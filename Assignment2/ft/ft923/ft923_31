BCE, the biggest Canadian telecommunications group, blamed the recession and
lower profits at its Northern Telecom subsidiary for a 20 per cent decline
in second-quarter profits. For the first half, earnings were down 9 per
cent, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
However, despite slow economic recovery, BCE expects improved performance in
all sectors in the second half.
The second-quarter performance was also affected by write-downs at its
Montreal Trustco financial services arm. Final earnings were CDollars 246m
(USDollars 205m), or 72 cents a common share, against CDollars 307m, or 92
cents, a year earlier. Operating revenues were CDollars 4.97bn against
CDollars 5.05bn.
First-half earnings were CDollars 544m, or CDollars 1.60 a common share,
against CDollars 600m, or CDollars 1.80 a share, a year earlier, on revenues
of CDollars 9.84bn against CDollars 9.78bn.

profits forecast

<TEXT>
JOHN Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, expects to exceed the
profit forecast for 1991-92 that was published in its pre-flotation
prospectus earlier this year.
Mr Dan Colson, acting chief executive, said earnings should be comfortably
ahead of the forecast in spite of the Australian economy's slow recovery
from recession. Fairfax, which is 15 per cent owned by Mr Conrad Black's
UK-based Daily Telegraph group, had forecast pre-tax profits of ADollars
123m (USDollars 91.7m) for the year to the end of June, followed by ADollars
165m in the current year.
Mr Colson said the directors were very optimistic. He confirmed that Fairfax
was considering building a printing plant in Sydney to enable the group to
compete more effectively with newspapers published by Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation.
The plant, which would cost about ADollars 200m, would have the capacity to
print colour news pictures.
Mr Colson said Fairfax would probably appoint a chief executive within the
next few weeks. Fairfax has been without a chief executive since December,
when it was acquired for ADollars 1.4bn by a consortium led by Mr Black. The
group was put into receivership in 1990 after an abortive buy-out of family
shareholders by Mr Warwick Fairfax.
The group publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian Financial
Review, and The Age in Melbourne. It is the principal competitor to News
Corporation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of East Asia, Hong Kong's third largest listed bank, yesterday reported
near 31 per cent growth in first-half net earnings.
Profit, struck after transfers to unpublished inner reserves, was HKDollars
162.7m (USDollars 21m) compared with HKDollars 124.4m a year earlier, and
broadly in line with market expectations. The bank published no other
figures relevant to its business.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 27.5 cents a share, up 31 per
cent from the equivalent of 21 cents paid at the same time last year.
Bank of East Asia, controlled by Hong Kong's Li family, is traditionally the
first of the colony's listed banks to report its earnings. Hongkong Bank and
Hang Seng Bank are expected to publish half-year results in a month's time.
All banks are expected to report greatly improved earnings. Hong Kong is one
of the most profitable centres for commercial and personal lending. Gross
interest margins are about 5 percentage points.
Deposit rates are being kept artificially low to support the Hong Kong
dollar's fixed rate against the US dollar, while lending rates are set
abnormally high to put pressure on the colony's overheated property market.
Mr David K. P. Li, the bank's chief executive, said economic growth in Hong
Kong had accelerated in the first half of this year. The sustained boom in
the property market had resulted in stable growth in mortgage lending
business, he said.
Steady growth in domestic demand was expected.
Mr Li added that it was expected that the current year's results would
compare satisfactorily with those of last year.
During the period, two of the bank's representative offices in China - in
Guangzhou (Canton) and Zhuhai - had received approval to convert to
branches.

FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Brazil puts brake on Whirlpool
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL, the world's largest manufacturer of large domestic appliances and
now the full owner of the former Philips appliance business in Europe, saw
an 8 per cent decline in second-quarter profits, to Dollars 53m after tax.
Sales rose to Dollars 1.84bn from Dollars 1.77bn.
The Michigan-based group blamed the drop on economic and political
difficulties in the Brazilian market. Operations there broke even in the
quarter, having contributed about 13 cents a share in the same quarter the
previous year.
Whirlpool said that, without this setback, it would have seen second-quarter
profits rise by some 11 per cent.
The second-quarter figures still mean Whirlpool is showing a net profit of
Dollars 88m for the first half, compared with Dollars 82m in the first half
of 1991. Sales for the six months were Dollars 3.55bn, compared with Dollars
3.38bn.
Mr David Whitwam, chairman, admitted that 'despite some recent positive
market indicators, the short-term outlook in Brazil remains uncertain'.
He also said the quarterly performance in the core US market lagged slight
behind 1991. 'Like others, we await, but are not yet seeing, sustained
recovery in the North American economy. Economic indicators continue to be
mixed.'
Mr Whitwam suggested that consumer confidence, having improved earlier in
the year, appeared to have stagnated, while competition between
manufacturers remained 'intense'.
Appliance industry shipments in North America rose by over 5 per cent in the
second quarter.
Whirlpool expects third and fourth-quarter shipments to show increases, and
predicts total 1992 industry shipments will be up by more than 6 per cent.
In Europe, Whirlpool International's performance was described as 'solid' in
revenue terms, despite the modest decline in industry shipments. Margins
improved 'significantly'.
'The anticipated recovery in the overall European market has been slow to
materialise,' commented Whirlpool.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON, the largest US oil and gas company, and Texaco, the third ranked
company, yesterday reported lower second-quarter net earnings as the squeeze
on petroleum product margins and weak demand continued to take a toll on the
US energy industry.
The Texas-based Exxon suffered a 15.1 per cent drop in second-quarter net
earnings, to Dollars 955m. This is the lowest quarterly net profit for the
company since 1989, the year of the Alaskan oil spill from the Exxon Valdez.
Exxon's earnings per share were down to 76 cents from 90 cents a year ago.
Revenues in the quarter were 1.8 per cent higher at Dollars 27.76bn.
For the first six months of 1992 Exxon's net income was down by 31.5 per
cent at Dollars 2.3bn, on revenues that were 4 per cent lower at Dollars
55.67bn.
Texaco of White Plains, New York, said its second-quarter net income was
Dollars 245m, a decline of 8.9 per cent. Earnings per share were 85 cents,
against 94 cents in 1991. Revenues were 4.4 per cent higher at Dollars
9.4bn.
For the first half of 1992 Texaco's net earnings were 34.9 per cent lower at
Dollars 445m, on revenues that were 6.3 per cent down at Dollars 18bn.
The second-quarter net profit at Occidental Petroleum, based in Los Angeles,
was nearly halved - from Dollars 147m, or 49 cents a share, a year ago to
Dollars 75m, or 25 cents. Revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, against Dollars
2.4bn.
For the first six months Occidental, undergoing a substantial restructuring
programme, suffered a 38.7 per cent drop in net income, to Dollars 173m.
Revenues were down to Dollars 4.3bn from Dollars 5.2bn in the first half of
1991.
The drop in earnings at these companies continues a trend started on
Wednesday, when Amoco, the fifth largest US oil and gas company, reported a
22.5 per cent fall in underlying second-quarter earnings and a Dollars 478m
net loss after taking an Dollars 805m charge for restructuring and severance
payment costs.
Mr Lawrence Rawl, Exxon's chairman, said the group's performance was
affected by lower petroleum product margins, which were in turn affected by
rising crude supply costs, weak economic conditions and soft demand in many
markets.
Earnings from exploration and production operation were Dollars 83m higher
at Dollars 725m while income from the refining and marketing side slumped by
Dollars 352m to Dollars 180m, due mainly to problems in the US market.
Included in the second-quarter results was a Dollars 75m charge for
restructuring Exxon's US oil and gas businesses.
The tendency of energy companies to direct exploration spending away from
the US was illustrated by Exxon's devoting 70 per cent of its worldwide
capital and exploration expenditures to projects outside the US.
Mr James Kinnear, chief executive of Texaco, stressed the company's effort
to maintain the strength of its financial position in the face of generally
weak industry conditions. He said Texaco expected to produce full-year cash
savings of around Dollars 700m from reductions in planned capital spending
and expenses.
On Wall Street, Exxon's share price closed Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars
63; Texaco's price improved Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 1/2 ; and Occidental's
price was Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 19 5/8 .

<TEXT>
POOR PRICES for newsprint and other papers pushed Abitibi-Price to a higher
second-quarter loss, despite an improvement in sales volumes.
The Canadian forestry company said losses, after unusual items, rose to
CDollars 41.3m (USDollars 34.4m), or 60 cents a share, from CDollars 5.7m,
or 8 cents, a year earlier. Revenues fell to CDollars 692m from CDollars
730m.
Mr Don Oberlander, chairman, predicted lower losses for the rest of the
year. He said demand for newsprint in North America 'has started to turn
around'. Newsprint producers expect to reduce their discounts to customers
by 5 per cent on August 1, and Abitibi said it would benefit from further
cost reductions.
Demand for uncoated groundwood paper is also expected to improve, although
prices will stay under pressure.
The company said it expected to post an after-tax loss of CDollars 19m in
the third quarter from the recent sale of its building products division.
However this would be offset by a gain from the disposal of its distribution
business.

FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF changes tack in bid
for LTV business
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF of France, which has spent weeks seeking ways around US
government hostility to its attempted takeover of LTV's missiles business,
has now agreed to take a minor, passive role in an LTV bid being mounted by
Loral, the fast-growing US defence business.
Loral said yesterday that it and Thomson had agreed in principle to offer
Dollars 260m for the LTV division, with Loral paying Dollars 230m for a 94
per cent stake and Thomson paying Dollars 30m, both for a 6 per cent equity
interest and convertible debentures which could ultimately take its stake up
to 9.9 per cent.
Thomson's original bid for the missiles division encountered strong
opposition in Washington, on the grounds that the French state-owned company
might leak US military secrets to foreign powers.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, a review body chaired by the
Treasury, was apparently poised to recommend that President Bush block the
deal when Thomson withdrew it and tried to find a more acceptable equity
structure.
The new bid keeps Thomson's stake under the 10 per cent level which normally
triggers a CFIUS investigation, but Loral was reported yesterday to have
volunteered to submit to such an inquiry anyway.
Thomson would have no directorships or 'other managerial prerogatives' in
the business, Loral said. Mr Bernard Schwartz, its chairman, said the
Department of Defense and the Treasury Department had given the new scheme a
'favourable reaction.'
Any final deal would still be subject to approval by the US bankruptcy court
which has control of LTV's assets. The company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in 1986. The court gave its approval to the original
Thomson bid last April.
Under that deal, Thomson agreed to pay Dollars 300m for the missiles
division, while the Carlyle Group, a Washington-based investment group, and
defence contractor Northrop would pay Dollars 150m for LTV's aircraft
business.
The new package would still be worth Dollars 450m, but one report last night
said the Carlyle offer for the aircraft side would be raised from Dollars
150m to Dollars 190m, offsetting the Dollars 40m drop in the Thomson offer.
Loral, which has a substantial missiles business, has become a Wall Street
favourite thanks to a strategy of aggressive expansion through acquisitions
at bargain prices.
Mr Schwartz said the acquisition of the LTV division would contribute
'positively' to Loral's earnings this year.

losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOW CHEMICAL, the second biggest US chemicals company, revealed a 20 per
cent drop in second-quarter net income and said it had suffered from the
weakness of the US economy and heavy losses in Europe.
Although Dow's operating earnings were 9 per cent up at Dollars 568m, the
quarter's net profit was Dollars 186m, compared with Dollars 233m a year
ago. Second-quarter sales were 1 per cent higher at Dollars 4.9bn.
Earnings per share were 68 cents, down by 21 per cent from 86 cents in the
second quarter of 1991. Dow noted that earnings per share were reduced by 5
cents because Dow Corning, in which it has a 50 per cent stake, took a
Dollars 45m pre-tax second-quarter charge associated with the costs of its
discontinued silicone gel breast implant products.
Mr Enrique Falla, Dow's executive vice president, called the second-quarter
results 'disappointing' and said Dow does not expect to exceed the
performance level of 1991 until some time during the second half of this
year. He noted that earning momentum in some of Dow's businesses normally
lags the economic recovery.
Mr Falla added that margins were also squeezed because of lower prices and
the European slowdown. Sales for Dow Europe in the quarter were Dollars
1.4bn, down 4 per cent.
Operating income from Europe slumped by 79 per cent to Dollars 30m and,
excluding earnings from Dow Europe's consumer specialty products business,
the area experienced 'an unprecedented loss for the quarter'.
In addition, Dow suffered temporary closures of polyethylene plants in
Canada and Spain and of a styrene facility in the Netherlands.
Dow's chemical and performance products sale were unchanged at Dollars
1.1bn, while operating income recovered by 53 per cent to Dollars 92m.
Sales for plastics were unchanged at Dollars 1.7bn while operating income
declined by 18 per cent to Dollars 113m. The energy and hydrocarbons
division suffered an operating loss of Dollars 47m on Dollars 382m of sales,
a fall of 15 per cent year-on-year.
Dow's consumer specialties division achieved 18 per cent higher operating
income of Dollars 381m on 13 per cent improved sales of Dollars 1.7bn.
Monsanto, the Missouri-based chemicals company, meanwhile achieved a Dollars
113m or 92 cents a share second-quarter net profit, compared with a net loss
of Dollars 52m (42 cents) a year ago.
Last year's earnings were affected by a Dollars 325m after-tax charge for a
corporate restructuring programme.
Sales in the quarter were Dollars 2.28bn, down from Dollars 2.47bn a year
ago, although Monsanto said the 1992 quarter did not include some Dollars
111m of revenues from businesses involved in the restructuring.
Operating income from the agricultural division was Dollars 147m, down
sharply from Dollars 243m a year ago. The chemicals division managed a
Dollars 64m operating profit, against a Dollars 370m loss a year ago.
The NutraSweet artificial sugar business suffered a fall in operating
earnings, from Dollars 57m to Dollars 49m. The Searle drug business lost
Dollars 39m, compared with a Dollars 27m profit a year ago.
On Wall Street, Dow's share price was marked  3/8 higher to Dollars 53 1/4
while Monsanto's price slumped by Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 .

RJR NABISCO, the US tobacco and food group taken private through a Dollars
25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, yesterday posted second-quarter profits of
Dollars 87m after-tax, up from Dollars 79m a year earlier.
The gain came from the reduction in interest expenses, partly offset by an
extraordinary loss of the early extinguishing of debt.
Mr Lou Gerstner, RJR's chairman, noted that since the start of 1992, some
Dollars 2bn of high-cost debt, carrying an average coupon of 14 per cent,
had been refinanced at more favourable rates.
Operating profits slipped to Dollars 768m from Dollars 773m, although total
sales were up from Dollars 3.78bn to Dollars 3.98bn.
RJR blamed the tough competitive environment in the consumer goods sector.
It had made significant investment in the domestic tobacco business which
had restrained operating income.
On the tobacco front, RJR saw operating profits of Dollars 580m from
domestic operations, down from Dollars 612m, while international contributed
Dollars 134m. against Dollars 116m. In the food division, operating profits
rose from Dollars 228m to Dollars 240m.
RJR Nabisco made after-tax profits of Dollars 72m in the first six months,
after a Dollars 281m charge for extinguishing debts early. In the same
period a year ago, the after-tax profit was Dollars 84m.

<TEXT>
USAIR Group, the US airline in which British Airways plans to invest Dollars
750m in return for a potential 44 per cent equity stake, yesterday reported
increased second-quarter losses of Dollars 84.9m after tax.
This compares with an after-tax deficit of Dollars 56.8m in the same period
of 1991, and takes USAir's net loss for the first half of 1992 to Dollars
147.9m.
The combined BA-USAir operation will link the world's biggest international
air network with the third-biggest US domestic network. It will carry more
passengers than any other airline.
Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's president, blamed recent domestic fare wars for
the poor results. 'Industry-wide fare reductions that began early in the
second quarter sharply eroded the positive momentum that we had developed in
the first quarter of the year,' he said.
His remarks echo those made last week by American Airlines which, although
it returned an operating profit, was also hit by the widespread
price-cutting.
In the wake of domestic fare wars during the early summer, most analysts
have been braced for losses from the nation's biggest carriers. USAir ranks
as the sixth largest and has little international business to offset
cut-throat competition at home.
The quarterly loss was scored on slightly higher revenues, at Dollars 1.7bn
against Dollars 1.66bn, and came after net interest charges of Dollars 60.1m
compared with Dollars 60.4m.
Nevertheless, USAir reported higher operating losses for the second quarter,
at Dollars 43.7m compared with Dollars 27.9m in the same period of 1991. The
operating loss at the airline subsidiary alone was Dollars 53.5m, against a
Dollars 45.3m loss.
Revenues rose 2.2 per cent to Dollars 1.58bn, and the passenger load factor
rose from 58.4 per cent to 59.9 per cent. The yield on scheduled services
fell from 16.98 cents to 16.21 cents.

1.5bn charge
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment, the US computer manufacturer, has revealed a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 1.85bn, including restructuring charges of
Dollars 1.5bn to cover the cost of job cuts and plant closures.
The heavy losses reflect the severity of Digital's problems as it struggles
to come to terms with technology shifts and an industry slowdown. The
results come in the wake of last week's announcement that Mr Kenneth Olsen,
the company's founder and president, will retire on October 1 amid criticism
that he has not moved fast enough to improve Digital's performance.
Mr Olsen said yesterday that Digital was 'taking actions designed to
increase revenues, increase market share, reduce costs and improve our
efficiency'.
For the fourth quarter, Digital recorded an operating loss of Dollars 188m.
Net losses equalled Dollars 14.76 a share, including the restructuring
charge. In the same period last year, when Digital also took charges for
consolidation, the company recorded losses of Dollars 871.3m, or Dollars
7.08 a share. Revenues for the quarter were virtually flat.
Losses for the full fiscal year came to Dollars 2.8bn, against a loss of
Dollars 617m last year, when the company recorded its first- ever annual
loss.
In addition to restructuring charges, 1992 losses include a charge of
Dollars 485m, applied retroactively to the first quarter, for accounting
changes relating to pensioners' benefits.
On a per share basis, the net loss for the year was Dollars 22.39, compared
with a loss of Dollars 5.08 last year.
Revenues for the year were essentially flat at Dollars 13.93bn, against
Dollars 13.91bn last year.

Elbief, the maker of photograph and handbag frames, clocks and mirrors, fell
deeper into the red in the year to April 30 and reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 451,000, against Pounds 29,000.
The difficult trading conditions of the first half had worsened, directors
said, and they had introduced 'more drastic cost cutting measures'.
Turnover was static at Pounds 4.44m. Losses per share amounted to 3p
(0.19p). There is no dividend (0.5p).

Telecom Eireann, the state-owned Irish telecommunications monopoly, reported
a drop of IPounds 3m to IPounds 91m (Pounds 85.5m), in pre-tax profits for
the year to April 2 1992.
Turnover rose IPounds 6m to IPounds 788m despite revenues being constrained
by the impact of price reductions introduced last January and reduced
overseas contract work. The price reductions will cost IPounds 50m in
revenues in a full year.
Operating profits fell IPounds 16m to IPounds 189m but financing costs also
dropped - by IPounds 13m. Net debt fell IPounds 55m to IPounds 998m, the
first time since 1986 that it has been below IPounds 1bn. In 1985, Telecom
was incurring losses of IPounds 65m.

A net cash balance of Pounds 2.6m at March 31 was expected to cover working
capital requirements in the current year.

<TEXT>
Continuing paralysis in the property market - with the residential side
'particularly vulnerable', according to Mr George Inge, chairman of Savills
 -accounted for further losses at the surveyor and estate agent in the year
to April 30.
Pre-tax losses rose to Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 1.69m) after exceptional charges
of Pounds 1.62m relating mainly to provisions against the sub-letting of
surplus office space.
Staffing levels were cut by 50 to 560 in the year and by 105 in the previous
year.
Pre-exceptionals, losses were reduced to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.69m).
Operating losses on the commercial side were Pounds 379,000 (profits Pounds
81,000) on turnover of Pounds 9.68m (Pounds 12.3m). For agricultural and
residential the losses were Pounds 914,000 (Pounds 1.76m) on turnover of

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Taunton closes 14p above offer price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAUNTON CIDER, the west country drinks group, yesterday joined a select band
of recently-floated companies to begin trading at a premium to the offer
price despite the general despondency hanging over the market.
The shares opened at 145p and closed at 154p, a 14p premium to the offer
price.
Apart from Kenwood Appliances, the kitchen tool manufacturer which opened at
a premium but has since fallen back to 278p, or a 7p discount, Taunton is
the only recent publicly-offered flotation to rise from its offer price.
Despite the relative failure of these issues, bankers and analysts have been
at pains to stress that most of the flotations have hit their targets of
reducing debt and gaining a public quotation.
than They also stress that institutions have been prepared to pay prices
that represent quite high earnings multiples, in the knowledge that they
could be left with shares at the underwriting stage because of weak retail
demand.
Anglian Group, which perhaps suffered most from the weak market and
perceptions that it was more closely linked to the building sector than may
in fact be the case, sold at a 12.2 earnings multiple. Its shares are now
trading at a 7p discount at 203p.
Country Casuals was entirely placed at 130p, representing a 15.9 pro-forma
earnings multiple. Its shares opened at 145p but had drifted back to 135p by
yesterday.
According to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, some Pounds 1.68bn has
so far been raised in 1992 - double the same period last year excluding the
electricity companies.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: LMS assets per share fall 9% to 99p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Merchant Securities, the property and investment group, saw its net
assets per share fall 9 per cent from 109p to 99p over the 12 months to
March 31.
Shareholders' funds declined to Pounds 312m (Pounds 358m) but this fall was
offset partly by the sale in January of 22.5m shares in First Leisure
Corporation, which accrued Pounds 50.7m in profits and represented Pounds
24.7m on the balance sheet.
Also the number of shares in issue fell by 11.5m with the Pounds 131m
acquisition of Westpool Investment Trust, the largest asset of which had
been its 50.9 per cent stake in LMS. Westpool's results were not material,
but the deal simplified the group structure.
Lord Rayne, LMS chairman and from October the successor to Lord Delfont as
chairman of First Leisure, said LMS had retained a 15.2 per cent stake in
the leisure group as 'a measure of confidence' in its management.
First Leisure provided the bulk of the Pounds 7.77m (Pounds 8.68m) share in
the profits of associated undertakings.
Net rental income grew to Pounds 28.9m (Pounds 23.2m), giving operating
profits of Pounds 25m (Pounds 22.1m). Interest payable increased to Pounds
14.8m (Pounds 11.6m) - none has been capitalised - and pre-tax profits fell
to Pounds 24m (Pounds 28.9m).
Mr Robert Spier, finance director, said the group's liquidity, its low
gearing of about 24 per cent, and the fact that virtually all of its Pounds
178m borrowings are at fixed rates - and some 71 per cent beyond the end of
the decade - all displayed the group's soundness.
The final dividend is lifted to a proposed 3p (2.8p) to make 3.8p (3.6p) for
the year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hill &amp; Smith Holdings, the West Midlands-based steel fabricator and
stockholder, blamed the recession as interim profits tumbled from Pounds
2.42m to Pounds 1.24m before tax.
The outcome for the six months to March 31 was struck after an exceptional
charge of Pounds 212,000 relating to losses incurred by Tipton Steel Stock
Holders (Stoke) which was sold after the period-end.
Profits for the first half of the previous year amounted to Pounds 2.42m.
Mr John Silk, chairman, said the winter months were 'particularly severe' in
the engineering, construction and building sectors. The group had strived to
increase market share without sacrificing margins, he added.
A cost cutting programme led to reduced stock levels and meant the loss of a
further 7 per cent of the workforce over the period.
Turnover fell to Pounds 31.8m (Pounds 38.7m). The interim dividend is 2.1p,
compared with an adjusted 1.91p. Earnings were 2.98p (5.74p).

FT  24 JUL 92 / Castle in the air bumps down to earth: Euro Disneyland's
opening has been a rocky ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by its name, Operation Mickey sounded like a promotion Euro
Disneyland might have mounted to bolster its disappointing attendance
figures. But instead, it was organised by some 500 French farmers who four
weeks ago turned up at the gates of the new theme park outside Paris.
The farmers were protesting against the building of Euro Disney on
agricultural land and against US pressure for reforms to European
agricultural policy. More than 2,000 school children were kept out of the
park until the farmers drove their tractors away after lunch.
Attracting enough French visitors was always going to be one problem facing
Euro Disney. Variable weather - and thus widely fluctuating admissions - was
another.
Although the company is learning how to adapt its product to meet European
tastes and to manage its operations more flexibly, the changes are coming
too slowly to avoid a loss in this fiscal year ending September. It might
not avoid further red ink next year.
Smith New Court, the London broker, forecasts a loss of at least FFr200m
(Pounds 20.4m) for this year, possibly followed by a worse performance next
year, which will include the first winter trading period.
Euro Disney originally hoped for 11m visitors in its first year of
operation. The park has attracted 3.6m people since it opened in April.
Given that spring and summer are expected to have higher than average
attendance levels, this means that, unless there is a sudden improvement,
Euro Disney is unlikely to meet its target.
The crux of the problem is the low number of French visitors who have
accounted for less than 30 per cent of the total, against a forecast of 50
per cent.
Euro Disney does have the consolation that visits from the UK and Germany
are above expectations and foreign visitors tend to spend more as they are
more likely to stay in the resort hotels. However, the six Euro Disney
hotels are performing 'slightly below expectations' with average occupancy
of 70 per cent so far.
There has been an improvement in overall attendance since the start of the
European school holidays. This week Euro Disney has been attracting capacity
crowds with 95 per cent occupancy at the hotels. However, the first year's
attendance is still likely to be 20 per cent lower than expected at less
than 9m people, according to Paribas in London.
This could pose a serious financial problem in that Euro Disney is a highly
geared business with substantial fixed costs, such as interest payments and
amortised construction costs, representing more than 75 per cent of total
costs. That makes it very vulnerable to any reduction in revenue.
The obvious solution is to cut variable costs, chiefly by bringing
employment in line with attendance.
The Disney parks in the US are extremely efficient at this. They have
developed sophisticated forecasting techniques enabling them to alter
staffing levels and food supplies on a daily basis.
Euro Disney plans to make similar adjustments. Mr John Forsgren, finance
director, said staffing levels will vary from 17,000 in the peak summer
season to around 12,500 in the slack winter months. But at present it is
difficult for Euro Disney to forecast accurately.
The California and Florida parks, which opened in 1955 and 1971
respectively, have the benefit of years of data. Euro Disneyland will
eventually build up similar records. Indeed it should be more efficient at
budgeting from next April, when it has its first year of information.
But Euro Disney's forecasting is unlikely ever to be as accurate as its US
counterparts because of its location. First, the climate in Paris is less
predictable than in sunny California and Florida.
Second, the US parks have the advantage of being large tourist attractions
in their areas. This means that Walt Disney World in Florida can use data on
the number of cars crossing the state border to calculate what proportion is
likely to visit the park. By contrast, Euro Disneyland is only one of dozens
of attractions in Paris.
The immediate challenge for Euro Disney is to increase attendance. In some
respects it is not surprising that its performance in the economically
sluggish early 1990s has not met the targets set in the bullish late 1980s.
But Euro Disney also needs to identify which areas should be adapted to suit
European taste.
Catering arrangements have already been changed to increase the availability
of fast food. Euro Disney is in talks with tour operators to change next
year's hotel rates. It is also negotiating winter hotel discounts and
organising an autumn promotional programme for France.
Euro Disney does at least have the consolation that it has performed better
than Tokyo Disneyland, the only other Disney park outside the US. Tokyo
attracted just 2.5m visitors in its first 102 days - against 3.6m for Euro
Disney - and 10.5m visitors in its first year.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Size of loss depends on level of trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, dogged by bad publicity since opening its FFr2.4bn (Pounds
240m) theme park outside Paris on April 12, yesterday confirmed it was on
course to make a loss in the current financial year after attracting 3.6m
visitors in the park's first 102 days.
Mr John Forsgren, finance director, said the group, which had hoped to break
even this year, would be in the red for the 12 months to September 30, but
that 'the magnitude of the loss would depend on the level of trading in the
peak summer season'.
Euro Disney's shares, which have been hit by recent adverse publicity about
wide fluctuations in attendance and over-crowding on busy days, initially
fell on the announcement but closed up FFr0.15 at FFr97.40.
Euro Disney received operating revenue of FFr1.5bn in the three months to
June 30, with FFr1.02bn coming from the theme park and FFr485m from the
resort, which includes the six Euro Disney hotels.
The group also made FFr973m from asset sales - compared with FFr1.33bn in
the previous quarter - making a total income of FFr2.47bn.
The hotels have sold 370,000 room nights with an average occupancy rate of
70 per cent which is 'slightly below expect-ations', according to Mr
Forsgren.
The hotels are currently 'almost full', he said, with average occupancy of
95 per cent as the park enters its peak trading period.
Euro Disney denied reports that it had cut hotel rates for the summer
season. However, it reduced rates at two hotels - the Santa Fe and the
Sequoia Lodge - in June and is talking to tour operators about price
reductions for the autumn and a new tariff for next year.
Since the start of the European school holidays, attendance at Euro Disney
has risen sharply and the past week has seen capacity crowds of more than
50,000 people a day, according to Mr Forsgren.
He said attendance from the UK and Germany was well above expectations, but
the number of French visitors was still below target.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Isosceles confirms details of its refinancing deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, owner of the struggling Gateway supermarket chain, yesterday
confirmed details of a refinancing deal that will allow it to step up its
development programme with a view to floating the business in 1995.
As part of the agreement the company is proposing to reorganise its capital
structure, substantially diluting its ordinary equity.
Isosceles implicitly accepted the failure of the Gateway brand as it said it
intended to convert most of its 650 stores into new fascias, including its
Food Giant discount superstores and the Somerfield fresh food chain.
In the next three years, Isosceles intends to open 150 Somerfield stores, by
converting Gateway stores and opening new sites. It is also experimenting
with other fascias such as a So-Lo discount chain, David Greig and the
Gateway Village convenience store chain. The company still intends to sell
Herman's, its US sporting goods subsidiary, and Wellworths, its grocery
chain based in Northern Ireland. It seems more likely that Wellworths will
be sold to a trade buyer rather than floated on the stock market.
The company's capital expenditure budget will remain at about Pounds 100m in
the current year although it has also won the right to spend a further
Pounds 30m of any money it raises from disposals.
Isosceles's preference shares will be converted into ordinary shares as part
of a 'tidying-up exercise' but holders of the mezzanine debt will also be
issued with warrants exercisable at 1p per share to subscribe for 20 per
cent of the fully diluted ordinary share capital.
Interest payments on Pounds 300m of mezzanine debt will continue to be
rolled up until February, 1993 under more flexible arrangements.
The deal has been agreed by the 50 banks which hold the company's Pounds
1.1bn of senior debt and its mezzanine debt holders. The main holders of the
ordinary equity have also accepted the amendments, although they still have
to be approved by shareholders in a formal meeting. Isosceles's results for
the year to April 25 will be released shortly after that meeting.
Mr Bob Nellist, finance director, said: 'We have gone over a bump in the
road and are confident that the legal arrangements will now be put in
place.'

BOOTS' share price rose 4 per cent yesterday following a cheerful trading
statement from Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, at the annual meeting.
Sir Christopher said sales of the diversified retailing group were up 11 per
cent since the beginning of its financial year on April 1 - in spite of the
weak market background.
'We are bucking the trend,' he said.
The company's statement contrasted sharply with the weak retail sales for
June released by the Central Statistical Office earlier this week, which
showed a 0.2 per cent drop on the preceding month.
Shares in Boots closed up 19p at 447p.
Boots the Chemist, which forms the group's core, reported sales up 13 per
cent over last year. It said it had benefited from strong sales of hay-fever
medicines and sun lotions because of the warm weather in May.
However, all of Boots' other retail chains, which have performed more weakly
during the recession, also recorded good sales increases.
Halfords, the car parts business which has struggled since being bought as
part of the Ward White acquisition three years ago, recorded an 8 per cent
increase in sales in spite of the closure of several small stores.
Meanwhile, sales at Childrens World and Boots Opticians rose by 14 per cent
and 6 per cent respectively.
Fierce discounting affected the company's DIY businesses, but the paint and
wallpaper business AG Stanley, which runs the Fads high street chain, lifted
sales by 3.5 per cent and Do-It-All, the joint venture with WH Smith,
achieved a 10 per cent advance.
The pharmaceuticals division managed to increase sales by 11 per cent.
Its Manoplax drug, developed for the treatment of congestive heart failure,
is in the late stages of registration in several markets.
Some shareholders criticised the 54 per cent increase in the collective pay
of the directors, but others argued that it was merited given the solid
financial performance of the group.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Italy alters privatisation plans: Turnround in policy
threatens credibility of the new Amato government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government bowed to pressure from foreign bankers, managers of
state groups and politicians yesterday by abandoning a central element of
its radical privatisation plan.
The treasury said it had scrapped its aim, announced just two weeks ago, of
grouping its main industrial and financial sector holdings under two new
umbrella companies in preparation for privatisation.
The plan had aroused fears among foreign bankers over the considerable
foreign debts of Italy's existing state holding companies.
These groups would have been broken up and their assets placed under two new
super-holding companies, raising questions about the fate of the many
foreign loans made to the companies and their subsidiaries.
The Italian treasury had sent shockwaves through the international banking
community in the past week by announcing that the debts of another state
holding company, Efim, would be frozen for up to two years while the group
was broken up.
The plan to reshuffle the state's holdings into just two groups had centred
on IRI, the main state holding group; ENI, the national oil concern; ENEL,
the electricity authority; and INI, the insurance institute. Between them,
these groups owe more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) to foreign banks.
Professor Guiseppe Guarino, the industry minister who had proposed the
scheme, insisted last night that the radical shake-up of public sector
ownership would now proceed more effectively. But the turnround threatens
the credibility of the new Amato government.
'This is a political setback for the government but probably a step forward
for a more efficient means of reorganising the state sector,' a foreign
banker said.
The four groups, which were recently turned into joint stock companies in
preparation for privatisation, will now remain with the treasury as their
shareholder.
The government gave no formal explanation for abandoning the idea of the two
super-holdings.
Foreign bankers are understood to have expressed concern at the lack of
detail about the structure. They were alarmed at the uncertain legal status
of the foreign debt of the existing groups, particularly IRI, ENI and ENEL.
Bankers were also dissatisfied by the idea that they would be issued with
bonds by the Italian government to back the debts of the two super-holdings,
since it was unclear what interest rate or other terms would apply to the
bonds.
Their fears were heightened by the handling of the freeze on Efim's L8,500bn
(Pounds 3.8bn) debts, of which some L2,300bn is owed to foreign banks.
Only after five days of uncertainty did the treasury clarify that interest
would be paid on Efim's obligations, though not for as much as two years.
The managers of IRI, ENI and ENEL also objected to the plan, since it would
have created a new layer of management which would have effectively put them
out of a job.
Politicians had voiced opposition to the plan because it threatened the
balance of political power of their appointees on the boards.
Under the super-holdings, the government planned to reorganise the companies
in preparation for the privatisation of all or part of their operating
companies. These span virtually every area of industrial and economic
activity.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Matrix goes into receivership as machine tool sector
declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATRIX CHURCHILL, the Midlands-based machine tool builder which has been at
the centre of allegations about illegal exports to Iraq, became the latest
victim of the recession yesterday when it announced that it had gone into
receivership.
The news is the latest twist in the chequered history of Matrix Churchill,
which was bought from Iraqi ownership early last year and put through a
heavy restructuring by its new owners, Midlands-based Automation
Investments.
On Wednesday, Mr Stephen Hancock and Mr Philip Baldwin of Price Waterhouse
were appointed receivers of the company, which has 190 employees making
lathes and grinding machines at Birmingham and Coventry.
The receivership comes a few days after the disclosure that Beaver
Engineering Group, the Norwich-based machine tool maker, had been placed in
administrative receivership. It further underlines the woes of the British
machine tool industry, whose sales fell last year to their lowest in real
terms since 1984.
Yesterday, the Machine Tool Technologies Association warned that 'the
long-term prospects for machine tools, a key industry critical to the
strength of Britain's economy, is being seriously compromised by the
continuing steep decline of the manufacturing base'.
Matrix has suffered a loss of Pounds 6.9m, on turnover of Pounds 23m in the
18 months ended September 30, and a further loss of Pounds 1.1m on turnover
of Pounds 6.9m in the seven months ended April. It has been hit by the
curtailment of Iraqi contracts, reduced sales to eastern Europe, and the
worldwide recession in machine tools.
Mr Keith Bailey, AI chairman, said yesterday: 'We thought we could have done
something with Matrix if there had been an improvement in the market in
1991.'
Three former Matrix executives face trial in October accused of illegal
exports to Iraq. Mr Bailey, who is also chairman of BSA Tools, another AI
company, faces similar charges in November.

FT  24 JUL 92 / MoD's record on contracting criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE efforts to cut costs by privatising services have been
dogged by errors, delays and mismanagement, according to a government report
published today.
Failure to keep sufficient records meant the amount saved in 13 years of
contracting out was impossible to check, says the National Audit Office, the
government's spending watchdog,
The MoD's problems cast doubt on prospects for plans to extend contracting
out to other departments, the next stage in reforming government machinery.
All government departments have submitted plans to the Cabinet Office to
contract out parts of their work. Sir Peter Levene, the government's
efficiency adviser, is considering the schemes, some of which should be
implemented from this autumn.
MoD failings uncovered by the Audit Office include reporting errors that led
to a 40 per cent overestimate in the amount of cash saved; failing to train
officers how to monitor contractors; and a wrongly assessed catering bid
which led to the work being kept in-house at a cost of Pounds 1m over three
years.
As a result, the audit office recommends that the MoD hives off part of the
contracting-out process itself.
Not all the MoD's efforts were in vain. By 1994, the departmentwill have put
out to competition contracts worth at total Pounds 243m.
However, it says it was 'unable to quantify' MoD claims that contracting out
had cut costs by Pounds 64m a year, an average 24 per cent saving on each
contract. The MoD kept a record only of how much was saved in the first year
of contracting out, even though 'many hundreds of contracts have since been
relet'.
The audit office also notes 'clerical errors' in reporting figures to the
MoD's in-house market testing consultancy .
The MoD said yesterday: 'Market testing in some areas has not progressed as
fast as expected.' It said it had been distracted from the process by more
pressing concerns such as the Gulf war.
It said it had taken steps to improve its guidance and training on
contractor appraisal.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Central Park bandstand project aims to recapture
historic design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From BETSY GOTBAUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Let me clarify some of the issues raised in 'New York's oasis of the
park' (July 13), an account of New York City Parks &amp; Recreation's proposed
removal of the Naumburg Bandshell from Central Park.
When Central Park was built, Frederick Law Olmsted included an octagonal
cast-iron bandstand designed by Jacob Wrey Mould on a grassy area to the
west of the mall. This bandstand remained until 1923 when it was demolished
owing to its dilapidated condition, and replaced by the current bandshell on
the east side of the mall. Now my agency feels that this facility, too, has
seen its day, and should be removed.
Unlike the original bandstand, which was open on all sides, the massive
stone bandshell broke up the sweeping vista along the mall that Olmsted had
intended. From the Wisteria Pergola atop the hill behind the bandshell, it
was no longer possible to enjoy (as Olmsted had intended) a panoramic view
of the mall and lake.
For the next 50 years, popular classical concerts were held at the bandshell
 -until 1980, when the Naumburg family concert series abandoned the
bandshell for Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center because the site had become
too loud and active for their concerts. As no one wanted to use it, the
bandshell fell into decay.
The mall is now in the final stages of an 18-month, Dollars 4m restoration.
The project's purpose is to recapture the historic design of Central Park's
most architecturally formal space, and to offer New Yorkers an unparalleled
green setting featuring lawns and permanent seating under a cathedral canopy
of elm trees. The bandshell has become an anachronism that attracts illegal
activity and vandalism.
The removal of the bandshell will restore the area to Olmsted's original
plan, and make the area safer. My agency cannot afford to commit its limited
resources to restoring and maintaining structures that no longer serve a
useful public function.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Tough medicine helps to cure US banks' ills: Both bankers
and their regulators have acted promptly to seek remedies for bad debt and
cost problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After two years of recession, heavy loan losses caused by the commercial
property slump and a series of tough restructuring programmes to cut costs,
there is at last evidence of solid recovery in the US banking industry.
This, at least, has been the message over the past fortnight as many banks
have put on a parade of improved second-quarter earnings, lower loan
write-offs and stronger capital ratios.
Citicorp, the nation's largest bank with assets of Dollars 219bn (Pounds
114.6bn), has led the way. Although its North American commercial property
division is still in the red, Citicorp's net earnings for the second quarter
jumped from Dollars 11m to Dollars 171m. For the first six months of 1992
earnings were more than trebled, at Dollars 354m.
Across the US, institutions large and small showed signs of an upturn in the
second quarter. These include Chase Manhattan (15 per cent higher net
income); First Chicago (up 19 per cent); Bank of New York (up 45 per cent);
JP Morgan (up 67 per cent); Norwest of Minneapolis (up 21 per cent); First
Fidelity of New Jersey (up 47 per cent); Barnett Bank of Florida (85 per
cent higher); and Fleet Financial of New England (net profits more than
doubled, from Dollars 28m to Dollars 71m).
Mr James McDermott, president of New York-based bank analysts Keefe
Bruyette, notes: 'Two years ago it looked as if the banking industry was
going out of business. Today, it looks as if the banks will last forever.'
In some ways, the recovery has been faster than Wall Street and the industry
itself might have expected. This is partly because bank profits have been
bolstered by fatter interest margins that owe much to the series of rate
cuts by the Federal Reserve Board since last December. With the Fed funds
level - the wholesale money rate at which banks borrow from each other - at
around 3.25 per cent, the opportunity for better margins have been abundant,
since the prime lending rate for companies stands at 6 per cent.
Regulators have also moved fairly quickly to seek remedies for bad debt and
cost problems. The clouds over the US property market began to appear in
early 1990, when prices began to soften, but by the autumn of that year
bankers had begun to realise that their loan portfolios had deteriorated
even more rapidly than they had expected. In 1990-91, the US banking
industry faced its most serious crisis since the less developed country
(LDC) loan debacle of the early 1980s, when US bank loans to Mexico, Brazil
and other countries led to large write-offs.
Most senior bankers got the message quickly and acted. Dividend payments at
many banks were slashed or halted; workforce reductions at dozens of medium
and large US banks averaged 10 per cent; and non-strategic assets -
including, for example, service companies and European property holdings -
were disposed of.
More important, most banks faced their problems head-on, classifying large
chunks of commercial property loans as non-performing, providing against
loan losses and simply writing them off.
It came as a shock to Wall Street when, in the autumn of 1990, Chase
Manhattan halved its dividend, made heavy provisions and unveiled a package
of draconian measures that included reducing its workforce by 12 per cent
and selling a number of European assets. But Chase, like others who took the
medicine, is now on the mend.
Another important step towards rationalisation, taken as the banking crisis
coincided with the sputtering performance of the US economy last year, was a
series of mergers.
The first of the three most prominent mergers, all of which are already
yielding benefits in terms of cost savings, was the decision in late 1991 to
combine NCNB of North Carolina and C&amp;S/Sovran of Georgia into NationsBank.
It is now the fourth-biggest US bank, with Dollars 111bn of assets and more
than 1,800 branches in 10 south-eastern states. NationsBank says that by
1994 it will have achieved annual cost savings of Dollars 450m, through
rationalisation of business and eliminating duplication of administrative
services.
The second big merger came a year ago, when Manufacturers Hanover Trust and
Chemical Bank joined forces to become the third-biggest US bank, with assets
of Dollars 142.4bn and a powerful branch base in the New York area.
This week, Chemical managed a 30 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit,
and said it had reduced total staff by more than 10 per cent and was well on
the way to achieving Dollars 750m of annual cost savings.
Bank of America last August engineered the biggest bank merger in US history
when, in what has been seen as a take-over, it merged with Security Pacific,
the Los Angeles-based bank troubled by heavy loan losses. It is even more
ambitious - it plans to achieve estimated annual savings of Dollars 1.2bn by
1995.
Although Bank of America's first results since the merger with SecPac was
completed in April showed second-quarter net profit down 11.8 per cent, Wall
Street is impressed by the speed with which SecPac is being integrated into
its larger partner's operations.
Mergers have not been the only driving force behind the recovery, however.
Other crucial elements have been the drive to strengthen capital and to
generate new revenues, especially from fee income.
For example, Citicorp, which has been among the weakest of US banks in terms
of capital, added Dollars 1.5bn of new capital during the first half of this
year and brought its main Tier One capital-to-assets ratio  - the main
capital adequacy measure used by US banking regulators - to 4.25 per cent,
up from 3.74 per cent at the end of last year.
Observers say that one example of the way in which banks have attempted to
raise fee income is an increase in charges to companies for back-up lines of
credit, from an average of a fifth of one per cent to a third of one per
cent.
There are still problems in the industry, however, particularly as the
commercial property market seems unlikely to improve in the short term. But
the view of Wall Street is summarised by Mr Tom Hanley, a leading banking
analyst at First Boston who says that 'the worst is now behind us'.
Most bankers say their industry will obviously only stand a chance of
continuing its recovery when the US economic recovery solidifies and the
corporate and consumer debt burdens of the last decade are eased. 'There is
no way to cure an over-leveraged system quickly,' remarks Mr McDermott of
Keefe Bruyette, who none the less sees bank industry earnings improving into
1993.
In the meantime, bankers claim they have learned from the property loan
fiasco of 1990-92 and will no longer leap into a single lending sector with
such abandon. The same, of course, was said by bankers after the US property
slump of the mid-1970s, and the LDC debt crisis of the early 1980s and the
Texas oil-related bust of the late 1980s. This time, however, the bankers
swear they mean what they say.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Mr Greenspan explains it all
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, got a sulky hearing before
the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday; the senators want to make political
capital out of a sluggish US economy, and although they would like to pin
the main blame on the administration, the Fed can expect no applause. It
deserves some, all the same. Mr Greenspan's painstaking explanations of the
problems of excessive debt are not new, but they do help to explain the
obstinacy of the recession. The British government, for one, might be in
much less trouble now if it had heard a similar early warning; but by the
time the nature of the problem was understood here, the more obvious
solutions had been complicated by entry to the ERM.
In the US, the Fed has been able to respond to the debt crisis with 23
easing actions, which helped to restore banks' profitability as well as
offering large relief to mortgage debtors. 'The discount rate has been cut
to 3 per cent - a 29-year low,' as Mr Greenspan pointed out. Despite these
actions - cautiously progressive, but large in their total impact - the
recovery remains shaky, and employment is especially weak. This has led some
analysts close to despair; the Fed response is more measured, a matter of
disappointment without much surprise, and quite optimistic about the
outlook. The Fed still forecasts US economic growth next year at up to 2 1/2
per cent, well ahead of gloomy Wall Street revisionism.
The chairman put the core problem in one familiar phrase: 'Banks still have
significant reluctance to lend.' This prudential squeeze, which the Fed
identified as a major problem right from the start of the recession, bears
almost entirely on the small company sector, since all but the shakiest
large corporations can profitably bypass the banks and fund themselves in
the markets.
For some years now, US employment growth has depended entirely on small
companies; indeed, large corporations, in the US as in the UK, are still
actively planning to shed more labour. Sluggish lending to small companies
thus undermines employment, and with it consumer confidence. It also stifles
personal income growth: in the context of long-stagnant US real wages,
income growth depends entirely on rising employment. The picture of
fast-falling employment in the adjusted June figures was almost certainly a
statistical oddity, but the other available evidence suggests a sideways
drift at best, and possibly something a little worse.
Is there a quick fix? Senators agitate for still more interest rate cuts; so
does an understandably worried Mr Bush. But such cuts, inevitably seen as
transient, would hardly restore banking confidence. The Fed advocates
patience - a debt work-out takes time. It also advocates experiments with
further bank reliefs, but admits puzzlement: 'We are looking at a phenomenon
that we have not seen in half a century.' From London, such clear-eyed
humility looks enviable.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Blueprint for a shrinking state: New Zealand's assault on
public spending might hold some lessons for the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'In general, those individuals and families with reasonable means should
attend to their own needs. As a broad principle, the top third of all income
earners can be expected to meet most of the cost of their social services' -
Ms Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's minister of finance, December 1990.
If Mr Norman Lamont wants some relief from his post-election spending
hangover, he might holiday in New Zealand, where Mr Jim Bolger's National
(right-of-centre) government is engaged in one of the toughest assaults on
public spending taking place in the developed world. Mr Bolger's main target
is social spending, and since he started with a welfare state comparable to
Britain's - completed a decade before Aneurin Bevan inaugurated the National
Health Service - his progress is of particular interest to British
observers.
'Within weeks of taking office, we began the redesign of the welfare state,'
says Ms Ruth Richardson, principal architect of the reforms. Two budgets
later, universal welfare benefits are all but extinct, targeting has been
widely extended in the context of reduced or fixed budgets, higher earners
are paying for health and tertiary education, and market structures are
under construction throughout.
It is a conscious attempt to limit the social role of the New Zealand state.
Not all Ms Richardson's cabinet colleagues would subscribe to the opening
quotation: several have been sniping away, with intermittent support from a
prime minister by instinct far more cautious than his finance minister. But
five agreed propositions underlie the changes: that the state's share of
national wealth is excessive and must be reduced if the economy is to
flourish; that government debt is too high; that social spending must be
more narrowly targeted; that the margin between benefit rates and post-tax
income is too small; and that raising extra revenue from tax is not an
option. Mr Lamont would probably say 'aye' to them all.
The validity of these propositions is debatable. New Zealand has a
comparatively high ratio of net debt to gross domestic product: 46.5 per
cent, against an OECD average of 33 per cent. But at 39.6 per cent, the
share of NZ national income consumed by the state is not comparatively
large; nor, at 33 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, are its top rates
of income tax and general sales tax excessive. New Zealand has no capital
gains tax. Says Mr Jonathan Boston, public policy lecturer at Victoria
University, Wellington: 'There is no convincing evidence to suggest that
democratic countries with relatively small state sectors grow any faster
than countries with relatively large state sectors.'
Yet among the New Zealand elite - politicians as well as businessmen - it is
virtually axiomatic that the state does consume too much and that taxes
cannot be raised without stifling growth. Ms Richardson's latest budget
projects public spending falling to 37.4 per cent of GDP by 1994-95 (in the
UK, by contrast, it is 41.7 per cent, and projected by the Treasury to rise
to 42.2 per cent by 1994-95). It is a product of New Zealand's recent past,
eight years of economic stagnation, mounting debt, and a steep decline in
relative living standards, creating an abiding sense of national crisis. The
Labour opposition broadly accepts the premises for all its opposition to
particular changes.
But accept them, and short of dramatic growth the only option is welfare
cuts. No peace dividend is available: defence accounts for only 4 per cent
of spending. After debt charges, three-quarters of New Zealand's budget goes
on welfare and social services. The issue is not whether but what to cut.
New Zealand's reforms divide into two parts: structure and funding.
Institutions are being restructured to devolve managerial authority, keep
politicians at arm's length, and separate 'purchasers' from 'providers' of
services. The 14 integrated area health authorities are being split into
four regional health authorities, which will buy services from some 25 Crown
Health Enterprises managing the hospitals. School governors are gaining
control of their salary budgets, with an experiment under way in total
budgetary devolution. Under the controversial Employment Contracts Act
existing national contracts with teachers have been terminated, and the
government wants more flexible - possibly local - contracts to replace them.
Much of that is familiar to British eyes, but in many areas change is being
taken further. For secondary schools the market is already a way of life.
Onslow College, Wellington, a typical secondary school, publishes
company-style annual accounts and last year raised 20 per cent of its income
from non-government sources. Donations - including a small 'voluntary fee'
charged to parents - account for some of the extra; but a sizeable chunk
came from trading activities and full-cost fees charged to 18 pupils from
overseas. 'I am 100 per cent committed to free state education,' says Mr
Neale Pitches, the principal. 'But it's a simple case of making ends meet.'
However, the most profound changes are in funding:
Health. New Zealanders have always had to pay part-charges for visits to
general practitioners, but those on average and above-average incomes must
now foot the full bill of about NZDollars 30 (Pounds 9) for such visits as
well as all their dentist and optician fees and most of their prescription
charges. Those on low incomes or benefits gain some - but not total -
relief; so do heavy users. Charges for hospital services were introduced
earlier this year for the first time. The population is divided into three
groups by income, with a so-called Kiwicard introduced for identification
purposes. The top third - families with an income of about NZDollars 32,500
(Pounds 10,000) - now pay up to NZDollars 50 a night for hospital visits, up
to a maximum of NZDollars 500 a year per family. Allowing for concessions,
about 20 per cent of patients will pay the charges.
The government is also working on a definition of 'core health services'.
Only these will continue to attract public subsidy, while users will bear
the full cost of such 'non-core' services as cosmetic surgery. Critics
estimate that once the new regime is fully operating about 23 per cent of
national health spending will be met by charges - up from 11 per cent in
1980.
State benefits. All universal transfer payments except the state pension
have been abolished, and significant cuts in that are under way. Over the
next 10 years, the age of eligibility for the pension will be raised from 60
to 65, and its payment is now targeted. The last Labour government
introduced a 25 cents in the dollar surcharge - additional to income tax -
for all pensioners paying income tax. That has been increased to 25 cents,
making a marginal rate of 58 cents for top-rate payers.
Other benefits have been cut across the board. To give an idea of scale,
unemployment benefit for a single person was cut by 10 per cent in cash
terms last year. It is no longer payable to those aged below 18, and at
reduced rates up to 25.
Housing. The government intended last year to withdraw from social housing
entirely, selling off much of its stock, managing the rest on a commercial
basis and fulfilling social obligations through a targeted accommodation
subsidy. The plan has since been modified (the new housing body is to have
social obligations), but the main lines of the reform will proceed.
Education. School spending is to be held constant in real terms. Total
spending will rise slightly to support a 13 per cent increase in tertiary
student numbers projected over the next three years, but funding for student
allowances is to be reduced by about half this academic year alone by means
of a large-scale shift to loans. Most students must now meet the full cost
of their maintenance, and a proportion - about 12 per cent - of the cost of
their fees. Higher education institutions are now allowed to charge top-up
fees.
'University graduates have considerably higher income than those without
qualifications,' argues the Treasury. 'This difference can be drawn on to
pay for their education over time.' It cites research showing that whereas
only 44 per cent of the parents of all those between 18 and 19 years old
have incomes of more than NZDollars 35,500, 73 per cent of parents of
university students do so. The use of such figures is revealing, not just
for their emphasis on the 'top third', but because of the assumption that
the family unit should be the basis for assessment.
If all that seems radical enough, the government initially planned to go
further on all fronts, not just on housing. Last year's budget envisaged
pensioners with taxable income facing a 93 per cent marginal tax rate. It
also planned far narrower targeting of health spending and a 'multiple
funder' health care plan, under which individuals would have been encouraged
to take their risk-adjusted premium out of the national health service
entirely and contract with insurance companies for provision.
But the resulting storm was so severe that the changes were modified. At one
point the government's poll ratings sank to 20 per cent: but with the
concessions, and evidence of economic recovery, the National party is now
almost level-pegging with Labour and the odds-on favourite to win next
year's election. Even if it loses, Labour is unlikely to return to the
status quo ante.
So are the reforms the end of Zealand's welfare state? Talk of
straightforward dismantling is simplistic, for it fails to recognise the
extent to which the previous system - like Britain's - already comprised
fees and targeting. Charges for visits to GPs are a case in point. Mr Simon
Upton, the astute health minister, uses them to argue that charges for
secondary care were positively necessary to 'discourage cost-shifting
between different budgets, and encourage people to consider the costs and
benefits of various services'.
None the less, the reforms mark a fundamental reassessment. Says Mr Mark
Prebble, until recently a senior Treasury official responsible for welfare
policy: 'The important shift is away from a commitment to income support at
a level so that recipients could 'belong and participate' in society . . .
to a modest safety net to maintain individuals in the daily essentials of
food, clothing, power and housing at a decent level.'
Doubtless Mr Lamont would return from Wellington convinced of the political
impossibility of such notions. But should Britain, too, be in for a decade
of stagnation, remember it was Aneurin Bevan who remarked: why gaze into the
crystal ball when you can read the book?

FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: English wood, isn't it good? - Furniture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is something heartbreaking about works of art that exhibit a rare
feeling for materials, are meticulously designed and superbly crafted, but
which are, nonetheless, ugly.
That fate is particularly cruel for much of the furniture produced by John
Makepeace, for Makepeace is not only a virtuoso craftsman but a visionary.
He has made a significant contribution to perpetuating the arts and crafts
tradition in Britain and to developing the neglected resources of native
woodlands.
In 1976, Makepeace bought Parnham, an idyllic but dilapidated Elizabethan
manor house in Dorset. It gave him space in which to set up alongside his
own well-established workshop a much-needed residential school for craftsmen
in wood.
The school's two-year courses provide practical instruction in craft and
design skills and essential business management for those wishing to set up
their own furniture workshops. Moreover, Parnham's restored interiors
allowed him the opportunity of proving - as the Italians had already
demonstrated - that the finest contemporary work could look well in a
traditional setting.
The Parnham Trust, the educational charity established to administer the
school, embarked on a second pioneering venture in 1983, purchasing 350
acres of neglected woodland from the Forestry Commission at nearby Hooke
Park.
Hooke Park College, which is funded by private enterprise, took its first
students three years ago. Here the aim is to develop techniques for the
efficient use of indigenous, sustainable and renewable resources of timber
in the production of anything from furniture and artefacts to buildings and
bridges. It is training a new generation of entrepreneurs to turn principles
into practice, and to regenerate the rural economy.
The college building itself is a light and ingenious construction using
forestry products which are normally wasted - notably roundwood thinnings
which represent up to 50 per cent of a forest's annual crop. At present, 90
per cent of all wood products in this country are imported - to the tune of
some Pounds 7bn a year. It is projected that over the next decade, 375,000
acres of under-exploited British forestry will become redundant.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of the John Makepeace
Workshop, and 15 years of The Parnham Trust and Parnham College.
To celebrate, Sotheby's in London is playing host to an exhibition which is
at once a retrospective of Makepeace commissions and prototypes, a showcase
for both Parnham alumni and the class of '92, and an introduction to the
work of Hooke Park.
It is unfortunate that the first Makepeace exhibit we encounter is the
recent 'Erudition' chair with raised book-rests at the end of each arm. Made
out of yew-wood, burr elm and leather, it looks squat, heavy and decidedly
not user-friendly.
The second piece is the hefty 'Liberty' dining table with its oak-shaped
leaves and supports like tree trunks, surrounded by a suite of
ill-proportioned turned chairs.
Almost everything else here reflects far more favourably on Makepeace's
formal inventiveness and imaginative use - and treatment - of wood.
Many items exult in the sheer beauty of their materials. There is the
glorious slab of burr elm used for the dining table designed for the late
Robert Bolt's medieval manor house.
Burr oak and elm weathered like stone are employed for an altar-like serving
and storage unit for a Cyprus house. We find oak ferrous-washed and polished
with a lime wax to interesting effect, or overlapping oysters of mulberry,
gilded beneath.
There are arresting combinations too. The 'Mitre' chair, with its clean,
sinuous Gothic-inspired lines, is a remarkable piece of 20th century design,
and a technical tour-de-force of intractable macassar ebony. Its back and
seat are made not of woven cane but of nickel silver.
Another covetable but more rustic piece is a kitchen chair of pale, scrubbed
oak with a seat of beaten and softly reflecting polished aluminium.
The 30 exhibits are impressive witness to the exacting standards of the
Makepeace workshop. It seems unlikely that such care, intelligence and
attention to detail were ever lavished on the construction - rather than the
decoration - of furniture before this century. Even the grandest of antiques
cannot boast the degree of finish of, say, the 'Bangkok' collectors' cabinet
combining satinwood, lacquer and velvet, its draws gliding open and close.
On the evidence of work here, the school must be congratulated not only for
maintaining high standards but for allowing students to speak with their own
voices. The range of interests here is striking. Particularly pleasing are
the form and textures of Paul Gower's shot-blasted Douglas fir and patinated
copper chest, Suzanne Watson's cheery multi-coloured hatboxes - a must for
quality freaks - at Pounds 78, and Robert Cullen's low table.
Glass marbles are supported between the latter's waving bands of thin oak,
which casts interesting shadows as well as providing a surface surprisingly
flat enough to carry all but the smallest glasses. Ben Brooks similarly
exploits the rippling lines of thin bent wood, and plays visual tricks with
planes of American cherry in his sculptural 'Paradox' table.
It seems that they all might have been boat builders. Petter Southall,
formerly of Hooke Park College, certainly was. The fluid lines and
thoughtful construction of his dining table and chairs place them among the
most impressive exhibits in the show.
Nine makers represent Parnham alumni. Their work ranges from the cutlery
canteen in the form of Charterhouse Chapel, made for an old boy out of his
own yew - price guide Pounds 20,000 - to wall-mounted coat hooks in anodysed
aluminium at Pounds 34.
Sotheby's, New Bond Street, W1, until July 28. Parnham House, Beaminster,
Dorset, is open on Wednesdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays until October.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Barclays move on MCC attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT by Barclays Bank to stop the administrators of Maxwell
Communication Corporation suing it in the US for the return of Dollars 30m
was an unjustified interference with the US court, the High Court was told
yesterday.
Mr John Higham QC, for the administrators, said Barclays wanted the English
court to help prevent the US court granting remedies in the Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings in New York involving MCC for the benefit of the
company's creditors.
He told Mr Justice Hoffmann that the US court should be left to decide
whether it should deal with the dispute.
The firm of administrators, Price Waterhouse, claims that the Dollars 30m
payment in November 1991 - three weeks after the death of Robert Maxwell -
was an unlawful preference. Price Waterhouse contends that it is for it to
choose where to sue for its return to MCC.
The payment had been demanded by Barclays under the terms of an overdraft
facility granted to MCC. The bank remains a creditor of MCC for Pounds
32.3m, about Pounds 7m of which relates to that facility.
Barclays has argued that the English court is the natural forum for trial of
the dispute because the overdraft facility was an English commercial
transaction, governed by English law, to provide working capital for an
English company and its UK subsidiaries.
Mr Higham argued that there were substantial facts supporting the view that
the US court was the natural and appropriate forum.
Barclays had a substantial trading presence in the US and the Dollars 30m
had been paid in New York at Barclays' request.
Judgment will be given on Tuesday.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Safety net under a steep drop: Exports may be a buffer
between carmakers and the worst of the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP improvement in the competitiveness of the UK car industry, reflected
in a tripling of exports since the late 1980s, may shield manufacturers from
the worst effects of the decline in the industry.
In spite of record spending on advertising and other promotional carrots to
lure buyers into showrooms, there is a growing sense of unease among
carmakers and dealers that the traditional August surge in sales will be
weaker than previously hoped.
August has assumed enormous importance as it typically accounts for nearly
25 per cent of annual sales because of the introduction on August 1 each
year of the new prefix letter - 'K' this year.
But while August will grab most of the headlines, manufacturers and dealers
have begun looking to September's sales with no less anxiety.
They believe that month's figures, free from the hype surrounding August,
will more accurately reflect whether slight improvements in sales
experienced in April, May and last month - of 9.1 per cent, 1.4 per cent and
4.4 per cent respectively - represent a faint but sustainable recovery.
The growing worry is that the relentless flow of gloomy statistics about the
economy over the past few weeks is damaging the confidence of both private
and business buyers so much that the car market could slip back into
recession for the rest of the year.
Sales have plummeted during the recession by a third from a record 2.3m in
1989 to 1.59m last year. In spite of the recent slight upturn, sales for the
first half of this year were down a further 4 per cent.
Mr Reg Heath, chief executive of the Inchcape-owned TKM group - which
controls more than 100 car dealerships - says there is now a real danger
that any real recovery will not get under way before 1993.
Mr Michael Hollingsworth, an economist with the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, finds it hard to see how the industry could avoid
cutting production and imposing short-time working this year under those
circumstances.
Without the export programmes, widespread shutdowns would definitely be
unavoidable. But even though some principal continental European markets are
now coming off the boil, and total exports are likely to decline again this
year, the manufacturers at least would no longer face potential disaster.
So far, Ford and Peugeot-Talbot have been the only manufacturers to signal
cuts after workers return from their summer break next month.
And the exports safety-net spread beneath the industry was emphasised again
yesterday with an announcement by Ford of an expanded exports programme at
its Halewood plant on Merseyside, just a few days after announcing that it
would cut output at the plant for a month because of the downturn in UK
sales.
Instead, Escort and Orion models built at Halewood - already exported to
France and Italy - are to go on sale to German buyers as well from the
autumn. As a result, production cuts at Halewood will last for only two
weeks.
The transformation in the UK industry's export performance over the past
three years has been considerable. In 1988 the industry shipped just over
200,000 cars overseas, mainly to continental Europe. By 1990 this had
doubled and last year saw a further sharp rise to 605,000, much higher than
in any year since 1973.
Last year Ford became the UK's biggest motor industry exporter, with
shipments of 186,000 cars and commercial vehicles. Rover Group's exports
totalled 209,000; Peugeot Talbot's 60,000; General Motors' Vauxhall
subsidiary, launching a substantial exports programme for the first time
since the 1970s, shipped 104,000 cars.
As a result, production slipped only 4.53 per cent below the 1990 level, to
1.23m. Output in the first six months of this year, at 686,763, was also
only 1.1 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago.
However, Mr Hollingsworth believes that export markets will weaken further
this year and that total UK exports could drop to around 500,000.
In order even to match 1991's total market, August sales will need to reach
400,000 - against 370,000 last year - and be followed by increases of 4 per
cent on a year-on-year basis for each subsequent month through to December.
The industry is putting a brave public face on its prospects. But privately
fears are being voiced that next month's sales may be no better than the
previous August's, even though the industry is unofficially estimated to be
spending a record Pounds 50m on advertising during July alone to generate
buyer interest. Last year, according to statistical group Market Expenditure
Analysis, it spent Pounds 42m.
In the private-buyer market, worries about job security and the collapse of
the housing market are seen as important factors. This reluctance - rather
than inability - to spend, which is reflected in high personal-savings
ratios, is being intensified, some dealer groups suggest, by a belief among
private buyers that still bigger bargains may be had by delaying purchases.
The attitudes of business car buyers are reflected by the large leasing
groups, which buy a broad spread of cars essentially chosen by their client
companies. They offer manufacturers little comfort.
After the Conservative victory in the general election, new orders started
flowing through the leasing companies at a rate some 40 per cent to 50 per
cent higher than last autumn.
But the spree lasted just eight weeks, as business confidence began
collapsing. 'June 1 was like the tap being turned off,' recalls Mr Ian
Mosley, chief executive of Swan National Leasing and Rental. 'Everything
just stopped.'

FT  24 JUL 92 / Top civil servants set to back deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP civil servants are today expected to accept a radical extension of
performance-related pay which will give managers much greater discretion
over what they pay staff.
Under the agreement proposed by the Treasury, which will apply to the 25,000
senior four grades of civil servant, the automatic progression up a 'pay
spine' will be removed and replaced by pay bands.
Performance will be measured against an agreed standard. If individuals
perform less well than the standard they will receive no pay increase. In
addition there will be a further budget for individual merit awards for
those who have done better than the standard.
The precise arrangements and criteria for the merit awards have yet to be
agreed between the Treasury and the three unions involved - the Association
of First Division Civil Servants, the IPMS and the NUCPS.
The actual pay offer this year to these higher-grade civil servants remains
confidential. Other civil servants have been offered and have accepted a 4.1
per cent pay offer which also included an element of performance-related pay
but did not abolish the traditional pay spines.
The Union of Communication Workers is recommending acceptance of a 3.99 per
cent increase on basic pay for staff at Parcelforce, the parcels arm of the
Post Office whose privatisation was announced last week.
The union represents 10,000 of the 12,500 workers in Parcelforce.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Sir Hugh Weeks, leading CBI figure: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR HUGH WEEKS, who has died aged 88, was a leading spokesman for industry
and commerce, a former chairman of merchant bank Leopold Joseph and a
pioneer in the use of market research in business.
He served on public committees under the Wilson and Heath governments, but
his main platform was the chairmanship of the Confederation of British
Industry economic committee from 1957 to 1972. It was from there in 1958
that he launched the CBI industrial trends survey.
His careers in finance and industry developed in parallel. He was deputy
chairman of Truscon, a steel company, from 1951 to 1960 and in the mid-60s
became deputy chairman of Richard Thomas and Baldwin, a larger steel
manufacturer. After nationalisation he was a regional board member of
British Steel.
He was also a long-serving director of both the Finance Corporation for
Industry and the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation, which
provided government-sponsored funds for industry.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Engineers gloomy over growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Engineering Employers Federation yesterday sharply revised downwards its
forecasts for UK economic growth this year and 1993 amid reduced
expectations for UK and world recovery.
An update to the federation's Engineering Economic Trends series, which last
reported in the spring, confirms that engineering output has stopped
falling, but pushes back by about six months the start of its recovery.
The federation is a cautious forecaster but is widely respected for its
accuracy. Mr Ian Thompson, its economic adviser, expects UK gross domestic
product to fall by 0.6 per cent this year compared with his spring forecast
of 0.5 per cent growth. Next year's growth forecast is revised downwards
from 2.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent.
The spring report had predicted that the vehicles sector would lead a
recovery in engineering output that would begin in the second half of this
year.
Yesterday, however, Mr Thompson said that neither the UK market, nor
exports, seemed likely to produce any substantial increase in vehicle output
during the second half. Consequently, engineering output is now forecast to
start recovering from late this year.
Among the main points of the federation's forecasts for the next 12 months
are:
Engineering output will increase by 3 per cent, after falling 15 per cent in
the previous 24 months.
The total UK market for engineering products will grow by 4 per cent, after
falling 17 per cent in the previous 24 months.
Employment in engineering will fall at a much slower rate, with about 60,000
job cuts compared with 260,000 over the past 24 months. This will take
engineering employment to 1.75m next year against 3m in 1980.
The rise in engineering output forecast by the federation for next year is
the first for four years, with sales in 1992 money expected to rise from
Pounds 121.6bn this year to Pounds 126bn. But, on the same basis, this is
still less than the Pounds 126.1bn of engineering sales in 1980.
Mr Neil Johnson, the federation's new director-general, said the EEF would
continue to stress the importance of maintaining the UK's manufacturing
base.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Wales 'set to lead recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON, Welsh Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAK recovery expected in the second half of this year will be led by
Wales, Mr David Kern, chief economist of National Westminster Bank, said
yesterday.
'The Welsh economy will register a small rise in output of 0.2 per cent this
year compared with fairly large outright declines in London and the rest of
southern England,' he said.
Mr Kern prediced that the resilience of the Welsh economy next year would be
'remarkable'. He pointed out that there had been an increase of just 2 per
cent in unemployment in Wales over the past six months against a national
rise of 7 per cent. 'Over the next year unemployment in Wales is forecast to
rise by 2 per cent compared with 12 per cent in the UK,' he added.
He also forecast that between 1993 and 1997 the Welsh economy would grow on
average by 2.3 per cent a year - more than the 2 per cent forecast for the
UK non-oil economy. He attributed the resilience to 'considerable
restructuring' of the Welsh economy during the 1980s.
'The economy has become much more diversified than 10 years ago,' he said.
There had been 'an increasingly competitive and enterprising manufacturing
sector replacing more traditional industries, while a prominent financial
and business-services sector has become a major source of employment.'
Foreign investment had played a large role in this diversification, Mr Kern
said. 'Wales has succeeded in attracting almost 20 per cent of all inward UK
investment in recent years including substantial amounts of Japanese and
US-owned manufacturing capacity.'
Mr Kern said the outlook for the UK would depend on 'its ability to adjust
successfully to the harsh discipline of convergence to a low-inflation
environment in the European exchange rate mechanism'. He predicted that
Welsh economic performance would comfortably exceed the national average
over the next few years.

FT  24 JUL 92 / 'Weak and fragile' upturn is claimed: Chambers of commerce
find concern on interest rates - Growth forecasts revised down / Carmakers
fear low August sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMY is slowly improving but the recovery is weak and uninspiring,
the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday.
The latest quarterly survey by the chambers provided a glimmer of good news
on the economy following a series of pessimistic figures earlier this week.
It found that order books in the domestic market for manufacturing and
service companies grew, on balance, in the second quarter.
'The recovery is here, but it is extremely weak and extremely fragile, and
it would take very little to knock it off-course,' said Mr Richard Brown,
director of policy for the chambers.
A slowdown in the growth of exports and a flattening out in the rate of
improvement of the service sector in particular raised questions about the
sustainability of the recovery.
During the second quarter, all 12 indicators of the survey - which covers
8,813 responses from across the UK - were either positive or less negative
than they were three months ago. The survey suggested that small to
medium-sized companies were leading growth in the manufacturing sector.
'There is room for cautious optimism that the economy is at least continuing
to move in the right direction, albeit at a slower pace than could be hoped
for,' said the report.
According to the survey, high interest rates remained the biggest concern of
business. Other fears included inflation, the price of materials and pay
settlements in manufacturing industry. Only a third of manufacturing
industries and a sixth of services industries said the exchange rate was a
big concern.
The survey also highlighted the continuing problem of skills shortages, with
about a quarter of employers experienced recruiting difficulties in the
second quarter. 'The potential for skill shortages to act as a brake on
recovery remains, and underlines the dangers of complacency with regard to
continuing training and development of the workforce,' the report says.
The main points are:
Home markets. More groups reported an increase in UK orders than a decrease
but the performances of regions differed widely. The north-east and east
Midlands continued to perform strongly, while order books in London did
worse than in the previous quarter.
Exports. Overseas trading conditions were increasingly difficult, especially
for smaller companies. There were signs of a slowdown in exports,
particularly for the service sector.
Employment. Heavy job-shedding continued, but the rate slowed. For the first
time in two years a small balance of service-sector businesses said they
anticipated increasing the size of their workforces over the next quarter.
However, the chambers warned that employer expectations often turned out to
be too optimistic.
Investment. On balance, companies revised their intentions to invest in
plant and equipment upwards for the first time in 18 months.
Capacity utilisation. Fewer than one in five companies worked to full
capacity.
Business confidence. This grew during the second quarter.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Motorola to spend Pounds 40m on Scots microchip plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOROLA, the US electr-onics group, yesterday announced plans to expand its
East Kilbride semiconductor plant in Scotland to make it the biggest of its
kind in Europe. It was the second large investment in Scotland to be
announced by a US electronics group in the past three months.
Motorola proposes to spend Pounds 40m to increase manufacturing capacity at
East Kilbride and to enable the plant to produce a new generation of
microprocessors now manufactured by Motorola only in the US.
National Semiconductor, another large US microchip manufacturer, announced
plans in May to spend Pounds 49.5m expanding its plant at Greenock in
Scotland, creating 250 jobs over two years.
Motorola expects to create 150 jobs at East Kilbride, increasing the plant's
workforce to nearly 2,000 and making the company one of Scotland's biggest
private employers.
Mr Allan Stewart, industry minister for Scotland, welcomed the decision
which he said would enhance the country's position at the forefront of the
European electronics industry.
Scotland accounts for about a fifth of European semiconductor output and
more than half of UK production.
The more than 450 companies involved in the electronics industry in Scotland
employ almost 50,000 people and account for almost a fifth of its
manufacturing output. Just over half of all production is exported to
continental Europe.
Mr Barry Waite, general manager of Motorola's European semiconductor
division, said that it was indicative of the company's commitment to Europe
and East Kilbride that the latest investment was being made when the UK was
fighting to recover from recession. Motorola has already spent Pounds 230m
at East Kilbride since it set up in Scotland in 1969.
The latest investment will allow the plant to manufacture some of the new
68,000 range of microprocessors which are capable of holding far higher
amounts of data on each tiny piece of silicon.
Motorola said: 'We will be able to etch on a piece of silicon measuring 0.5
sq cm a street map of the whole of the UK. Those semi-conductor streets, 0.5
microns wide and 160 times thinner than a human hair, will connect together
more than 6m transistors on the silicon surface.'
Microchips produced at East Kilbride are used in a wide range of products
from cars and CD players to computers and washing machines.

MR IAN MAXWELL went to the High Court yesterday to oppose an application by
the liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management for immediate judgment
on its Pounds 450m damages claim against him.
The liquidator, Robson Rhodes, contends that Mr Maxwell, a son of Robert
Maxwell, has no defence to its allegations that he breached his fiduciary
duty as a director of BIM, from which hundreds of millions of pounds of
Maxwell companies' pension funds are missing.
Mr Maxwell's lawyers are contending at the private hearing, which continues
today, that he has an arguable defence justifying the dispute going to a
full trial.
On Monday the liquidator was granted final judgment in an identical claim
against Mr Kevin Maxwell, brother of Mr Ian Maxwell, who was ordered to make
interim payments totalling Pounds 406.5m pending assessment of his total
liability. Mr Kevin Maxwell did not defend the liquidator's claim because of
lack of resources. Earlier this month he said he was insolvent and wanted
time to formulate proposals to put to his creditors.
The liquidator intends forcing him into bankruptcy. It is expected to do the
same to Mr Ian Maxwell if it succeeds in its claim for final judgment
against him.
Both brothers face criminal charges arising from an investigation of their
father's empire by the Serious Fraud Office.

FT  24 JUL 92 / London Electricity tops service poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY consumers in London get better service than those in the north
of Scotland, the industry watchdog Offer reported yesterday.
It also proposed important measures to improve customer service in the
electricity industry. These include offering customers timed appointments
and paying more compensation for bad service.
The report ranked the 12 regional electricity companies and the two Scottish
electricity companies according to how well they had performed against 10
'guaranteed' service standards Offer set in July last year. If they fall
below these standards, the companies have to pay customers compensation.
London Electricity came out top, with a failure rate of only one incident
per 10,000 customers since July last year. The Scottish company
Hydro-Electric was the worst, with 47 failures per 10,000.
The company admitted it had some way to go to achieve its objectives.
East Midlands came bottom of the 12 regional electricity companies, with 26
failures per 10,000. But East Midlands said it had set itself more stringent
standards than most companies.
For example, it already offers customers timed appointments, and replies to
them more quickly than Offer requires.
The other companies performed from best to worst as follows: Southern (5
failures), Yorkshire (7), Northern (10), Norweb (10), Eastern (11), Seeboard
(12), Midlands (13), Scottish Power (14), South Wales (18), South Western
(21), Manweb (25) and East Midlands (26).
But some companies also failed Offer's 'overall standards'. These do not
carry financial penalties, but Offer said it would write to the companies
and ask them how they planned to improve their service.
While East Midlands performed better on these standards, ScottishPower,
Midlands Electricity and Southern Electric each failed standards - and
Hydro-Electric failed two.
Offer also proposed changes to customer service standards which it expects
to introduce in January after a consultation period. These involve:
Doubling the penalty payments customers can claim from electricity
companies. Under the new standard customers could claim Pounds 20 for a
missed appointment, and non-domestic customers could claim Pounds 100 for
failure to supply electricity.
Compelling electricity companies to specify within 2 hours when they will
arrive for appointments with customers.
Ensuring customers are sent accurate rather than estimated bills.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Allocations replace pre-Budget bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC spending round under-went minor reform last year when the then
chief secretary to the Treasury made clear that he would not spend the party
conference in the traditional manner of chief secretaries, ducking in and
out of colleagues' hotel rooms for individual negotiations.
The changes announced on Wednesday in the way in which public spending
decisions will be taken will affect the role of the chief secretary rather
than just his dignity. The new cabinet committee will inevitably mean that
the chancellor has more involvement in spending decisions than at present
The introduction of the new 'top down' process for agreeing spending for
1994-95 will coincide with the changes to the Budget cycle, leading to a
combined Budget and public spending statement in late November or December -
slightly later than the usual date for the Autumn Statement. Even Treasury
officials profess some uncertainty about how the two sets of changes will
mesh together.
There will still be a cabinet economic discussion in July each year. If the
new system is as firm as ministers made it sound this week, however, the
'control total' which will govern discretionary spending for the following
year will already have been set, and the cabinet will be setting the
'control total' for the second year after the one in which the discussion is
held.
The chief secretary will still hold discussions with departmental ministers,
and some spending bids will undoubtedly not make it beyond that stage.
However, instead of being negotiations around planned departmental spending,
the meetings will be about allocating money within the agreed total.
Spending bids that survive those discussions will go to the chancellor's
committee, which is likely to meet during September and October.
Already nicknamed 'son of Star Chamber', after the committee which can act
as arbitrator of last resort in the existing system, the chancellor's
committee will include the chief secretary and consist mainly of
non-departmental ministers such as the leaders of the Commons and the the
Lords. The Treasury is, however, resigned to inclusion of a spending
minister as well. As under the present arrangements, the cabinet as a whole
will be asked to approve the final deal.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Warning shots over EC environment rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE same environmental standards need to be applied throughout all European
Community countries to avoid creating barriers to trade, Mr Karel van Miert
said last night in London in his first public speech as EC environment
commissioner.
That principle should include drinking water and bathing water, he added.
Mr van Miert's remarks follow a recent statement by Mr Michael Howard, the
UK environment secretary, that some EC environmental directives might be
repealed during the UK's presidency of the EC. This prompted accusations
from opposition MPs and environmental groups that water standards would be
targeted.
Although Mr van Miert will hold the job for only six months until the end of
the current commission, his tenure will coincide with the UK presidency.
His reference to trade barriers reflects concerns that some member states
might impose tough environmental standards not so much to protect the
environment as to keep out imports.
In a speech which also showed that he has adopted some of the policies
favoured by his predecessor, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, Mr van Miert said new
taxes should be used alongside regulation to persuade businesses to clean up
the environment.
Taxes on the emission of carbon dioxide and on road haulage were
particularly desirable, he said. One of the UK's priorities in the six
months of its presidency should be to secure EC agreement on how to
stabilise carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000, he said.
Mr Ripa di Meana was a champion of the carbon tax, a proposal that lost some
of its force with his sudden resignation last month.
The EC's action should not end at its own boundaries, Mr van Miert said.
'The threat posed to our air and our water by the state of nuclear reactors
in central and eastern Europe is the most striking example.'
Mr Howard, who was present for Mr van Miert's speech and later took part in
a debate with him, said enforcement of environmental directives would be a
priority of the UK's presidency.
He also reaffirmed his commitment to subsidiarity - devolving decisions back
to national level. 'We are still looking closely at whether EC environmental
legislation would benefit from shedding weight,' he said.

FT  24 JUL 92 / High insurance losses feared on mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS may face further heavy losses as a result of continuing high levels
of default on mortgages, analysts believe.
Earlier this year hopes were high that claims from domestic mortgage
indemnity policies, which cover lenders against losses on sales of
repossessed properties, would tail off as the economy moved out of
recession.
However, the continuing depression in the housing market is leading many
analysts to revise earlier forecasts.
Mr Derek Elias, analyst with Paribas Capital Markets Group, said: 'The
problem is not going to to decline fairly rapidly in the tidy way that most
of the lenders and the insurance companies are suggesting.'
Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance, Legal &amp; General and Eagle Star, which
together control about 70 per cent of the mortgage indemnity market, are
worst affected.
Last year insurers made pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.2bn, with mortgage
indemnity claims an important contributing factor.
Overall mortgage indemnity losses for last year and this year were expected
to amount to Pounds 2bn, but could now climb even higher and continue next
year, undermining the prospect of a return to profitability.
Analysts expect repossessions to stay at around the level of 75,540 reached
last year for the next two years.
Mr Youssuf Ziai, analyst with Morgan Stanley, expects repossessions to total
80,000 in 1992. 'People got too excited by the prospects of the government
and building society rescue schemes,' he said.
There are also fears that insurers could face claims on insurance policies
covering securitised mortgage pools.
According to one analyst, the UK industry's exposure on mortgage-pool
business is about Pounds 10bn. Another said he expected claims could amount
to as much as Pounds 100m.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Danger to certain projects from spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, ANDREW ADONIS, DANIEL GREEN and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUTTING public expenditure over the next three years will involve ruthless
scrutiny of some cherished projects:
Social security: at 30 per cent of public expenditure, the largest component
but also the hardest to cut given Conservative manifesto commitments. State
pensions (more than 10 per cent of public expenditure) and child benefits
will be uprated in line with inflation. Leaks have suggested that growth in
unemployment benefits could be eased by reducing eligibility from one year
to six months but most savings would be consumed by increased income
support.
Health and social services: Pounds 36.8bn. The Conservative manifesto
promised 'year by year to increase the level of real resources committed to
the NHS'. This makes it hard to cut much more than Pounds 500m of the
increases planned for the next few years. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, believes her Pounds 800m budget for switching responsibility for
care in the community to local authorities is inviolate.
Local government: consumes about a quarter of central government
expenditure. Most of it goes on the general support grant to cover housing,
police, environment, roads and so on, which is easy to cut. However, the new
council tax arrives next April, with ministers anxious to avoid the sort of
cuts which partly accounted for the hefty bills in the first year of the
poll tax and so discredited it. Capital grants for housing - already heavily
cut in real terms - offer an easy target at around Pounds 2bn, but would be
hard to sell.
Defence: 10 per cent of the total. If reduced to the level of comparable
European countries, the 25 per cent cut across the board would save Pounds
6bn a year. The 1990 Options for Change review has already sharply reduced
numbers in the Army. The Royal Navy has taken ships out of service and
extended refits, but could cut some of 13 Type 23 frigates ordered at Pounds
180m each. Vulnerable RAF projects include the Pounds 700m mid-life update
of the Tornado aircraft (especially if the European Fighter Aircraft,
needing Pounds 7bn from the UK, goes ahead). The Trigat anti-tank missiles
(Pounds 425m) have already seen the production phase cut from spending
plans, and the decision on buying the medium-range surface-to-air-missile
MSAMS (roughly Pounds 500m) has been delayed six months to June 1993.
Education: only Pounds 8.3bn of more than Pounds 30bn spent on education is
directly controlled by central government. With the largest component -
teachers' pay - recently subject to an independent pay body review, large
savings would mean teacher redundancies, a reduction in capital budgets or
cuts in higher education. With the first two, local councils would have to
do much of the cutting, since they control most school education (for now).
Transport: Pounds 6.6bn and falling. Construction costs have dropped to such
a low level that big cuts can be made in the Pounds 2bn-a-year national
roads budget without drastically affecting the number of miles being built
or repaired. A cut of 20 per cent would not only produce savings of Pounds
400m a year but could also prove popular with the green lobby. But cutting
British Rail or London Underground investment would be painful and
controversial.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Recession twists the knife in public spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury has pencilled in cuts of about Pounds 13bn in public spending
in 1994-95 and 1995-96 as part of its programme unveiled on Wednesday to
rein in rises in government borrowing.
It has also sharply reduced its projections for inflation over the next few
years, while leaving growth assumptions largely unchanged.
Such news is likely to be welcomed by the financial markets, which have
become concerned at the rapid rise in the public sector borrowing
requirement. But the sting in the tail of this week's developments is that
the PSBR may continue to rise at a greater rate than the Treasury projects
because of the longer-than-expected recession, which is biting into
government revenues.
On the basis of estimates from Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, the
likely shortfall in tax receipts will push the PSBR from an expected Pounds
31.7bn this financial year to Pounds 41.9bn in 1993-94.
Even with the benefit of the spending cuts in 1994-95 and 1995-96, the
borrowing requirement for those two years works out at Pounds 36bn and
Pounds 33.4bn respectively, using Salomon's revenue projections. These
figures are substantially above comparable estimates of Pounds 18.6bn and
Pounds 12.5bn, based on the Treasury's most recently published figures for
likely growth in government receipts.
The table below illustrates how the Treasury's new regime for cutting
increases in public spending will change the outlook for government
programmes spread across areas such as health, transport and eduction. The
main features are as follows:
Total government spending - which includes the 'planning total' covering 90
per cent of spending, together with debt interest and self-financed spending
by local councils - is earmarked to stay at Pounds 285bn in 1993-94, as
under existing plans. Excluding proceeds from privatisation, that represents
real, inflation-adjusted growth of about 4 per cent compared with 1992-93.
Real growth in government spending will be pegged to 1 per cent in 1994-95
and 1995-96. On the Treasury's new assumption of 2.25 per cent inflation in
these years (less than its Budget estimates of 3 per cent and 2.5 per cent
respectively) that boils down to growth in current prices in each year of
3.25 per cent. Comparing the new figures with previous Treasury projections
made in the Budget, it appears the Treasury is contemplating a spending cut
of Pounds 6.9bn in 1994-95 and one of Pounds 6.5bn in 1995-96. In each case,
the reductions represent about 2 per cent of total spending. In real terms,
the cuts will be slightly less, because of the effects of the lower
inflation which the Treasury is projecting for these years.
The planning total for 1993-94 will stay at previously agreed levels, at
Pounds 244.5bn. In previous years large sums have been added to planning
totals ahead of the coming financial year; in the past few months,
departmental ministers have submitted bids to the Treasury asking for a
total of about Pounds 14bn to be added to the planning total. By making it
clear early in the public spending round that such bids will be ignored, Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hopes to reduce expectations substantially
about higher state spending.
From 1994-95, the Treasury's system for controlling spending will be based
on a new concept - the 'control total'. This will be broadly the same as the
planning total, but excludes unemployment-related social security spending.
Out of the Pounds 65bn social security budget in 1991-92 (accounting for
roughly a quarter of total government spending) Pounds 7.5bn was spent on
unemployed people. With the rise of unemployment to 2.7m - a figure which
could climb to 3m by the end of the year - the total will probably increase
to about Pounds 9bn this year. Counting other social security programmes
also linked to people without jobs, total unemployment-related social
security spending over the next few years is expected to total Pounds
10bn-Pounds 15bn a year.
According to the Treasury's new arithmetic, the control total will be
allowed to rise by an average of 1.5 per cent a year in real terms during
the next three years. It is pencilling in a notional increase of 2.8 per
cent in 1993-94 (even though the new concept is being introduced only in the
year afterwards) and growth of 0.75 per cent and 1 per cent in the two
subsequent years.
Working out which government programmes will be affected by the new regime
is difficult because much depends on the pace of economic growth and how
this affects unemployment. The Treasury estimated for this year that
unemployment would average 2.4m over the 12 months; each additional 100,000
people out of work adds about Pounds 300m to social security spending.
Because of the Pounds 13bn worth of cuts already programmed into the
spending profile for 1994-95 and 1995-96 the haggling will have to start
quickly among spending ministers as to which programmes are likely to
suffer.
One possibility is that if growth picks up relatively quickly over the next
year, the government may relax the pressure on public spending slightly; on
the other hand, should the recession drag on well into 1993, the squeeze may
become even more sharp, if only because of the strains that would start to
hit the PSBR.

MORE than 60 leading architects have signed a statement criticising public
authorities for taking advantage of the recession and accepting cut-price
bids from architects.
The signatories, including professionals from Richard Rogers Partnership and
Sir Norman Foster and Partners, are concerned that choosing architects on
the basis of price alone will encourage poor designs and shoddy work.
The move comes at a time when a third of Britain's 32,000 registered
architects are estimated to be out of work as a result of the recession.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Investors Compensation Scheme, the industry-backed compensation fund for
investors in retail financial products, paid Pounds 12.5m to more than 1,500
investors in 1991-92, up sharply from Pounds 1.8m the year before.
In explaining the sharp increase in both the volume and value of claims, Mr
Denis Child, chairman, said there had been a surge of complaints relating to
alleged negligence. He also noted that claims had become increasingly
complex.
These claims largely are concerned with the sales of home-equity plans -
plans which encourage individuals to mortgage their home and invest the
proceeds in a bond which may earn an insufficient return.

FT  24 JUL 92 / New shadow cabinet members for John Smith's 'dream team'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the new Labour leader, yesterday won what amounts to a 'dream
team' in the highly-volatile lottery of the shadow cabinet elections.
The make-up of the new parliamentary leadership reflects a growing shift
towards what is widely becoming known as the 'modernising' faction of the
party with women and southerners getting a slightly larger share of the
cake. A younger generation - comprising Ms Harriet Harman, Ms Marjorie
Mowlam and Mr Chris Smith - can all be deemed Smith loyalists.
The full result of the shadow cabinet election was: Gordon Brown 165 votes,
Tony Blair 150, Robin Cook 149, Frank Dobson 140, John Prescott 137, Bryan
Gould 135, Harriet Harman 135, Marjorie Mowlam 135, Chris Smith 135, Ann
Clwyd 133,Ann Taylor 129, Jack Cunningham 124, Michael Meacher 122, Donald
Dewar 121, David Blunkett 112, Jack Straw 111, Tom Clarke 105, David Clark
104.
Harriet Harman
Robin Cook's well-established deputy on the high-profile shadow health
portfolio and already one of the best-known of Labour's frontbench
spokespeople. Ms Harman is too uncompromising in her campaigning for women's
rights for some of the more unreconstructed male chauvinists in Labour's
ranks but she will be a key figure in the party's bid to woo more of the
female vote. She is approaching her tenth anniversary as MP for the
down-at-heel inner London seat of Peckham and has an enviable reputation as
a diligent constituency worker. A leftwinger of the Meacherite rather than
the Bennite school.
Tom Clarke
Affable MP for Monklands West who has the advantage over his shadow cabinet
colleagues of sharing a constituency border with his party leader. Mr Clarke
is arguably the least well-known of the new leadership outside Westminster
but he built a reputation as an efficient second-ranking spokesman on health
affairs, having served as the backbench foreign affairs committee chairman
from 1983-86. He is centre-right, Roman Catholic, devolutionist and a
Scottish moralist and he will be a doggedly loyal supporter of his friend,
Mr John Smith, when the going gets rough.
David Blunkett
His breakthrough into the shadow cabinet at the fourth attempt should give
him an opportunity to demonstrate that he has more than one string to his
bow. He is MP for Sheffield Brightside and has been a frontbench environment
spokesman. He is Britain's third blind MP, has served on Labour's national
executive committee since 1983 and ran Mr Bryan Gould's ill-starred
leadership campaign. He described the sell-off of the water authorities as
'probably the most disgraceful act of a government intent on turning Britain
into an auctioneer's paradise'.
Chris Smith
Conscientious Islington South and Finsbury MP and previously the Number
Three in the Smith-Beckett shadow Treasury team. He did his prospects no
harm by successfully moving the controversial recent amendment to raise MPs'
office expense allowances by 38 per cent. He is the only MP openly to have
declared his homosexuality. Mr Smith increased his once slender majority by
9,800 votes in the last general election. A softish left intellectual, he
co-sponsored Mr Tony Benn's 1989 bill to disestablish the Church of England.
Marjorie Mowlam
A trojan of Labour's ultimately futile so-called prawn cocktail offensive.
She is an industrious former college lecturer who made a good fist of
shadowing the tricky City and corporate affairs portfolio without ever
giving the impression of having found her metier. She was among the first
members of the parliamentary intake of 1987 to be appointed to the front
bench as a Northern Ireland spokeswoman four years ago. MP for the
industrial north-east constituency of Redcar, she is well-placed now to turn
her attentions to a bigger spending department.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Banks set to bounce California's cheques: State
administration grapples with severe budget crisis as big pay day looms
</HEADLINE>

CALIFORNIAN banks are preparing to bounce the state government's cheques, as
the state grapples with its most severe budget crisis since the Depression.
Left without a formal budget for the fiscal year that began this month, the
state government has been reduced to paying its employees and contractors
with a form of cheque, or IOU, known as a registered warrant. For
recipients, these warrants are meant to be as good as cheques, while the
banks earn interest on them until the state redeems them.
More than Dollars 1bn is already outstanding in this form, a big pay day is
impending next week and banks are starting to grumble. Small community banks
have virtually stopped accepting the IOUs. Bank of America, one of the main
Californian banks, said yesterday it would no longer accept the state's IOUs
from August 5.
'This is a very unusual situation. I don't think anyone has issued scrip or
IOUs since the 1930s,' said Mr Ron Snell at the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
Bankers' threats appear to have forced Governor Pete Wilson of California, a
Republican, and Mr Willie Brown, Speaker of the Democratic-controlled state
assembly, into a new effort to resolve their disagreements. 'It's going to
take this sort of action to get out of the impasse,' said Mr Richard Mount
of the Saratoga National Bank, near San Francisco, noting that the 5 per
cent interest paid to banks on the warrants did not begin to cover handling
costs.
But the size of California's fiscal problems, and the public policy
questions which underlie them, will make it hard to reach a solution.
Faced with a budget shortfall last year, Governor Wilson agreed to a heavy
tax increase. As the state's economy continued to suffer from recession,
however, this failed to bring in as much revenue as hoped.
This year, the state faces a shortfall estimated at Dollars 11bn-Dollars
12bn, for a total budget of Dollars 55bn-Dollars 60bn. 'Even the states
which had very large problems at the beginning of the 1980s, because of the
collapse in oil and energy tax revenues, did not have shortfalls of 20 per
cent,' Mr Snell comments.
The difficulties are rooted in the state's development over the last two
decades and the policies it has pursued. The growing population has put
heavy burdens on public education and social security. The burdens have been
made worse by immigration from elsewhere in the US, Mexico and Pacific Rim
countries.
The state has also taken over from city and county administrations more of
the cost of providing services, as a consequence of the 1978 state
constitutional amendment, known as Proposition 13, that limited property
taxes. Much discussion between Governor Wilson and Speaker Brown focuses on
how to reduce the state's payments to local governments so as to compensate
them for the property tax reduction under Proposition 13.
California has a history of passing by referendum constitutional amendments
which mandate spending or earmark revenues. As a result, its governors
complain they control less than 10 per cent of their budget. The fiscal
crisis has been brought to a head by recession, which has hit California
harder than most other states, and by cuts in defence spending, once a
mainstay in the state economy.
Mr Gray Davis, state controller, said this week that he would start
redeeming some of the IOUs from August 3. The state has about Dollars 1.5bn
in cash, but is constrained in using that until a budget has been passed.
Even so, a longer-term solution is expected to require radical rethinking of
the services California offers its population and the taxes it may levy.

LEADERS of Spain, Portugal and 17 Latin American countries started a
four-day summit in Madrid yesterday, amid concern about crises facing
several governments in the region.
Absent yesterday from the opening session of the Ibero-American summit were
President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, embroiled in a crisis after the jail
escape of drug baron Mr Pablo Escobar; President Alberto Fujimori of Peru,
facing a guerrilla bombing campaign in Lima; and President Carlos Andres
Perez of Venezuela, his country's senate refusing to let him travel because
of a national political crisis.
Also absent was President Mario Soares of Portugal, reported to be ill.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, last night pointedly expressed
regret over the non-appearance of Mr Gaviria and Mr Perez, but did not
mention Mr Fujimori.
The occasion is being used to confirm inter-governmental commercial accords.
Mr Gonzalez and President Fernando Collor of Brazil yesterday signed an
accord envisaging the extension of up to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.58bn) in
Spanish credits and investments over the next five years.
The accord includes up to Dollars 500m of credits to finance Spanish exports
to Brazil, and measures such as renegotiation of their double-tax treaty to
boost foreign investment and joint ventures.
The arrival of President Fidel Castro of Cuba was marked by demonstrations
for and against his government.

The Airports and Auxiliary Services said the first airports to be sold are
likely be those at the Caribbean resort of Cancun and at Tijuana on the US
border. Both require new terminals.
Mr Carlos Cardenas, head of the national chamber of construction, told El
Economista newspaper that airport concessions for up to 20-30 years are
likely to be sold. Foreign investors will almost certainly be welcome.

FT  24 JUL 92 / White House sees sharp fall in jobless rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, CHICAGO, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration yesterday forecast a sharp drop in US unemployment
by the end of the year, as economic growth gathers pace.
The White House said it had revised its growth forecast for gross domestic
product up to 2.7 per cent (fourth quarter over fourth quarter 1991), from a
projection of 2.2 per cent in its January budget.
Unemployment will fall to 6.9 per cent by the fourth quarter, the White
House said in its half-yearly economic report - a steep fall from last
month's disappointing 7.8 per cent figure, although still slightly higher
than the rate of 6.8 per cent forecast in the budget.
The economic report said real growth, as anticipated, had accelerated
slightly from virtual stagnation in 1991, and inflation had stayed subdued.
'The downward trend in interest rates over the past year, lightened debt
burdens and improved consumer and business confidence have contributed to
the revival in activity. Most private sector forecasters predict a moderate,
but sustained, expansion,' the report said.
In Chicago, Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury Secretary, admitted that the economy
had not bounced back as quickly as the administration wanted. He blamed this
on the heavy burden of debt that households and businesses accumulated in
the 1980s. But he said there would be 'solid recovery' in the third quarter,
and predicted far better growth in 1993 and 1994.
The White House's revised forecasts show a budget deficit this year of only
Dollars 333.5bn, much lower than its original estimate of Dollars 400bn. But
Mr Richard Darman, budget office director, said the decline resulted from
Congressional refusal to authorise new funding for the savings and loan
bail-out, and would merely push spending into later years.
Reuter reports from Toronto: Main Canadian banks yesterday cut their prime
lending rates to a 19-year low, easing from 7 to 6.75 per cent.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROSS PEROT is warning that the US 'is on the edge of a severe recession
or depression', avoidable only by adoption of tough measures as soon as
possible.
In his first newspaper interview, with the Los Angeles Times, since dropping
his undeclared presidential candidacy a week ago, the Texas billionaire
promised to keep speaking out, trying to make those seeking public office
face up to economic realities.
His own economic revitalisation proposals would be published, perhaps next
week. These are known to include a five-year plan to balance the budget by
combining sharp rises in consumption taxes and steep cuts in federal
subsidies and entitlements, including social security.
Mr Perot painted a dire picture of prospects for the US, unless decisive
action were taken. 'If we have an economic catastrophe, tens of millions of
ordinary people will be devastated. It will probably take us 20 years to
recover.'
He foresaw the complete collapse of the financial establishment, with banks
and mortgage finance companies all going under.
'Then, if huge numbers of people are out of work, huge numbers will lose
their homes and all the federally guaranteed home mortgages will kick in and
that will have to be paid for, when people don't have work and the tax base
is deteriorating.'

FT  24 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Mexico may impose environmental tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is considering a trade-related 'green tax' to raise
money for environmental enforcement and clean-up, according to a senior
Mexican official.
Mr Santiago Onate, attorney-general for environmental protection, said in
Washington yesterday the government was trying to find a tax permissible
under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'We don't
want to generate some kind of subsidy,' he said. Some sort of user-fee is
likely to be more acceptable.
A 'green tax' would not necessarily fall on polluters, but could be levied
more widely, such as on exports and imports.
Mexico has already begun to spend Dollars 400m (Pounds 209.4m) on a
US-Mexican border clean-up plan, and more funding is expected, Mr Onate
said.
Hundreds of foreign companies have manufacturing plants on the border,
taking advantage of cheap Mexican labour, duty-free exports to the US and
low environmental standards.
But the US Congress has yet to approve funding for the clean-up plan,
although the Bush Administration has given a commitment to participate.
'If the US doesn't want to take charge of its part, then it is too bad for
them,' Mr Onate said.
Although the negotiations for a free trade agreement between the US, Mexico
and Canada appear to be moving toward a conclusion, there is bitterness in
Mexico about a controversial US Supreme Court ruling which upheld the US
kidnapping of a Mexican doctor. Dr Humberto Alvarez Hachain is now awaiting
trial in Los Angeles for his alleged role in the torture of a US drug
enforcement agent.
Joint dispute settlement, environmental action and inspections would have
been 'a very sound idea' before the Supreme Court raised the issue of the US
honouring international law, Mr Onate said.
'We have now a new task, that in order to fulfil actions that in the past
could have been very easy ..now they have to be more clearly designed, the
rules more clearly set and explained to the public.'
Environmental issues may be a key to Congressional approval of a North
American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Onate's message was Mexico's commitment
that all future development must be 'approached within limits of sustainable
growth' and environmental considerations.
The government, he said, had decided to allow all citizens to sue for
damages due to environmental hazards or to file complaints anonymously. If
they wanted, they could accompany environmental inspectors. There would be
no new money next year for additional inspectors, but those employed were
undergoing more rigorous training.

</HEADLINE>

   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESCAPE from jail by Mr Pablo Escobar, the Medelln cocaine cartel chief,
on Wednesday morning has demolished the cornerstone of Colombian President
Cesar Gaviria's anti-drug policy. Mr Escobar's negotiated surrender, just
over a year ago, was hailed as a government victory by most Colombians.
Now a storm of criticism has broken out, with leading politicians calling
for the president's resignation.
Mr Escobar seems to have escaped amid a gun battle while the army's special
forces were trying to recapture the jail, near the city of Medelln. He and
his associates had seized the director of prisons and the deputy justice
minister when they entered the jail on Tuesday evening to tell Mr Escobar
that he and his men were to be transferred.
The Gaviria government's policy of encouraging traffickers to surrender and
confess their crimes, in exchange for lenient sentences and exemption from
extradition to the US, was meant to stop drug terrorism.
The car bombs, assassinations and kidnaps that punctuated the war on drugs
in Colombia did stop after Mr Escobar had surrendered last year.
Mr Escobar seems to have expected to serve a short sentence - perhaps three
years - and go free. But his confession to a single trafficking crime, of
which he had already been convicted in France, made a mockery of the justice
system.
His unwillingness to confess to other crimes, thus breaching the terms of
his surrender agreement, meant he had effectively forfeited the right to
leniency and might have to serve 20 or 30 years.
Mr Gaviria said the government had decided Mr Escobar should be transferred,
having received evidence that he was continuing criminal activities from
jail.
The president has now said that Mr Escobar's life will be respected if he
gives himself up. The fugitive, in a statement last night from somewhere in
the jungle, said he would return to jail if guaranteed a fair trial and if
UN personnel controlled the prison entrance.
Fearful of a revival of the Medelln cartel's drug terrorism, Colombian
politicians are already talking of negotiating a new surrender.
Congress, meanwhile, is set to investigate not only the bungling of the
military operation during the escape but also the absurdity of the luxury in
which Mr Escobar was held.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday ordered a permanent block on new government-backed Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories, but said it would allow completion
of almost 9,000 housing units already under construction.
The move, entrenching last week's temporary new building freeze, was in line
with commitments by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to curb expansion of
settlements, regarded as an obstacle to Middle East peace talks.
But it was sharply criticised by Palestinians for falling short of their
demand for a complete freeze on all building. They said completion of units
under construction meant the settler population could rise by 50 per cent
from its present level of 100,000. 'It is a beginning but it certainly is
not enough,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the previous prime minister, and settler leaders bitterly
condemned the announcement, saying it signalled the abandonment of their
claim to eternal Israeli rule over the occupied territories. 'For me this is
a nightmare,' Mr Shamir said. 'It is impossible that the majority of the
public will not show full opposition to all these measures which may lead
Israel into a labyrinth of significant dangers.'
Officials said Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, had been briefed on
the measures. Israel is optimistic Washington will now approve Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.25bn) in loan guarantees held up because Mr Shamir refused to
freeze settlements.

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE failure of South African business and labour to avert a general strike
next month has set the stage for a period of civil and labour conflict which
could not have come at a worse time.
The strike, on August 3 and 4, and the following days of rallies, marches
and local demonstrations, take place against a background of an economy in
deep recession and a volatile political environment where incidents of
politically related violence continue unabated.
The efforts of business and labour in recent weeks to negotiate a charter
for peace, democracy and economic reconstruction had contributed to a
palpable sense that the political clouds were lifting. The announcement by
President F W de Klerk that the controversial Koevoet and 32 Battalion
military units were being disbanded, and the sending of United Nations
special envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance, to the country contributed further to this
more optimistic mood. Now the country faces a week of mass action,
unprecedented in its scope in recent years, which will severely test the
fragile social fabric.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the African National Congress
(ANC), said yesterday that in failing to reach agreement with the Congress
of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), business had missed an 'historic
opportunity'. He accused them of a 'lack of commitment and resolve to solve
the current crisis'. This view was disputed by the South African Employers'
Consultative Committee on Labour Affairs (Saccola), the umbrella employer
body, which said that 'the breakdown is rooted in our inability to reach
agreement on a total shutdown of all sectors of the economy' - a compromise
discussed for August 3 instead of a week-long strike.
Although the strike will take place, the efforts of business and labour were
not in vain. Agreement failed to materialise when the perception took hold
among the business community that it was giving a lot more than it was
getting. Both parties agree the draft charter represents considerable
progress which can be built upon in future.
The four sections of the charter - curbing violence, combating poverty,
conflict intervention and political transition - would commit business, in
particular, to an unprecedented involvement in addressing the main
constitutional and socio-political challenges facing the country.
Just how successful the mass action campaign will be in putting large
numbers of people onto the streets is a moot point. There is a growing
feeling in the business community that mass action is something of a paper
tiger.
Where mass action does become threatening is in the possibility that it will
fuel further violence. The main concern lies in the potential for clashes
between ANC/Cosatu members, supporting the stayaway, and members of the
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) who are determined to go to work.
Cosatu's mobilisation efforts will not have been assisted by the weakness of
the economy and a 45 per cent unemployment rate. Its policies have also
caused a significant hardening of attitudes among businessmen who feel that
they and the economy have taken about as much as they can.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Arabs seek to regain the initiative on peace: The dramatic
change of political style in Israel has sown confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and LAMIS ANDONI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Arab foreign ministers meet in Damascus this weekend they face the
difficult task of regaining the initiative from a new Israeli government
which has moved with surprising speed to assert its claims as a peacemaker.
Arab states and the Palestinians in particular, while intrigued by
possibilities of progress towards peace, have been discomfited by the
quickfire decisions of Mr Yitzhak Rabin in his first week in office. Arab
officials have tended to bluster as they seek to take account of the
dramatic change in style, if not substance, of the new Israeli
administration.
Mr Rabin's surgical strike at the heart of US concerns, notable curbing
settlements in the occupied territories, has worried the Arabs, aware that
President Bush wants to make his peace with the American Jewish community.
In Damascus, foreign ministers from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and officials of
the Palestine Liberation Organisation are certain to urge the US not to
release loan guarantees for Israel until it has provided a firm commitment
to halt all settlement activity.
Arab foreign ministers will also urge the new Israeli government to commit
itself to negotiations, set to resume possibly as soon as next month in
Washington, within a framework of United Nations Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338 that require Israel to withdraw from land captured
in the 1967 war.
Syria feels especially strongly about the need to re-emphasise the UN
resolutions link to a peace settlement because of concerns that Israel may
seek to relegate the Golan Heights issue to a 'second phase' of the peace
process, while focusing initially on Palestinian autonomy.
Mr Rabin has fuelled these concerns by indicating that his main priority was
a confidence-building self-rule agreement with the Palestinians of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip under the terms of the 1978 Camp David accords which led
to the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty. Damascus believed the agreement
destroyed Arab solidarity and set back chances of regaining the Golan
Heights. Syrian officials this weekend will be intent on trying to ensure
Arab solidarity in the face of Israel's new peace offensive. Both Jordan and
the Palestinians are likely to be left in no doubt about Syrian displeasure
if they should contemplate breaking ranks. A central preoccupation in
Damascus is likely to be what tactics to employ in dealing with the Rabin
government.
If Arab demands are too insistent there would be a danger of undermining the
pro-peace camp inside the Israeli cabinet, and in the Knesset.
Egypt is certain to argue strongly that greater efforts should be made by
the Arabs to encourage the Israeli peace constituency, now that there is a
real prospect of progress.
The Arabs are also being obliged to come to terms with the new reality of a
dramatic transformation in US-Israeli relations. Mr James Baker, the US
secretary of state, made it clear in public remarks during his visit to the
region this week that he believed a new chapter had been opened in relations
with Israel. His Arab interlocutors were left in no doubt who would get the
blame if the fragile process was allowed to collapse. The US is pressing the
Arabs, as a goodwill gesture, to lift the economic boycott on Israel which
has been in force for 44 years.
It is unlikely, however, that such a step would be taken until talks have
resumed, and only then if substantial progress was made. Arab officials have
been saying this week that an end to the boycott will require Arab League
approval, although the decision would not necessarily require the imprimatur
of a full Arab summit. It should become clear after the Damascus meeting
whether Arab scepticism will allow the leap of faith required for quick
progress.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, paid a surprise visit to Lebanon
yesterday after a crucial meeting with Syria's President Hafez al-Assad to
press for Arab co-operation in latest peace efforts, writes Tony Walker.
It was the first visit by a secretary of state to Lebanon since April 1983
when Mr George Shultz went to Beirut after a suicide car bomber killed 16
Americans in an attack on the US embassy.
Mr Baker hinted following his talks with Mr Assad that Middle East peace
negotiations might resume sooner than expected. 'We in the US want the talks
to resume as soon as possible,' he told reporters. Arab and US Officials say
that bilateral negotiations between Israel and its neighbours may reconvene
in Washington next month rather than Rome in September.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Suleiman Franjieh, feudal warlord who became president of
Lebanon: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SULEIMAN Franjieh, the former president of Lebanon and one of the country's
last surviving zaim, or feudal clan leaders, has died of heart failure at
the age of 82.
As head of state from 1970 until 1976, Franjieh presided over the beginning
of Lebanon's civil war in April 1975. The following year, he asked his old
friend, President Hafez Al-Assad of Syria, to send 'peace-keeping' troops to
Lebanon. To the dismay of many of Franjieh's fellow Maronite Catholics, some
40,000 Syrian soldiers remain in Lebanon to this day. Their scheduled
withdrawal to eastern Lebanon this autumn is now the country's main focus of
political tension.
In 1957, Suleiman Franjieh led a murder squad into a church in northern
Lebanon to gun down members of the rival Douaihy clan. Franjieh fled to
Damascus where he forged a life-long friendship with Mr Assad, at that time
an air force officer. A longtime foe of an armed Palestinian presence in
Lebanon, Franjieh sent tanks and aircraft to bombard Palestinian camps near
Beirut in 1973. Despite his violent past, Franjieh was respected as a senior
statesman in the Middle East. Unlike many other Maronite leaders, he always
stressed the importance of Lebanon's Arab identity and good relations with
Syria.
He held court at two homes in the northern Lebanese cities of Zghorta and
Ehden, smoking cigarettes through a black holder and recalling the details
of his long life with surprising lucidity. When he entered hospital in
Beirut recently with heart trouble, his bodyguards occupied a whole floor of
the American University Hospital while the Lebanese president, prime
minister, speaker of the assembly and a host of parliamentarians called to
pay their respects. The life of the 'Lion of Ehden' was repeatedly marred by
violence.
He had groomed his son, Tony, for leadership of the powerful northern
Lebanese family.
Tony Franjieh had established the Marada (Giants) militia. But in 1978, the
leader of the rival Maronite Phalangist militia, Bashir Gemayel, dispatched
gunmen to the family's home in Ehden to massacre Tony Franjieh, his wife,
infant daughter and 30 family retainers.
Suleiman Franjieh harboured untold bitterness towards the Gemayels and the
Phalange.
But in recent years he channelled his hopes and energies into preparing his
grandson Suleiman - Tony's son - to continue the family's political role in
Lebanon.
Young Suleiman served as a minister without portfolio in the last two
Lebanese governments, but resigned in anger last month when Samir Geagea,
the Phalange leader who is believed to have carried out the 1978 Ehden
massacre, arrived at a luncheon given by the Lebanese president Elias Hrawi.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Community spending cut in draft budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community budget ministers yesterday agreed to scale back
Commission spending proposals for 1993, overruling the wishes of poorer
member states.
Ministers agreed that total EC spending should be cut from Ecu63.1bn
(Dollars 85.18bn) this year to Ecu62.9bn in 1993. However, the draft budget
now goes to the European parliament which has the power to make substantial
amendments.
Negotiations over next year's budget are separate from the fierce debate
over the 1993-97 budget proposals going on among foreign and finance
ministers. But wealthier countries are still likely to use yesterday's deal
to back their claim that the EC has money to spare. They say there is no
need to increase the contributions of member states on the scale suggested
by Brussels in its five-year plan.
Proposed expenditure for 1993 would be equivalent to a contribution from
member states of just 1.09 per cent of gross national product - well below
the current revenue ceiling of 1.2 per cent.
The Commission has said the ceiling must be increased to 1.37 per cent by
1997, but richer countries argue there is plenty of 'headroom' under the
current ceiling.
One element in the draft budget likely to be attacked in the European
parliament is the decision to omit a specific figure for the 'cohesion fund'
to help poorer EC economies catch up.
The ministers included a specific line for a cohesion fund in the 1993
draft, but rejected the Commission's suggested figure of Ecu1.56bn, despite
the protests of Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain, which would benefit
most.
The maximum committed spending under the draft agreed yesterday would drop
from Ecu66.6bn this year to Ecu65.7bn in 1993. That compares with the
Commission's proposal that commitments should rise to Ecu69.3bn.
The proposed budget gives effect to the reform of the common agricultural
policy, but will involve cuts in other areas. For example, the European
consumers' organisation has already complained that funding designed for
consumer protection had been halved.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Carrington urges further peace talks

LORD Carrington, the European Community's peace mediator on Yugoslavia,
yesterday made clear he was prepared to go ahead with planned talks next
week with representatives of the three warring factions in Bosnia, in spite
of their failure to respect the latest ceasefire.
His office said a letter had been sent to Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's
Moslem president, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban,
the region's Croat leader, inviting them to London.
Expressing his dismay at the repeated violation by all parties of the
ceasefire agreement signed in London last Friday, Lord Carrington's letter
said the parties could no longer blame each other. 'No one is blameless,' it
said.
In a television interview, Lord Carrington confirmed earlier statements that
he would change his approach to the peace talks. If the warring parties
wanted to come, he would try to focus their attention on working out
constitutional arrangements, rather than first trying to negotiate a
ceasefire agreement.
Referring indirectly to the criticism expressed by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
UN secretary-general, of the lack of co-ordination between the EC and the UN
peacekeeping and peacemaking operations in Bosnia, Lord Carrington said he
had no objection to a widening of the EC peace conference.
It is understood that Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary and current
president of the European Council, gave Mr Boutros Ghali an assurance,
during talks in New York on Wednesday night, that a UN representative would
be welcome to take part in any of the EC-sponsored peace talks.
However, in New York, a UN spokesman emphasised that opposed to the EC peace
conference's plan, endorsed by the Security Council, to place under UN
supervision heavy weapons held by the factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The Security Council last night scheduled further private consultations on
the question.
Meanwhile, Serb irregulars continued to battle with Bosnian Moslem and Croat
forces in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and throughout the republic. The
Serbs are trying to wrest from mainly Croat forces the control of the key
towns of Derventa, Bosanski Brod and Brcko, northern Bosnia, to secure a
corridor linking Serb-controlled territories.
Moslem defenders of Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, again sent radio messages
appealing to the outside world for help. Some 70,000 people have been
trapped in the city, the last Moslem stronghold in Bosnia, for two months.
In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he had written to all his EC partners
asking them to reconsider their reluctance to share the growing refugee
problem equally among all 12 member states. He hit out at his European
partners for being too slow to recognise breakaway Yugoslav republics last
year, but stressed that no western state planned to send combat troops to
end the bloodshed in the region and that the only hope for peace lay in
political pressure.
A Saudi Arabian aircraft yesterday delivered the kingdom's first load of
food and medical supplies to the beleaguered Moslems of Bosnia-Hercegovina,
Reuter reports from Jeddah.
A Saudi defence ministry C-130 transport hurriedly delivered 50 tonnes of
supplies and Dollars 27m in cash to Sarajevo, leaving as mortar shells
exploded near the airport.
Saudi Arabia plans to contribute 35 planeloads of supplies to the airlift.

<TEXT>
THE 'hour of truth' has come for west Germans who believe their expansive
lifestyle can go on unchanged after unification, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
warned yesterday.
Rebuilding the east must have absolute priority over new developments in the
west, he said at a pre-holiday press conference.
'The truth of the matter is that we must use substantial contributions from
our customary yearly earnings increases for the economic and social
reconstruction in the east of our fatherland.'
The economy could no longer afford luxuries such as extravagant pay rises,
earlier retirement, and the shortest machine running times in the west, he
said.
Rejecting tax rises and further state contributions for health and welfare,
he said an answer had to be found to the question: 'How will Germany master
the future?"
Echoing Mr Kohl's concerns, an independent council of advisers to the
economics ministry yesterday suggested the answer was 'unpopular cuts'.
Total state debt of DM1,300bn (Pounds 448.2bn) would rise to DM1,900bn by
the end of 1995, it said. Bonn, the federal states and local authorities
must cut spending, pay must be restrained, and privatisation speeded up. If
these policies were not carried through, tax increases were the 'second
option'.
Recent government austerity proposals have run into strong resistance
outside the ruling coalition group. A plan to cut state subsidies to the
health service by DM11bn a year - by freezing drugs prices, reducing the
number of registered doctors and increasing patients' charges - has hit
opposition from all groups.
However, Mr Kohl pointed out, health care payments were growing at twice the
rate of contributions.
A scheme to pay for care of the elderly by withholding sick pay for the
first day of absence from work has stirred strikes among union members. The
4m-strong IG Metall metalworkers' union has promised national strikes after
the summer break.
Mr Kohl said progress in the east would be slower and more costly than first
thought, although recent forecasts suggest accelerating growth of just under
3 per cent for the whole of Germany next year.
The first signs of an easing in price increases came yesterday from North
Rhine Westphalia, which reported nil month-on-month growth in July and an
annual rate of increase of 3.3 per cent. This is one percentage point below
the national figure of 4.3 per cent for June.

POLAND'S tight monetary policies are coming under threat from the country's
most serious waves of industrial unrest since economic changes began three
years ago.
As strikes by coal and copper ore miners continue, an important western
investor, Fiat, is also faced with a stoppage for the first time. Workers at
the FSM plant in Tychy, which is being sold to the Italian motor group, went
on strike on Wednesday to demand higher wages.
The strike followed a stoppage which started on Monday by some 40,000
workers at the copper-producing combine at Lubin in western Poland. The
miners are demanding a 30 per cent wage rise, which can only be paid if the
government eases tough wage controls.
Ms Hanna Suchocka, the new prime minister, told the senate, parliament's
second chamber, yesterday that the government would not permit settlements
which 'would favour one group of workers at the cost of other groups'.
A strike also began at the Zofiowka coal mine, one of the largest pits in
the Rybnik mining region in southern Poland.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Temporary reprieve for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALM RETURNED to the financial markets yesterday as the pound enjoyed a
temporary respite and a survey provided a glimmer of hope for economic
recovery.
A survey of almost 9,000 companies by the British Chambers of Commerce found
that the economic trend 'remained towards a slow and lasting recovery'
although the BCC warned that it would take little to knock the upturn off
course.
Sterling finished half a pfennig higher at DM2.8375 in London - boosted
mainly by technical factors but buoyed also by the government's announcement
on Wednesday of tighter controls on spending - while in New York it closed
at DM2.8426.
However, a rise in Spain's key interest rate yesterday to 13 per cent from
12.4 per cent means that sterling's woes may not be over. The move by the
Bank of Spain leaves Britain as one of the few members of the European
monetary system which has not tightened monetary policy in the wake of last
week's rise in the German discount rate.
Labour stepped up its criticism on the planned changes to the public
spending round, accusing the government of trying to use them to distract
from the impact on spending of continuing economic stagnation.
Opposition spokesmen promised a detailed and sustained attack as they warned
that, despite Tory election pledges, public services would be 'sacrificed on
the altar of their own economic incompetence'.
The Engineering Employers Federation revised downwards sharply its forecasts
for UK growth this year and 1993 amid reduced expectations for UK and world
recovery.
An update to the EEF's engineering economic trends series confirmed that
engineering output had stopped falling but pushed back by about six months
the expected start of its recovery.
However, share prices closed firmer with Boots' price rising 4 per cent
after an optimistic trading statement from Sir Christopher Benson, chairman
of the diversified retailing group.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Mellor weathers deluge of media criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUG-OF-WAR over the future of Mr David Mellor, the national heritage
secretary, remained as ferocious as ever last night - five days after the
first revelations of his relationship with an actress.
As several national newspapers pressed for his resignation, Mr John Major,
the prime minister, again let it be known that his backing for his friend
and colleague remained uninfluenced by a new deluge of 'revelations' in the
popular press.
Senior Conservatives believe, however, that the next few days may prove
critical for the embattled minister. As one said last night: 'If there are
no new developments, then he may be able to weather it. But he is not yet
out of the woods.'
The warning came as the first Conservative MP to call publicly for the
minister's resignation emerged yesterday. Mrs Ann Winterton, MP for
Congleton, told a BBC interviewer that Mr Mellor now had 'only one option'.
Her argument was contradicted by at least one Tory backbencher who, while
accepting that an MP's behaviour was of 'public interest', argued that the
question was not a resignation matter.
Elsewhere, Sir David English, the editor in chief of the
Conservative-supporting Associated Newspapers group, said that the
minister's position had become impossible. 'He has been moved from the
minister of fun to a figure of fun, a figure of ridicule,' he said.
In spite of the pressure, it was clear that several senior Conservatives,
close to the prime minister, believe that the heritage secretary should and
could brave out the storm.
Increasingly the question has become a trial of strength between Fleet
Street and Downing Street as the government has attempted to bring to an end
a long history of resignations provoked by allegations of impropriety in
ministers' private lives. The broadening of the controversy into a
discussion of what is and is not an acceptable degree of press intrusion
into politicians' personal lives has only hardened the stances of both
sides.
Most observers at Westminster believe that whatever happens to Mr Mellor,
the row has postponed indefinitely any prospect of the government
introducing new privacy legislation.
The row has also unveiled the conservative nature of the British public.
Commentators noted that in a BBC Radio 4 phone-in programme on Tuesday, a
larger proportion of callers than might have been expected were highly
critical of the minister's behaviour.
That appeared to be confirmed yesterday by a telephone opinion poll
conducted for ITV's Oracle teletext service. That showed 74 per cent of
respondents arguing that Mr Mellor should be dismissed, against 26 per cent
who thought he should stay.
Tabloid newspapers have also consistently claimed that public opinion
supports their detailed reporting of the relationship.
In an interview in today's Independent newspaper Miss Antonia de Sancha, the
actress with whom Mr Mellor is alleged to have had an affair, said she was
considering legal action against newspapers which had told lies about her.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Smith's new team has younger image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHADOW cabinet assumes a more youthful image after yesterday's election
of five new faces to serve under Mr John Smith and his deputy Ms Margaret
Beckett on Labour's 18-strong frontbench team.
Four of the five newcomers are in their early forties. The changes reflect
the meritocratic, as opposed to ideological, nature of Labour's 69 new MPs
whose votes played a critical role in the three-month election process.
Two of the newcomers - Ms Harriet Harman and Ms Marjorie Mowlam - were
women, bringing to five the overall female representation on the body. This
is the highest number ever.
Ms Harman, MP for Peckham, and Mr Chris Smith, MP for Islington South and
Finsbury, also bring an injection of southern blood into a party
increasingly identified with Scotland, Wales and the north of England.
The other two newcomers, Mr David Blunkett, a former leader of Sheffield
council, and Mr Tom Clarke, the Scottish junior health spokesman, will prove
popular choices among more traditional Labour supporters.
By contrast, the outgoing shadow cabinet members who contested the poll  -
Mr Barry Jones and Ms Jo Richardson - are widely identified with an
increasingly old-fashioned image of the party.
Top of the poll were Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair. Each is expected to
be rewarded with a top job, with Mr Brown thought certain to be named shadow
chancellor and Mr Blair set to be home affairs spokesman.
The full list of shadow cabinet appointments is expected to be published
today.
Senior portfolios are expected to go to Mr Robin Cook, shadow health
secretary and Mr Smith's campaign manager, and Mr Jack Cunningham, until now
campaigns co-ordinator. They are expected to contest the role of shadow
foreign affairs spokesman vacated by Mr Gerald Kaufman.
Welcoming the appointments yesterday, Mr Smith singled out the success of
his cabinet's female members.
'The Labour party now has more women in senior positions than any British
political party in history,' he said.
Other successful candidates pledged to start working immediately towards
ensuring that the party wins the next general election.
'Now we have a new leadership in place, we will be able to roll up our
sleeves and get stuck into the government,' said an ebullient Mr Chris
Smith.

THE CONFRONTATION between Iraq and the United Nations hardened yesterday as
a senior Iraqi minister vowed continuing defiance and as President George
Bush called in his national security advisers for talks on the crisis.
After the White House meeting of military chiefs, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the
president's spokesman, said: 'All options remain open.'
At the same time, Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the US
presidency, said he would support US use of force against Iraq if the UN
deemed it necessary. He warned Iraq's President Saddam Hussein that his
election battle against Mr Bush would not deflect Washington from making
Iraq comply with the terms of Gulf war ceasefire last year.
'Let Saddam Hussein make no mistake. Even during an election campaign,
Americans are united on this issue. Saddam Hussein should understand clearly
that we will not tolerate his defiance of UN resolutions,' Mr Clinton said
in a statement.
US officials suspect the Iraqi president's defiance rests partly on a belief
that the US would not launch military action against Iraq in the middle of a
divisive election campaign. Mr Clinton's assurance will be welcomed by
President Bush if it demonstrates to Mr Saddam that there is bipartisan
support in the US for the administration's firm stance.
The US Defence Department confirmed yesterday that it had cancelled port
visits in the Mediterranean for the aircraft carrier Saratoga and three
other warships, apparently strengthening the administration's threat to use
force.
But Mr Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said the decision was 'based
on the situation in Yugoslavia'. Officials in Washington would not be drawn
on whether the vessels - now said to be in the central Mediterranean - had
been alerted for possible action.
The White House warned on Wednesday that it could not rule out the use of
force if Baghdad continued to defy a team of UN weapons inspectors seeking
to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special commission charged with the task,
warned in a US television interview yesterday that the confrontation could
swiftly reach 'endgame', voicing growing fears for the safety of his
70-strong inspection team in Iraq.
The allies appear to be pursuing a carefully calibrated increase of military
and political pressure with echoes of the allied build-up before the Gulf
war of January 1991 - and eliciting a familiar Iraqi response.
In Baghdad yesterday, Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, told a news
conference: 'Iraq will not concede its sovereignty, will not accept any
insult, will not allow the inspection teams to threaten its national
security and will not allow . . . any other person affiliated with the UN to
interfere in its internal affairs. The threats and all what they are doing
will not change the Iraqi position.'
None of the western allies appears in a hurry to implement threats. Top
officials at the Defence Department in Washington are known to harbour
doubts about the likely effectiveness of a limited military strike.
Nor do Bush campaign officials appear convinced that military action against
Iraq offers good chances of success. Mr Bush's military advisers are
reported to have warned that they can offer no prospect of ousting President
Saddam from power without full deployment of a larger force than that used
during Operation Desert Storm last year.
They are also perplexed by the difficulty of finding targets for a limited
air strike that would do enough to change Mr Saddam's behaviour, while not
wreaking undue suffering on the civilian population.
Campaign officials fear a raid that leaves Mr Saddam unshaken would further
erode the political credit that Mr Bush originally won during Desert Storm.
To complicate matters further, the US is having trouble reconciling
disagreements between its allies on whether any military strike should be
massive or limited in scale.
Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, voiced caution yesterday,
saying he thought Iraq would probably bow to pressure in the end. 'Above
all, we have to see how Iraq reacts,' he said. 'It is not the first time in
this period of two years that Saddam Hussein has rebelled against UN work on
the spot. We have had difficult times. Last year, in the same circumstances,
the Baghdad authorities refused access to some places to UN experts . . .
and finally Iraq gave way.'

FT  24 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of government help
lift Nikkei above 16,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices rebounded on news that the government would meet to discuss the
stock market slump, and the Nikkei average, which had dropped to a six-year
low on Wednesday, moved back above the 16,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average jumped 497.99 to 16,039.94. The weakness on overseas
markets prompted arbitrage selling in the morning, pulling the index down to
the day's low of 15,333.00. An announcement by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, that the government will hold an emergency meeting today to
discuss support measures for the market triggered buying in the futures
markets, and the Nikkei advanced to the session's high of 16,084.30.
In spite of the sharp rally in prices, volume dipped from 272m shares to
250m. Rises led declines by 614 to 339, with 150 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks gained 22.07 to 1,227.82, and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.42 to 965.80.
The futures index surged as investors rushed to cover short positions,
prompting arbitrage buying and bargain hunting in the cash market. Most
participants were encouraged by Mr Miyazawa's announcement.
However, some investors were sceptical about the outcome. 'There was some
relief in the market, but if there is nothing new decided at the emergency
meeting, the market may go down,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Life.
Analysts said measures to boost the economy were needed to lift sentiment.
'It is not up to the cabinet to decide on monetary policy, so the effects of
the meeting on the market are questionable,' said Mr Yuichi Kohashi,
strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Stocks heavily depressed on Wednesday recouped losses. High-technology
issues, which were lower on earnings worries, advanced. NEC put on Y19 to
Y804 and Fujitsu Y11 to Y580.
Dealers once again sought speculative theme stocks for short-term trading
purposes. Meiji Milk Products, the day's most active issue, climbed Y37 to
Y932 and Taiyo Fishery gained Y25 to Y460.
Banks were also firmer, with Industrial Bank of Japan appreciating Y10 to
Y1,640 and Sakura Bank Y33 to Y949.
In Osaka, the OSE average recovered 248.41 to 18,190.94, rising for the
first time in six days. Volume remained flat at 23m shares. Roundup
THE STEEPEST fall among the region's markets yesterday was registered by
Taiwan, which ended at its lowest level since January last year.
TAIWAN's weighted index lost 175.93, or 4.2 per cent, at 3,978.87, but after
an intraday low of 3,954. Turnover expanded to TDollars 30.35bn from
Wednesday's TDollars 18.57bn.
Some analysts said the setback reflected the slowdown in economic growth and
lack of confidence for company earnings in the second half of the year.
HONG KONG declined by 1.5 per cent amid uncertainties over a dispute between
China and Britain regarding the financing of a new airport. The Hang Seng
index shed 93.28 to 5,917.16. Turnover increased to HKDollars 3.50bn from
Tuesday's HKDollars 3.13bn. The market was closed on Wednesday because of a
typhoon.
Banks generally lost ground, with HSBC finishing 50 cents down at HKDollars
54 and Bank of East Asia HKDollars 1 off at HKDollars 37.
SINGAPORE was broadly lower, with shipyard issues falling in late trading.
The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 12.25 to 1,424.65 in volume of
47.13m shares, against 45.83m. Declines outpaced gains by 153 to 53.
SEOUL retreated after a two-day advance. The composite stock index closed
7.47 off at 518.53 in turnover of Won170.5bn, after Won162.9b.
Sunkyong and Yukong, which are among companies bidding for South Korea's
second mobile telecommunications contract, moved ahead by Won800 and
Won1,000 respectively to Won20,400 and Won24,900.
MANILA staged a further improvement, helped by gains in the oil sector. The
composite index ended 16.97 higher at 1,470.76. Oil issues showed rises
ranging from 6 per cent to 13 per cent, while the oil index advanced by 10
per cent. Combined turnover contracted to 275m pesos from 313.7m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR declined on profit-taking. The composite index lost 6.55 to
602.24 in turnover down to MDollars 121.8m from MDollars 166.1m. Falls
overwhelmed rises by 227 to 50.
AUSTRALIA recovered from a poor start to close modestly higher on balance
after trading dominated by the debut of GIO, the former New South Wales
government insurer. The All Ordinaries index ended 3.5 ahead at 1,610.7.
GIO accounted for 15 per cent of the day's turnover of ADollars 239.5m. It
opened at ADollars 2.68, a 28-cent premium to the issue price, but fell to
close at ADollars 2.53 after volume of 17.8m shares.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index slid 16.31 to 1,552.20 as a result of weakness
on Wall Street. BOMBAY fell sharply, the BSE index finishing 139.78, or 4.96
per cent, weaker at 2,678.34.

BOURSES were mostly lower yesterday, as Spain raised its interest rates,
writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID reacted calmly to the 0.6 point rise in the benchmark money market
rate to 13 per cent, although the rise exceeded some analysts' forecasts.
The general index closed down 2.07 at 214.03 and turnover was estimated to
be low.
Santander's 17.4 per cent increase in first half figures pleased investors
although its shares lost Pta40 to Pta3,795, in line with the market. Among
construction stocks, FCC lost another Pta310, or 4.5 per cent to Pta5,990,
while Telefonica gained Pta5 to Pta1,040 on US buying.
FRANKFURT slid into negative territory late in the session. Having seen a
day's high of 1,647.48 the DAX ended 4.85 lower at 1,623.76, while at
midsession the FAZ was 0.28 weaker at 648.76. Turnover fell to DM6.1bn from
DM6.3bn.
Disappointing first half retail sales data contributed to pessimism with the
publication of a 2 per cent fall in western Germany.
Early gains made by blue chips were lost by the close. Siemens, which rose
as high as DM632, closed 20 pfg lower at DM623.10 and Daimler finished down
DM2.50 at DM703 after an intraday high of DM713.80. Chemical stocks were
vulnerable, with BASF down DM4.20 at DM216.50 and Hoechst DM3.60 lower at
DM229.40. One of the day's major losers was Linde which shed DM20 or 2.6 per
cent to DM753.
PARIS endured another day of volatile trading to finally end higher after
after falling for seven consecutive trading days. The CAC 40 index rose 7.07
to 1,734.56 in turnover estimated at FFr2.5bn.
News that Euro Disney expects to make a net loss in its fiscal year ending
September 30 was greeted with a rise of 15 centimes in the stock to FFr97.4.
The stock had fallen earlier in the week in anticipation of the
announcement.
The cement maker Lafarge Coppee gained FFr6.10 to FFr305 on the back of
pleasing second quarter results from its US subsidiary. Another gainer was
Havas up FFr14.60 or 3.3 per cent to FFr455.50 in reasonable volume.
Among the losers were BSN down a further FFr14 to FFr1,045 and L'Oreal down
FFr6 to FFr903. Higher interest rates in Spain unsettled Carrefour, the
retailer with Iberian interests, which fell FFr7 to FFr2,517.
MILAN fell further as strong selling overwhelmed attempts to trigger a
technical recovery. The Comit index fell 1.69 to 408.07 in turnover
estimated at near Wednesday's L113.4bn.
Fiat fell L12 to L4,530 and Generali dropped L250 to L26,150.
OSLO recovered but there were few fresh factors to stimulate trading. The
all-share index rose 2.61 to 376.50 in low turnover of NKr141.5m.
Norsk Hydro, due to publish its first half results on Monday, added NKr2 to
NKr147.
BRUSSELS fell in low turnover of BFr721m on the first day of the new forward
accounting period. The Bel-20 index lost 5.46 to 1,139.89.
Petrofina rose BFr25 to BFr10,775 with 8,840 shares traded while BBL
advanced BFr20 to BFr3,480.
VIENNA fell to its lowest-ever close as the 18-share ATX index lost 17.59 or
2.1 per cent to 794.36. News of a 15.7 per cent decline in first half
operating profits at the building materials group Wienerberger led the
market lower. Wienerberger's shares fell Sch200 to Sch4,100.
STOCKHOLM saw its lowest closing level since January 1991 following an
increase in short-term interest rates. The Affarsvarlden index fell 12.1 to
839.4 in turnover of SKr388m from SKr292m.
Among actives Astra B shares slipped SKr2 to SKr520 and Volvo B declined
SKr4 to Skr330.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index closed down 0.3 at 116.2. Among active stocks
Akzo lost Fl 2.20 to Fl 138 while Elsevier bucked the trend, gaining Fl 1.10
to Fl 106.40.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: West needed to plug leaks in
former Soviet oil sector - Neil Buckley begins a three-part series
explaining why foreign investment is vital to an industry in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VAST oil and gas reserves of the former Soviet Union have been the talk
of the western oil industry for more than two years, but several recent
events have added a new impetus to the great oil rush to the east.
In the space of two months came potentially the two largest deals yet struck
with a former Soviet republic, Kazakhstan; Mr Boris Yeltsin's appeal to the
G7 to write off a chunk of Russia's debt in return for a share of its
natural resource; visits to the West by several high-ranking Russian
officials seeking more investment; and the announcement of Russia's first
government-backed oil industry trade fair in Tatarstan in October.
Russia has adopted the hard sell: in Tatarstan, data packages will be
available for perusal, and helicopters will be ready to whisk western
delegates off to the oilfields.
The slide in Russia's oil output has also focused attention on the sorry
state of its industry. As Mr Vasili Fedorchenko, an energy expert from
Russia's supreme economic council and a former head of a Siberian oil
enterprise, impressed on a meeting of London oil executives and financiers
last week: 'If there is no reinvestment in the oil industry, it will
collapse. To hesitate is to die.'
The size of the former Soviet republics' reserves is staggering. They have
43 trillion (million million) cubic metres of natural gas, or two-and-a-half
times as much as any other country. The republics also hold the world's
seventh largest reserves of oil, at 58bn barrels.
These, moreover, are known reserves. In many areas only the top geological
layer has been explored, with just 5 per cent of discovered oil and 12 per
cent of gas at depths exceeding 3 km (1.86 miles). In the lower strata,
there could be much more. Experts believe there is a high probability of
discovering other giant or supergiant fields.
The Russian Federation holds 90 per cent of proven reserves, with 70 per
cent in the Tyumen region of western Siberia. But significant quantities are
also to be found in Kazakhstan - sometimes tipped to be a new Kuwait - and
in Azerbaijan, as well as other republics such as Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan.
The energy sector received the bulk of investment in industry through to the
1980s, turning the Soviet Union into the biggest producer of both oil and
gas in the world. At its peak, in 1988, it produced 12.7m barrels a day -
equivalent to more than half of the combined output of members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Gas production reached 740bn
cu m in 1989 - more than the next six largest producers combined.
Oil and exports accounted for nearly half the Soviet Union's foreign
currency income.
Since then, production has slumped. Oil output is estimated by the
International Energy Agency to have fallen to 9.3m b/d for the second
quarter of this year, and is still falling.
The blame for the decline lies partly with unbalanced development. Funds
were poured into boosting output in the maturing Volga-Urals fields in the
1950s and 1960s when more should have gone into developing new discoveries
in western Siberia. When attention shifted, belatedly, into Siberia, the
Volga-Urals region was allowed to decline more rapidly than it should have.
Fields were also over-pumped with inadequate technology. Clumsy water
injection to lift oil has left some fields waterlogged.
The most immediate cause of the output decline is, however, rapidly falling
investment. In 1989 the oil and gas industry received Rbs12.9bn; last year,
Mr Fedorchenko said, it was Rbs8.7bn. This has forced the industry to cut
back drastically on exploration needed to sustain the industry. More than
100 drilling teams were disbanded between 1988 and 1991, and total drilling
dropped from 5.1m metres, to 3.8m.
Meanwhile, enterprises can no longer afford - or even obtain - replacements
for ageing equipment and infrastructure. The main equipment plants are in
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ukraine (the principal supplier of pipelines and
tubing), which all became independent states with the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and are now demanding close to world prices for their goods.
Key equipment prices have risen by between four and 22 times, Mr Fedorchenko
says, while some producing associations have been supplied with less than
half the equipment they needed.
The pipeline situation is especially acute. Some estimates show that more
than 10 per cent of oil and gas leaks from the 300,000 km of pipeline in the
former Soviet Union. This can have serious environmental and safety
implications. In June 1989, gas leaking from a pipeline beside a railway
line exploded as two trains were passing near Ufa, in the Urals, killing 600
people.
An adviser to the Russian energy ministry told last week of obsolete
pipelines being dug out of the ground and re-used in new locations, because
of the shortage of new piping.
The tasks - and the opportunities - for foreign companies and investors are
immense.
Paradoxically, however, many observers consider the most important task to
be investment in energy-saving technology rather than in the oil industry
itself. Russia expends nearly twice as much energy per head of population as
western countries, and must cut its own consumption if it is to reap maximum
benefits from its energy industry.
In the oil industry, western experts suggest a three-pronged approach is
necessary.
A first, relatively easy step, is improving field management, and retraining
engineers and managers. Simply by 'tweaking' equipment, some experts suggest
output could be raised by 10 per cent or more.
The second step is for western companies to become involved in boosting
production from existing fields. Mr Sergei Roginko, a member of acting
Russian prime minister Mr Yegor Gaidar's secretariat, said in London this
week that the introduction of western technology could double the production
possible with Russian technology in many cases. Elsewhere, where fields have
been damaged or waterlogged, whole new seismic and drilling programmes may
be needed.
The third step is the development of new fields, and exploration for more.
The attractions of such developments are clear but so, too, are the
pitfalls. Not the least of the latter is the remoteness of some fields and
the huge investment required in infrastructure and communications.
Ironically, some fields are so large only a drastic upturn in the western
oil industry, and in oil prices and demand, could allow even western
companies to consider developing them.
Further articles in this series will be published on July 31, looking at the
improving commercial climate for foreign investors; and on August 7,
covering deals signed so far with western companies.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Philippines to allow sugar
imports on raised tariff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINES is lifting restrictions on the importation of sugar, even
though the country is a major producer of the commodity.
Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, confirmed the move this week
despite local producers' and millers' protests at sugar's inclusion among 43
items listed in an import liberalisation plan published last month. The
protests had prompted a review by a government panel.
The lifting of restrictions will coincide with an increase in the import
tariff on sugar from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, which is expected to take
effect in October.
Last week sugar industry leaders presented a petition to Mr Ramos seeking
increased import tariffs on sugar, both raw and refined, and on artificial
sweeteners.
Mr Ramos had declared that his government, installed on June 30, would move
towards greater deregulation of domestic industries and privatisation of
more state enterprises. He said last week, however: 'Some basic industries
in the Philippines need time to become more competitive through the
acquisition of newer equipment and the development of better processes'.
Sugar Industry leaders say that prices of sugar currently being offered in
the world market are lower by up to 60 per cent than the average cost of
production in the Philippines. The 75 per cent import tariff on raw sugar
will be returned to 50 per cent in 1995.
The Philippines is expected to produce some 2.1m tonnes of sugar in the crop
year ending this August. Domestic consumption is estimated at some 1.6m
tonnes and the country's quota in the US, its traditional market for sugar,
is now down to only 178,380 tonnes. Industry leaders say exports to the
world market are inevitable.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia's state mining
corporation to make hundreds redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMIBOL, BOLIVIA'S loss-making state mining corporation has embarked on a
big redundancy programme prompted in part by the World Bank. The move is
widely expected to trigger widespread industrial action.
The corporation currently employs some 6,158 workers. To date, 304 have been
issued with redundancy letters, all of them in administration. Mining
minster Alvaro Rejas said further redundancies could take place within
Comibol's administration 'because it is a huge bureaucracy'.
However, 526 miners in San Jose, formerly a tin mine, but currently
producing uneconomic amounts of silver and lead, are also expected to go.
The threatened San Jose job losses have been described by the COB, the
Confederation of Bolivian Unions, as 'unacceptable'. COB is currently
organising a 48-hour general strike due to begin on Monday.
Comibol was partly forced into announcing the redundancies by the World
Bank, which has been withholding a Dollars 22m credit to restructure the
corporation in protest at the slow pace of change.
The World Bank credit was first extended in 1989. Its aim was to revitalise
and modernise the Bolivian mining sector, which had been hard hit by the
collapse in tin prices in 1985. Rather than opt for full scale
privatisation, which remains unconstitutional, the Bolivian government
instead saw Comibol's future in joint ventures with private enterprises. The
corporation was to concentrate on overseeing exploration, exploitation and
leasing contracts and curtail its loss-making mining operation.
Over 21,000 employees have been shed since 1985. However, the move towards
joint ventures since 1991 has been slow. Although the first joint venture
agreement was signed last December with Compania de Minerales Especializados
(Cominesa), a number of mining companies interested in joint ventures with
Comibol backed off. These include the Bolivian company Bartos and
Anglo-Irish group PanAndean. Perhaps even worse, the latest joint venture
deal, signed by Mineraco Taboca, a subsidiary of the Brazilian group
Paranapanema, resulted in strike action by the local miners.
An assessment is being made of Comibol's restructuring needs and a full
report is expected by the end of this year. The process has been slowed by
long strikes at the end of last year, in January, and localised action
recently.
Comibol blamed its first quarter loss this year of Dollars 2.7m on
industrial action.
However, the mining picture in Bolivia as a whole is far from bleak. The
Medium Mines Association, an umbrella organisation which includes a number
of US subsidiaries, has diversified away from tin and invested in modern
machinery and methods. Inti Raimy, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold, is
to invest Dollars 710m in its gold and silver operations here. Cyprus
Minerals is hopeful about signing exploration deals with Comibol covering
the huge Los Lipez region. RTZ recently uncovered Pucionorte, a gold deposit
which will be exploited by Comsur, Bolivia's largest private mining
enterprise.
Bolivian mining in general has enjoyed growth of between 14 and 53 per cent
from 1987 to 1990. Perhaps due to the worldwide recession, growth last year
was down to 2 per cent. Comibol's production actually rose by 20 per cent in
1991, but its share in Bolivia's overall production continues to slip - from
63 per cent of the total in 1980 to 27 per cent last year.
There is no escaping the fact that Bolivian mining still faces serious
labour, bureaucracy and infrastructure difficulties. Comibol in particular
has been unable to adapt, as the Medium Mines have done, to new market
conditions quickly enough.
The government, however, remains committed to the restructuring of Comibol.
The question is: how quickly should it be done? As Mr Rejas, the mining
minister, explains: 'You have to understand that this period of
transformation requires time. Our country has had a very static mining

THE ANC's threat of strikes in South Africa prompted a sharp bounce in the
PLATINUM price yesterday, following substantial falls earlier this week. The
afternoon fixing in London saw the price at Dollars 383.40 a troy ounce, up
Dollars 6.15 from Wednesday's fix, though it drifted lower in later trading.
Meanwhile the GOLD price, having been fixed at a fresh 7-month high of
Dollars 359.50 an ounce, eased back to close at Dollars 358.75 an ounce,
down 50 cents on the day. Gold chart patterns still looked positive,
analysts said, noting the lack of stiff resistance up to Dollars 370 an
ounce. Jitters in the financial markets and the dollar's recent plunge to
near record lows against the mark had sent funds surging into the metal,
they added. COCOA prices built on this week's rally, with London's September
futures position ending at Pounds 599 a tonne, up Pounds 14. Dealers
attributed the advance to speculative buying and the continued absence of
producer selling, underpinned by the Ghanaian cocoa workers strike and dry
weather in the Ivory Coast. Most London Metal Exchange contracts lost some
of Wednesday's gains. The main exception was TIN, which rose another Dollars
72.50 in the cash position to Dollars 7,120 a tonne.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Issues unresolved as cocoa pact
talks draw to a close
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE WEEKS of negotiat-ions on a new international cocoa agreement are set
to end today, with producers and consumers still far apart on key issues.
There has been tacit acceptance by producing countries of the withholding
scheme for stabilising prices proposed by consumers. But there has been no
meeting of minds on the price level to be defended, the amount of cocoa to
be withheld from the market, or how the scheme is to be financed.
Delegates from the 40 member countries of the International Cocoa
Organisation (ICCO) have agreed to return to Geneva for two weeks at the
beginning of November for a third attempt to finalise an agreement. The
current pact, negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (Unctad), expires in September 1993.
Producers want the new accord to defend a price range of SDR1,485-2,155 per
tonne, with a median price of SDR1,820, or just over Pounds 1,400. This is
more than double current market levels. The present cocoa pact's inability
to defend the same price range led to the suspension of buffer stock
operations in 1988.
Consumers are proposing a range of SDR800-1,200 a tonne, with a median price
of SDR1,000 (about Pounds 770). This corresponds to the average market price
over the four years since 1988.
Producers this week conceded that a ceiling could be imposed on withholding
levels. But the 600,000 tonne limit proposed by Mr Kouame N'Guessan of the
Ivory Coast, which he argues would enable the accord to defend a bottom
price level of SDR1,400 Pounds 1,078) a tonne, is twice that envisaged by
consumers.
Consuming countries want tough production controls from the start of the new
accord to bring supply and demand into better balance. Both sides have
agreed in principle to the establishment of a producer committee within the
ICCO to co-ordinate a 'production management programme'. But producers claim
that output curbs will not start to bite for three to four years.
On financing, consumers want the cost to be met first from the payment of
arrears, then by controlled sales from the existing 240,000 tonne buffer
stock and only later, under certain conditions, by a levy on cocoa trade as
proposed by producers. The ICCO's biggest debtors are the Ivory Coast and
Brazil, the two largest producers.

FT  24 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian companies face credit
rating scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREDIT standing of Italy's two biggest state holding companies was
yesterday put under review for a possible downgrade by Moody's and Standard
&amp; Poor's, the two leading international rating agencies.
The scrutiny of ENI and IRI marks the latest sign of concern in the
international financial community over the break-up of Efim, another Italian
state holding company. Italian authorities have said that Efim and its
subsidiaries will not service their debts for up to two years while the
group's assets are sold off.
'That happening to one of the leading holding companies has to make you ask
about the others,' said an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's.
Both credit rating agencies said their review was prompted by the Italian
government's moves to restructure the state's industrial holdings, as well
as the deferral of interest payments by Efim.
IRI and ENI have the highest credit ratings from the two agencies for their
short-term debt, neither have long-term debt ratings. The ratings are in the
names of their fund-raising arms, Cofiri International and ENI International
Bank.
Standard &amp; Poor's said it may downgrade its ratings of Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro and Banco di Napoli, and it has switched the outlook of Banco
Commerciale Italiana, from stable to negative.
Moody's said in early June that it may downgrade Italy's state debt.
Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday reaffirmed its ratings for the republic. IRI,
the main state holding company, and ENI, the oil concern, have both been
converted into joint stock companies in preparation for possible
privatisation.

FT  24 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Shearson to take Dollars 84m
charge
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and securities subsidiary
of American Express, is planning to write down a substantial portion of a
three-year-old bridge loan to Prime Computer. It will record an Dollars 84m
second-quarter extraordinary debit as a result.
The after-tax Dollars 84m charge stems from a decision by Shearson to take a
Dollars 137m pre-tax write-down on a Dollars 500m bridge loan extended to
Prime in 1989. The bridge loan, like many others at the time, was to have
been converted into junk bonds, but this proved impossible when the junk
market collapsed.
The write-down is something of an embarrassment for Shearson, which only a
few months ago said it considered the loan as 'money good'.
In 1989, the bridge was originally part of a Dollars 1.3bn leveraged buy-out
of the Massachusetts computer company, which was acquired by Whitney &amp;
Company, a New York venture capital firm backed by Shearson Lehman.
At the time of the loan, Shearson and its parent, American Express, jointly
invested Dollars 66m in buying an equity stake in DR Holdings, the vehicle
used by Whitney to acquire Prime. Last autumn, Shearson wrote down the value
of its Dollars 66m equity stake to Dollars 10m
In 1991, after the plan to refinance the bridge loan by converting it into
junk bonds failed, Shearson converted it from a cash repayment obligation
into a payment-in-kind security, meaning that accrued interest of about
Dollars 70m was added to the original loan.
The Shearson decision to write down the value of the loan comes a few weeks
after Prime, advised by Lehman Brothers, revised the terms of a share offer
aimed at raising Dollars 300m by the sale of nearly 16m shares at a price
between Dollars 18 and Dollars 20 per share. The revised offer will be for
20m shares at a price of between Dollars 14 and Dollars 16.

FT  24 JUL 92 / International Bonds: American Express arrives with
card-backed issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express yesterday launched its anticipated Dollars 1bn global issue
of bonds backed by charge-card debt, the first securitisation by the US
financial services group.
The issue was structured in equal tranches of five-year and seven-year
paper. The bonds carry a top triple-A credit rating on the basis of Dollars
55m subordinated bonds, which will absorb any losses on the underlying
charge card loans.
The shorter-dated bonds will be priced today to yield between 42 and 44
basis points over US Treasury bonds. The long-dated tranche will yield
between 45 and 47 basis points over Treasuries.
Outstanding bonds backed by credit-card debt trade on a yield spread of over
50 basis points. Hence, the indicated pricing was seen as aggressive by new
issue managers and likely to appeal only to US investors. However,
participants in the deal reported steady buying in Europe and the Far East.
Lehman Brothers, which lead-managed the transaction Express, said the
tighter pricing was justified by the characteristics of the underlying
charge-card loans.
For example, American Express card-holders cannot maintain unpaid balances,
so the pool of assets which backs the bonds turns over around seven times
every year, compared with 1 1/4 times for a typical pool of credit-card
debt. American also claims a lower default rate on its charge cards.
Elsewhere, Toyota Motor Credit, the consumer finance subsidiary of the
Japanese car-maker, raised Dollars 250m three-year funding through a deal
lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation.
The paper carries a 5 per cent coupon - one of the lowest coupon issues
outstanding in the mainstream of the Eurodollar sector. The paper was
re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.65, where the yield spread
over US Treasury bonds was 35 basis points.
Although the bonds are not securitised, the deal drew comparison with the
American Express transaction. The Toyota Motor Credit deal also carried a
triple-A credit rating, and the main business of the issuer is consumer
lending.
Both transactions benefited from the shortage of outstanding Eurodollar
bonds trading below par. Since US interest rates have fallen sharply, most
Eurodollar bonds in the three- to five-year maturity range are trading
substantially above par. Toyota Motor Credit has existing bonds maturing in
1995 which trade as high as 109 per cent of face value in the secondary
market.
The US Treasury market rallied again yesterday. The Toyota paper quickly
rose above its issue price, prompting some participants to sell paper back
to the lead manager at a profit.
However, genuine demand from both retail and institutional investors was
enough to absorb most of the loose paper. At the close, the bonds were bid
at 99.80, with the yield spread held at the launch level.
Another consumer finance subsidiary of a motor manufacturer, General Motors
Acceptance Corporation, launched CDollars 100m five-year deal lead-managed
by Scotia-McLeod. The 7 3/4 per cent paper was priced to yield 107 basis
points more than Canadian government paper of the same maturity. The bonds
sold fairly well into a rallying market, although GMAC is a weaker credit,
rated five notches below Toyota Motor Credit.

CONTROL Securities, the UK property and leisure group suspended from trading
on the London Stock Exchange since October, said yesterday it would not pay
interest on a Swiss franc bond issue, writes Simon London.
In a brief announcement after the close of trading in London, it said a
SFr7.5m (Dollars 5.7m) interest payment due on July 27 would not be met. A
meeting of bondholders would be convened 'to consider resolutions to be
proposed'.
Control has two Swiss bond issues outstanding: a SFr100m issue maturing 1994
and a SFr100m 8 7/8 per cent issue maturing 1997. Both were lead-managed by
Warburg Soditic, a subsidiary of the UK merchant banking group.
Control Securities' shares were suspended following raids on its offices by
the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Nazmudin Virani, former chairman and chief
executive, faces conspiracy charges relating to the collapse of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International.

telephone unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government said yesterday it had received a joint bid for the
national telephone directory service from Australia Post and GTE
Corporation, the US telecommunications group.
The offer would remove control of National Directory Services (NDS) from
Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC), the
government-owned telecommunications carrier. Australia Post, which is
government owned, would not comment.
The bid would provide an initial payment of ADollars 400m, (USDollars 298.5)
followed by further payments of up to ADollars 2bn over 15 years, depending
on performance. The bid offers the Labor federal government a small
contribution towards reducing the 1992-93 budget deficit, expected to exceed
ADollars 10.5bn, following a deficit of more than ADollars 9bn in the year
to June.
However, it is likely to be opposed by backbench Labor MPs because it would
transfer majority ownership of NDS to GTE, which would hold a 52 per cent
stake through its subsidiary GTE Directories Corporation.
The bid will be opposed fiercely by AOTC, which said it had not seen the
proposal and claimed that overseas experience showed it would be a mistake
to split the directory service from the main telecommunications carrier.

next-generation chip

<TEXT>
INTEL, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips, said it would delay
the introduction of its next-generation product, code-named P5, until the
first quarter of 1993 to allow more time for testing.
The P5, which will be renamed before its official launch, is the latest
version of Intel's widely used microprocessor family, which includes the 386
and 486 devices that power most personal computers. Intel had planned to
launch the P5 during the fourth quarter of 1992.
Mr Paul Otellini, vice-president in charge of Intel's microprocessors, said
the delay did not mean that there were problems with the P5.
'We have (prototype) parts running in multiple systems at Intel and with key
customers. Sampling to a broader range of customers will not be delayed,' he
said.
However, by delaying full- scale production of the P5, Intel will allow more
time to refine its manufacturing process, improve yields and avoid the bugs
that have plagued new microprocessors in the past.
Despite Intel's statements, analysts suspect that Intel has encountered
technical problems, forcing it to delay full-scale production.
Intel is facing rising competition in the high-performance end of the
microprocessor market from makers of reduced instruction set computing
(Risc) microprocessors. The P5 is Intel's response to this competition.
Microsoft, the world's largest provider of software for personal computers,
reported a 52 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 210.1m,
or 48 cents a share, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The final quarter took Microsoft's earnings for its fiscal year to Dollars
708m, or Dollars 2.41 a share, well up on the Dollars 463m earned in fiscal
1991.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence group which is slimming down, yesterday
received a powerful endorsement of its strategy when Berkshire Hathaway, the
investment group led by Mr Warren Buffett, announced the acquisition of a 15
per cent stake in the business.
Mr Buffett is one of the most highly regarded investors in the US and tends
to take large stakes in companies for the long term.
His acquisition of 4.35m shares in General Dynamics will have cost about
Dollars 300m.
The company's share price rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 yesterday
morning on the New York stock exchange.
General Dynamics recently carried out a Dutch auction tender offer to buy
back 13.2m of its shares at a price of Dollars 72.25 a share under its
commitment to return to investors much of the excess cash the business is
throwing off.
Most of this cash is coming from a programme to dispose of peripheral
businesses and concentrate on four core sectors of the defence business.
Mr William Anders, chairman and architect of the new strategy, said
yesterday he was pleased with Berkshire Hathaway's expression of confidence
in the company and its new management team.
Members and trusts of Chicago's Crown and Goodman families, which have long
held a large stake in General Dynamics, reduced this from 22 per cent to
about 14.4 per cent under the Dutch auction.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIICHIBO, an Osaka textile company struggling to recover from the collapse
of a trading offshoot and an ill-fated expansion into commercial property,
has raised with its creditors the possible sale of its main factory.
Such a move would be extremely unusual for a Japanese manufacturing company.
Daiichibo stressed yesterday the sale was only one option for restructuring
under discussion with the lenders.
Nonetheless, it illustrates the harshness of choices facing many
medium-sized Japanese companies as the consequences of a more than two-year
property and equity price slide take hold.
Daiichibo, with annual sales of about Y60bn (Dollars 480m), fell into a net
loss of Y22.2bn for the year to March, from modest post-tax profits of Y219m
the year before. It passed its dividend, blaming extraordinary losses on
uncollectable accounts.
Then this month Ichibo Shoji, a subsidiary, was put into liquidation after
its main customer went bankrupt. Daiichibo, faced with a negative net worth
because of its responsibilities to this debt, has been trying unsuccessfully
to sell a shopping centre in the Osaka region.
Its shares on the second section of the Osaka Stock Exchange, meanwhile,
have been sliding; the price halved last week and closed yesterday at Y115,
down Y4, to value the company at some Y2.3bn.
In talks this week with creditors, led by Sakura Bank, Daiichibo sought a
deferral of Y2bn in interest payments due this year.
Japanese commercial banks are coming under strain from increasing numbers of
such requests, and the country's financial authorities have begun signalling
that meeting these is not always justified.

FERNZ Industries, the New Zealand-based chemical and fertiliser group,
yesterday reported a 59.9 per cent rise in net profits to Dollars NZ25.28m
(US13.8m), in spite of lower than expected profits in its Australian
operations.
Turnover rose 26.7 per cent to NZDollars 379m, of which NZDollars 139.41m
was generated in New Zealand, NZDollars 205.45m in Australia and NZDollars
34.21m in other markets. Recovery in New Zealand agriculture saw fertiliser
output rise 20.3 per cent to 332,259 tonnes. Directors said demand
accelerated in the second half, due to rising farm incomes.
Turnover in the company's industrial chemicals business rose 37.8 per cent
to NZDollars 66.79m. The main contributing factors were a second chlor
alkali plant in west Australia and the Kinleith chemical complex in New
Zealand which saw increased demand for its preservative chemicals.
Turnover in agricultural chemicals and animal health products rose 28 per
cent to NZDollars 230.6m. Directors said the majority of that business was
conducted in Australia and earnings were complicated by fluctuating exchange
rates.
International sales rose by NZDollars 10m last year. However, Australian
profits were affected by the most severe drought in Queensland and New South
Wales in 10 years.
Directors said that although business opportunities improved in the second
half, sales there for the 12 months were ADollars 7m (USDollars 5.2m) below
forecast, due to competition.
Earnings per share rose 37 per cent to 48 cents.
The directors recommended a final dividend of 13 cents a share, up from 12
cents last year.

BCE, the biggest Canadian telecommunications group, said the recession and
lower profits at its Northern Telecom subsidiary caused a 20 per cent
decline in second-quarter profits. For the first half, earnings were down 9
per cent.
However, despite slow economic recovery, BCE expects improved performance in
all sectors in the second half.
The second-quarter performance was also affected by write-downs at its
Montreal Trustco financial services arm. Final earnings were CDollars 246m
(USDollars 205m) or 72 cents a common share, against CDollars 307m, or 92
cents, a year earlier. Operating revenues were CDollars 4.97bn against
CDollars 5.05bn.
First-half earnings were CDollars 544m, or CDollars 1.60 a common share,
against CDollars 600m, or CDollars 1.80 a share, a year earlier, on revenues
of CDollars 9.84bn against CDollars 9.78bn.
BCE said first-half telecommunications earnings were flat because of the
recession.
Bell Canada, the telecommunications utility providing most of BCE's
earnings, saw slower growth. Its first-half profit gained a modest 1.2 per
cent and operating revenues rose 2.4 per cent.
Bell Canada contributed CDollars 453m, or CDollars 1.47 a share, to BCE's
first-half earnings, unchanged from a year earlier. Northern Telecom
contributed 34 cents per BCE share against 38 cents.

profit forecast for 1991-92 that was published in its pre-flotation
prospectus earlier this year.
Mr Dan Colson, acting chief executive, said earnings should be comfortably
ahead of the forecast in spite of the Australian economy's slow recovery
from recession. Fairfax, which is 15 per cent owned by Mr Conrad Black's
UK-based Daily Telegraph group, had forecast pre-tax profits of ADollars
123m (USDollars 91.7m) for the year to the end of June, followed by ADollars
165m in the current year.
Mr Colson said the directors were very optimistic. He confirmed that Fairfax
was considering building a printing plant in Sydney to enable the group to
compete more effectively with newspapers published by Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation.
The plant, which would cost about ADollars 200m, would have the capacity to
print colour news pictures.
Mr Colson said Fairfax would probably appoint a chief executive within the
next few weeks. Fairfax has been without a chief executive since December,
when it was acquired for ADollars 1.4bn by a consortium led by Mr Black. The
group was put into receivership in 1990 after an abortive buy-out of family
shareholders by Mr Warwick Fairfax.
The group publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian Financial
Review, and The Age in Melbourne. It is the principal competitor to News
Corporation.
GIO, the insurance group privatised by the state government of New South
Wales, closed at ADollars 2.53 after its first day of trading on the
Australian stock exchange yesterday. The closing price represented a premium
of 5.4 per cent to the flotation price of ADollars 2.40, slightly less than
expected.
The shares opened at ADollars 2.68, but lost ground in a falling market.
Southern Cross Airlines, which plans to relaunch the collapsed Compass
Airline operation next month, closed at 40 cents after listing at 45 cents.
The closing price represented a discount of 20 per cent to the price at
which the shares were floated.

MINNESOTA Mining and Manufacturing, the diversified US manufacturer known as
3M, broke a string of five quarterly declines in the three months ended June
30.
The company reported net income of Dollars 322m, or Dollars 1.47 per share,
up 7.6 per cent from Dollars 299m, or Dollars 1.36 per share, a year ago.
With nearly half its sales overseas, 3M has been suffering from negative
currency effects. But these were offset during the second quarter by a 6 per
cent gain in unit volume, improved productivity, lower raw materials costs
and a decline in its tax rate.
Mr LD DeSimone, chairman, said US unit sales registered their best gain in
six quarters with a rise of about 3 per cent. Outside the US, sales
increased about 8 per cent.
During the first half, net income rose 1.9 per cent to Dollars 610m, or
Dollars 2.79 per share, compared with Dollars 599m, or Dollars 2.73 per
share, a year ago. Sales were up 2.5 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn from Dollars
6.7bn last year.

ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 45 per cent drop in
second-quarter net income, due mainly to sharply lower earnings at its ITT
Hartford insurance subsidiary, accounting adjustments and restructuring
action at the Sheraton hotels business.
The group reported net income of Dollars 106m, or 75 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.43, in the second quarter of 1991. Sales
rose 4 per cent to Dollars 5.36bn.
Net income would have been Dollars 131m, or 95 cents a share, compared with
a restated Dollars 206m, or Dollars 1.53, if the non-cash accounting
adjustments were excluded.
The figures also included after-tax portfolio gains at ITT Hartford and ITT
Financial of Dollars 22m, or 17 cents a share, compared with Dollars 6m, or
5 cents, in the same period of last year.
ITT Hartford saw income drop from Dollars 117m to Dollars 41m. The company
said this was 'mainly due to unfavourable adjusted underwriting income
caused by higher catastrophe losses, largely from several weather related
events, along with continued adverse developments in workers' compensation
and reinsurance'.
ITT Sheraton had an operating loss of Dollars 14m, against a profit of
Dollars 15m, after restructuring its headquarters operations to make them
more efficient. Excluding this charge, the company would have reported a
small profit, although still below last year.
Among the group's seven other major businesses, the automotive, financial
and communications operations produced higher operating income; fluid
technology and the Rayonier paper business were flat; and the defence and
components businesses showed drops.
For the six months ITT reported a net loss of Dollars 336m, or Dollars 2.62
a share, after taking a Dollars 580m non-cash accounting adjustment. In the
first half of last year it made Dollars 406m, or Dollars 2.99 a share. Sales
rose 3 per cent to Dollars 10.44bn.

BANCO Santander, Spain's most aggressive commercial bank, yesterday reported
net profits of Pta43.2bn (Dollars 452.8m) for the first half of 1992, up
17.3 per cent on the same period last year. Pre-tax profits rose 17.5 per
cent to Pta58.2bn.
The bank said lending margins had increased 4.35 per cent and fee-based
income by 25 per cent, leading to a 9 per cent rise in operating profits at
Pta129.3bn.
Mr Emilio Botin, chairman, said management had made cost-cutting a priority
this year. 'As a result, significant savings have already been achieved, and
the growth in operating expenses for the second half of the year should be
significantly lower.'
Santander's income from mutual fund management rose 55 per cent to above
Pta800bn. It claims to control more than 13 per cent of the Spanish unit
trust market.
Meanwhile, Banco Exterior, the state-controlled commercial bank at the heart
of the state's new banking group, Argentaria, has reported a 16.4 per cent
rise in first-half net income, to Pta15bn.
Exterior said its operating costs, including personnel, had grown 4.8 per
cent to Pta32.6bn but this might reflect the added costs of incorporating
BCI, the state industrial credit bank, earlier this year
Earlier, Banesto, another of the country's key retail banks, reported net
profits among its financial group of Pta26.2bn for the first six months of
1992, a 3.76 per cent increase.
The bank said first-half results, which exclude its industrial affiliates,
showed gross operating profits up 18.62 per cent to Pta65bn after a sharp
drop in operating costs.

RHONE-POULENC Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc, the
French state-owned chemicals group, yesterday reported a 39 per cent rise in
net profits for the first six months of this year.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's net earnings rose from Dollars 122m in the first half
of last year to Dollars 170m in the six months to the end of June. This was
on sales up by 6.7 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn, excluding currency changes
and the disposal of non-strategic product lines.
The group, formed two years ago from the merger of Rhone-Poulenc's
pharmaceuticals division with Rorer, the US drugs company, plans to invest
more than Dollars 500m on research and development in 1992.
Sales growth was generally spread across the group's main markets, although
US sales were affected in the second quarter by destocking by wholesalers.
However, demand for the group's main prescription drugs continued to grow.
Mr Robert Cawthorn, chairman, was satisfied with this performance in a
'challenging environment'. The group was on track to meet its earnings
objectives in the current half, he said. Earnings per share rose from 89
cents to Dollars 1.24.

<TEXT>
STRONG gains from Walt Disney's film and consumer product divisions
propelled the company's third-quarter net earnings 33 per cent higher on
revenues which grew 23 per cent.
For the three months to end-June, Disney posted net income of Dollars
220.8m, or 41 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.85bn. The results
compared with earnings of Dollars 165.5m, or 31 cents, in the second quarter
of last year, on revenues of Dollars 1.51bn.
The strongest boost to Disney's earnings came from its film division, where
operating income jumped 70 per cent to Dollars 134.3m, against Dollars 79.1m
a year earlier. The increase came on the back of a 21 per cent improvement
in revenues to Dollars 723.8m, against Dollars 597.1m.
The company's theme park division saw a 10 per cent improvement in operating
income to Dollars 194.3m from Dollars 176.5m, on revenues which rose 17 per
cent to Dollars 890.5m, against Dollars 759m.
The theme park results benefited from the Easter holiday falling in this
year's third quarter. A year earlier, only part of the Easter period was in
the third quarter. Investment in Euro Disney cut into the strong results
from domestic theme parks and resorts.
Disney's consumer products business posted a 31 per cent increase in
operating income to Dollars 60.8m, on revenues which climbed 54 per cent to
Dollars 239.2m.
For the first nine months, the company had net income of Dollars 593m, or
Dollars 1.11 a share, against Dollars 462.6m, or 87 cents, in the
year-earlier period. Revenues were 23 per cent higher at Dollars 5.45bn.

project

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELF Aquitaine, the French oil group, and Thyssen, the German steel and
engineering group, yesterday confirmed that they had won a DM6bn (Dollars
4.5bn) contract to take over and modernise eastern Germany's main petrol
station network and build an oil refinery there.
Elf, majority owned by the French government, is to take full control of
Minol, which owns more than 1,000 filling stations in eastern Germany, or 74
per cent of the market.
Elf will also have two-thirds control of a joint venture to build one of
Europe's largest oil refineries, with a capacity of 10m tonnes a year. The
facility is scheduled to open in 1996 at the Leuna chemical complex. Thyssen
will hold the remaining third of the joint venture.
This is the largest Franco-German investment since the second world war and
confirms an outline deal struck in January with the Treuhand, the body
handling eastern German privatisations. The project will support between
6,000 and 10,000 jobs in the east.
The deal reinforces France's position as the biggest foreign buyer of
privatised eastern German companies, with FFr7.7bn (Dollars 1.54bn) of
investment since unification, not including the Elf deal.
However, western German buyers hold 95 per cent of the privatised eastern
companies, in spite of the Treuhand's efforts to stimulate more foreign
interest.
Elf and Thyssen won the deal in competition against two rival groups, one
headed by British Petroleum and Italy's Agip oil concern, and the other
involving Middle Eastern interests including Mannai Corp and Kuwait
Petroleum.
The acquisition of Minol, which will function under Elf's brand name, will
double the French company's 4 per cent share of the overall German filling
station market. This would lead to an inevitable loss of market share by
Minol as competition from other distributors builds up in the east, said Elf
officials.
Of the total DM6bn investment, DM4.3bn will go on the Leuna refinery. Elf
and Thyssen are taking over a petrochemicals producer at Zeitz, near Leuna,
and Elf also plans to buy on the site a formaldehyde resin plant, which uses
methanol.
Elf and L'Air Liquide, the French industrial gases producer, plan to build a
plant at Leuna to make hydrogen peroxide - used in bleach and disinfectant.
Leuna already has two inefficient and polluting oil refineries which will
continue production until the new plant is ready. The Treuhand will then
take them over and arrange for their dismantling.
Elf also plans to discuss with local partners the possible construction of
an oil pipeline from the port of Rostock to feed the refinery.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BENETTON, Italy's biggest clothing group, is poised to swap assets with
Edizione Holding, the private company controlled by the Benetton family.
However, Benetton stressed the changes, expected to be announced on Monday,
had nothing to do with the resignation on Wednesday of Mr Emilio Fossati,
managing director.
Shares in Benetton fell for the second day yesterday after confusing press
reports and uncertainty about its plans. Benetton's stock fell L356 to
L10,432, making an 8 per cent fall since Tuesday.
Mr Fossati's departure highlights Benetton's difficulties in retaining top
managers. In late 1990, Mr Carlo Buora, finance director, left after less
than a year in the job.
Analysts attribute the brevity of some managers' stays to cultural and
family problems, linked to Benetton's location near Treviso, an unexciting
town of 85,000 near Venice. Many executives coming from centres such as
Milan leave their families behind and commute home at weekends.
Conflicts with the Benettons, who own about 80 per cent of the shares and
remain the company's guiding spirits, may be inevitable. Though the family
wants to attract top managers, decision-making remains with them.
In 1987, the family opposed plans by Mr Aldo Palmeri, the then managing
director, to buy Lanerossi, a financially-troubled textiles producer.
However, avoiding acquisitions and keeping its own assets to a minimum have
been key to Benetton's success. Most production is contracted out, while
shops are run by independent retailers on a licensing basis.
First half net profits, due in September, are expected to rise 15 per cent
to about L92bn (Dollars 81.5m), with sales 6 per cent ahead at L1,220bn.

CREDIT Lyonnais, one of France's leading nationalised banks, will acquire a
20 per cent stake in Aerospatiale, the state-controlled aerospace concern,
AP-DJ reports from Paris.
The Economics Ministry said the move was designed to strengthen the
competitive positions of the two companies, and to enable Aerospatiale to
pursue the costly development of new aircraft and missiles.
Under the terms of the agreement, Credit Lyonnais will inject FFr1.4bn
(Dollars 280m) into Aerospatiale through a capital increase. The French
government will give Credit Lyonnais some of the shares it owns, so that the
bank will hold 20 per cent of Aerospatiale's equity.
Aerospatiale, which has borrowings of around FFr14bn, last year made a net
profit of FFr213m.

FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Salomon proves resilient as
earnings achieve record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday reported second-quarter
after-tax operating earnings of Dollars 375m, the best three-month
performance in the group's history and the clearest sign yet that it has
recovered from last year's bond trading scandal.
However, the burden of a special Dollars 185m charge to cover costs related
to the settlement of the bond market-rigging allegations reduced net income
to Dollars 211m.
Even with the charge, net income was still higher than a year ago, when
Salomon reported a profit of Dollars 178m, thanks partly to the return to
profitability of Phibro Energy, the group's oil trading and refining
subsidiary.
The second-quarter charge, taken alongside the Dollars 200m charge the
company took in the third quarter of 1991, means Salomon has set aside a
total of Dollars 385m to cover the costs related to the scandal.
A large part of that reserve has gone towards paying the Dollars 290m in
fines and compensation levied on Salomon as settlement of allegations that
the firm broke Treasury rules during bond auctions in 1990 and 1991. The
remainder will help pay for the penalties and legal costs of the lawsuits
filed against the company in the wake of the scandal.
Under the new leadership of chairman Mr Deryck Maughan, the securities
subsidiary, Salomon Brothers, provided the bulk of Salomon's profits during
the second quarter. Such was the strength of the firm's underlying
performance, that if the charge and taxes were excluded, Salomon Brothers'
earnings totalled Dollars 647m in the three months, the highest recorded by
a publicly held US securities firm.
Against the background of a highly favourable interest rate environment,
strong sales and trading activity in Salomon Brothers' core bond business
made the biggest contribution in the quarter.
Even investment banking, hardest hit by the uncertainties surrounding the
bond trading scandal, staged a recovery, with revenues exceeding the
preceding two quarters due to the heavy flow of corporate bond issues.
On the oil trading and refining side of Salomon, Phibro recorded pre-tax
earnings of Dollars 19m in the quarter, a turnround from the losses of the
previous six months. Most of its revenues came from its crude oil trading
and derivatives department.

intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE over a capital restructuring at Etonbrook Properties grew
increasingly heated yesterday as the company's largest shareholder attacked
directors over fees paid to associated consultancies since 1988.
Mr Andrew Perloff, who through three companies and a personal stake controls
15 per cent of Etonbrook, said companies associated to its directors had
taken Pounds 1.5m in fees since 1988 compared with payments to ordinary
shareholders of Pounds 105,342 over the same period. The information had
come from the accounts, he said.
Mr Keith Moss, managing director, said yesterday that the fees were partly
due to the ordinary running of the company, and partly a board incentive set
up under the Business Expansion Scheme. 'The board received 20 per cent of
the development profits,' he said. 'It was an incentive . . . 750
shareholders invested with us on that basis.'
The claims form part of a dispute over plans to repay Pounds 1.2m in
preference shares which fell due on April 1. That would require a reduction
in share capital as Etonbrook does not have enough distributable reserves.
In a letter to shareholders Mr Perloff rejected Etonbrook's claim that the
preference shareholders could wind up the company if not repaid as he
claimed company law required repayments to be made from distributable
profit.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker fails to find a new chairman
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the leisure and property group which in March agreed a Pounds
1.6bn refinancing with its banks, failed to find a new chairman in time for
its annual meeting yesterday.
Instead, Lord Kindersley, who retired as chairman at the meeting, is to be
replaced temporarily by Mr Ken Scobie, deputy chairman and chief executive.
Mr Alan Clements, the group's only non-executive director, who had also
planned to retire at the meeting, has agreed to stay on for a while.
Lord Kindersley told shareholders that a number of possible candidates had
been identified for the chairmanship. He said: 'The task facing your board
is still enormous and we feel that it would be wrong to rush into such a
vital appointment.'
The appointment of new non-executives cannot take place until a new chairman
has been found.
It is thought that potential chairmen of the group want to clarify their
relationship with the company's banks before accepting the job. Through the
refinancing the banks became holders of more than 50 per cent of the group's
shares and have to be kept informed of its financial position on a regular
basis.
Lord Kindersley also said that he expected news in the next two to three
months on the Serious Fraud Office's inquiry into the group's affairs which
was launched last summer. Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief
executive, has been interviewed as part of the inquiries.
Lord Kindersley said that trading in the group's two on-going businesses,
Pubmaster, which manages a chain of pubs, and William Hill, the betting shop
group, was being affected by the recession. Sales of the non-core activities
had also proved difficult because of the recession.
An independent expert has been appointed to arbitrate between Brent Walker
and Grand Metropolitan, the leisure company, in the dispute over the
purchase price of William Hill.
He is Mr Raymond Hinton, a partner at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm.
Brent Walker is claiming a refund of part of the Pounds 685m consideration
agreed in 1989 on the grounds that profits did not meet a forecast made at
the time.
Brent Walker shares were unchanged at 5 1/4 p.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: A fight to the bitter end - Greene King's
battle for Morland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENE KING needs about 700,000 shares, a stake of just over 4 per cent,
this morning to clinch its Pounds 104m hostile bid for Morland, the Thames
Valley brewer. Yet Morland's chances of retaining its independence still
seem good.
The Suffolk-based brewer launched its bid in May with all the cards
apparently in its favour. It bought a 28.5 per cent stake in Morland from
the Whitbread Investment Company, which also pledged a further 14.9 per cent
if no other bidder emerged.
For Morland, there was a bitter irony about the sudden move that threatened
its survival.
Whitbread had been forced to dispose of its shareholding by the government's
beer orders. Those were based on a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report
that sought to safeguard the independence of regional brewers.
With 43.4 per cent of Morland in its grasp, Greene King confidently made its
first, and final, offer for the rest of the shares - 484p in convertibles or
450p cash.
But after a hard-fought nine-week campaign, Greene King succeeded in gaining
control of less than another 3 per cent.
Against the background of a falling stock market - generally considered to
favour the bid - several shareholders who accepted the offer have had second
thoughts in the last few days and withdrawn.
Royal Insurance, with a 7.7 per cent stake, rejected the bid from the
outset, saying 'it considerably undervalues the future prospects of the
company.'
Other institutions with significant stakes - Prudential (7 per cent),
Britannic (5.9 per cent), CIN (3.8 per cent) and Refuge (3.1 per cent) -
have shown no signs of defecting.
Morland's record and its prospects in a fast-changing brewing industry have
been the main battleground.
Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, opened hostilities by claiming that
a takeover made commercial and financial sense. 'Regional brewers require
both critical mass and strong brands in order to compete effectively in the
new environment.'
Morland had neither - and it faced serious strategic difficulties as a small
independent brewer, Mr Redman claimed. Its 300 pubs, and the limited
penetration of the free trade by its Old Speckled Hen ale, were not enough
to justify the continued operations of its brewery.
Greene King's IPA and Abbot ales had a strong market position, with more
than 55 per cent of sales outside the brewer's own 825 pubs. High
utilisation of its brewery capacity gave it low-cost production.
Merging the adjacent pub estates and closing Morland's Abingdon brewery
would bring cost savings and improved margins that would boost trading
profits by an initial Pounds 2.5m a year, Mr Redman claimed.
Greene King's offer - a multiple of 21 times Morland's 1991 earnings and a
premium of 51 per cent on the company's share price when abortive merger
talks began in February - was generous, he said.
Sir Humphrey Prideaux, Morland's chairman, dismissed it as 'an opportunistic
attempt to acquire the company on the cheap.' Morland based its defence on
its record of the past five years: annual earnings growth of 17 per cent,
dividend growth of 16.6 per cent, gearing of only 8.1 per cent and cash
deposits of Pounds 9m.
The company had achieved the best earnings per share growth in the sector
and substantially outperformed Greene King, it said, taunting the predator
with its refusal to reveal its 1991-92 profits.
Greene King was later forbidden from publishing its results by the Takeover
Panel but described Morland's forecast of a 28 per cent rise in profits this
year as 'feeble and lacklustre.'
Morland's past record was no guide to future prospects in a more competitive
industry, it said. But the Oxfordshire brewer was shoring up its defences
against such charges.
It announced a deal with Courage covering the sale of a minimum 5,000
barrels a year of Old Speckled Hen, and the brewing of 20,000 barrels of
Courage beers a year at Abingdon. The deal would generate initial annual
pre-tax profits of Pounds 800,000, it was claimed.
Morland followed up with the Pounds 16.9m purchase of 72 pubs from
Inntrepreneur Estates, increasing its tied estate by nearly 25 per cent. The
pubs, it forecast, would make a substantial and growing contribution to
profits.
There has been some angry skirmishing around these main lines of attack and
counter-attack: over Morland's net asset value and Greene King's
unsuccessful forays into leisure businesses, for example.
When the dust settles today, however, it would be no surprise to see Morland
emerge, after Devenish and Invergordon, as the third UK drinks company in
little more than a year to defy the odds against its survival.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Decision day for Walbrook creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of the stricken Walbrook Insurance, must decide today whether to
back a rescue plan which would stave off the company's liquidation.
The deal, which could convert many of the company's creditors into
shareholders, would close another chapter in the long-running saga of
Walbrook's parent, London United Investments, a property and finance
company, which was placed in administration in February 1990.
However if the creditors refuse approval, the Policyholders' Protection
Board, financed by contributions from British insurance companies, stands to
meet millions of pounds in insurance claims.
During the 1980s Walbrook was one of the leading insurers and re-insurers of
US liability business in the London market, specialising in covering US
doctors, hospitals, accountants and lawyers, and their insurers, against
legal awards for negligence.
But the company, along with four other LUI subsidiaries, Kingscroft, El
Paso, Lime Street, and Mutual Reinsurance - the so-called Kelm companies -
was swamped by a surge in claims. LUI was placed in administration in 1990,
and Walbrook and the Kelm group ceased writing new business. In May this
year, Walbrook stopped paying claims after actuaries completed a new, more
pessimistic, assessment of outstanding claims.
Walbrook's unpublished 1991 accounts show underwriting losses of Pounds
178.5m. The company had negative net assets of Pounds 170m after allowing
for approximately Pounds 461m in outstanding claims and claims incurred but
not reported.
Under the rescue plan, launched earlier this month, directors are proposing
that leading policyholders exchange their debts for equity, in a deal which
would raise Pounds 270m and restore Walbrook's solvency.
Creditors would receive 100 cents in the dollar, but would then be asked to
pledge 60 cents immediately in exchange for preferred stock. More than 200
policyholders are each owed over Dollars 1.0m (Pounds 520,000) in potential
outstanding claims.
However some creditors are strongly opposed to the deal. Transit Casualty, a
Missouri-based insurer which went into receivership in 1985, is seeking to
appoint liquidators, which it believes would represent a quicker and cheaper
solution.
Earlier this week Transit asked Walbrook to supply more material financial
information in connection with the rescue plan. As of yesterday, no
information had been forthcoming and, according to advisers, Transit was
understood to be 'resolutely opposed to the rescue plan'.
If the plan fails, the company faces the prospect of a formal scheme of
arrangement, or provisional or full liquidation. The UK's insurance
companies, already battered by two years of heavy underwriting losses, could
well pick up some of the cost.
In March this year the PPB paid a total of about Pounds 37m to pay claims
from policyholders of the Kelm companies. Under the Policyholders Protection
Act, the PPB pays private policyholders of insolvent companies 90 per cent
of outstanding claims.
A court judgment in April broadened the definition of private policyholders
to include firms or partnerships, making it possible for many of Walbrook's
policyholders to claim for compensation. Between 20 per cent and 25 per cent
of Walbrook's 200 biggest policyholders are understood to be able to claim
compensation.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greycoat asset value falls 58%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET ASSETS per share at Greycoat, the property development and investment
company which specialises in central London offices, tumbled by 58 per cent
from 477p to 201p over the year to March 31.
The fall reflected the annual revaluation and Pounds 11m provisions against
properties at cost. Last time these were Pounds 64m. Profits before
provisions emerged at Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 25.5m), and after provisions the
pre-tax loss was Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 38.5m). Gross rental income grew to
Pounds 50m (Pounds 31.9m).
The company said that the 22 per cent overall fall in the value of its
investment portfolio embraced falls of 24.6 per cent in the City, 18.4 per
cent in central London, the West End and Victoria, and 15.5 per cent in the
provinces. Some 96 per cent of the portfolio is in offices.
Interest payable jumped to Pounds 36.3m (Pounds 12.3m), with Pounds 8.4m
(Pounds 32.2m) capitalised. No capitalisation was expected in the current
year.
Losses per share amounted to 14.6p (45.1p) but the final dividend is held at
2.9p for a maintained total of 5.2p.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Ewart's 21% downturn intensifies war of
words
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EWART, the Belfast-based property company, reported a 21 per cent decline
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 254,000 to Pounds 201,000 for the year to
April 30, the war of words over its control increased in intensity.
Mr Philip Monahan, who holds a 29.22 per cent stake and is attempting to
replace four existing directors, said that the company's existing strategy
was not successful and the present management had no ideas for recouping
shareholder value.
Mr Barry Gilligan, managing director, said he was pleased to report a
profitable year in 'extremely difficult' market conditions.
He added that the view of the majority of the directors was that the board
changes should be rejected.
Mr Monahan is seeking to replace four directors with Mr Patrick Whyman, who
holds a 6.38 per cent stake and Mr Edward Sweeney, development director of
Mr Monahan's Dublin-based Monarch Properties.
When asked if he considered whether Mr Monahan and Mr Whyman were acting in
concert Mr Gilligan said he could not comment but the company would be
sending its views on the move to shareholders soon.
He added that he thought Mr Monahan was trying to take control of Ewart
without making a full bid.
Mr Monahan's view was that as they were existing shareholders there was no
requirement to make a full bid.
He is seeking to replace Capt Bill Henderson, a former chairman, Sir William
Ewart, Mr Dominic Deeny, development director and Mr David Robinson, finance
director.
The year's profit was achieved on turnover of Pounds 3.7m against Pounds
12.6m, which was boosted by the sale of a development. The net interest
charge increased from Pounds 5,800 to Pounds 718,000 as a result of the
non-capitalisation of interest. In the previous year interest on the sold
development had been capitalised.
Earnings per share were 1.18p (0.34p) and the proposed final dividend is
maintained at 0.5p for a total of 0.75p (1p).

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad loss may reach Pounds 65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES AT Amstrad, the UK consumer electronics group caught by a sharp
deterioration in the personal computer market, are likely to have reached
Pounds 65m in the year to June 30.
The group, launched and still piloted by Mr Alan Sugar, said pre-tax losses
would be about Pounds 25m more than the market expectations which range
around Pounds 40m.
Amstrad said the additional losses were the result of erosion of prices in
the personal computer market and higher-than-expected restructuring costs.
Inventory reduction and restructuring have, however, increased Amstrad's net
cash to Pounds 100m from Pounds 60m at the end of June 1991.
The announcement was initially greeted by a sharp fall in the Amstrad share
price. But the shares bounced to close down only 1p at 29p as the increased
cash balance was seen as underpinning the shares and limiting further price
falls.
The statement made no comment, however, about the final dividend which
analysts say remains seriously in doubt.
'The best hope is that they will pay the final dividend but it is entirely
at the whim of the chairman,' one analyst said. 'It is not justified by
earnings or profits and only marginally by cash flow.'
A spokesman for the group said the increased losses did not include any
provision for further price reductions in the personal computer market.
Nonetheless, the group was 'well poised now' to compete in a market that has
turned into a bloodbath as a result of competitors like IBM and Compaq
hitting back at computer clone producers like Amstrad.
Compaq, the US company, revealed on Wednesday a 43 per cent jump in second
quarter net income, providing evidence that a new policy of competing with
clones on price rather than features was paying dividends.
Analysts believe the provisions and stock liquidation will have been enough
to return Amstrad to profits in the current year ending June 1993.
While the increased loss was not entirely unexpected, given the all too
evident depth of high street discounting, the increased cash pile has
increased the quality of net assets.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists sees advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Lloyds Chemists jumped 18 per cent to 235p yesterday following an
optimistic trading statement from Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief
executive.
Mr Lloyd said the board was prompted to make the announcement in the face of
the sharp decline in the share price over the past month. The price has
fallen steadily since June 17, when shares traded at 351p.
The chairman said business remained resilient despite difficult conditions.
For the present year like-for-like sales were 9 per cent ahead in the
chemists division, 6 per cent in Drugstores, and 5 per cent for Holland &amp;
Barrett, the healthfood retailer.
In light of this, the board expected to increase the final final dividend by
33 per cent to 4p for the year to June 30, making a total of 5.55p.
He warned, however, that pre-tax profits in the current year would be some
Pounds 5m to Pounds 8m lower, due to the NHS decision to cut the cost of
generic drugs. He added that Lloyds aimed to mitigate the decline through
increased margins on own label products and over-the-counter sales.
Mr Lloyd reassured investors that profits should be in line with
expectations, unless the the NHS decided to backdate reimbursement for
generic drugs to April 1. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of between
Pounds 33m and Pounds 35m.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Arjo Wiggins names Frenchman to replace its
chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, did little to allay
the fears of British institutions about the strength of its French minority
shareholders yesterday. The group named a Frenchman to replace the group's
sacked British chief executive, Mr Stephen Walls.
Mr Alain Soulas, presently chief executive of the paper division of
Saint-Gobain, the French industrial company, will take over at the beginning
of October. The group said Saint-Gobain has no relationship with Worms et
Cie, the French financial company, which indirectly owns 39 per cent of Arjo
Wiggins Appleton (AWA).
At a meeting with analysts yesterday, Mr Soulas said his most immediate
priority would be to continue to push through synergies following the merger
of the French and British groups. In particular, there were synergy benefits
in rationalising production and purchasing which had not yet been achieved.
Mr Soulas told analysts he did not want to increase geartinue to make small
acquisitions as they became available. There would be no significant
management shake-ups within the company.
He added that he would move to the UK where the company's small headquarters
would remain domiciled. The group's dividend policy would not change.
Mr Tim Rothwell, paper analyst at BZW, said Mr Soulas had a good track
record in the industry. However, he said poor trading conditions meant he
was downgrading his profits forecast for this year from Pounds 212m to
Pounds 205m, and for next year from Pounds 240m to Pounds 235m. AWA's
shares, which have underperformed the market since Mr Walls was sacked,
closed last night 5p up at 218p.
Mr Soulas's move, while not unexpected, was nevertheless a significant
promotion, said Mr Jonathan Helliwell, paper analyst at James Capel. He
pointed out that Saint-Gobain's paper division had a turnover of about
Pounds 900m against AWA's sales last year of Pounds 2.48bn.
Meanwhile, the company expects to announce more board appointments to
replace a non-executive director - Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline
Beecham, who resigned, and Mr Ian Kennedy, the chief executive of the fine
papers and forestry and pulp division, who retired this year.
The replacements are likely to be American and British.

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Extensive disposals aid First Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST TECHNOLOGY, which supplies crash dummies and safety sensors to the car
industry, said extensive disposals helped it make pre-tax profits of Pounds
639,000 in the year to April 30, against a Pounds 3.03m loss.
The recession-hit group's shares, which crashed from a peak of 500p in 1990,
yesterday closed 3p higher at 59p.
The group sold nine non-core businesses and closed one during the year,
reducing turnover from Pounds 37.3m to Pounds 27.8m.
Earnings per share of 2.4p compared with losses of 14.7p, but the final
dividend is again passed, resulting in a nil distribution for the year (1p).
A capital reorganisation is planned and it is intended to resume dividends
in the current year.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 6m, leaving year-end gearing
at 150 per cent. Further significant reductions are expected this year.
Banking facilities with Barclays and National Bank of Detroit will be
reviewed in December. The group is confident it will be able to negotiate
support at much lower cost than last year, when there was an exceptional
charge for professional fees of Pounds 365,000.
COMMENT
First Technology has made a good start on the road to recovery, but a lot of
fingers have been burnt since the not-so-distant glory days when the shares
topped 500p. The company will have to rely on cash generation to reduce
further its debt burden, but should have no great difficulty in cutting
gearing to about 80 per cent next year. Mr Westlake argues as persuasively
as ever that increasing consumer concern with car safety will prove good for
business. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.5m next year put the shares
on a prospective multiple of just under 8. At that level, they obviously
have attractions as a recovery play. However, more safety-conscious
investors may wish to await the resumption of dividends before leaping
aboard.

<TEXT>
BRISTOL SCOTTS unveiled preliminary figures for 1991 showing a reduction in
pre-tax losses from Pounds 770,000 to Pounds 562,000.
The leisure and property group also revealed the agreed acquisition of the
outstanding 87.6 per cent of Mount Street Fine Wine Company, a wholesaler
and retailer of fine wine. Some 37 per cent of its trade is with Bristol
Scotts.
Terms of the offer are 645 Bristol shares for every 1,000 Mount Street,
which puts a value of 60p on the shares and Pounds 822,000 on the whole
capital. There is a cash alternative of 50p.
Draft accounts showed that Mount Street incurred increased losses of Pounds
236,000 (Pounds 65,000) in the year to March 31.
Bristol Scotts' turnover fell to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 13m) and trading
profit to Pounds 795,000 (Pounds 1.21m), but a doubled contribution from
profit on sale of investments and other income, and reduced interest charges
enabled the loss to be cut. Losses per share were 4.69p (11.73p).

FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel believes 'no significant debt
trading'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL, the channel tunnel company, does not believe there has been any
significant trading in its debt, the company's chief executive, Sir Alastair
Morton said yesterday.
He was responding to a comment in yesterday's Lex column in the FT which
said that a small amount of Eurotunnel's debt had changed hands at a
discount to its face value of 30 per cent.
Sir Alastair said that under the terms of its borrowing agreement, the
company must be notified if security is assigned to any purchaser of debt.
In the past six months, Eurotunnel has not been notified of any market
transactions in its debt involving the re-assigning of security in this way.
However, Sir Alastair said it was possible that debt has been transferred
between banks without reassigning security, though he thought it unlikely.
If a bank had bought debt without gaining the right to security it would
naturally buy the debt at a discount, he said, since the debt would carry an
increased risk.
In addition, he said that no bank can assign its ongoing commitment to
provide Eurotunnel with its undrawn banking facilities without the company's
consent - which has not been given in the case of any market transactions in
the past six months.
Eurotunnel has 220 banks. To date, it has drawn on more than Pounds 4bn of
its banking facilities. The company believes that less than 1 per cent of
this Pounds 4bn has ever changed hands and is not aware of it ever being
sold at a discount.
The company also pointed out that it is not planning to seek further finance
from its banks or shareholders prior to the opening of the Channel Tunnel
towards the end of next year. The need for further funding in the period
after opening will be measured during the first year in service in 1994.
Sir Alastair also said that negotiations with Transmanche Link, the
consortium of contractors working on the tunnel, are going well.
There has been a dispute between Eurotunnel and TML over how much the
contractors should be paid for fitting out the rail tunnels and building
passenger terminals at Folkestone, Kent and Sangatte, northern France .
Eurotunnel is now believed to be offering TML between Pounds 100m and Pounds
150m less than TML wants, as measured in 1985 prices.

FT  24 JUL 92 / USAir blames fares war as deficit rises to Dollars 85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAIR Group, the US airline in which British Airways plans to invest Dollars
750m in return for a potential 44 per cent equity stake, yesterday reported
increased losses in the second quarter of Dollars 84.9m (Pounds 44.4m) after
tax.
This compares with an after-tax deficit of Dollars 56.8m in the same period
of 1991, and takes USAir's net loss for the first half of 1992 to Dollars
147.9m.
The combined BA-USAir operation will link the world's biggest international
air network with the third biggest US domestic network and carry more
passengers than any other airline.
Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's president, blamed recent domestic fare wars for
the poor results.
'Industry-wide fare reductions that began early in the second quarter
sharply eroded the positive momentum that we had developed in the first
quarter of the year,' he said.
His remarks echo those made last week by American Airlines which, although
it returned an operating profit, was also hit by the widespread
price-cutting.
In the wake of domestic fare wars during the early summer, most analysts
have been braced for losses from the nation's biggest carriers. USAir ranks
as the sixth largest and has relatively little international business to
offset cut-throat business at home.
The quarterly loss was scored on slightly higher revenues, at Dollars 1.7bn
(Dollars 1.66bn), and came after net interest charges of Dollars 60.1m
(Dollars 60.4m). Nevertheless, USAir reported higher operating losses for
the second quarter, at Dollars 43.7m compared with Dollars 27.9m in the same
period of 1991.
The operating loss at the airline subsidiary alone was Dollars 53.5m,
against a loss of Dollars 45.3m a year earlier.
Revenues were 2.2 per cent higher at Dollars 1.58bn, and the passenger load
factor rose from 58.4 per cent to 59.9 per cent. However, the yield on
scheduled services fell from 16.98 cents to 16.21 cents.
USAir has recently been attempting to reduce its cost base but in the second
quarter two main items - labour and fuel - were only reduced by 2.6 per cent
and 3.1 per cent respectively.
However, Mr Schofield said benefits of the recent pilots contract, which the
airline claims will take Dollars 100m out of operating expenses, would be
felt in the third quarter.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Wellcome bolsters demand for issue: Drugs group will not
sell shares below 800p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME Trust, the charity which is selling around half its 73.5 per cent
stake in Wellcome, the drugs group, said yesterday that it would not sell
shares below 800p. It also said it would set the size of the issue with the
aim of creating a successful aftermarket.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank handling the global share sale, also
reported progress in identifying dealers who had sold Wellcome shares short,
thus pushing the price down and reducing the likely proceeds to the trust.
Although selling short is perfectly legal, there is some anger that these
dealers have profited at the trust's expense and they will not be allocated
stock in the sale, forcing them to buy in the market to close their short
positions.
One fund management group whose name was thrown up by Section 212 notices
sent out by the company was EBC AMRO International Investment Management.
Its pattern of dealings since May shows large sales of Wellcome shares and
then purchases at lower prices.
The trust's announcement was designed to bolster demand for the global
tender for the shares which closes at 5pm in London today. By suggesting
that supply of stock will be limited, the trust might encourage bidders for
stock to ask for more in anticipation of being scaled down.
Some institutions increased bids following the announcement. The shares rose
2p to 830p yesterday.
Investors putting in tender offers have to 'go firm' by the 5pm close. At
that point their bids must either state a fixed price in pence or be good at
the strike price set by the trust on the basis of demand for shares. The
strike price will be set over the weekend and trading will begin on Monday
morning.
Fund managers in the UK yesterday were positive about the shares. One said
of the company: 'Fundamentally it's a very sound story. It's an attractive
issue.' He said he expected the shares to perform well in the aftermarket.
Another said: 'We are positive about the sector and the company.' He aimed
to put bids in accepting the price set by the Trust.
In June the trust indicated that it would sell 330m shares, but reserved the
right to increase or reduce the issue size.
Originally it said it could sell as many as 417m shares which would cut its
stake to 25 per cent. It has said it would not proceed with the sale if
could not reduce its holding to below 50 per cent.

FT  24 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to know whether to be more astonished by Amstrad's proneness to
accident or its talent for survival. Yesterday's statement suggests that
pre-tax losses this year will total at least Pounds 65m on sales not much
over Pounds 300m. But the liquidation of stock which has largely produced
this result means that net cash now stands at over Pounds 100m compared with
Pounds 40m in February.
Aside from the general awfulness of the world market for personal computers,
the question is whether Amstrad has finally exhausted the potential for
designing and commissioning consumer electronic products in a market
dominated by vastly bigger rivals. If so, Mr Sugar will doubtless think of
something else to turn his hand to. How far he deserves backing from
portfolio investors is another matter.
More immediately, the shares at yesterday's 29p are on a yield of 6.4 per
cent, assuming a maintained dividend. On an earnings basis, the company
should not be paying a dividend at all. But a held payment would cost only a
tenth of the cash pile. As shareholders might reflect, Amstrad's recent
history suggests the money is a good deal safer with them than re-invested
in Amstrad inventory.

FT  24 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Wellcome share offer draws to a close today, its promoters might
reflect that their timing could have been a good deal worse. Since the bulk
of the proceeds are to be reinvested in equities, all that really matters is
that the shares should be sold at a high price relative to the market. Since
flotation, Wellcome's price has tripled in relative terms. Despite its
recent weakness, it is still higher against the market than at any time
outside the past 8 months. Given that, it is in the Wellcome Trust's
interest as a buyer of equities that the market should be as low as
possible. As any actuary at a life company will tell you, the point about
bombed-out markets is that they offer inflation-proofed income on the cheap.
The only real question for the Trust is therefore how many shares to sell.
The criteria were set out yesterday with admirable clarity. The minimum
price has been set at 800p as a warning to short sellers, thus setting the
maximum discount to yesterday's close at only 3.6 per cent. Thereafter, the
guiding principle in setting the price and quantity is that there should be
no discount in the after-market. For a seller which will end up with well
over a third of the equity, that seems a sensible precaution.
From a buyer's viewpoint, the immediate question is whether the sale process
has driven the price below the level which might naturally be expected from
such a huge increase in the free float. If not, a discount of 1-2 per cent
scarcely seems enough in today's volatile markets to justify a change in
stance towards the stock. Perhaps fund managers should also ask themselves
the following: if it is such a good deal for the Trust to switch out of
Wellcome into general equities, where is the attraction in doing the
reverse?

FT  24 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sentiment towards Euro Disney has turned so negative in recent months that
there is little shock left in its forecast yesterday of a net loss in the
current year. All the same, the omens are at first sight scarcely
encouraging. Attendance levels may be up on that achieved by other Disney
theme parks at a comparable stage, but the company faces an uphill struggle
meeting its target of 11m visitors in its first year. That depends on the
winter having only a limited seasonal impact on attendance levels, an
unlikely prospect when Euro Disney also runs the risk of being caught up in
any European economic slowdown resulting from upward pressure on interest
rates.
This only increases the need for the company to match its expenditure to the
level of business it eventually manages to attract. Costs were always bound
to be high in the early stages when Euro Disney had to be ready to receive
any number of visitors. Only when they have been cut and a clearer pattern
is established for visitor levels will it be possible to evaluate earnings
prospects and thus the share price. Original expectations look optimistic.
But with the shares 40 per cent below their peak in March, there is also a
danger of overdoing the pessimism.

FT  24 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: The Spanish two-step
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in Spanish interest rates do not have quite the same impact on the
UK that they might have had when the peseta was at its ERM limit against
sterling. It is thus tempting to dismiss yesterday's 60 basis point increase
in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate as largely a domestic affair,
prompted as much by continuing worries on inflation as by the Bundesbank's
recent monetary tightening. Just the same, the UK authorities cannot be
entirely comfortable at the growing list of European countries to have
reacted to the German move.
Besides Spain, these now include Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. Though
the latter two confined themselves to technical operations in the money
market rather than explicit rate rises, the impression is growing that the
trend of interest rates in Europe is upwards. As long as France holds its
own rates and Germany does not tighten further, the UK may manage to stay
aloof on the grounds of its weak economy and relative success in curbing
inflation. But it is still using up its credibility on the foreign exchange
market.
It has for a long time seemed unlikely that the exceptionally narrow
quarter-point differential between German and UK rates can persist once the
Bundesbank does eventually decide to relax. At that stage, UK rates will
almost certainly have to fall more slowly than German ones.
The more immediate danger is that of a Lombard increase after the summer
holidays if German money supply growth shows no signs of abating. The UK
would then not only be sucked into a further round of European rises. It
might have to go further than matching the actions of its partners.

   From Mr A H HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on performance-related pay schemes (Management, July 20)
points out their robustness and widespread use in the public and private
sectors. At Kent County Council we understand this durability. Pay of all
11,500 managerial and white-collar staff is linked to individual performance
appraisal.
In common with your article's definition of 'best schemes', we introduced
PRP in conjunction with other human resource management techniques and in
the context of a performance management system. It was coupled with a
properly thought-out system for training, rewarding and encouraging staff.
The key question is whether PRP enables performance management to become
part of normal management practice, linking performance measurement and
staff development in a sharply focused way.
Our experience is that PRP focuses attention on action plans and targets; it
brings home to line managers their accountability for people; and it sends a
clear message on the importance of performance standards in providing good
quality services. Unlike Coventry City Council we shall not be joining the
'tiny minority' which have abandoned PRP. A H Hart,

FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Conditions right for new funding policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ANDREW D BAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It appears to be received wisdom that underfunding the public sector
borrowing requirement would result in a rise in short-rates, owing to the
increased supply of Treasury bills, and a fall in gilts yields, owing to the
reduced supply of gilts.
It is true that gilts yields would fall, in so far as UK bond prices reflect
domestic supply and demand conditions as well as conditions in the
international capital markets. And higher gilts prices could be expected to
support UK equities and improve conditions in the new issue market - all of
which would help to speed up recovery from the recession.
But the notion that short-term rates would have to rise is false. These are
determined by Bank of England policy, enforced through its control of the
supply of 'cash', at levels governed at present by exchange rate
considerations. There is no reason why an increased supply of Treasury bills
(or more probably a reduction in the Bank's holding of commercial bills)
should cause the Bank to increase its dealing rates in the market. Only if
monetary expansion warranted interest rates higher than those required to
support sterling in the ERM would the Bank want to raise its rates.
It follows that underfunding need have no ill effects for the building
societies or mortgage rates. In current conditions, when broad money is
growing too slowly, the government's full funding policy should be replaced
by a policy of funding only as much as is necessary to ensure an acceptable
rate of monetary growth.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Debt and economic activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof MICHAEL LIPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agree with 99 per cent of Samuel Brittan's excellent article, 'Debt
work-out dangers' (July 13). However, there are two important 1/2 per cents
remaining.
First, the argument against 'debt deflation' theory can be greatly
strengthened, again for Keynesian reasons. When I repay debt (instead of
spending) out of extra nominal income, my creditor (instead of my supplier)
has more money. If my creditor is a bank, its monetary base is enlarged and
it can lend more, fuelling other people's spending on consumption or
investment. If my creditor is a firm (or household), then my repayment
permits more investment (or consumption) directly. Of course, the state of
confidence may be such that my creditor uses my debt repayment to increase
its savings, not its economic activity - or the exchange rate may be such
that my creditor uses my repayment to import. But, if so, that is not the
fault of 'debt deflation' but of 'low' levels of economic confidence - or
'too high' exchange rates. One person's, or institution's, debt repayment is
another's - the creditor's - receipts. Only to the extent that creditors
have a higher marginal propensity to consume (as opposed to saving or
importing) than debtors is there a 'debt deflation' brake on the growth of
economic activity.
Second, there is an important exception to Mr Brittan's judgment that
macro-economic policy options cannot affect the real economy. Options that
lead to significant, sustained rises in real long-term interest rates lead
economic agents to arrange their affairs so as to shift incomes more firmly
towards the present, and costs more firmly to the future, than was the case
at lower real long rates. This increases rates of resource depletion; and
reduces incentives both to adopt resource-saving methods of production and
consumption, and to discover new reserves of resources. In the long run,
this has a fairly dramatic effect on the real economy, viz. to destroy it.

It's nice to hear that Britain's economists, much maligned for failing to
predict anything very meaningful over the past few years, are doing
something practical to improve the trade deficit.
Oxford Economic Forecasting has just landed a juicy contract with China to
construct a computerised model of the country's economy over the next two
years.  And John Walker, Oxford's chief economist, is flying off to Beijing
soon to have a crack at the process. The fact that his initial training was
in chemistry - not in economics - will undoubtedly help.
But it is slightly less encouraging that the man who will thereafter do much
of the work is Walker's colleague Geoff Mean. This is the same Geoff Mean
who, when working for the Treasury in the 1980s, had a big hand in building
the government's model of how the UK economy works.
As the model has turned out to be far from accurate in its predictions about
the UK, we must hope Mean has learned from his mistakes. Or in the words of
an old Chinese proverb: 'May man meddling in models miss making muddles.'

The Spanish hosts of the Ibero-American summit are testing the visiting

Starting dinner last night at 10pm, the leaders were then scheduled to head
for a concert which started at 15 minutes after midnight.
Earlier in the evening, the schedule had appeared threatened by the blind
octogenarian president of the Dominican Republic, Joaquin Balaguer, whose
half-hour speech to the opening session overshot the seven minutes allowed
by a considerable margin. This looked like taking the spotlight from the
Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who everybody also feared would also make an
extended speech.
Castro, who on his first visit to the United Nations in New York, moved into
a hotel in Harlem and regularly ordered out for fried chicken, is allowing
himself a little more luxury these days. Along with other leaders, the
bearded president is holed up in the Ritz, which by no stretch of the
imagination is a proletarian hotel.

Matrix Churchill's plunge into receivership might raise a wry smile among
ageing students of Britain's machine tool industry. One of the receivers,
Philip Baldwin of Price Waterhouse, was also the man on the spot when Alfred
Herbert went down in the last recession, nine years ago.
Baldwin ended up selling the Herbert name and product range to TI Matrix,
which subsequently became Matrix Churchill and fell under Iraqi ownership in
1987. Four years later it was bought by Keith Bailey's Automation
Investments and shares the AI stable with BSA Tools - which, as White BSA,
tried to buy the Herbert assets back in 1983.
'It's an incestuous sort of business,' says Bailey who is soldiering on with
his BSA Tool business. Who knows, he might even try to salvage some of
Matrix's assets from the receiver - although in that case, he'd have to
contend with Baldwin who should have a better idea than most of what the
assets are worth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Time was when western tourists were apt to return from the Soviet Union
feeling literately inferior. Even the most ordinary citizens on public
transport and so on could be seen earnestly reading great classical works.
While this behaviour was often ascribed to some innate seriousness in the
national character, the reason was probably just a lack of what the public
really wanted. For, today, Pushkin et al have been given the push in favour
of thrillers, especially the erotic kind.
Whereas the Soviet culture used to be puritanical, and even faintly naughty
films and books were banned, sex is now busting out all over. For instance,
perhaps feeling upstaged by a 'Miss Big Bust' competition held in Estonia's
capital Tallinn, Moscow's sex-maniacs are showing their mettle with an
'erotic dance competition' to be held this weekend at the Ismailovo Sports
Centre.
Nevertheless, the organisers, a body called 'Culture and Health', insist
that the prizes on offer will be awarded for artistic merit, not simply
'vulgar display'. Moreover, they're taking pains to keep libidos from
boiling over.
Their plan is to break up the erotic dancing with interludes featuring well
known pop-stars - which, however strongly it testifies to the organisers'
social responsibility, does not say much for Russian pop.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUMMIT meeting in Madrid of the leaders of Spain, Portugal and Latin
America is laden with symbolism, 500 years after Christopher Columbus
arrived in the new world. Many of those present have good reason to
celebrate, including the hosts.
In contrast with a decade ago, democracy holds sway over much of Latin
America, a fact which owes an important debt to Spain's own transition from
dictatorship. There have been important advances too in economic policy in
Latin America which in many countries have provided a foundation for
sustained economic growth. The result is a wave of euphoria about Latin
America's future, notably in financial markets.
There are dangers in this change of sentiment: it fails to distinguish
adequately between economies of highly variable performance, and risks
ignoring some fundamental political and social questions which will have a
profound effect on their future economic success.
For this reason, the absences from the Madrid gathering are also
significant. The Venezuelan president, Carlos Andres Perez, who survived an
army coup attempt in February, was forbidden by his legislature to attend
amid a continuing crisis of political confidence. Alberto Fujimori, the
Peruvian leader who usurped constitutional rule in April, was forced to
remain at home as a Maoist terrorist group conducts a series of bomb strikes
in the heart of Lima. The Colombian head of state, Cesar Gaviria, postponed
his visit as the leader of a notorious drugs gang escaped from prison,
underlining the threat posed to the state by the drug traffickers. Among
those attending, Fernando Collor of Brazil is riding out a corruption
scandal at home which, at least, threatens to weaken him severely for the
rest of his term. And Fidel Castro, the spectre at the feast, hardly
provides the kind of democratic model the creators of these Ibero American
get-togethers can have had in mind.
Latin America's democracies are fragile, the institutions that support them
often weak or inadequate. Guiding the reforms needed to sustain growth and
deepen democracy requires a higher quality of leadership than Latin America
has traditionally received from its presidents.
Whether the Madrid summit can do anything significant to further such
objectives must be doubtful. Despite strengthening investment links with the
region, Spain's trade ties with Latin America are as yet marginal. Where
interests clash, there is no doubt, either, that Spain's priorities will lie
with the EC rather than its former colonies. Nevertheless, symbols have
their importance, as has the current meeting's stress on democracy and human
rights. If over time such gatherings reinforce Latin America's insertion
into the world economy and into enduring membership of the community of
democratic nations, then they will have their value.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The price of coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL deserves praise for its record profit last year of Pounds 170m.
After years of cost cutting, the corporation is now one of Europe's most
efficient producers, although it still cannot compete with prices on the
open world market.
It is ironic that these achievements should come at a time when British
Coal's future is so uncertain. The long-term coal supply contracts with
electricity generators, which account for more than 80 per cent of its
revenues, are up for renegotiation; for the first time they will be struck
at a commercial price, rather than one dictated by the government to prop up
the coal industry. With these new contracts in place, coal will be returned
to the private sector. Still more pit closures are inevitable.
The government is right to want to privatise coal as part of its so far
patchy strategy to allow market forces to restructure the UK's energy mix.
But British Coal has a point when it argues that it is being asked to
compete against other fuels whose prices are also artificially set. Nuclear
power has a protected status, which may or may not be altered when the
industry is reviewed in two years. Then there are the independent UK
electricity generators, which will be burning gas obtained on highly
favourable long-term contracts. Finally, there is the inadequately
competitive structure of the electricity generating industry, where two
unregulated giants may be able to crush British Coal in contract
negotiations.
This is not an argument for rethinking the privatisation of coal - or even
delaying it. It has to be recognised that coal is not an attractive fuel: it
is difficult and dangerous to obtain and it requires a lot of cleaning to
meet air quality standards. The most efficient open-cast mines are also the
least environmentally friendly. Coal's main advantage is that it is
plentiful, but security of supply is less of a concern than it was 10 years
ago, and Britain is fortunate in having abundant alternatives.
The government should therefore focus on two points. First, it cannot avoid
some interest in the coal contracts, given its importance for the size of
the industry and its value at privatisation. It would be a disaster for
ministers to revert to the old game of requiring a bloated price, but it
would also be unsatisfactory for the generators to use their powers to drive
a bargain with damaging long term consequences for consumers. The Office of
Electricity Regulation should be asked, exceptionally, to produce and
publish an analysis of coal's future in electricity generation, to help
government and other interested parties judge the proposed deal.
Second, Britain should use its EC presidency to press actions already
launched in Brussels against coal protectionism in other member states. EC
coal subsidies totalled Ecu10bn (Pounds 7bn) last year. Germany is a
particular culprit, as is Spain, where some mines produce coal at five times
the cost of British Coal.

FT  24 JUL 92 / The reins tighten on public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is living on its nerves. If it is lucky, the recession will
come to an end soon. Then it can make good its election promise 'to provide
an economic environment which encourages enterprise'. We would enjoy price
stability, 'firm control' over public spending and lower taxes. If that is
achieved at a bearable cost, Mr John Major and Mr Norman Lamont will have
earned their place in history as a remarkable duo. Wondrous accounts will be
written of the far-sighted statesmen who led Britain into a new era of low
inflation, steady growth, quality public services, a healthy lifestyle,
clean air, dozens of Citizen's Charters and a winning smile from breakfast
to bedtime.
Alternatively, the prime minister and the chancellor may be, shall we say,
thwarted by an absence of good luck. If that happens they will be seen as a
twin disaster, the Laurel and Hardy of British politics. They will be
remembered for failing to get out of the exchange rate mechanism, for
producing near-zero inflation at the cost of semi-permanent stagnation, for
running down public services, for making not one Briton healthier nor one
cubic centimetre of air cleaner, for meaningless charters and a winning
smile from Mr John Smith.
You have to choose between these alternative readings of what is going on
before you can make up your mind about the import of the decisions on public
spending announced on Wednesday evening. My view is that the government
believes (hopes? prays?) that the budget deficit can be brought permanently
under control - but that experience suggests otherwise.
Mr Major's ambition, as expressed in the Conservative election manifesto in
April and repeated on Wednesday, is 'to reduce the share of national income
taken by the public sector'. He is asking a lot. Over the past 30 years
government spending has more than doubled in real terms, but national income
has risen by less than 90 per cent. The effect is well-known. In 1963-64
state expenditure accounted for little more than 36 per cent of gross
domestic product. When Mrs Margaret Thatcher came to office in 1979, that
key ratio stood at some 44 per cent. It has been higher - above 48 per cent
in the mid-1970s and above 46 per cent in the early 1980s - and lower, down
to a fraction less than 40 per cent when Mr Nigel (now Lord) Lawson was
chancellor. But the way things are going it may be back up to 44 per cent
next year, which is where it was when the Tories came in 13 years ago. The
fiscal frontiers of the state will stand where they were when Labour was
last in office.
To save itself the embarrassment of that revelation, the government has
taken to pointing out that the ratio is misleading, since it rises naturally
during a recession, as growth falls. So it does. Ratios are therefore out;
firm intentions in. The new system of control that Mr Lamont will now impose
will allow for a maximum real growth in spending of some 2 per cent a year,
half a point below what the Treasury regards as the long-run potential of
the economy. This is to be achieved over the 'medium term', which means not
now, while growth is a memory, but for as long as it takes for something,
preferably business activity, to turn up. Then we can presumably return to
the ratio as a benchmark. It will look respectable again.
The essence of the new system is that it is 'top-down'. The cabinet will
decide, as it did this week, on the grand totals of future years' spending.
Then ministers who seek more for their departments will have to explain why
to those who must therefore get less. Not all parts of the mechanism are yet
in place. It is characteristic of the incremental, nuts-and-bolts approach
of Mr Major's government that this should be so. Top-down budgeting will
evolve, although it starts at once.
Bilateral discussions between the chief secretary, Mr Michael Portillo, and
individual ministers will continue but everyone will know that the outcome
cannot exceed Pounds 244.5bn for next year. In previous years the
'bilaterals' were the means by which the final figure was arrived at.
Success this year will depend on the government's determination not to be
moved from the number it first thought of. A special cabinet committee,
chaired by Mr Lamont, will presumably bring the main spending ministers
together so that in brotherly and sisterly affection they may trade favours
 -within the pre-ordained total. Mr Portillo will report to this committee.
There is a further wrinkle. For 1993-94 the planning total includes
unemployment benefit. If job losses are higher than forecast, other
departments will have to finance the consequent increase in the cost of
social security, or benefits will have to be cut. In the following years,
the 'new control total' will exclude unemployment benefit. Other departments
neither lose if it rises nor gain if it falls.
The change of system is important, but less revolutionary than it might
seem. In recent years the talk has been of getting 'as close as possible' to
the target, a loose control if ever there was one. But before 1987 Cabinets
affirmed their faith in planning totals and tried to stick to them. The
Labour party's election manifesto promised an autumn national economic
assessment, which would indicate how much could be afforded. This would be
adhered to, or, if necessary, taxes would be increased. Most businesses
understand budgeting to a prescribed cash total. The pre-1979 government of
Mr James (now Lord) Callaghan moved from real-terms, or funny money,
budgeting to departmental cash limits. Now a cash lid is being placed on the
entire UK enterprise, based not on a series of individual bargains but
predetermined by a calculation of what can be afforded.
The net result is that there are three bars to the iron cage into which the
grim optimists of Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street have locked themselves. They
propose to ratify the Maastricht treaty, just as soon as they can get it
through the Commons. They are pledged to stick within the ERM, whatever the
cost. The third bar clanged into place this week, when they published public
spending totals which they promise will not be exceeded.
The consequent 'cuts' may make them as unpopular as Mrs Thatcher ever was.
Even in departments where real spending rises, as in the health service,
there will be a chorus of anguish at the increases that might have been. In
British political parlance these are 'cuts'.
We can only applaud Mr Major and Mr Lamont's courage, or, if you prefer,
sympathise with their desperate plight.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: Alvin Ailey Dance Company - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 30 years Revelations is still there. When we first saw the Alvin Ailey
Dance Company in the Sixties, Revelations won our hearts. Ailey's response
to the spirituals which are his musical text, to the radiant faith and
urgent doubts of black religious experience, had - and still has - a
stunning directness.
The arms raised to the sky in supplication or joy; the sense of delight
combined with reverence in the scenes of baptism, as white-clad figures wade
through the waters; the contrast, as the work ends, between an awareness of
sin and the gospel fervour of a congregation of women with their floppy
hats, palm fans and long yellow dresses, are unerringly aimed at our
emotions, and unerringly touch them.
It is dance reaching out to its public on the most basic, and most artful,
terms. But for all its stylistic polish and theatrical astuteness - every
cliche brightly burnished - it speaks profoundly about black America's
faith. And it remains central to what Ailey sought in his American Dance
Theatre, in giving the broadest expression to popular dance and a people's
identity.
Returned to London after 17 years, with a new generation of dancers (and
with Ailey's star, Judith Jamison, as director) the company knows it is
still loved here.
It responded in its opening programme, which I saw on Wednesday at the
Coliseum, with that open-hearted, physically eager manner we have always
associated with Ailey's artists.
How good to see Dudley Williams, the company's senior principal, masterly as
ever in his control of 'I want to be ready' in Revelations, his body tautly
responsive to the song's plea for redemption.
How good, too, to find three men - Dwight Roden, Desmond Richardson, Troy
Powell - able to fly with the best through 'Sinner Man' in this same work,
movement given a whip-lash sharpness and speed.
Technically, the company looks fine, frank in its delight in performing
Revelations. Would that the other pieces in this first programme offered the
dancers any sort of artistic challenge, other than that of selling them to a
receptive audience.
Donald McKayle's District Storyville, which dates from 1962, purports to
deal with the emergence of jazz from New Orleans' bordellos and funeral
music.
It amounts to a sequence of scenes that are no more than garish post-cards.
Mourners strut; tarts flaunt; a bed serves as a trampoline for lovers, and
we see a few desultory bumps and grinds, those hallowed gyrations of
burlesque strippers. It is superficial, superficially busy, and, I would
have thought, far too patronising in its pursuit of quaintness.
Everyone works very hard, not least the London Gala Orchestra which has a
high old time with a raucous score. Marilyn Banks, as one of the soiled
doves in the bordello, has the smile and the zippy grace of Josephine Baker,
and is adorable.
The remaining piece is Donald Byrd's recent Dance at the Gym. Four girls and
four boys meet,and finally unite, to a tiresome and clanking accompaniment.
The movement proposes an artificial sexiness, and the dancers are trapped in
unenterprising routines that have little dramatic or emotional power; not
even the Ailey dancers' skills can make it seem anything more than an
expense of spirit in a waste of shame.
Happily, there is Revelations to follow, and the company thereby reasserts
its identity.
The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre is at the London Coliseum, (071) 240
5248, until August 1. Programme changes on Monday July 27.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: Double bill - London Promenade concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEDNESDAY brought the first of several double Proms this season: a whole
concert at 7pm, and another, shorter one at 10pm. For what will almost
inevitably be smaller audiences, and usually smaller-scale music, the BBC
decision to keep the second concerts in the Albert Hall this year instead of
planting them in modest venues nearby may be debatable; but the late
all-Villa-Lobos programme by the Lontano ensemble sounded terrific.
Their effervescent conductor, Odaline de la Martinez, must find an excuse to
give it again during the winter. In five contrasting works, it displayed the
composer at his reckless, engaging best - and Lontano too, and the BBC
Singers who appeared with them, and Anne Dawson's lovely soprano. To her, of
course, went the evergreen Bachianas Brasileiras no. 5 (the one with the
haunting vocalise over eight cellos).
Miss Dawson was not only ravishing in the first movement, but - with canny
assistance from de la Martinez - made subtler sense of its tricky successor
than we usually hear. The BBC Singers boldly essayed the original version of
Bachianas Brasileiras no. 9 ('for orchestra of voices'), and brought it off
with awesomely secure pitch.
They also joined the shivaree of Villa-Lobos's early Nonet: a
tongue-in-cheek label, for the nominal nine players are supported - nay,
crowded - by the substantial chorus and 18 percussion instruments, many of
them exotic. The young composer threw everything into the pot, and called it
'A rapid impression of the whole of Brazil". New to me was his still earlier
Quartet for harp, celesta, flute and alto sax - and female chorus to show
how much he admired Debussy's Sirenes.
Ravel looms even larger, and yet the piece fairly tingles with pungent
Villa-Lobos ideas. Just afterwards came his Choros no. 7, an irresistible
serenade for septet (plus a secret tam-tam, which booms gently and magically
through the penultimate verse). Lontano executed it more or less perfectly.
I should love to hear the whole programme again - especially if the BBC
could be persuaded to round it off with the choral Choros no. 10.
The earlier concert found Yan Pascal Tortelier also in full, stylish command
of his scores. Though he became Principal Conductor of the BBC Philharmonic
only last month, they played devotedly for him. Ravel's La Valse was adorned
with all the delicately decadent touches that 'international' bands miss
when they go through the piece like locomotives: soulful swoons from solo
strings, wicked woodwind gurgles.
Nothing was forced; nor in Dutilleux's cello concerto "Tout un monde
lointain. . .' either, where the marvellous Redon-like orchestral colouring
seemed to well up as naturally as Tim Hugh's lyrical phrases in the solo
role. (His aplomb survived a broken string at a particularly awkward point.)
The old Saint-Saens' warhorse, the 'Organ' Symphony which has long been a
Prom standby, boasted a poco adagio of great sweetness without saccharine.
Tortelier allowed no trace of vulgarity anywhere, however, and toward the
end of the Finale I began to doubt whether excluding cheap thrills was
altogether wise.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: Columbus - Royal Shakespeare Company, Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the song has it: 'They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said
the world was round. . . They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother when
they said that man could fly'. There are very few laughs in Richard Nelson's
play Columbus at the Barbican. Very few thrills either. Nothing indeed but
encircling gloom, which lasts for 3 1/2 hours. Has the Royal Shakespeare
Company really thought about what it is doing?
Nelson is an American playwright who has written for the RSC before. Some
people will remember his Two Shakespearean Actors. His Columbus, performed
on the main Barbican stage, is a disaster. We should be clear why.
No one is going reasonably to object about whether his version is
historically accurate. After all, there is poetic licence. The only test is
whether it stands up as a play. I can think of no single criterion on which
it does - certainly not on this stage and at this length.
The Nelson thesis is that Columbus was a snob and a creep. Possibly he was,
though it would help to explore the theme, not just proclaim it. This
Columbus is first seen getting out of bed with his mistress who appears
washing her legs.
As Columbus is promoted in the hierarchy, he drops the mistress because, he
says, it would not do for a member of the nobility to consort with a
peasant. His characterisation as totally obnoxious continues throughout.
Columbus is nasty to anyone who ever helped him.
There are no compensations. The language is appallingly stilted. When
Columbus says he is the Admiral of the Ocean Sea, he might as well be
mimicking a line from Gilbert and Sullivan about the Queen's Navee. There is
a sequence about a pornographic dream which ends with a touch of Brighton
pier: 'We won't have beans for supper again,' and some tougher garbage about
defecating at sea.
Even in the supposedly more serious parts, the language fails to take off.
When there is near-mutiny in the fleet about Columbus's lack of leadership,
someone remarks: 'I had hoped that we could settle this with some dignity.'
When they pass a volcano, Columbus comments: 'I saw the volcano in Sicily
when it erupted. It went on for days. You could read by the light.'
The sets, and this is a remarkable comment on the Barbican of all places,
are almost uniformly dreadful. Signs go up periodically to indicate the
changes in time: for instance, 'just off the Canaries, late August 1492',
then again 'later'. It looks like Euston station. The officers in their
cabins look like amateur sailors on a day out off Essex.
It is not remotely funny, or indeed particularly relevant, that Columbus
thinks he is going to Japan. The only part that develops is that of Pulgar,
a once wealthy landowner who is reduced to becoming Columbus's secretary. It
is well played by Philip Voss.
It would be unfair to criticise Jonathan Hyde as Columbus; it is just an
unspeakable part in an unspeakable play. Jane Gurnett as the mistress has
the misfortune (or perhaps the good luck) of disappearing early on.
Does all this matter? Yes. Here is the RSC using some of the same stage
devices it deploys so gloriously in Henry IV, and throwing them away on such
a text. It is a terrible come-down. The best thing to do about John Caird's
production is to forget it.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Technology: Athletes who are dying for glory - Scientists
compete with sportsmen to see who can detect and who can hide banned
substances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH millions of dollars of sponsorship at stake, greed will have driven
some competitors at this summer's Olympic Games to cheat by using banned
substances. Given that the side-effects of such medicines can be fatal, some
athletes may be literally dying to win.
After the Ben Johnson scandal at Seoul four years ago, when the Canadian
sprinter was stripped of his 100m gold medal after testing positive for
drugs, the International Olympic Committee's medical commission planned the
largest programme ever to catch such cheats.
During the Olympics fortnight about 2,000 urine samples will be taken.
Athletes will be tested randomly, as well as the first four finishers in
each event. Each sample will then be analysed by a new laboratory specially
built in Barcelona, with 75 staff working 24 hours a day.
The drugs for which the scientists will be looking fall into five classes.
They are:
Anabolic steroids. These are synthetic derivatives of the male hormone
testosterone. They work by boosting ribonucleic acid and protein production,
which in turn is converted into muscle. The additional muscle allows for
faster recuperation between training, permitting longer and harder training.
Stimulants used to invigorate the central nervous system, allowing the body
to tolerate higher levels of pain-causing lactic acid created during
exercise.
Beta-blockers which have a calming effect on heart rate and blood pressure
by obstructing the receptors that absorb adrenalin, so reducing its impact.
Competitors involved in archery and shooting are most likely to take them.
Narcotics and analgesics which act as pain killers, allowing athletes to
compete with injuries and reduce the risk of cramps.
Diuretics. These remove water from the body and can be used by boxers to
lose weight before a fight, or by all competitors to dilute urine in an
effort to hide other prohibited drugs.
In addition, the laboratory will be looking for masking agents which hide
the presence of other drugs.
Since the introduction of random sampling in 1986, the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) believes it has had some success in reducing abuse. In 1990,
more than 71,000 samples were tested worldwide by the 21 laboratories
accredited by the committee. Only 932 (1.31 per cent) proved positive
compared with more than 2 per cent between 1987 and 1989.
Over the same period, athletics achievements have fallen. The results of the
top 100 competitors in some events, particularly those involving women, have
been disappointing.
In women's athletics, for example, performances in throwing competitions
such as the discus, javelin and shot, as well as track events such as the
800m and 1,500m, have all fallen by as much as 5 per cent. It is difficult
not to conclude that a whole generation of athletics records is corrupt.
But while such figures suggest increasingly stringent testing is beginning
to have some effect, the potential rewards for successful athletes are so
huge that there remains a constant battle between competitors, desperate to
improve their performance artificially, and the scientists anxious to catch
them.
In spite of the technology available, the authorities admit there remains a
huge discrepancy between usage and detection.
A recent World Health Organisation survey concluded that as many as 20 per
cent of athletes have used drugs to boost performance. The survey, which
questioned athletes in Australia, Canada, Italy, the UK and US, showed that
about six per cent had used stimulants, steroids or diuretics over the
previous 12 months.
Detection has been complicated by the arrival of a new generation of
molecules available to sportsmen and women who want to cheat. There is now
little need for athletes to use easily detectable synthetic substances which
are becoming obsolete. Instead they can use natural molecules already found
in the body. So, if few athletes are tested positive over the next two
weeks, it may not be a sign that the scientists are winning, but merely that
athletes are becoming more sophisticated in their drug taking.
One of the natural substances is erythropoietin, known as EPO, which is a
natural hormone essential in the production of red blood cells. It is
normally produced by the kidney but is also manufactured artificially by
Amgen of California. By taking EPO, athletes boost the number of red blood
cells that carry oxygen and so boost stamina.
Tests in Sweden by Bjorn Ekblom, professor of physiology at the Karolinska
Institute, show that performance in endurance events can be improved by 10
per cent when using EPO. Another substance increasingly being used is
natural testosterone which is found naturally in both men and women.
Detecting both testosterone and EPO poses problems for scientists. Old-style
tests, which used to produce a simple response of either negative or
positive, are no longer sufficient. The problem is not testing for them,
since they are naturally present, but rather working out what the normal
level should be. Test results are now the subject of acrimonious debate as
scientists and lawyers dispute what represents a normal hormone balance.
When examining testosterone levels, the International Olympic Committee and
International Amateur Athletics Federation have both decided to compare them
with those of epitestosterone, another naturally occuring hormone related to
testosterone production. If testosterone levels are six times those of
epitestosterone, the competitor has probably been taking the hormone.
One potential way of by-passing many present problems is to introduce tests
on blood rather than urine. In theory blood should be easier to analyse.
Sports administrators are investigating the possibility, but there are
religious and cultural problems in implementation.
However, Michele Verroken, head of the doping control unit at the UK's
Sports Council, warns that blood testing is no panacea. At present,
scientists are used to dealing with waste products. With blood testing, they
would have to look at a far greater number of intermediate products. She
argues the results would be far from straight-forward.
The efforts of scientists are hampered not only by new drugs but also by the
failure of the relevant authorities to deal with the drugs problem
adequately. Most experts believe testing during competitions is a waste of
time because athletes are aware that they will tested. This gives them time
to stop taking the drugs and clean out their bodies.
The sports authorities are only beginning to come to grips with
out-of-competition testing. However, not even this is always effective.
Tests are often announced in advance, giving time for sportsmen to use a
catheter to clean their bladder or for a woman to conceal a condom with
clean urine.
At times there also appears to be a lack of political will from the sports
federations. Germany's Katrin Krabbe, the world champion for 100m and 200m,
and Butch Reynolds, the American 400m world record holder, were banned by
the International Amateur Athletic Federation, only for them to be
reinstated by their national authorities.
Michele Verroken says one of the main priorities is to close the loopholes
in drug-testing procedures. Such loopholes have allowed competitors, such as
Krabbe, to escape a four-year ban on a technicality.
Admittedly, testing is expensive. In the UK alone, the doping control
programme cost more than Pounds 700,000 last year, a 60 per cent increase on
the amount in 1988, the last Olympic year.
But doping costs more than money. The athletes who use drugs risk more than
ban. They risk their lives. The West German heptathlete, Birgit Dressel,
received more than 400 injections as she moved from 33rd to sixth in the
world rankings. It took three days for her to die from toxic poisoning from
the cocktail of drugs inside her body.
Drugs hurt not only competitors but sport, too. Drug abuse is only likely to
disappear when society and sponsors place less emphasis on winning. And that
is only likely to occur when the public kicks its own addiction to sport.

Hard water containing high concentrations of calcium bicarbonate can lead to
a build-up of calcium scale in household plumbing and water heating
equipment, reducing pipe diameters and lowering the efficiency of hot water
appliances and central heating systems.
Most conventional water-softening treatments rely on adding chemicals but
can create other problems by changing the chemical composition of the water
and making it too soft. Now a French company called Rauh has developed a
novel way to prevent scaling without using chemicals.
The Twin Master system uses electrical fields and magnetic or
electro-magnetic impulses to prevent scaling. It helps to create free-moving
calcium crystals that simply wash out of the tap.
The company claims that the water retains its valuable mineral salts but
costs less to heat and prolongs the life of household appliances and
plumbing. Rauh: France, 47 09 36 72.

Money may make the world go round, but it is grease that helps machine
bearings turn. Conventional low-friction enhancers like graphite have long
been used as lubricants, but they form layers of uncontrolled thickness and
provide only temporary protection.
Instead, an innovative lubricating grease called Micro Mu2 changes the
surface structure of metal by bonding a low-friction film just one molecule
thick on to it. The film permanently reduces wear in metal bearings and
enables them to run at higher loads, speeds and temperatures. The result is
longer machine life, reduced maintenance costs, higher productivity and
lower energy consumption.
Micro Mu2, developed by James Walker, the Surrey-based lubrication
specialist, comprises a hydrocarbon surface modifier carried in a
multi-purpose lithium-complex synthetic grease Independent tests show that
it reduces friction by 35 per cent over conventional lithium grease. James

A new type of airport radar system called a Precision Runway Monitor (PRM),

weather by permitting aircraft to continue to land simultaneously on closely
spaced runways.
PRM allows aircraft separation to be reduced safely because it provides
increased accuracy and more frequent position updates by using electronic
scan secondary surveillance radar. Allied-Signal's PRM uses electronic
scanning to provide controllers with position updates twice a second, or 10
times faster than conventional radar.

X-RAY machines used at airports for screening luggage are sophisticated but
the video images which they produce are often so unclear that operators have
difficulty interpreting them.
A new imaging system developed by a team at Nottingham Polytechnic, called
SecureScan, uses computer image-processing techniques to enhance the X-ray
picture. This enables the operator to see into black areas which might
conceal a weapon and into light areas where drugs or explosives, including
Semtex, might be hidden.
Because the Pounds 12,000 system bolts on to existing airport X-ray
equipment, rather than replacing it, it is relatively cheap and quick to
install. The Nottingham team developed the system on behalf of the UK
Customs and Excise authorities. Nottingham Polytechnic: UK, 0602 486491.

FT  24 JUL 92 / People: Stevenson takes on Takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dennis Stevenson, the violin-playing chairman of consultants SRU, continues
to climb the establishment ladder. The Governor of the Bank of England has
appointed him to be an independent member of the City Panel on Takeovers and
Mergers.
Stevenson, 47, who founded the Specialist Research Unit in 1972, is perhaps
less well known than one of SRU's other co-founders, Peter Wallis, the
sociologist who invented the Sloane Ranger tag. However, of SRU's three
founding partners - the other is Colin Fisher - Stevenson is credited with
having the best access to the boardrooms of SRU's blue chip clients. SRU, a
market research-based strategic consultancy, employs 45 staff.
Apart from being chairman of the Trustees of the Tate Gallery, Stevenson
sits on several boards, including Pearson (owner of the FT), Manpower Inc,
Thames Television and J Rothschild Assurance. As a non-executive director he

FT  24 JUL 92 / People: Jones to find business for Swedish market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lynton Jones, the former diplomat who founded the London outpost of Nasdaq,
the US over-the-counter market, is on the move again. He has been appointed
chief executive of OM London, the UK arm of Sweden's fast-growing electronic
options and futures exchange.
Olof Stenhammar, who founded OM seven years ago on his return from Chicago's
trading pits, is keen to increase the amount of international business done
through OM London which, along with OM Stockholm, operates as an exchange
and clearing operation.
The London operation has been hard hit by the recent abolition of Swedish
turnover taxes which meant that roughly 40 per cent of OM London's volume
has moved back to Sweden.
Jones, 47, who was head of public affairs at the London Stock Exchange
before he joined Nasdaq, has been given the job of finding new business.
OM London, which has a staff of over 20, lists options and futures contracts
on Swedish stocks as well as the Swedish OMX stock market index. A separate
clearing service is offered for interbank trading in interest rate futures
and in options and futures on the LDCx-index.
However, Jones' appointment suggests that OM is keen to broaden its base.
There is nothing, for instance, to stop it launching new products which will
compete with those on more established exchanges.
As a private sector operation - OM's shares are quoted on the Swedish stock
exchange - OM is able to make decisions about new products far more quickly
than some of its more bureaucratic competitors.
However, it is coming close to outgrowing its Swedish domestic market and
needs to develop new areas of business if it is to sustain its growth.
In his last annual report Stenhammar says that OM's international operations
are 'naturally not without risks' but notes that, 'if we succeed, we can
create something really big'.

FT  24 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Ship's post-bail arrest valid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINSENGRACHT
Queen's Bench Division
(Admiralty Court):
Mr Justice Sheen:
July 15 1992.
OWNERS OF a ship against which a writ in rem has been issued submit to the
court's Admiralty jurisdiction if, before the writ is served, they
voluntarily give bail for the purpose of avoiding the ship's arrest. And a
subsequent arrest despite bail is valid if it was not vexatious or
oppressive in that the plaintiffs believed it to be necessary to preserve
the jurisdiction.
Mr Justice Sheen so held when dismissing an application by the defendant
owners of Prinsengracht, to set aside the arrest of the ship by the
plaintiff cargo-owners.
HIS LORDSHIP said a writ in rem was issued by the cargo-owners against
Prinsengracht on April 15 1991.
It could not be served that year because she did not come within the
jurisdiction.
In January 1992 it was anticipated that Prinsengracht would enter an English
port.
On January 28 Clyde &amp; Co, the cargo-owners' solicitors, wrote to Holmes
Hardingham, solicitors for the shipowners, requesting security for the claim
in the hope that the need to detain the vessel could be avoided. They
enclosed a draft letter of undertaking for the shipowners' agreement,
confirming that they agreed that claims should be subject to English law and
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court.
Holmes Hardingham resp-onded by notifying Clyde &amp; Co that a bail bond had
been provided by the London Steamship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association.
By that bail bond the Association submitted to the jurisdiction of the
court, and consented to execution if the shipowners failed to pay any sum
adjudged against them.
On January 29 Holmes Hardingham, without waiting for the writ to be served
on the ship, acknowledged issue on behalf of the shipowners.
If the shipowners wished to take part in the proceedings, they were entitled
to do so by virtue of Order 75 rule 3(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court.
The rule provided that a defendant to an action in rem in which the writ had
not been served 'may, if he desires to take part in the proceedings,
acknowledge the issue of the writ . . .'.
There was nothing new in a defendant waiving the necessity of service. He
could enter an appearance as soon as he heard the writ had been issued,
although it had not been served.
At about 10.45am on January 29, an assistant solicitor for the shipowners
attended the Admiralty and Commercial Registry with a bail bond in the
correct form, and it was accepted for filing.
The next person at the counter was a clerk from Clyde &amp; Co, with the
documents necessary to effect an arrest.
The Admiralty Marshal phoned Clyde &amp; Co and asked if they wished to go ahead
with the arrest despite the fact that a bail bond had been filed. They said
yes. At 11.10am, the Marshal phoned HM Customs at Immingham. Prinsengracht
was arrested at 11.40am.
Mr Teare for the shipowners acknowledged that if Clyde &amp; Co had reached the
Admiralty Registry before Holmes Hardingham, the court would have had
jurisdiction.
He submitted that if a ship was arrested and then released a few minutes
later when bail was given, the court had jurisdiction; but if bail was
lodged a few minutes before arrest, the court did not have jurisdiction.
He said that followed from the Court of Appeal decision in the Deichland
(1990) QB 361.
Mr Kendrick for the cargo-owners contended that the shipowners had
voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction, and that the cargo-owners had
shown good and sufficient reason for the arrest even though a bail bond was
given.
The first question was whether the shipowners had voluntarily submitted to
the jurisdiction.
The writ was a writ in rem addressed to the owners and/or demise charterers
of Prinsengracht. The claim was within the High Court's Admiralty
jurisdiction.
An opportunity to serve that writ might never have arisen. The shipowners
took the voluntary step of acknowledging issue of the writ.
They thereby became party to the action which, from that moment, became in
personam as well as in rem.
By acknowledging issue of the writ, the shipowners voluntarily submitted to
the jurisdiction because they 'desired to take part in the proceedings'.
Their voluntary act in acknowledging issue of the writ at a time when no
action by them was called for because the writ had not been served, was the
clearest submission to the jurisdiction.
The next question was as to the nature of bail. DR Thomas on Maritime Liens,
p228 said bail was not a guarantee to the plaintiff, but an undertaking to
the court, and might therefore only be given following appearance in the
action. It said it fol-lowed that 'where bail is prov-ided there is on the
part of the res owner a concurrent submission of his personal liability
beyond the value of the res'.
That statement was adopted. It accorded with what had always been the
practice of the court, and was reflected in RSC Order 75 rule 6 which
provided that a person entering a caveat against arrest must acknowledge
service and give bail or pay into court.
In the Deichland the shipowners' club had given a letter of guarantee but
had not agreed to submit to the jurisdiction. The ship had been served but
not arrested.
The court held that the jurisdiction given to it by Article 7 of the 1952
Arrest Convention was only preserved by Article 57 of the 1968 Jurisdiction
and Judgments Convention as rel-ating to a 'particular matter', if there was
an arrest. But that did not rule out jurisdiction by express agreement (see
the Deichland, 385 G) or by submission to the jurisdiction (382 H).
Contractual security might be given without submitting or agreeing to submit
to the jurisdiction, as in the Deichland.
But bail could not be given without submitting to the jurisdiction.
There was no reference to that in the Deichland because it was not relevant.
It would be absurd and it would bring the law into disrepute if a defendant
could procure a bail bond in which there was a solemn undertaking to satisfy
judgment, and then say to the plaintiff 'you cannot obtain judgment because
you cannot arrest my ship and I have not submitted to the jurisdiction'.
That was not the effect of the decision in the Deichland.
The shipowners, by acknowledging issue of the writ, had shown their desire
to take part in the proceedings. They were free to do so. They had submitted
to the jurisdiction and the motion must fail.
In case a higher court held that the shipowners had not submitted to the
jurisdiction, the next question was whether the arrest was valid.
Mr Teare submitted that on provision of bail the ship was released from the
action and could not be arrested. He relied on Dr Lushington's judgment in
The Wild Ranger (1863) Br and L 84,87 - 'bail given for a ship in any action
is a substitute for the ship'.
It was held in the Arctic Star, February 1985, CA that the rule that bail
represented the ship and that she should be free from further arrest on the
same claim, was viewed in the light of whether it was oppressive and
vexatious to re-arrest.
In the present case there had only been one arrest, which lasted less than a
day.
It was not vexatious or oppressive. The ship was arrested solely because the
shipowners declined to agree expressly to submit to the jurisdiction, and
because it was thought the Deichland decision might have made it necessary
to arrest her though bail had been given.
In looking after the cargo-owners' interests, it was natural for Clyde &amp; Co
to make sure they did everything necessary. If arrest was necessary to
preserve the jurisdiction, it could not be wrongful.
If contrary to the court's view bail could be given without submitting to
the jurisdiction, and it remained necessary for the cargo-owners to arrest
the ship, that arrest could not be unlawful.
The motion was dismissed.
For the cargo-owners: Dominic Kendrick (Clyde &amp; Co).
For the shipowners: Nigel Teare QC and Simon Kverndal (Holmes Hardingham).

FT  24 JUL 92 / Management: Visionary with a wooden raincoat - Lucy Kellaway
meets Stuart Lipton at the village pump / My Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you visit the fifth floor of Landsdowne House in London's Berkeley Square
you are in for a very special experience. The headquarters of Stanhope
Properties is more than just another lavish office, fitted out in those far
off days three years ago when money was no object.
Contrary to appearances, it is not an office at all. It is a village. Stuart
Lipton, the head of the company and visionary of London's property market,
explains that the corridor stretching from the reception area is actually a
street. The place where you sit on stylish leather chairs, surveying the
design magazines on the minimalist glass table, is no simple waiting area.
'Our reception represents the heart of our little village. It is a soft
place where visitors could talk to each other', he says.
The significance of every last detail has been thought out. What might seem
a fussy mixture of glass, tiles, steel, light wood, dark wood, stone and
plaster is yet another concept: of building itself, with all main materials
represented.
To those who think of their places of work in terms of desks, chairs and
secretaries, Lipton's chatter about warm feelings of offices may be
difficult to understand. Yet Lipton thinks he 'helps people to demistify
buildings'.
He has done that with many acclaimed new developments, including Broadgate
in the City of London. His battle cry is about good design, about the need
'to produce a building with a friendly disposition. The culture of the
building should be such that people want to brush against each other'.
In Stanhope's offices - almost empty on the afternoon I was there - this can
either be done in the 'street' or in the post room, which Lipton describes
as a 'very social area in which there are no formalities'. The room, in
which a couple of secretaries were chatting, also contains the coffee
'station', which he says is 'like the village centre'.
Unlike most villages, the Stanhope offices are crammed with works of art.
Lipton makes much of this: he is on the board of the Royal Academy, is a
trustee of various modern art galleries and was involved in building the
Sainsbury wing of the National Gallery. 'Life is about art and
architecture,' he says.
The most striking piece in his own office (or 'private realm' as he calls
it) is a life-size raincoat and umbrella carved out of wood, hanging on one
wall.
'Ninety per cent of the people who come in here go for the timber. It's
because it's meaningful. We all like soft issues.' A large Miro print hangs
above his desk, and on the wall next door is a brown modern canvas, the
details of which he has forgotten.
Everyone in the company has a piece of art or objet in their offices, which
they have selected from a collection chosen by Lipton. 'I don't think art is
a democratic business', he says. 'It should be searching and demanding.'
Thus Lipton has chosen a large collection of abstract canvases, carpets to
be hung on the wall, wooden bowls, and small model snooker tables.
The art, he says, is an antidote for the computer screen. Lipton is such a
believer in the computer that he has dispensed with paper in his office.
There is no clutter among his objets; his stylish glass in-tray is almost
empty.
His oval conference table has nothing on its grey marble surface save an
ethnic copper bowl. The more comfortable area with swish leather chairs and
sofas is equally bare of paper, save a few design periodicals.
On every surface in the room is a telephone. This is another detail designed
to make the visitor comfortable: 'A lot of visitors get calls here, and they
don't want the formality of talking at a chap's desk.'
On the whole, Lipton is pleased with the general effect of the Stanhope
offices, although he is a little sheepish about the size of his own (the 300
sq ft, he estimates, is on the conservative side). Indeed, both the space
and the heady rent paid strike an odd note with Lipton's emphasis on
squeezing full value out of every square foot.
'The office is a bit dated,' he admits, surveying the stark modernity. 'If I
was doing it again the room would be smaller, the meeting area would be in a
different room, it would be more open plan.'
Indeed, on his view of the future, he would be lucky to have an office at
all. His new concept is that of an hotel, full of facilities and with
employees checking in and out. Each worker would have an electronic card,
which as they enter the building would assign to them a desk and a telephone
number. At Stanhope, they would doubtless also be allocated for the day
their own timber sculpture.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Management: Transparent move to European unity - Christopher
Lorenz observes Pilkington's tricky balancing act in its new Brussels
headquarters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine months ago Pilkington, Europe's second-largest glass maker, shattered
the illusions of many conservative insiders by becoming one of the first
British companies to relocate the headquarters of its core business from the
UK to the heart of Europe's incipient 'single market'. It announced that
direction of the European part of its big flat and safety glass interests
was being moved to a small unit in Brussels from its totem-like HQ on
Merseyside, deep in England's north-west.
At the same time it revealed a much-needed slashing of overheads: a net
reduction of 250 in its 500-person corporate head office on Merseyside; 120
jobs were decentralised, leaving the HQ only 130-strong.
Yesterday, 24 hours after a sombre annual general meeting, it delivered
another surprise: it is reinforcing in unexpected fashion the European
structure it announced internally only a few months ago.
From the start, Pilkington's task in Brussels was a delicate managerial
challenge: the creation of an integrated, European-minded operation out of a
set of mainly nationalistic subsidiaries, notably its truculent German
offshoot, Flachglas. The latter's minority shareholders were bought out only
in 1989, after nine years of tension under majority British ownership. The
situation was not helped by Flachglas's size: twice as large as Pilkington's
equivalent glass operations in the UK.
Against this unpromising background, Pilkington embarked on the integration
process with considerable diplomacy, while leaving no doubt who was now
boss.
For a start, Brussels is an obviously neutral location. Then, between
December and June, Pilkington gradually outlined the tactful structure and
staffing of the 35-person Brussels organisation, called 'Flat and Safety
Europe'. After a lengthy gestation period, the office opened officially last
week.
Under the chairmanship of Glen Nightingale, a main board director of the
parent company - who also has responsibility for the group's North American
flat and safety glass interests - five directors of market-orientated
European 'business lines' were created. Only one of the five men is British:
the chief executive of the existing UK glass company who now also has the
European mandate for basic glass. There is one Finn and three Germans,
including the Flachglas board spokesman, who now also has European
responsibility for special glasses.
The nationality balance was given a slight tilt towards the British by the
appointment of three English functional directors - for marketing,
technology and finance.
Only two are based full-time in Brussels: the financial and marketing
directors (the latter is an old hand and Nightingale's right-hand man).
Nightingale expects the business line directors to be travelling for up to
70 per cent of their time, so he saw little point in uprooting them and
their families. But, in addition to board meetings, he has declared a series
of monthly 'Brussels days', when everyone has to be there to mix informally.
Nightingale expects it to take up to another two years for each national
company to be integrated into the new European structure, under their
respective business line directors. This is partly to avoid overloading the
people concerned, but it is also because some of the national companies have
not yet moved fully to a market-based structure allowing clearly defined
responsibilities to be transferred to Brussels. Flachglas, in particular, is
still converting from its typically German functional structure.
It is the complexity and intricacy of the European reorganisation which
caused yesterday's surprise: the appointment under Nightingale of a
full-time chief executive of Flat and Safety Europe, who will take up
residence in Brussels from October.
Companies with more European experience may be surprised that Pilkington
could have hoped to accomplish proper integration without someone in such a
post. Nightingale may be a powerful character, but it was over-optimistic to
expect him to drive the tricky integration process by spending just two days
a week in Brussels.
With hindsight, he now realises that 'the man to whom the business line
directors report needs to be based in Brussels - to cause that to be the
centre of things. It's no good having a visiting leader - he has to be on
the ground'.
There was a second surprise in yesterday's announcement - that the chief
executive will not be a European, but a South African, 52-year-old Brian
Young. He has worked for Pilkington since 1967, mostly in Southern Africa,
but for the past two years as chief executive of Pilkington Australia.
Again, the appointment has the benefit of neutrality, but some of the
Germans may be discomfited by an Anglo-Saxon above them.
Nightingale admits there has been some 'disquiet' that the business line
directors will no longer, as originally planned, report straight to a main
board director. But he says they know and respect Young.
The new man certainly faces a challenging task. Without submerging the
national identities which have given Pilkington's constituent companies
strong leadership in many of their markets - though not in southern Europe -
he must exploit cross-frontier economies of scale much more effectively than
over the past decade. Given all the sensitivities, that will create quite a
thorny menu for him and his Brussels colleagues to master.

FT  24 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Improvement in quay quality - Salford's
docks, like London's, suffer from empty offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago, Manchester's Salford Quays epitomised the ugly face of
industrial decline. The heart of what was once the country's third-largest
port lay derelict and vacant. Its docks were deserted and its warehouses
were a haven for rats. The canal was so badly polluted that someone falling
in was alleged to be more at risk of dissolving than drowning.
This was the unpromising crucible of one of the 1980s' most significant
experiments in urban regeneration. In place of the decaying docks, there are
now a hotel, cinema, flats, offices, promenades, green areas and sweeping
vistas across canal basins. The water is clean enough to fish in.
The transformation of Salford Quays provides a parallel with London's
Docklands, the best-known example of the achievements and the difficulties
of inner-city regeneration, although on a far smaller scale. The two areas
have been moulded by similar forces: the decline of their docks, enterprise
zone tax breaks, government-funded land reclamation and the property boom.
There are also physical similarities between the two former docklands: the
neat street furniture, the colourful brick roads and the bijou, toy-town
architecture, which already looks dated.
Both areas were governed by enterprise zones, set up by the government to
offer tax incentives to investors. In Salford Quays, the Enterprise Zone
expired in August last year, delivering so much new office space on to the
market that its vacancy rate exceeds that of London's Docklands.
About 800,000 sq ft out of a total of 1.2m sq ft lies empty, according to
Lambert Smith Hampton, the chartered surveyor. The empty space is
concentrated in three buildings: Manchester Ship Canal Company's 116,000 sq
ft Harbour City, AMEC Properties' 247,000 sq ft building called The
Anchorage, and Charter Group's 530,000 sq ft Exchange Quay.
Charter Group's building has a close relative in the London Docklands, where
the same company has erected a 503,452 sq ft building at Harbour Exchange.
As well as physical similarities - both buildings are dark-glass behemoths -
they have been a similar drain on financial resources.
Charter Group sold the buildings to investors in Enterprise Zone Trusts,
having guaranteed to pay the rent and running costs until tenants moved in.
The developments have so far been unable to attract sufficient tenants, and
Charter cannot meet its obligations to investors.
'Charter . . . is unlikely to meet its obligations and accordingly the Trust
will be forced to pay these costs . . . ,' said the Property Enterprise
Trust's managers in a letter to Exchange Quay's investors last month. An
additional difficulty is that, even if the scheme does attract a tenant, it
is unlikely to be willing to pay the Pounds 15 per sq ft guaranteed by
Charter Group. The market rate at Salford Quays, after taking account of
incentives, is Pounds 10 per sq ft at most.
While London Docklands has suffered partly from its location, some distance
from the City, Salford Quays is close to Manchester city centre and well
served by roads and buses.
However, London Docklands' well-publicised problems in securing the Jubilee
Line extension have similarities - on a far smaller scale - with the
extension of the metro to Salford Quays. The Salford extension would cost
Pounds 17m - 100 times less than the Jubilee Line extension  - but it has
foundered for the same reasons. It would need a contribution from private
developers, which are in no position to provide the funds.
There are also questions being asked over whether the construction of
waterside flats and offices does enough for impoverished local communities.
This point was highlighted a few weeks ago when there were disturbances in
the surrounding area of Ordsall.
Salford Quays' supporters, however, stress its human scale, and contrast it
with the London Docklands. As Mr Stephen Pressman of Dunlop Heywood, a firm
of surveyors with an office in Salford Quays, said: 'We are only two miles
west of the city centre. You can go by car into the heart of the city in 10
minutes . . . It is more planned; there is a greater sense of identity.'
The planning was carried out at the behest of Salford City Council, which
has been one of the driving forces behind the regeneration of the area. The
operation began at the start of the 1980s, when it purchased much of the
land on Salford Quays for Pounds 1.7m from the Manchester Ship Canal company
and secured derelict-land finance from the Department of the Environment.
In 1985 it commissioned Shepheard, Epstein and Hunter, a firm of architects
and planners, to produce a development plan. It drew up proposals to reclaim
the area by constructing canals and quays, and putting in roads, pedestrian
routes and landscaping.
The canal was dammed and divided into basins, thus reducing the scale of the
dock and making it more suitable for development. 'The water constitutes an
asset which should be exploited with the same spirit of enterprise shown a
century ago with the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal,' said the
architects.
By March 1991, the council, aided by government grants, had put in Pounds
30m of infrastructure, while the private sector's investment in industrial,
residential and commercial buildings, a cinema and a hotel totalled Pounds
250m.
The ambitions of the developers grew considerably in the late 1980s, to a
level that many critics think was unrealistic. Mr Mike Butterworth, property
director of the Manchester Ship Canal, developer of the massive Harbour City
scheme, disagrees. 'If you look at the history of Salford Quays, it started
with small industrial buildings. Gradually the quality and use has improved.
This is merely the next stage,' he said.
He conceded that the letting market was in a difficult state, but said he
took comfort in the minimal land costs of the building and his company's
decision to treat it as a long-term investment. 'We are not looking for a
quick buck,' he said.
That is probably just as well. Even enthusiasts reckon it will take three to
five years to absorb the space in the Salford Quays market. Although
Manchester as a whole is not burdened with an oversupply of office space,
hopes that the property market would benefit from relocations from outside
the area have subsided.
The eventual verdict on Salford Quays will depend on its success at
attracting occupiers. 'At the start, people were sceptical,' said Mr
Pressman. 'It was Salford docks and there wasn't much cachet about Salford.
But it has established itself and people who come down here like it.'
Mr Roger Rees, chief executive of Salford City Council, points out that the
area is now employing 3,000 people - as many as the docks employed in their
heyday.
Mr Rees wishes that the metro had been installed at the outset, but he is
enthusiastic overall. 'As an example of the conversion of decaying, derelict
docklands in modern uses, then I think it has been successful by 20th
century standards,' he said.
His dream is to crown the achievements of Salford docks by building a Pounds
34m arts complex for opera, ballet and galleries, which would house the L S
Lowry collection on the last significant site on the Quays. The plans were
unveiled last week. If this is ever built, the building would be the last
work of its architect, Sir James Stirling, who died earlier this month.

THE Welsh property market ended 1991-92 on a positive note even though the
year and its predecessor had been two of the worst in the market since the
late 1950s, Mr Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of the Land Authority for Wales,
said yesterday.
He said when presenting the authority's annual report in Cardiff that the
organisation had made a profit of Pounds 3.3m before tax last year on
turnover of Pounds 9.1m.
That showed a rise in profit of Pounds 400,000 over the previous year on a
turnover which was Pounds 500,000 lower.
However, encouraging signs included the announcement of a new community
development with some 2,000 houses and light industrial and retail areas on
a 370-acre site in Cardiff, and the involvement of the property arm of
Boots, the retail chain, in the redevelopment of the town centre in
Caerphilly.
The authority was set up in 1974 to help development in Wales by putting
together packages of land. It is particularly active where the private
sector has difficulty acquiring land and is the only body of its kind in
Britain.
It took 14 years to assemble the land for the Cardiff development.
Mr Inkin said the authority would 'maintain an even more imaginative
programme this year' in order to prepare the foundations for recovery once
the national economy picked up.
Mr Bernard Ryan, chief executive, said that as a result of its land sales
last year 'a potential development investment in Wales of Pounds 70m would
come about'.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Building societies are 'stronger than thought'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUILDING Societies Commission said yesterday that the societies are in a
much stronger financial position than is generally realised in spite of the
crisis in the housing market, David Barchard writes.
In its annual report, the commission, which regulates the industry, said the
capital strength of societies had risen since 1990. The average risk/asset
ratio for the industry was 11.8 per cent against 11.2 per cent in 1990 -
well above the international minimum of 8 per cent.
The commission said societies had shown sense and resolve in confronting the
problems in the housing market. At the end of the first quarter of 1992,
7.06 per cent of loans were in arrears of over six months and 1.75 per cent
of loans had become repossession cases. Provisions against mortgage losses
rose from Pounds 450m in 1990 to Pounds 1.22bn in 1991.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Gaviria attacked over drug baron's escape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESCAPE from jail by Mr Pablo Escobar, the Medelln cocaine cartel chief,
on Wednesday morning has demolished the cornerstone of Colombian President
Cesar Gaviria's anti-drug policy. Mr Escobar's negotiated surrender, just
over a year ago, was hailed as a government victory by most Colombians, few
of whom saw it as an ignominious submission.
Now a storm of criticism has broken out, with leading politicians calling
for the president's resignation. Mr Enrique Parejo, a former justice
minister who nearly died in a drug cartel attempt on his life in Hungary,
said the escape showed the government's drug policy as a 'total failure' and
the president without 'all moral authority.'
Mr Escobar seems to have escaped amid a gun battle while the army's special
forces were trying to recapture the jail, near the city of Medelln. He and
his associates had seized the director of prisons and the deputy justice
minister when they entered the jail on Tuesday evening to tell Mr Escobar
that he and his men were to be transferred.
With the collusion of the prison guards, Mr Escobar's men remained in
control of the jail through the night until the army broke in.
In the ensuing mayhem, the director glimpsed a group of men in gas-masks -
perhaps the last sighting of Mr Escobar and his associates. Reports that he
was holding out in a tunnel under the prison appear to have been a red
herring.
The Gaviria government's policy of encouraging traffickers to surrender and
confess their crimes, in exchange for lenient sentences and exemption from
extradition to the US, was meant to stop drug terrorism. The car bombs,
assassinations and kidnaps that punctuated the war on drugs in Colombia did
stop after Mr Escobar had surrendered last year; there was a collective sigh
of relief and little talk of the political cost.
Mr Escobar seems to have expected to serve a short sentence - perhaps three
years - and go free. But his confession to a single trafficking crime, of
which he had already been convicted in France, made a mockery of the justice
system. More than 17 investigations of his activities were in hand, and he
was accused of having ordered the murder of a Bogota newspaper editor, Mr
Guillermo Cano, among others.
His unwillingness to confess to other crimes, thus breaching the terms of
his surrender agreement, meant he had effectively forfeited the right to
leniency and might have to serve 20 or 30 years.
Mr Gaviria said the government had decided Mr Escobar should be transferred,
having received evidence that he was continuing criminal activities from
jail.
National and foreign intelligence sources had been saying for months that Mr
Escobar ran the prison on his own terms and continued to direct
cocaine-trafficking operations.
The final straw for the government seems to have been the kidnap and murder
of traffickers who had worked under Mr Escobar's umbrella but were, he
believed, getting too big for their boots. Several of these 'known
criminals' visited Mr Escobar before their disappearances.
Mr Gaviria has said that Mr Escobar's life will be respected if he gives
himself up and, fearful of a revival of the Medelln cartel's drug terrorism,
politicians are already talking of negotiating a new surrender.
His prison stronghold suited Mr Escobar in many ways, particularly because
enemies in trafficking organisations wanted to get rid of him and the police
were unhappy about the surrender policy.
But it is clear he had contingency escape plans: now it is thought he will
remain where he has the best cover - in his own trafficking structure.
The government's incompetence and shame at home and abroad will have
far-reaching consequences. Congress is set to investigate not only the
bungling of the military operation during the escape but also the absurdity
of the luxury in which Mr Escobar was held.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Perot sees US on edge of depression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROSS PEROT is warning that the US 'is on the edge of a severe recession
or depression', avoidable only by adoption of tough measures as soon as
possible.
In his first newspaper interview, with the Los Angeles Times, since dropping
his undeclared presidential candidacy a week ago, the Texas billionaire
promised to keep speaking out, trying to make those seeking public office
face up to economic realities.
His own economic revitalisation proposals would be published perhaps next
week. These are known to include a five-year plan to balance the budget by
combining sharp rises in consumption taxes and steep cuts in federal
subsidies and entitlements, including social security.
Mr Perot painted a dire picture of prospects for the US, unless decisive
action were taken. 'If we have an economic catastrophe, tens of millions of
ordinary people, of the type that signed petitions (to get his name on the
election ballot) will be devastated. It will probably take us 20 years to
recover.'
He foresaw the complete collapse of the financial establishment, with banks
and mortgage finance companies all going under. 'Then, if huge numbers of
people are out of work, huge numbers will lose their homes and all the
federally guaranteed home mortgages will kick in and that will have to be
paid for, when people don't have work and the tax base is deteriorating.'
Mr Perot has been criticised for abruptly withdrawing from the presidential
race, though given credit for speaking out, albeit without supplying
details, on economic policy. He had found the political process 'brutal,
brutal, brutal and intrusive'. He sympathised with the ordeal already faced
by Governor Bill Clinton, his wife and daughter. 'Are we so involved in a
game that we've lost sight of what's good for our country?'

FT  24 JUL 92 / Mexico to privatise airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO is to sell concessions to manage the country's airports and sea
ports, deepening its commitment to privatise much of basic national
infrastructure.
The Airports and Auxiliary Services revealed that the first airports to be
sold are likely be those at the Caribbean resort of Cancun and the
north-western city of Tijuana, on the US border. Both require new terminals.
The government hopes the private sector will make the investment needed.
Few details have been revealed but Mr Carlos Cardenas, head of the national
chamber of construction, told El Economista newspaper that airport
concessions for up to 20-30 years are likely to be sold. Foreign investors
will almost certainly be welcome.
The scheme will be similar to that of concessions granted for building toll
roads, he said. The government has already granted concessions for more than
3,500 km of toll roads, at an estimated cost to the private sector of about
Dollars 5bn.
Last month, the Mexican company PACSA issued Dollars 312.7m (Pounds 163.7m)
of highway bonds to finance the Mexico City-Toluca motorway. Some Dollars
207.5m of the bonds were acquired by international investors. This was the
first time such bonds have been sold outside Mexico.
The transport and communications secretary said this month that Mexican
ports needed to follow Singapore's example. The minister earmarked for
privatisation the ports of Lazaro Cardenas, Manzanillo and Topolobampo on
the Pacific coast, and those of Veracruz, Tampico and Progreso on the east
coast.

FT  24 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Paris court stubs out Cuba cigar brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of the Cuban cigar trade in Europe has been thrown into doubt
after a French court barred the import of three leading brands because of a
trademark violation. The three brands are Monte Cristo, H. Upmann and Por
Larranaga. According to Seita, France's largest tobacco goods distributor,
these marques comprise about 50 per cent of French Cuban cigar imports of
7.7m.
However, Cuba pledged yesterday that the court ban would not deprive
connoisseur French smokers of their cigars.
Cubatabaco, the state tobacco agency, said it would send other prestigious
Havana brands to replace the three banned names.
Mr Patrick Clayeux, a senior manager for Seita, said yesterday the company
would stop distributing the three brands on August 14. All retail sales must
stop by September 7. Surplus stocks would be withdrawn from retail outlets.
In addition, Seita is obliged to stop production of Mini-Montecristo 'whiff'
cigars, manufactured in France with imported raw Cuban tobacco.
The landmark lawsuit, settled recently in a French appeals court ruling,
stems from a dispute over the ownership of the three famous brands, whose
proprietors fled Cuba following the 1959 revolution. Cuba, under Cubatabaco,
has continued their manufacture since. In 1976, the former owners sold the
marques to Cuban Cigar Brands (Curacao) of the US, which launched the
orginal challenge in various international courts. CCB in the late 1980s
sold the non-US use of the brand names to Tabacalera, the Spanish
distributor, which now controls them for all non-US business.
Mr Clayeux said that officials from Seita, Tabacalera and Cubatabaco had
held a series of meetings to enable the French group to resume sales, but
the dispute remained unresolved.
Cuba's struggling economy earns Dollars 100m a year from tobacco exports.

FT  24 JUL 92 / World Trade News: The painful rush to sew up Nafta pact -
Bush may want to present free trade deal to Congress in time for the
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE ministers from Mexico, Canada and the US meet tomorrow in Mexico City
in an attempt to resolve their outstanding differences over the proposed
North American Free Agreement (Nafta) so that a text of an agreement can be
initialled by the end of the month.
The flurry of activity, and the spate of concessions Mexico has made in
recent weeks, suggests that President Bush may still want the option of
presenting an agreement to the US Congress before the November 3
presidential elections. 'The only reason to be hurrying up at this late
stage is if they want to sign before the elections,' argues Mr Timothy
Bennett, chief adviser in Washington for the Mexican private sector.
Mexico has helped the frequently stalled negotiations gather momentum by
making a series of key concessions. In return, it has received the promise
of an end to US steel and textile quotas, agreement on food and health
standards, the establishment of a trinational panel to settle disputes, and
the gradual elimination of already low US tariffs.
The Mexican concessions appear more telling, in part because, as the most
protected economy, Mexico has the most to give away. The government is also
run by committed free-marketeers, who would, even in the absence of Nafta,
probably have made many of the concessions unilaterally.
In one of its earlier concessions, the government agreed to let foreigners
own 8 per cent of banking assets in 1993, with no single bank allowed more
than 1.5 per cent of assets. Each year the ceiling will increase by one
percentage point until the year 2000, when the then 15 per cent limit will
be scrapped. However, foreign banks which exceed a certain size will not be
allowed to grow through acquisitions, while Mexico will be guaranteed
control of the national system of payments.
The Mexicans have also agreed to open all but 14 petrochemical products to
foreign investment immediately, and of these another nine will be opened up
in three to five years. This would leave just five of the current 19
products in the hands of the Mexican state.
While the Mexican government has adamantly refused to let private sector oil
companies explore for oil under 'risk contracts' - where the companies can
keep a proportion of oil they find - it will accept 'performance contracts.'
This is where the driller is paid a bonus fee if he strikes oil, or performs
his work under time. Contractors are now only paid a flat fee.
Mexico will also open up the procurement of Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex)  -
about Dollars 5bn a year - and of the Federal Electricity Commission
(another Dollars 2bn a year) to US and Canadian companies. But the three
countries remain bitterly divided on just how much of the procurement should
be opened up, with the US fighting for a full opening, and the Mexicans for
something much more restrictive.
Mexico's decision to open up the corn sector to US and Canadian growers is
perhaps the most significant concession, given the poverty in which most of
the country's 2m corn-growers find themselves. Mexico has agreed to purchase
2.75m tonnes of corn a year, according to US corn-growers, and increase over
a 15-year period the quota and simultaneously reduce tariffs on corn imports
until free trade is achieved.
These concessions are conditional on agreement being reached on tariff
reductions for Mexican exports of fruit and vegetables to the US. The US and
Mexico still disagree on the speed at which US tariffs must be cut on
sensitive products and even on what these sensitive products are.
Similarly, the three countries have made almost no progress on the car
sector. The US is still pushing for a high regional content rule of 65 per
cent, in the hope this would penalise non-American producers. The Mexicans
and Canadians are hoping for 50-55 per cent, precisely so as not to scare
away non-American investors.
As if that were not enough, Mexico and the US still disagree on Mexico's
rules that require car companies to match imports into Mexico with exports
from Mexican plants. The US wants to import two cars into Mexico for every
car exported, but Mexico's autoparts makers object. Some kind of compromise
will be made which sets a floor on domestic Mexican car production equal to
last year's production plus a percentage of last year's total imports.
The three countries are also working on another compromise of some
complexity. Mexican-based car companies will be able to import finished
vehicles into Mexico according to, first, their exports of vehicles from
Mexico and, secondly, a percentage of the imports of components made by
their Mexican assembly plants. This percentage may start at 18 per cent and
after 10 years conclude at 52 per cent.
The bewildering array of deals and differences reflect the different visions
of North American free trade. The US is determined that their industries
gain from the treaty, even if consumers do not. US car companies and textile
producers want high rules of origin to block out low-cost Japanese and other
low-cost Asian producers.
Mexico wants to protect its sacred oil sector from the the north and give
weaker industries time to shape up before facing the onslaught of US
competition. Like the Canadians, the Mexicans are marginally less inclined
to shut out non-American companies from the new regional market by
acquiescing to high regional content rules.
These conflicting visions of North American free trade will come to a head
this weekend - and, just perhaps, be resolved.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, will today chair an
emergency meeting on measures to support the country's flagging stock
market.
The announcement came after Wednesday's 2.9 per cent plunge on the Tokyo
market, where the Nikkei average fell to its lowest level since April 1986.
Share prices rallied yesterday on reports of the emergency meeting, and the
Nikkei surged 497.99 to 16,039.94.
Mr Miyazawa spoke during his campaign tour in Kobe, in western Japan, before
Sunday's election for half the seats of the upper house of parliament.
He expressed concern over the effects of the Japanese stock market on other
world markets. 'We have to think of the Japanese economy's position in the
world,' he said, adding that all possible measures needed to be considered
to support the faltering stock market.
Market participants were relieved by the announcement. 'It seems like the
authorities, who have been turning their cold shoulder to the stock market,
have started to indicate that they care,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi
Life. The Tokyo business community was also heartened by the move. Mr Gaishi
Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation, welcomed the
government's response to stock market weakness.
However, Mr Miyazawa did not elaborate on possible measures to support share
prices, and some scepticism remains. 'The turnaround in the government's
attitude is good news, but whether the support measures are practical is
another matter,' said Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities in Tokyo.
Others expressed concern over the negative impact, if the emergency measures
turn out to be little more than a rehash of previously discussed reforms.
The government's emergency economic package announced in March failed to
restore investor confidence.
Pessimism over the Japanese economy is at the root of the stock market
weakness.
Most investors had hoped for a rebound of the economy this autumn to lift
corporate earnings. However, recent adverse economic data have cast doubts
over an early economic recovery.

<TEXT>
MR YASUSHI Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(Untac), yesterday accused Khmer Rouge guerrillas of terrorising Cambodians
and roundly condemned it for flouting a UN peace plan.
His public criticism of the Khmer Rouge, one of four Cambodian factions
which signed a peace accord in Paris last October, came two days after the
UN Security Council demanded Khmer Rouge compliance and decided to allow
foreign aid to go only to factions co-operating with Untac.
Speaking at a meeting of the Supreme National Council in Phnom Penh, Mr
Akashi said ceasefire violations had increased, especially in Khmer Rouge
controlled areas in northern Cambodia.
In the strongest language used by the UN so far, he accused the guerrillas
of laying new land mines and launching artillery bombardments.
'The nature of these activities points to a deliberate policy of terror
against ordinary Cambodians,' he told the SNC, which includes the four
factions and is supposed to run the country together with the UN until
elections next year.

<TEXT>
CONFRONTATION between the South African government and the main black
opposition alliance looked inevitable yesterday following the collapse of
efforts to avert a general strike on August 3.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general of the African National Congress
(ANC), at a press conference urged 'millions' of South Africans to
'overwhelmingly demonstrate that the De Klerk regime stands isolated as a
white minority attempting to cling to power'.
Other political and trade union leaders also rallied support for what they
described as a 'week of unprecedented action' to ensure a speedy transition
to democracy in South Africa.
Mr Ramaphosa said the week of action would begin with a two-day general
strike, followed by a day of demonstrations, occupations and marches, with
further protests during the rest of the week.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom Party leader, condemned the
strike plan, saying: 'As long as the ANC keeps on generating tension through
mass action, there is no way we can get anywhere near resolving the problem
of violence.'
Talks between the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the
largest union grouping in the country, and the South African Co-ordinating
Committee on Labour Affairs (Saccola), an umbrella employers' body, broke
down on Wednesday night. The two sides had been meeting for the past two
weeks in an effort to avoid the general strike and to break the
constitutional deadlock.
Mr Ramaphosa, in an indirect appeal to Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy,
warned that the current 'tense atmosphere' made international monitoring
'imperative'. Mr Vance, on a 10-day visit to South Africa, will advise the
UN Security Council on whether the world body can help end violence and
break the deadlock in negotiations.
Thousands of protesters have already been taking to the streets in the mass
action campaign led by the ANC and the Cosatu, so far without serious
incident.
But concern about the capacity of the police to handle protest on a larger
scale was heightened yesterday by a report which portrays the force as
incompetent.
British investigators sharply criticised the South African Police's (SAP)
handling of last month's killings at Boipatong, but said they had found 'no
evidence of direct police complicity in the massacre itself'.
The investigators, led by Mr P A Waddington, director of criminal justice
studies at Reading University, also said that 'inquiries in Boipatong have
been obstructed throughout by the hostility and non-cooperation of
residents, apparently at the behest of the African National Congress (ANC).'
There is no evidence, say the investigators, that police had any forewarning
of the attack. The 50-page report, compiled with the assistance of two
London detectives, is scathing in its assessment of the police: 'To judge
from Boipatong . . . the SAP suffers serious organisational problems', and
lacks 'adequate mechanisms for internal and external accountability, since
they seem unable or unwilling to establish what action was taken by whom
with what result', says the report.
The ANC described the report as 'a damning indictment of the standards of
policing in South Africa'. Mr Hernus Kriel, minister of law and order, said
that the government and police took the investigation's findings 'very
seriously indeed', adding that he had asked the SAP commissioner for an
urgent report.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Status may change to developing country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's role in the world trading system and its competitive
disadvantages after decades of ostracism are receiving close attention, with
the possibility of a 'demotion' to developing country status and membership
of preferential trading arrangements.
But the country would receive limited benefits from existing preference
systems, and might antagonise competitors in the developing world, according
to a study published yesterday by the Overseas Development Institute*.
The study argues that South Africa is not a typical developed country, with
many characteristics typical of a middle-income developing country such as
Brazil or Venezuela. As such, a strong case could be made for the country
being 'reclassified' as a developing country, and receiving a range of trade
benefits that go with that - including privileges under the General System
of Preferences (GSP) and the Lome Convention.
The study nevertheless argues that the gains from such a reclassification
would be limited. Most minerals on which it relies for almost three-quarters
of its export income are not subject to preferences - including gold, by far
the country's largest export earner. Main gains would be for fruits, metals,
paper and leather, while other exports potentially important to South Africa
 -such as coal, sugar, beef, steel and clothing - 'would be those least
available under preference schemes', the report says.
Membership of the Lome Convention would bring the greatest benefits,
including closer links with other economies in southern Africa. But this
would be difficult to negotiate because of fears of other Lome beneficiaries

<TEXT>
POLAND'S tight monetary policies are coming under threat from the country's
most serious waves of industrial unrest since economic changes began three
years ago.
As strikes by coal and copper ore miners continue, an important western
investor, Fiat, is also faced with a stoppage for the first time. Workers at
the FSM plant in Tychy, which is being sold to the Italian motor group, went
on strike on Wednesday to demand that their wages should correspond to those
paid by Fiat in its plants elsewhere.
Fiat produces its Cinquecento car at FSM and the autumn should see the
completion of an agreement under which it has agreed to commit nearly
Dollars 2bn to the plant in exchange for a 90 per cent share of the equity.
The strike followed a stoppage which started on Monday by some 40,000
workers at the copper-producing combine at Lubin in western Poland. The
miners are demanding a 30 per cent wage rise, which can only be paid if the
government eases tough wage controls.
Ms Hanna Suchocka, the new prime minister, told the senate, parliament's
second chamber, yesterday that the government would not permit settlements
which 'would favour one group of workers at the cost of other groups'.
A strike also began at the Zofiowka coal mine, one of the largest pits in
the Rybnik mining region in southern Poland which had remained unaffected by
last week's stoppages in about 15 pits elsewhere.
The coal industry is already reporting financial losses, and pay concessions
would imply a return to government subsidies. These would place an
additional burden on the budget where the present ceiling for the deficit of
5 per cent of gross domestic product is seen by the International Monetary
Fund as a key element of a forthcoming agreement on renewed Polish access to
credits worth Dollars 1.6bn.
Real wages in Poland in the first five months of the year fell by 5 per cent
compared with the same period last year, while money supply has contracted
by 1 per cent since the beginning of the year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, flies out to Russia and the Baltic
States tomorrow on a flag-waving tour. But there will be few British
businesses to visit.
Amid much publicity last September, Mr Gummer summoned the great and the
good of the UK retail trade to a breakfast meeting to discuss ways of
developing the former Soviet Union's food business. At that time, Mr Gummer
did little to dispel the impression that there would soon be Safeway stores
in Sverdlovsk and Tesco stores in Tomsk, as one newspaper duly reported.
But, almost a year on, little has happened.
Only the privately-owned Littlewoods group has so far moved into Russia,
opening two stores in St Petersburg last year.
But an unlikely British investor has been Sid Shaw, a doggedly persistent
entrepreneur who runs Elvisly Yours, a shop selling kitsch Elvis Presley
memorabilia in Shoreditch High Street.
Earlier this month, Mr Shaw opened a 2,000 sq ft 'Super' store on Prospekt
Smirnova in St Petersburg as a joint venture with a local co-operative. The
store sells a hotch-potch of western goods, ranging from flea collars and
cider to car repair kits, for either roubles or dollars. He expects it to
take Pounds 2m in its first year.
Why does Mr Shaw want to open shops in Russia? 'Why did anyone set off to
California with a shovel?' he responds.
But Mr Shaw complains that he has received little support from the UK
government or industry. He says he has contacted hundreds of companies
seeking supplies to export but has met with a miserable response from most.
'I have struggled for two years against Russian bureaucracy and British
intransigence,' he says. 'This country is run by bloody accountants who have
no imagination.'
The British Food Export Council has agreed to help Mr Shaw find backers but
says it is not surprising that he has not yet met with a more encouraging
response. 'He has a very jaundiced view of British suppliers, but you do not
deal with someone you do not know,' says David Gray, marketing manager at
the BFEC. 'At the end of the day, exports have to be based on a more
centrally planned approach,' he adds.
Mr Shaw has spent Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 262,000) on developing the Super
store but has plans to open another ten, from cash flow - he has received no
backing from any banks. He says Russia is in a state of 'economic anarchy'
at the moment and it needs unconventional men and methods to succeed there.

ESTONIAN border guards have seized a Russian navy-support ship inside
Estonia's territorial waters, and have been holding it for over 24 hours,
officials said yesterday, AP reports from Moscow.
The Russian hydrographic ship was removing buoys from Estonia's Paarnu Bay
when it was seized on Wednesday night, a spokesman for Estonia's border
guards said, 'because its actions had not been co-ordinated with the
Estonian authorities'.
The head of the Commonwealth of Independent States naval press centre in
Moscow said the ship was part of the Russian-controlled Baltic Sea Fleet.
Crew members had been taking measurements when the boat was boarded by armed
Estonian border guards. It was still being held late yesterday, in spite of
Estonian assurances it had been released.
The Baltfax news agency said Estonia's border guards and Maritime
Administration had agreed to release the ship yesterday morning on condition
it replaced the buoys it had removed.
Hydrographic vessels belong to the navy but are usually manned by civilians
and have about 15-20 crew members.

The European Commission announced plans yesterday to provide Ecu30m (Pounds

border controls are removed, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The money, which must be approved by EC governments, would help create new
jobs and business opportunities in 1993 in the worst-hit border areas.
More than 60,000 private customs agents stand to lose their jobs when all
formalities on intra-EC trade are wiped out next January 1. They have staged
a series strikes and other protests this year to demand compensation.
The Commission announced in May that it hoped to provide up to Ecu400m to
retrain or re-employ customs agents, most of it coming from existing EC
funds earmarked for regional development.

Mr Erich Honecker, the former East German leader, may soon be returned to

Chancellor Helmut Kohl said there had been 'visible movement' and that a

sent back from Moscow.
The former communist chief fled to Moscow in March, 1991, and was given
sanctuary in the Chilean embassy there last December.
The German Foreign Ministry said talks between the Chilean and Russian
governments had reached the point where there were signs of a solution.
Mr Honecker's lawyer said reports that he could be expelled this weekend
were 'bare-faced lies.' Mr Honecker would not leave of his own free will, he
added.

THE BANK of Spain yesterday raised its benchmark intervention rate from 12.4
per cent to 13 per cent in an effort to dilute, in advance, the inflationary
effects of a series of direct and indirect tax increases announced by the
government on Tuesday, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid.
Spain's biggest bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, immediately followed by raising
its prime lending rate from 13 per cent to 13.5 per cent and most other
banks are likely to follow.
The government's emergency fiscal package, designed to stem unexpectedly
sharp increases in its deficits this year, included a VAT increase from next
month of 2 percentage points to 15 per cent. That will force year-end
inflation to at least 6.5 per cent, well wide of the 5.5 per cent target.
Yesterday's interest rate rise places official rates higher than they have
been since May 1991.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Catalan socialists and nationalists play games with the
Games: Jealousy and grumbling in Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST in case visitors to the Olympic Games starting in Barcelona tomorrow
did not know the city is run by the Socialist party and that opposite City
Hall sits the headquarters of the nationalist regional government of
Catalonia, both have spent the past weeks trying to make their positions
obvious.
The socialists began by driving out of town hundreds of prostitutes and
transvestites, thus depriving the city of the most colourful element in its
otherwise cliquey nightlife. Eastern Europeans would instantly recognise the
mind-set that polishes pavements before lots of foreigners come to town.
The nationalists have been, as ever, even less subtle. They took out
double-page advertisements in international newspapers last week asking 'in
which country would you place this point?' with a dot marking Barcelona on a
blank page. The 'country,' of course, was not Spain, but Catalonia, a small,
semi-industrialised region on the margins of Europe.
Ever since it was first decided to hold the 1992 Games in Barcelona, the
socialist City Hall and the nationalist regional government have lost
themselves in a contorted effort to claim them as their own. At one stage
the nationalist government allowed its followers to believe the possibility
really existed that Catalonia would be able to compete as a separate
country.
Nationalist pressure has at least won them the right to have the Catalan
anthem played at the inaugural ceremony tomorrow and the Catalan flag will
adorn Olympic sites throughout the Games. Catalonia's Games? In the City
Hall, Mr Enric Truno, the Socialist party councillor responsible for
preparing Barcelona for the Games, just sighs. 'We have tried to share the
Games with the rest of Catalonia,' by scattering events around the region,
he said in a recent interview.
That has not been enough for Mr Jordi Pujol, the leader of the nationalist
government, for, like most moderate nationalists, his constant carping over
the years about how terribly badly Madrid treats his country has bred a
generation of people who actually believe it. People watching the Olympics
on television around the world might be startled by the occasional youth
wearing 'Free Catalonia' on his T-shirt throwing himself in front of the
cameras. In English, that is. No one but the locals understands Catalan.
The problem is that Catalonia is already free. Poor Madrid, which has had to
fund far more than half of the Dollars 10bn that has gone into Olympic
housing, stadiums, new highways and sewers - and, most important, restoring
to Barcelona a beach - has learned it is best to say nothing when Mr Pujol
and his patriots climb their flagpoles.
But the truth is that these Games are the work of the ruling Socialist Party
in Madrid and its Catalan affiliate. Barcelona has been a socialist city
ever since the first elections after Franco died in 1975. Jealous of the
credit that would go to City Hall, Mr Pujol spent a great deal of time in
the late 1980s frustrating plans to build hotels in Barcelona and
interfering in infrastructure projects.
Unable to topple the socialist mayor, he is now making the most of the fact
that things have gone well. The project is ready, and even the 1,000
athletes who will have birthdays in the next two weeks have had cakes
specially ordered for them. The only thing that can go wrong now is
security.
Mr Pujol would no doubt be quick to point fingers at Madrid if the Basque
separatist movement Eta does anything to upset the Olympics. The Spanish
have drafted in 26,000 police and security guards to ensure nothing happens.
Mini-submarines patrol the beaches, and Mr Truno is calm. Many Eta leaders
in exile in France have recently been arrested, and the organisation is in
trouble.
'By the time the games begin, Eta may have missed its political chance,' he
said. It would be a major departure for Eta to kill foreigners, and the
small Catalan terrorist group is not regarded as a serious threat.
The prostitutes, however, have threatened to invade the city-centre at night
in protest at having been shunted off into an industrial suburb. Madrid
could hardly be blamed for that, but if the ladies and men of the night
become unruly, someone in Barcelona will surely try.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Cartel office rules on Gillette: German investigation
decides against link with Wilkinson Sword
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German cartel office yesterday ordered Gillette, the US razor group, to
dispose of its interest in Eemland, the parent company of Wilkinson Sword,
which is Gillette's main competitor in the world market for wet shaving
products.
The order follows a decision last March by Mr Peter Lilley, then the UK
trade and industry secretary, to seek parliamentary authority to require
Gillette to dispose of its shareholding in and loan to Eemland, formerly
Swedish Match.
Investigation of Gillette's interest in Eemland has involved an
unprecedented degree of co-operation by competition authorities worldwide,
including the European Commission, which is expected to rule against the
investment shortly.
Gillette owns 22 per cent of Eemland through non-voting shares. It also lent
the company Dollars 69m (Pounds 36m) to finance a buy-out, three years ago,
of the consumer products businesses of Stora, the Swedish paper and forest
products group.
The cartel office said the equity interest and loan, together with
pre-emptive rights to buy further Eemland shares, enabled Gillette to
influence the company's management.
However, Gillette says it has no influence over Eemland and made its
investments only so that it could buy Wilkinson Sword's businesses outside
the US and the European Community. Gillette says it is prepared to dispose
of its Eemland interests by the middle of 1994.
Once the order sought by Mr Lilley is granted by parliament, Gillette would
be required to make the disposal in six months. If Gillette refused, the
government would have to seek a High Court injunction enforcing the order.
The cartel office has set no deadline for the implementation of its
decision, which Gillette may challenge in court. The cartel office said that
if that happened, the case could take up to three years to reach a
conclusion.
Gillette and Wilkinson Sword together have more than 90 per cent of the
German wet shaving products market, according to the cartel office. Their
combined shares of the European Community and world markets are estimated at
more than 75 per cent.
Gillette's relations with Wilkinson Sword have also been investigated by
competition authorities in Canada, France and the US, where the former
company agreed, under official pressure, to dispose of the latter's American
businesses.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST drop in the European Community's average inflation rate was
welcomed yesterday by EC officials. However, they are increasingly concerned
about the steady rise in unemployment.
Consumer prices fell on an annual basis from 4.8 per cent in May to 4.5 per
cent last month, with only Greece going against this downward trend,
according to Eurostat, the EC statistics office. But at the same time,
unemployment is expected to average 9.5 per cent this year and to rise
further next.
EC officials express some dismay that sluggish Community growth, forecast at
only 1.75 per cent this year, may continue into next year as a result of
German interest rates. However, the Commission is still officially
predicting an expansion in the EC economy of at least 2.25 per cent in 1993.
This is preventing many EC governments making an early start to curb public
borrowing and expenditure, as they are required to do by the economic and
monetary union provisions of the Maastricht treaty.
But, even in the extremely unlikely event of a renegotiation of the
Maastricht pact, most Commission officials see no prospect of moderating the
'economic convergence' criteria set down in the treaty last year. They say
such a move would prove unacceptable to Germany.
Also, in recent meetings of EC finance ministers, most other governments
have supported a long-haul approach to improving efficiency in the EC
economy, even though cutting industrial subsidies and removing rigidities in
the labour market are politically hardest to achieve at a time of low growth
and rising joblessness.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has said the best riposte, at the
Community level, to the criticism that Maastricht's Emu provisions are
'deflationary' is to channel more aid to southern EC states. These would, as
in the recent past, buy more investment goods from the north.
This, in essence, is the macro-economic strategy behind the new cohesion
fund for poorer Mediterranean countries plus Ireland, which the Commission
is due to propose formally next week.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (7): Future
hangs on guesswork - In the light of other large-scale projects, the
environmental issue is critical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Osman Tekinel, of Cukurova University, likes to put on a slide
show for his visitors: a compendium of images of apricots the size of
peaches, and bees undergoing the discomfort of artificial insemination.
Perhaps the most alarming is the one of the dessicated white soils of
Turkey's south-east. It reveals, as the professor put it: 'what happens if
we get the irrigation wrong'.
Today the Gap project provides a range of puzzles for a whole range of
Turkish scientists, from soil engineers to ecologists, hydrologists, even -
it seems - bee experts.
The area was, after all, part of the 'Fertile Crescent' in ancient times.
Professor Tekinel and other members of the Agriculture faculty at Cukurova
University are in little doubt that it can be part of it again. But no one
underestimates the challenges.
The environmental issue is of urgent concern, particularly in light of the
experience of other large-scale irrigation projects - the most notorious
example being the Soviet Aral Sea development.
In the Gap region, humidity levels alone are expected to triple over a
period of 25 years, as a result of evaporation once the irrigation canals
are filled.
What effect this will have on the micro-climate one can only guess at.
Increased pesticide and fertiliser used on such soils will also result in
higher pollution levels - affecting, in turn, the water sources.
To assess the environmental impact of the expected industrialisation is a
job for the future. Today it is the Gap authority's task to install a
irrigation system.
Surface irrigation currently looks like the chosen system, particularly if -
as seems likely - the farmers choose to grow cotton, But surface irrigation
consumes more water than sprinkler or drip methods. Drip, for example, is
estimated to save 50 per cent of the water, and adds 30 per cent to the
yield.
Surface systems could also prove even more of a problem for the soils, as
salt deposits increase with evaporation. With the low precipitation, the
water table is currently at around 135 metres. However, during the
irrigation season, there is normally ground water much closer to the
surface, where there is an impervious clay band. If excessive irrigation
acts to raise the water level, this will add to the salinity problems in the
critical area of the plant's roots.
At a 30 hectare research station in the Harran plain the university is
experimenting on soil and seed types, planting and rotation patterns, and
different water uses. Professor Tekinel, like many Turks working on the Gap
project, remains optimistic.
'We have the world's largest wheat experiment - 110 varieties.'
There are also 110 varieties of strawberries, mulched under plastic
sheeting. 'He didn't believe we could do it, 12.8 tonnes of maize in one
hectare,' he says, chalking up the name of the 'doubting Thomas' German
professor on the lecture room blackboard.
Some of his colleagues are more worried. 'The changes to the natural
environment could be disastrous. We have to be very careful,' says Professor
Ural Dinc, director of the remote sensing unit at Cukurova.
Professor Dinc is conducting a detailed soil survey of the region, half of
which has already been mapped using satellite imagery. It will be too late,
he says, once the land comes under cultivation. His research will feed into
policy decisions on crop patterns.
'This is less important for annual crops, where farmers will be given a
selection of five or six different types. But for fruit trees it is critical
to match the soil types."
Professor Dinc's other concern is the impact of mechanisation, as farmers
start to use tractors and other heavy harvesting machinery. His research is
looking at the effect of compact soils, and on the disturbance associated
with mechanisation.
But both professors agree on the most important thing, extension skills.
Unless the farmers are taught the new irrigated farming methods, the
problems of salinity could easily arise. Studies in the Cukurova irrigated
scheme show that farmers believe the more water applied the better the
yield.
Clearly one question is the pricing policy for the water. But - as Professor
Dinc says - 'that is a matter for the politicians'.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (6):
Archaeologists race to save a crossroads - Already over 200 historic sites
have been lost
</HEADLINE>

THE CAUSE of archaeology has never been uppermost in the minds of the
Turkish engineers who drew up plans to flood the Euphrates valley. There are
few signs that things will be any different when it comes to the Tigris.
The race is on to save what is, in archaeological terms, a laboratory: a
crossroads of some great civilisations of the world - from the Assyrian and
Persians, Commagenians, Romans, Abbasids of Aleppo, the Byzantines and the
Seljuk Turks.
Already, as many as 210 documented sites on the Euphrates have been lost
since the Keban, Karakaya and Ataturk dams were filled; perhaps many more.
In 1977, in a rush to beat the deadline, Ankara's Middle East Technical
University conducted a survey of the affected areas, on the basis of which
local and foreign archaeologists were invited to choose one site to
excavate.
One example was Samosat, a massive Roman legionary base and the iron age
capital of the region which is now inundated by the Ataturk reservoir.
The birthplace of the Roman writer Lucian, Samosat is dated to the first
half of the third century BC. It is mentioned by Pliny, by Strabo, and in
the histories of Procopius. It is believed to be the capital of the late
Hittite Kingdom known as Kummuku; it was also the capital of the Commagene
kingdom. It was besieged by Mark Antony, and later Vespasian made it a Roman
province. 'Surface evidence indicates the Samosat mound was occupied almost
continuously from the beginning of the Chalcolithic period to the present
day,' the report stated.
Professor Halet Cambel of Istanbul University says that Samosat was probably
the most important historical and archaeological site in the region.
Today she is campaigning to save Nevali Cori, near Urfa, where a joint dig
with Heidelberg University has discovered a 7th century mosaic, which is
slowly being covered as the Ataturk reservoir advances. 'This is one of the
two earliest mosaic floors in the world; the authorities should allow the
waters to recede to enable us to move the mosaic,' Professor Cambel says.
On the Tigris, things are potentially worse. 'There has been no survey
done,' she says. 'That story is even more sad because we don't know what we
are losing if the area is flooded.'
After five years campaigning, Prof Olus Arik of Ankara University has just
received a Dollars 10,000 budget direct from the Gap authority to excavate
Hasankeyf, a late Roman frontier camp, at the crossroads of 'three different
worlds - the Asiatic, Mesopotamian, and Byzantine.' This is three times the
size of normal excavation funds approved by the culture ministry, but is
still barely enough to make an impact on a site more extensive than Ephesus.
Today Hasankeyf faces the fate of so many of the sites in the Tigris and
Euphrates valley.
According to the Gap master plan, the Ilisu dam near Midyat is projected to
cover the area within nine years of the construction starting. 'Only the top
of the highest minaret might still be visible,' says the professor.
Scrapping the dam is probably unlikely, given its importance in the overall
Gap masterplan. But Prof Arik remains optimistic that the authorities may
give him a reprieve, at least to be able to survey the site properly.
'I hope they will cancel it, or at least alter the plans. My argument has
always been that Turkey shouldn't sacrifice 2,000 years of history for some
kilowatt hours of energy.'

FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (8): The
landless need help - Land reform is seen as crucial to the long-term health
of the Gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<TEXT>
THE aghas, or feudal landlords, of the south-east region have their minds
set on one subject these days: land reform.
If a less immediate problem, the issue is seen by many economists as
critical for the long-term health of the Gap project. The question is, what
sort of land reform?
Today, more than a quarter of the cultivated land is owned by less than 1
per cent of the region's farmers. On the other hand, 61 per cent of the
farmers, or about 150,000 families, own holdings of less than 5ha.
A pilot project has just been started in the Sanliurfa region, to
redistribute government land to landless farmers. To date some 10,000ha of
government land has been given to landless farmers. 'It's the landless
farmers we want to help,' says Mr Hurman Ocakli, vice-president of the Gap
authority in Ankara.
In the 1970s, under socialist legislation passed by Mr Bulent Ecevit's
government, land was expropriated from the aghas and given to poor farmers.
In 1980, following the military coup, the law was overturned. According to
figures from the Gap authority, more than 10,000ha has been returned to the
original owners.
Today's government seems attracted to reform less as a vehicle to achieve
more equitable land distribution than as a way to improve efficiencies, in a
region where the patchwork of the small farms serves to reduce productivity
levels.
A pilot project in the Harran plain has been started, aimed at consolidating
plots. Many of the region's farmers have scattered allotments, too small to
achieve economies of scale - a product of the local inheritance practices,
where farms are divided up between the sons. Officials have set an optimum
land plot at around 4ha for first class land and 6ha for the third grade
farm. Under the project, they have set a maximum land holding of 60ha for
any one plot.
Since 1983 in the Harran land reform area, land sales have been prohibited
without government permission. This is partly to prevent alternative land
use in the planned irrigation area, and to discourage the large agricultural
combines from buying out smallholders.
Ironically, over the long term the master plan predicts that there will be a
large-scale consolidation of land holdings, as mechanisation becomes more
widespread, and as higher input costs force smaller landholders to sell up
and head for the cities. Given the project's original aim to keep people on
the farms, this might seem a contradiction. But, as Prof Tekinel sees it,
'this is what happens when an area develops.'

FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (5): A
home-grown achievement - The Ataturk Dam drew heavily on Ankara's financial
resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani declined to pay his
respects at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's secular
founder, the Iranian leader was taken to the next best thing - the Ataturk
Dam.
Inaugurated in October 1981, this huge rock-filled structure is more than
just a sight for visiting heads of state. The Ataturk Dam is the most
important project in Turkey. It is also the most costly. Designed by Turks,
the dam was constructed by Turkish contractors and financed with Turkish
funds. Apart from the foreign suppliers' credits, the Turkish government
budget bore the brunt of the Dollars 4bn investment.
From an observation point high in the project's headquarters the main
landmarks can be seen: the mammoth 169m high embankment; the eight penstocks
which carry the water to the power turbines housed below the reservoir
stretching into the distance.
The statistics are impressive. The dam's 180m high clay core, with
rock-filled wall, will impound a volume of 48.7bn cubic metres of water,
making it the fifth largest dam in the world.
The design is said to be able to withstand an earthquake measuring 8 on the
Richter scale. 'It would take a nuclear bomb to dent it,' said Mr Ferruh
Anik of DSI, the state hydraulics department, during the Gulf War when asked
about his fears that Iraq might attack the site.
When completed, the dam's total installed capacity from eight Swiss-built
turbines will produce 2,400MW, with generating capacity of 9bn kilowatt
hours - almost half Turkey's current hydro output. The reservoir will
provide irrigation for about 730,000 hectares, with the first 40,000ha
scheduled to come into operation next summer.
The system comprises a twin bore 24.6km tunnel which will take water from
the reservoir to irrigate the Harran and Mardin Ceylanpinar plains. This
will make it the second largest single source irrigation scheme in the
world, and it will increase Turkey's irrigated land by a third. The value of
the food surpluses resulting from such large-scale irrigated farming is
estimated at Dollars 5bn.
Since 1983 the government has spent TL11,100bn (Dollars 1.6bn) constructing
the dam, and a further TL5,600bn on electro-mechanical equipment. The
completed cost is projected at almost half of what has so far been spent on
the South East Anatolian Project as a whole. President Turgut Ozal once
claimed that earnings from the electricity revenues from the Ataturk Dam
would repay the cost of installing the irrigation network within four years.
According to Mr Anik, it still requires two or three good years with heavy
snows to fill the dam to the required maximum elevation of 542 metres. But
at a height of 526m the twin Urfa tunnels come into play. Depending on the
next year's snow-melt, this could be as early as next summer.
Officials say there is even an option to raise the maximum water level
further, although this would involve additional flooding, taking more land
out of cultivation. It would also increase evaporation - involving, as it
would, an increase in surface area.
According to initial calculations, the current water level of the reservoir,
at an elevation of 507m, should have been too low for power generation to
begin.
However, Mr Olcay Unver, head of the Gap authority, revealed there had been
a few last-minute adjustments to allow Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime
minister, and his countless guests, to witness tomorrow the first two power
units come into operation.
'There have been times when we have squeezed the government, and times when
the government has squeezed us. But there were no serious delays. That's the
real achievement,' says Mr Asaf Guven of Ata-Insaat, the main contractor for
the dam.
Ata-Insaat, a consortium of three Turkish contractors, was formed specially
to bid for the dam construction work, winning the tender largely through a
cunning financing package.
'The only demand we made was that a foreign exchange portion should be paid
in advance to buy the machinery,' says Mr Guven. With the government in
agreement Ata-Insaat used a Dollars 200m credit, including a US Eximbank
loan of Dollars 110m, to import US Caterpillars to start the site clearance.
From the start, many economists have contested the financial good sense of
such a colossal undertaking. Gap, as a whole, is said by officials to
consume Dollars 2m a day, with the Ataturk development taking the lion's
share. Some economists estimate that these expenditures account for one
third of Turkey's 70 per cent inflation rate.
Mr Guven takes a different view. 'When the full electricity capacity is in
operation, the government will earn between Dollars 800m and Dollars 900m
every year, while still offering the consumer power at three cents per
kilowatt hour. That's extremely cheap.'
Asea Brown Boveri supplied the eight turbines - which each comprise 700
tonnes of generator rotor. For each turbine there are three transformers -
supplied by Brown Boveri before the company joined the Swedish Asea.
The dam is also a remarkable achievement for homegrown Turkish engineering.
The design and civil works, done by Ata-Insaat, have given the company
invaluable experience. Mr Anik, head of DSI, says the original plans made no
provision for the difficult task of closing off the bottom outlet, to allow
the water level to rise sufficiently to cover the turbines. If the job had
not been handled correctly, it could have created what engineers call a
vortex, putting the base of the dam under dangerous pressure.
With its task all but complete, Ata-Insaat now has its sights on contracts
further afield - particularly, it says, in the former Soviet states, where
there is a growing demand for power plants.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (3): Finding
common ground - Ozal and Demirel are both closely identified with the
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Turgut Ozal of Turkey and Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime
minister, may disagree on most things these days, but when it comes to
arguing the case for the Gap, they sound like a duet.
For all its technical, financial and environmental problems, the Gap has
supporters where it counts. Both men started their careers as engineers on
the project, the president as a young electrical engineer on the Keban Dam,
and Mr Demirel as director of the State Hydraulics Works DSI. Today they
would each like to be seen as the founding father of the project.
Mr Demirel's association with the Gap goes back to the 1950s, when he earned
himself the nickname of the King of Dams. He studied as a water technician,
obtaining a degree in hydrological engineering from the Technical University
of Istanbul.
It was when he became premier for the first time in 1965 that the plan for
developing the vast water resources of the South East first took off. His
government obtained World Bank credits for the construction of the Keban
Dam.
In a later incarnation as prime minister, he laid the foundation stone for
the Karakaya Dam in 1976. Mr Demirel insists it was during this period that
plans for the Ataturk Dam complex were drawn up.
President Ozal, too, has been closely identified with the project. After
studying economics and engineering in the US he took up a post as general
deputy director of Electrical Studies and Research Administration in Ankara
in the late 1950s. It was during this period that he first formulated
schemes for harnessing the Euphrates for its huge hydro power potential.
As a young electrical engineer he had worked on the Keban Dam. As prime
minister he was to give the political green light to the massive Ataturk Dam
and reservoir complex.
And as president he was to inaugurate the project when the huge concrete
'bung' was locked into place in early 1990, staunching the flow of the river
to allow the authorities to trap water behind the dam.
It was President Ozal who formally opened the 26km Urfa irrigation tunnels,
to take water from the reservoir to irrigate the Harran, Ceylanpinar and
Mardin plains.
For a brief moment last week it seemed the president would not attend
tomorrow's celebration, allowing Mr Demirel to open the flood gates on to
the turbines this Saturday, generating the first kilowatt of electricity
from the Ataturk Dam. According to his spokesman, the president would go to
Malatya for an apricot festival in his home town.
Now it appears that Mr Ozal has changed his mind. The president will be
attending. No one ever really believed he wouldn't.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (2): Rich
agricultural region gears up for change - Irrigation will have far-reaching
effects on farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER it is the water melons of Diyarbakir, the apricots in Malatya or
Gaziantep's famous pistachio nuts, the 'Antep fistigi', Turkey's south-east
region, is already well known for its farm products.
With the advent of modern irrigation methods, the area promises to become a
bread-basket for cereals and vegetables and an industrial greenhouse for
horticultural products and exotic export crops.
The first 40,000 hectares on the Harran plain adjoining the Syrian border
will be brought into the scheme next summer, or when water levels in the
Ataturk reservoir allow. From a figure of less than 4 per cent today, the
Gap area when complete will account for a third of Turkey's public and
private lands under irrigation.
For the agronomists and soil scientists trying to anticipate these changes
from the research centre at Cukurova University near Adana, the challenge is
considerable. Remote sensing of the region's soil populations is not yet
complete. Research has started on possible crop patterns, vital if those
soils are to be properly conserved. The farmers, long used to rain-fed
agriculture, have still to learn the new techniques of irrigated farming.
As the region's humidity increases, so pest problems will multiply. This
will mean more pesticide and other requirements, which will increase the
farmers' need for capital, putting new pressure on existing credit systems.
More broadly, it will mean the government will have to reassess its subsidy
policy if, as seems likely, much of the surplus farm production is to
compete in export markets.
Whatever the policy choices, the Gap project, with 1.7m ha coming under
irrigation, is set to transform the region's economy. Today, farmers face a
six-month dry season. Few can cultivate more than one cash harvest a year.
With irrigation, two or perhaps three annual harvests will be possible. But
as farm outputs increase, farm incomes will also rise. The project will
create demand for seeds.
Many of the big foreign names have already invested in the area, using
sophisticated technologies to produce hybrids, which they sell on a royalty
basis to state and private seed retailers.
Longer term, the project will provide the raw material for industries such
as cotton ginning and textiles or processed food canning, cigarette
production and sugar refining.
About four fifths of the Gap's 5.2m people are in farming. Some regions are
more intensively farmed than others. Sanliurfa, for example, has 450,000ha
of first class land, compared with just 22,000ha in Siirt province.
Moreover, the proportion of available land under cultivation is much higher
than the national average in the south-east provinces, another indication of
the scarcity of alternative employment. Among the project's eight provinces,
only the economy of Gaziantep is not dominated by agriculture.
The region's cold winters, while unsuited to citrus, are ideal for other
fruits and vegetables. Large quantities of pomegranates, almonds and sesame
find their way to Turkey's markets. The remote mountainous area around
Siirt, the most easterly of the Gap provinces, produces more than 15 per
cent of Turkey's pomegranate crop. Given water supplies, improvements in
marketing, and other modern inputs, the authorities predict that from the
Harran plain alone the project will add more than Dollars 5bn to Turkey's
annual agricultural export earnings.
The government master-plan, drawn up by the Japanese firm Nippon Koei,
envisages 'step wise' implementation of the irrigation services, given the
limited capacity for on-farm development. The plan is based on the
cultivation of cereals, pulses and cotton and three other crop types - oil
seeds, fruit and vegetables and forage crops, and feed grains for livestock
production.
Crop rotation, a practice which is unknown in rain-fed areas, is being
introduced. Winter vegetables, oilseed and pulses, will be alternated with
cotton as the summer crop, for example. The plan foresees that the area
under wheat and pulses will be dominant, but that cotton production will
rapidly expand as irrigation services become available.
According to official projections, the Gap will increase Turkish wheat
production by more than 50 per cent, barley by a similar figure and the
production of cotton by more than four times by 2005, when full irrigation
is expected to be operating. This will add some 60 per cent to Turkey's
current cotton output.
Infrastructure will be an initial constraint. Roads and railway links, a key
factor in the transport of perishables, are not yet developed. Storage
capacity is limited and, according to Mr Onur Erkan, the economics professor
at Cukurova, there is not a single packing plant in the Gap region. As for
the the broader environmental impact, this is a subject which has yet to be
properly addressed.
The Gap authority contracts a number of specialist consultancy firms. The
German firm AFC is studying market strategy - how to sell the expected food
surpluses, which crops should be encouraged, and which export markets should
be targeted.
Tubitak, the Turkish science research institute, is looking at credit
mechanisms for the Gap. Cheap credit is an important ingredient in Turkish
agriculture policy, but it also represents an increasing burden on the
budget.
The French group Compagnie National Bas Rhone Lanquedoc is surveying the
main canal system. Alexander Gibb, the only UK concern working in the Gap,
has a contract to look at the road network. Alexander Gibb is also one of
several companies likely to bid on a irrigation management contract, which
the Gap authorities say will go to tender later this month. The project will
look at issues which include the extension skills that will be needed as
farmers change to irrigated techniques.
The choice of irrigation is perhaps the most pressing issue. Following
recommendations by Rhone Lanquedoc, on the regulation of the main canals,
the Gap authorities have modified the system on the Harran plain to increase
water conservation, but the main system will remain a network of open
canals, which will be subject to greater water loss through evaporation.
However, considerable apprehension remains, particularly given the increased
salinity associated with large scale gravity or surface irrigation
programmes.
Professor Osman Tekinel, dean of the Cukurova Agricultural University, says
the farmers should be left to decide. An expert on irrigated farming, Prof
Tekinel believes farmers will upgrade to the more water-efficient sprinkler
and drip methods once labour rates pick up and they begin to reap the
financial benefits of yield improvements.
None of these issues seems insurmountable, given adequate time and research.
But with the first hectares due to come under irrigation next year, when the
colossal Urfa tunnels come into operation, there is a growing urgency to
find solutions.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (4): Water
supply a thorny issue - Downstream neighbours resent Turkey's control of
distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE last time so many high-ranking Turkish government officials visited the
Ataturk Dam, it was to watch hawsers winching a massive 87-tonne concrete
plug into the diversion channel under the embankment.
On that occasion, marked by the presence of President Turgut Ozal, Turkish
engineers staunched the Euphrates for a period of 30 days, trapping the
water behind the dam for future irrigation and power generation. Syria and
Iraq, Turkey's downstream neighbours, both protested. Newspapers throughout
the Arab world took up the cry.
Strategists have made a good living predicting that water will be the cause
of the next big war in the Middle East. Turkey, controlling as it does both
the Euphrates and Tigris, has been the subject of countless studies on what
has become the region's most precious resource.
Turkey's South East Anatolian Project, GAP, and particularly the dam which
is its centre piece, is the source of continuing friction with its two
former Arab colonies to the south. In spite of technical meetings - the last
one in Ankara in June 1990 - the three sides have been unable to agree a
permanent distribution of the waters.
The issue is particularly urgent for the Syrians, who rely on water for 75
per cent of their power generation, not to mention the supply of drinking
water and water for irrigation and industrial use. Iraq can use the Tigris,
which is less directly affected by Turkey's irrigation plans. As a major oil
producer, Iraq also relies less on hydro-power generation. On the other
hand, it is the Euphrates which feeds Iraq's agricultural sector.
Much of the population in these areas is made up of Shia, and the Sunni
administration in Baghdad has been at pains to win their support.
Projections suggest the more Turkey uses the water to fill the reservoir and
for irrigation purposes, the less will be available for the Syrians and the
Iraqis.
Moreover, both downstream users face pollution and degraded supply, in spite
of assurances from Turkish engineers that irrigated water will be
controlled. Scientists predict the intensified inputs could also seriously
affect ground water quality as fertilisers and insecticides seep down into
the water table, polluting the springs on the Syrian side of the border.
Beyond these practical worries, Syria and Iraq both resent their growing
dependence on Turkey and the influence that Ankara seems likely to assert in
connection with the water issue.
For Damascus, the issue has been intimately linked with its broader security
concerns. When Turkey decided in the early 1980s to push ahead with the
Ataturk Dam, Turkish officials now acknowledge that it was this action which
prompted the Syrians to start backing Turkey's separatist Kurdish Workers
party, the PKK.
This bloody conflict has since claimed more than 4,000 lives. Syrian support
for the rebels is also seen as a lever with which to win concessions on the
long-standing bilateral grumble over the status of Hatay, a region ceded to
Turkey at the end of the French mandate.
The joint technical meetings have proved far more amicable than the
political exchanges. According to Mr Ferruh Anik of the state hydraulics
works, DSI, Syria and Turkey have even discussed joint dam projects
involving flooding the border to maximise the power generation.
But Ankara rejects calls for an internationally ratified agreement on the
waters. Instead it says the dam programme has helped regulate the flow,
providing its neighbours with constant supply - a claim consistent with the
dramatic seasonal changes in water discharge and the historical evidence of
flooding in the region.
'The Syrian approach has always been to calculate their maximum needs. If
you put Syria's needs and Iraq's needs together you will have twice the
potential of the Euphrates. Until common sense prevails in these discussions
there will not be any agreement,' says Mr Burhan Ant, head of Arab affairs
at the Turkish foreign ministry.
Turkish policy has none the less periodically sought to accommodate these
concerns. In 1987, during a visit to Damascus, President Turgut Ozal, then
prime minister, offered to guarantee a flow of 500 cubic metres a second at
the Turkish Syrian border, until a 'final allocation of the waters of the
Euphrates between the three riparian states.'
Various proposals have been made, Ankara even offering to transmit
electricity to Syrian cities in the border area. Before staunching the river
in 1990, Turkey gave two months advance warning and offered to compensate by
increasing the flows. Partly to appease international concern at the
environmental effect of its irrigation schemes, Turkey is inviting foreign
experts to assess the various canal schemes.
Yet the Turkish position remains that there is no legal case for sharing the
waters. Mr Fahri Armagoglu, a journalist and lecturer on international
relations, insists that the Euphrates and the Tigris are not international
waters. 'They both have their sources in Turkish soil,' he says.
Moreover the Turks remain extremely wary of becoming involved in any
multilateral accord, unwilling to embroil themselves in Syria's own disputes
with Iraq. Turkish officials point out that Syria and Iraq almost went to
war when Syria started construction of its Taqba Dam in the mid-1970s.
The rival riparian claims have frightened off potential donors, the Japanese
recently having pulled out of a Dollars 350m canal irrigation development,
reportedly following pressure from the Syrians. 'Until there is a permanent
agreement I don't think Japan will finance this project,' said a Japanese
embassy official in Ankara.
According to Mr Asaf Guven, then head of the Treasury, in the 1970s the
World Bank agreed to finance the Keban Dam, but only on condition that
Turkey guaranteed to supply Syria with 350 cubic metres a second for the
duration of the loan.
On both Keban and the Karakaya development, the use of international
financing gave the World Bank and other donors some control over how Turkey
used its resources and their impact on downstream users. Significantly, when
it came to finding credits for the Lower Euphrates development and the
Ataturk Dam, Turkey decided to finance.
As Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, once put it: 'Water is an
upstream resource and downstream users cannot tell us how to use our
resources'. Whether the current tension ever erupts into open hostilities
will depend much on the extent to which all three countries manage to
realise their planned irrigation projects. Turkish water officials estimate
Syria can only make use of a third of the 500 cubic metres a second it
currently receives, yet Damascus continues to demand 700 cubic metres.
Turkey's own plans to irrigate more than 1.7m hectares may prove over
ambitious in itself, depending as it does on being able to finance the canal
infrastructure and to continue to subsidise its farmers.
Turkey's budget problems have already served to set back the completion
date. Moreover, once the dam is filled, Turkey says it will increase the
water discharge to Syria as it fires up its power turbines. The first two
units will be started tomorrow.
Officials also point out the original protocol contained an implicit
undertaking that once the dam was filled, negotiations would restart on
water sharing. Today, Turkey's desperate need for funds may persuade the
government to revive this search for a political solution to the dispute.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (1): A tall
order for Turkey - Ankara is seeking to restore the once 'Fertile Crescent'
to its former glory. But the success of this ambitious and costly project
hinges on whether the country can resolve a water dispute with Iraq and
Syria and find a lasting solution to the instability within its Kurdish
population, says John Murray Brown, who wrote this survey

WHETHER a bold experiment in social engineering, or the profligate use of a
scarce resource, the day of reckoning is fast approaching for Turkey's South
East Anatolian Project.
Guneydogu Anadolu Projesi, or Gap as it is better known, is Turkey's most
ambitious public investment, and the largest construction project in the
countries bordering the Mediterranean. It comprises a sprawling network of
hydro-power plants and irrigation schemes spanning the Euphrates and Tigris
rivers along Turkey's borders with Iraq and Syria. Just as the ancients
developed this alluvial plain, so Turkey is seeking to harness its potential
to restore the once 'Fertile Crescent' to some of its former glory.
The Gap is a large undertaking supported at the highest level by a political
elite dominated by engineers. The project promises much but it has soured
relations with Turkey's two downstream neighbours. A continuing riparian
dispute with Syria and Iraq means few western donors are willing to provide
credits for the development. Turkey has thus been forced increasingly to
rely on its own over-stretched financial resources. Amid renewed budget
constraints, the government is engaged in a policy review.
Tomorrow, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, will celebrate another
landmark when turbines come into action for the first time on the large
Ataturk Dam on the Euphrates, producing the first kilowatt of electricity
from this Dollars 4bn investment.
With the Ataturk reservoir almost full, Turkey will soon have to decide
whether to press ahead with its irrigation plans, diverting more water from
the Euphrates, or first seek to negotiate a permanent water settlement with
Iraq and Syria. Ankara would appear to have incentives to seek agreement.
Syrian support for Turkey's Kurdish rebels, which is linked to the water
issue, is the most important. It was Turkey's decision to push ahead on the
Ataturk project in 1983 and this is widely seen in Ankara as the reason
Syria started backing the PKK, the Kurdish Workers Party.
Signs of a political settlement are appearing. Turkey is participating in
the technical meetings on water in Vienna in the context of the Arab Israeli
peace talks. Last November, Istanbul was offered as the venue for an
international water conference, a plan which was later cancelled over the
issue of Israel's presence. Turkey has even floated a plan to redirect two
of its rivers, the Ceyhan and Seyhan, which end in the Mediterranean, so as
make them flow to its Arab neighbours. If there is to be a comprehensive
settlement of the region's problems, Turkey's Gap project seems certain to
feature.
The Gap was conceived as early as the 1950s - some even say it was Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk, the country's founder, who dreamt up the scheme. But the need
to find a cheaper fuel stock and to reduce the import bill, created by the
first oil crisis in the late 1970s, spurred the authorities into action.
Today, power generation is just one element of a project embracing
irrigation, infrastructure development and social services.
Officials put the total cost of the Gap at Dollars 9bn. By the next century,
when the irrigation infrastructure and all 21 dams and 19 power plants are
in place, the total cost will have reached Dollars 32bn.
The narrow objective has been to redress the imbalances of Turkey's poorest
region, creating jobs in an area facing endemic unemployment, the country's
highest population growth, and the social and economic deprivations
associated with an eight-year-old rebel insurgency.
The scheme will increase Turkey's irrigated farmland by a third. Power from
the dams will double the country's electricity capacity. The Gap spans eight
provinces and is envisaged as the economic catalyst for a multitude of
ancillary economic activities from seed manufacturing to textile production.
The social impact is no less ambitious. Land reform offers a panacea for
poor farmers caught in a trap of debt in a region where feudal allegiances
still predominate. The advent of new farm technologies promises to drag
these backward rural communities into the modern age, raising income levels
and introducing mechanisation and the science of modern inputs such as
fertiliser and pesticides.
By directing public investment to the region, the broader objective is to
stem the flow of migrant workers, which has put such a strain on public
services in cities such as Istanbul and Izmir. The promise of jobs and a
better life is seen as a way to win Kurdish hearts and minds and undermine
the popular support of the PKK.
The project is far from complete. Target dates have been repeatedly moved
back. A senior official suggested the best they could hope for was to build
all the dams by 2005, the original year of completion of the whole project.
But the Gap has also brought considerable benefits. Turkish construction
groups have gained invaluable experience, which is paying dividends in
markets further afield. The project has engaged the country's best
engineers, scientists and urban planners. The Turks are rightly proud of
such achievement.
There is none the less a growing need to reconcile some of the project's
conflicting aims. In an economy where subsidies have long been seen as a
cure for an ailing agriculture, the policy of food support will have to be
reviewed in the light of the anticipated surpluses produced by the Gap.
Experts are looking at appropriate marketing strategies, keen to stop
farmers producing surpluses of crops which are impossible to sell.
A debate is being conducted on whether policy should be framed to keep
families on the land, or to provide alternative employment in urban areas.
Many agronomists predict there will be a consolidation of land holdings as
large agribusiness concerns move in on smallholders unable to finance the
required new inputs. Such a development would run counter to one of the
Gap's social imperatives to help the rural poor.
At a time of high inflation and spiralling budget deficits, the main
argument continues to centre on the project's cost. Officials calculate it
will pay for itself in about six years. However, some other estimates say
the Gap accounts for a third of Turkey's 70 per cent inflation rate.
The indirect costs have made their mark. The investment incentives and the
special levies introduced on luxury goods imports and other items -
specifically for the Gap - have served to distort budget calculations
further still.
Without outside assistance, the financial squeeze will continue to affect
the timing. It will have an important effect on some of the policy choices,
most immediately the choice of irrigation system which will directly affect
the downstream users.
Mr Olcay Unver, head of the Gap authority, says that 70 per cent of the
irrigation canals will use gravity surface techniques, with the rest using a
pressurised hose - either drip or sprinkler. Uncovered surface canals, while
less costly, are considered the most extravagant in terms of water use.
Moreover, the environmental effect of large-scale gravity irrigation, if not
properly managed, could result in dangerously high levels of salt deposits
in the soils.
Only if Turkey can solicit foreign assistance can new investments be made in
the sophisticated technologies needed to conserve the water supplies. That
will only happen if Turkey can resolve its water dispute with Iraq and Syria
and find a lasting solution to its own Kurdish crisis - a tall order for any
government.

FOREIGN investment in Venezuela has remained strong this year, according to

February's unsuccessful coup attempt, writes Joe Mann in Caracas.
The Ministry of Development estimated that direct foreign investment for the
first half of this year reached about Dollars 550m, sharply higher than in
the same period last year.
New investment was concentrated in industry, with a big share going to
petrochemicals. Investments included fresh capital from overseas,
reinvestment of retained earnings by foreign companies, and debt-equity
swaps.

THE Indian Supreme Court yesterday ordered the Uttar Pradesh state
government to 'unconditionally stop' all construction activity in Ayodhya
before the court decides whether a Hindu temple can be built on disputed
land.
The country's highest court said it expected the state government to talk to
the parties concerned and report by today whether there was an agreement to
stop all work.
In Ayodhya, Hindu militants, joined by saffron-clad priests, continued
construction work for the 14th consecutive day, ignoring both the court
order and armed paramilitary troops. The Hindus are attempting to build a
temple on the site of a 16th Century Babri mosque in the north of India.
The Supreme Court has in effect granted the ruling Congress party a
temporary reprieve from deciding whether to dismiss the Hindu revivalist
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government. The BJP had allowed Hindu
militants to defy a court order prohibiting construction on the site. Five
stock brokers arrested in India's securities scandal, were released
yesterday on bail, writes R C Murthy in Bombay. A member of India's Planning
Commission resigned yesterday over his reported investments in a company
linked to the scandal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA has passed a law implementing stringent traffic regulations. With
apparent disregard for Indonesia's per capita income - about Rupiah1.2m
(Dollars 600) a year - even the smallest traffic offence could cost
motorists a year's salary or several months in jail.
Jakarta abounds with anarchic driving: leave the smallest gap between two
speeding cars and a third will nose its way in; motor cyclists, often
without helmets, career down dual carriage ways in the wrong direction to
beat the traffic.
When the new regulations come into force in September not wearing a
motorcycle helmet will carry a fine of up to Rp1m; jumping a red light, up
to Rp2m; and an expired licence could send the driver to jail for six months
or a lead to a fine of Rp6m.
Motorists say the new regulations are unjustly harsh. Many cars, including
most of Jakarta's taxis, lack seat belts but not wearing one could cost you
Rp3m.
The new decree has led to protests from university students and highlighted
the weakness of Indonesia's law-making process. Mr Ismail Saleh, the
minister of justice, has said the proposals, drawn up by civil servants,
were not passed through his office, breaking usual procedure.
Advocates of the bill point out that anything which reduces road deaths  -
an estimated 10,000 people are killed in Indonesia each year in traffic
accidents - should be welcomed.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Maastricht clouds cast shadow on Lisbon: Portugal has much
to gain from fuller European union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOUDS MAY have gathered over Maastricht, but Lisbon remains firmly
committed to European union and deepening integration. For the Portuguese
government, ratification of the Maastricht treaty is part and parcel of its
ambitious plans for accelerated economic convergence with its richer
northern partners. The treaty's survival, in one form or another, is
therefore of key importance to Portugal which was stunned by Denmark's 'no'
vote last month.
The Danish rejection gave hope to the small band of Portuguese Euro-sceptics
who see Maastricht's plans for deeper integration as an attack on the
country's sovereignty. Ireland's 'yes' vote restored official confidence,
though the government could rely on the European Community's enduring
popularity. Polls consistently give over 60 per cent of Portuguese voters in
favour of ratification with only a small minority - well under 20 per cent -
against.
There are good reasons for the Community's popularity. As the poorest member
state when it joined in 1986, Portugal has received massive EC aid. Between
1986 and 1990, Portugal received Ecu2.9bn (Dollars 3.7bn), representing 1.6
per cent of its gross domestic product, in structural funds alone.
Under the Community Support Framework programme agreed in October 1989,
Portugal is set to receive Ecu 7.368bn for the period 1989-93, equivalent to
3.5 per cent of its GDP, and representing a subsidy of close to Dollars
1,000 per inhabitant. In addition, soft loans from the European Investment
Bank and other EC institutions could reach Ecu 2.8bn. Portugal expects EC
aid to double when the Community's next financial package for 1993-97 is
agreed.
The impact on one of Europe's poorest nations has been dramatic. Domestic
and foreign investment has rocketed and the economy grew more than 4.5 per
cent on an annual average between 1986 and 1990. Standards of living have
risen and unemployment is under 4 per cent. Direct foreign investment rose
faster in Portugal than in other peripheral countries, roughly doubling
every year to reach above Esc1,000bn (Dollars 7.5bn) last year.
A European Commission study says: 'Foreign investment. . . is contributing
significantly to the restructuring of Portuguese industry in developing
sectors, such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical and electronic
equipment, and transport equipment, thus underpinning domestic efforts to
strengthen Portuguese intra-industry competitiveness in the internal
market.'
Fears that competition from eastern Europe would be detrimental to Portugal
have not materialised, and the Commission calculates that German unification
alone caused an additional increase of 0.7 per cent in Portuguese GDP since
July 1990.
Full economic union will also have a positive effect. 'Portugal is likely to
be a prime beneficiary of the advantages of Emu. Transaction costs savings
and the suppression of exchange rate variability by virtue of a single
currency will be very significant for Portugal whose currency is only
marginally used as a means of international payments and whose financial
service sector is not developed as in the richer part of the Community,' the
study says.
Getting there is the difficult part, and for Portugal which wants to be
among Emu's founder members by joining in 1997 or by 1999 at the latest, it
is a formidable challenge.
Inflation, the toughest nut to crack, will have to be brought down from 11.2
per cent in 1991, more than twice the EC average, to within 1.5 points of
the Community's best performers; the budget deficit cut from last year's 6.5
per cent to 3 per cent of GDP; the public sector debt brought to below 60
per cent of GDP; interest rates will have to come down and the escudo, which
only entered the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
three months ago, will have to move into the narrow 2.5 per cent band. All
the while, Portugal will have to grow at a faster rate than its Community
partners.
Portugal's convergence plan aims to satisfy all these requirements, some
before 1997. But there is a constant danger of slippage. Critics doubt it is
possible simultaneously to reduce inflation - and hold back wages when there
is practically full employment - and maintain high rates of growth and
investment. They also wonder whether the government has the political
courage to push through the tough medicine needed to tackle budget deficits.
What is not in doubt is that Portugal will need more help to restructure its
agriculture and ailing industries, and to modernise its infrastructures.
That is why it wants an early agreement on a new Community budget including
the new 'cohesion fund' to help the EC's poorest members catch up.
Help is important if the government is to contain growing social pressures.
Farmers have demonstrated noisily against the reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy which their leaders say could force 70 per cent of
Portugal's farmers off the land. Thousands of workers in the textile
industry face lay-offs as competition from within and outside the EC
intensifies, and companies - not only in the textile sector - have
campaigned vigorously for protection against what they see as a precipice
opening up under their feet. Trade unions are flexing their muscles for a
fight with the government over plans to trim the public sector which employs
some 600,000 workers, representing 17 per cent of Portugal's 3.5m labour
force.
The government will extend help to farmers and it hopes that enough jobs
will be created as an alternative for workers facing lay-offs in traditional
industries.
But it has less room for manoeuvre as far as public finances are concerned.
The budget deficit has to be reduced to meet the tough conditions imposed by
Maastricht for monetary union. With an overall cut in expenditures ruled out
by the need to spend more on education and health as well as to co-finance
EC-backed investments, reducing the public administration bill is a
politically acceptable alternative to raising taxes, but the social and
political strains of convergence are starting to show.
With an election in the recent past (last October), the government has
another four years to show that it can make its ambitious convergence plans
stick - provided Maastricht itself remains on target.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Madrid seeks private cash for public works: The list of
projects is long, but the money is short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief planning executive at Spain's Public Works ministry, Mr Carlos
Alberto Zaragoza, says international financiers queue outside his office.
'From BNP to NatWest, from Goldman Sachs to Indo Suez, they all want to see
me.'
Mr Zaragoza has only himself to blame if his appointment book is full. In a
series of recent presentations to investment banks he has outlined domestic
infrastructure investment of Pta15,000bn (Dollars 159.5bn) through to the
year 2007 and explained that only some Pta8,000bn-Pta9,000bn of the total
will be provided by the central budget.
The presentations deliver a very simple message: the government has an
enormous public works shopping list, it has very little money to spend on
it, and it wants the private sector to provide the balance. The bottom line
is that the Public Works Ministry is putting the final touches to the
creation of an autonomous agency which will channel project finance into the
nation's infrastructure.
'The ministry seems to be quite clear about the need for such an agency,'
says Mr Carlos de la Serna, head of research at Iberagentes, a Madrid
broking house owned by Credit Suisse. 'It also has increasingly clear ideas
about the options it has to guarantee the finance.'
The shopping list would make even a government with a budget surplus blanch.
Mr Zaragoza's priorities are:
A second national road plan which will add 4,000km of motorways in the
course of the 1990s to the existing 6,000km high quality road network.
A 10-year programme to bring water treatment in Spain up to European
Community standards - 60 per cent of the population receives either
deficiently treated or wholly untreated water.
Large railway investment involving an upgraded commuter line network to
serve Madrid and high-speed track linking Madrid with Barcelona and the
French high-speed railway system.
A Pta120bn-Pta150bn enlargement of Madrid's Barajas airport.
Mr Zaragoza is especially concerned about the road plan. The water treatment
plants will be paid for by end users and the cost of railway networks and
airports is likewise to be passed on to those who make use of such
facilities. Building the motorways, however, requires the government to
abandon a key tenet in its approach to road transport.
'The government had always said that the public sector had sole
responsibility for building the road network and that there would be no toll
motorways,' says Ms Mar Turrado, an analyst at Madrid brokers FG. Neither
principle can now be maintained because 'the government has not got the
money.'
Mr Guillermo de la Dehesa, a former senior Finance Ministry official and now
chairman of Banco Pastor, says the government's refusal to have motorists
pay for roads while airport passengers paid for airports is 'illogical'. The
author of a recent pamphlet on extra-budgetary infrastructure financing, Mr
de la Dehesa says the government is facing up to 'a radical departure from
its previous policy.'
The prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, has already warned that the 1993
state budget will be extremely restrictive. Furthermore, under the Finance
Ministry's policy paper on the convergence of Spain's economy with those of
the country's richer EC partners, the deficit should be reduced as a
percentage of gross domestic product from a current level of close to 5 per
cent to 1 per cent over the next 5-7 years.
The convergence programme sets aside 5 per cent of GDP every year for
investment in infrastructure but this chapter includes items such as the
health service, education and professional retraining. Analysts say it is
not clear how much the road network can expect from the state, and suspect
Mr Zaragoza will have to tap the markets even more than he is willing to
admit.
The likelihood is that as early as September the expected project finance
agency will be preparing to issue its first infrastructure bond. The first
issue, raising Pta50bn-Pta70bn, is expected to finance a 108km motorway
linking the Basque industrial centre of Bilbao and the city of Santander,
further west along the Cantabrian coast.
The issue could be guaranteed by a toll or, more probably, by a new annual
infrastructure tax. The latter would either be levied on Spanish car owners
and on foreign motorists entering Spain, or would be added on to petrol
prices.
Analysts expect that such a bond will incorporate generous tax rebates and
that it will prove popular. The financiers calling on Mr Zaragoza appear to
have similar ideas.
Building the new motorways requires the government to abandon a key tenet in
its approach to road transport.

THE United Nations, already pouring relief supplies into Bosnia, fears that
winter hardships could force a million more people to leave their homes in
the newly-independent Balkan state and become refugees, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
'We are already assisting 2.5 million people (from Bosnia) and we are
terrified at the way this conflict is evolving,' said Mr Jose Maria
Mendiluce, special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
'We are not expecting a massive return of population to their place of
origin (after the war). We are witnessing ..a growing conviction among the
people that the situation will never be as it was,' he said.
Mr Mendiluce said a big fear was that as winter approached, hundreds of
thousands more civilians would try to leave their bombarded towns and cities
in search of food, warmth and safety.
The UNHCR has called a conference in Geneva next week to ask the world
community for more support and to establish mechanisms to deal with the
crisis.

FT  23 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke suffers steep fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE
THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY and leisure group Ladbroke plunged in very heavy turnover as a
combination of technical factors and renewed trading worries hit the stock.
The shares continued to tumble in after-hours' trading as rumours circulated
that the group would be issuing a statement today. A spokesman for Ladbroke
dismissed the story as 'rubbish'.
Early trading was dominated by two large lines of stock which had difficulty
finding a home. Later, talk again focused on Ladbroke's exposure to the
wilting US property market and the flat UK consumer market, where its
leisure and DIY interests are suffering badly.
The shares closed 17 off at 158p - their lowest since January 1988 - in
turnover exceeding 7m. Traders were marking the shares down by as much as a
further 15p in after-hours' trade as nervousness grew that a gloomy
statement may be forthcoming.
Lasmo steadier
Further good news on the exploration front staunched the latest flow of
selling in Lasmo, the oil exploration and production group. Lasmo shares
have been undermined by a succession of bearish stories since the company's
takeover of Ultramar.
The group said yesterday that an exploration well in Morecambe Bay, off the
coast of England, had produced an oil flow of 1,370 barrels a day, as well
as gas from a separate zone. Lasmo has a 30 per cent stake in the block
containing the oil and gas discovery. Monument Oil &amp; Gas has a 20 per cent
holding.
The oil and gas find is the second piece of encouraging drilling news for
Lasmo this week. On Monday, the group's Indonesian gas reserves were sharply
increased following an independent evaluation. Lasmo is due to announce
interim figures next Wednesday. The stock settled 1 1/2 off at 125p, having
fallen to 123p earlier in the day. Monument managed a minor gain at 32 1/4
p.
Carlton wanted
An improved recommendation from the company's broker was said to be behind
the rise in new Footsie constituent Carlton Communications. The stock was
the day's strongest among the FT-SE 100 components, appreciating 11 to 585p.
Cazenove, which never comments on market speculation, was believed to have
put Carlton on its buy list, focusing on news that the group's Technicolor
unit had retained a film processing contract from Sony's Columbia Tri-Star.
However, some analysts said fears of Carlton losing the contract had
actually faded a few months ago.
Varied attitudes among London share analysts following Tuesday's interim
report from Reuters left the stock sharply lower. After some erratic
trading, the bear view prevailed and the shares closed a further 35 down at
1090p.
Agency broker James Capel reinforced its sell advice and argued that
Reuters' cash mountain of Pounds 600m did not fit well with its high
price/earnings ratio. BZW said: 'The company is now right at the top end of
UK growth stock ratings,' adding that Reuters needs to approach 1025p before
becoming attractive.
However, broker Hoare Govett points out that the company is some 35 per cent
held in the US, where its p/e relative is not nearly so demanding. Hoare is
maintaining its buy stance and is considering raising its full-year profits
forecast to Pounds 380m.
Mirror Group Newspapers continued to rise against the market, with most
traders believing a stakebuilder was at work. The shares firmed 1 3/4 to 65
1/4 p on another heavy turnover of 6.1m.
Marketmakers are convinced that one buyer has been constantly picking up the
shares with a view to a bid or, alternatively, a belief that the stock
offers very good value. Most analysts say institutional investors
acknowledge the value in MGN but are staying well clear because of the
Maxwell aura still surrounding the company.
The property sector picked itself up from its recent drubbing as bargain
hunters were spotted. British Land, helped by a County NatWest note on
superstore investments, put on 2 to 186p. Greycoat's good run continued as
James Capel was reported to be positive ahead of today's figures, for which
there is hope that the dividend will be held.
Hammerson, missing from most broker's recent recommendations, at last found
some support, the 'A' shares bouncing 8 to 260p. MEPC gained 7 to 267p, Land
Securities 4 to 387p and Slough Estates 5 to 127p. Southend Properties
jumped 6 to 42p on well-received results.
SmithKline Beecham units were a penny firmer at 413p as one US house
upgraded the company to a strong buy, but the 'A' shares eased 3 to 454p.
After several days of selling pressure, Thorn EMI bounced initially with the
help of a supportive note from Hoare Govett, the securities house, arguing
that the group was now at the bottom of its relative range.
News that the loss-making security division may be off-loaded, and a trade
press feature claiming that the Office of Fair Trading would not be
investigating compact disc prices, also helped sentiment.
The OFT rejected the press comments, stressing that no decision had yet been
taken on whether to launch an inquiry. The shares were finally 2 easier on
balance at 743p.
Unigate slipped 9 to 277p after chairman Sir Brian Kellett told the annual
meeting that 'we must expect the present difficult trading conditions to
continue for the time being'.
Regional brewer Morland reversed an initial gain to finish a net 2 off at
461p, ahead of tomorrow's closing day for the bid from Greene King, 6
cheaper at 514p.
Enterprise Oil rallied well, adding 6 1/2 at 325 1/2 p, with dealers arguing
that the recent steep fall in the shares had been overdone. The stock was
also helped by a bullish note on the exploration and production sub-sector
issued by Hoare Govett.
The combination of a large seller and the effects of an overhang of stock on
dealers' books caused Siebe to drop 24 to 639p.
Weakness in the construction sector was only one of the factors that
undermined Trafalgar House. The shares gave up 5 1/2 to 67 1/2 p as dealers
also focused on fears about the dividend and uncertainty over the Hong Kong
Airport project, for which Trafalgar is a major contractor. Poor sentiment
in the construction sector left P &amp; O 14 lighter at 344p.

MEXICO'S stock market ended 2 per cent weaker yesterday, dragged down by a
4.1 per cent drop in Cemex 'B' shares and a decline of 2 per cent for
Telmex, the respective cement and telephone companies.
Cemex CPO shares - those held in a special trust for foreign investors -
were down 10 per cent at one point, as Morgan Stanley, previously a staunch
Cemex supporter, failed to endorse the company in a report.
Foreign investors have reacted negatively to Cemex's recent decision to buy
Spain's two largest cement companies, Sanson and Valenciana.

Wall Street
LOSSES ON overseas equity markets, prompted by concern about the global
economy, led to heavy selling of US stocks yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 30.80 down at 3,277.61, its lowest
for more than a month. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 2.83 to 410.93, while
the American SE composite lost 1.65 to 383.17 and the Nasdaq composite 4.75
to 563.88. Turnover on the New York SE was 192m shares.
In Tokyo overnight, stocks fell to their lowest levels for six years, which
sparked a sell-off in major European markets. That set the tone for a weak
opening in the US, and within the first few minutes the Dow had registered a
20-point decline.
The selling spread throughout the market and, as on Monday, motor shares
were particularly weak.
Ford receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 in turnover of 2.2m shares,
General Motors weakened Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 in similarly active
trading, and Chrysler slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 18 1/2 .
Bankers Trust climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 1/4 on news of an 11 per
cent gain in second quarter net income to Dollars 205m. Banc One dipped
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 after announcing the Dollars 125m acquisition
of Illinois-based First Community Bancorp, which forged ahead Dollars 8 1/4
to Dollars 26 3/4 , and a joint venture with three other regional banking
groups to form an electronic payment services company.
Other bank stocks lost ground, with Wells Fargo retreating Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 69 1/2 , Chemical Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 7/8 , BankAmerica
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 25
7/8 .
Compaq jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 27 3/4 on reporting second quarter
net income of 35 cents a share, up from 23 cents and well above the 29 cents
expected by analysts.
Upjohn rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 33 7/8 in active trading after the
company said its scientists had created a compound which it believed is more
potent in blocking the growth of the HIV virus than its AZT drug.
Harley-Davidson advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 on news of second
quarter operating income of 49 cents a share, up from the 45 cents recorded
a year earlier.
Canada
TORONTO closed lower after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index declined 13.1
to 3,412.1, while falls outscored advances by 305 to 238 after a volume of
23.9m shares valued at CDollars 317.7m.
Imperial Oil gained CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 44 5/8 . The company reported
a second-quarter profit of 30 cents a share, compared with year-earlier
earnings of 3 cents.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Bearish sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SENTIMENT IN the sterling money markets remained bearish yesterday after the
June figure for Germany's M3 money supply growth came in at 8.7 per cent,
well above the Bundesbank's target.
Dealers fear that monetary growth will force the German central bank to
raise the Lombard rate when it meets again next month. There was light
relief in the market after the Bundesbank decided to inject DM7.7bn into the
banking system, in what was seen as an attempt to push German call money
rates away from the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent. But there is still an
outside chance of another monetary tightening.
The market was also unnerved by the Bank of Spain's decision to drain
overnight funds from the interbank market at 12.75 per cent, compared to
12.45 per cent previously. The move was interpreted as signalling monetary
rigour.
Both the German and Spanish developments are certain to put pressure on
sterling in the European Monetary System, and the pound again looked weak
yesterday, closing a pfennig down on the day. One clearing bank dealer said
the UK June trade figures, which showed a widening of the visible trade
deficit to Pounds 0.9bn, had little effect on the money market. 'Sentiment
now is driven by Germany and the EMS issue, and little else,' he added.
Cash rates ended mostly unchanged, with everything from two-month money out
to one-year at 10 5/16 per cent on the offered side. The flat yield curve
indicated how bearish dealers are about the chance of a base rate cut, even
in the long term.
Futures trading was more exciting. The September short sterling contract
opened at 89.73 and ranged up to 89.78 in the morning on technical trading.
The German M3 news quickly pushed it down, as did rumours that the Bank of
Italy will devalue at the weekend. The front-month contract closed at its
low of 89.67.
The Bank of England's operations were straight-forward after the authorities
forecast a shortage of Pounds 550m. The Bank purchased Pounds 403m of Band 1
bank bills at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the
Bank bought Pounds 146m of Band 2 bank bills, also at 9 7/8 per cent.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling continues to weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING continued to perform nervously against the D-Mark yesterday after
Germany's figure for June M3 money supply came in at 8.7 per cent, writes
James Blitz.
The fear that the Bundesbank will lift its Lombard rate when its council
meets next month continues to hang over the pound. A poor set of UK trade
figures for June also depressed the currency, with the visible trade deficit
widening by Pounds 0.1bn from the previous month. Yesterday, sterling
declined a pfennig from its previous close to DM2.8325.
A worrying feature of the pound's performance is that it is the only
currency in the European exchange rate mechanism which continues to weaken
against the D-Mark following Monday's concerted intervention in the market
by the US Federal Reserve and the European central banks.
The Italian lira showed some improvement against the D-Mark, firming to
L758.2 from a previous L759.4. The Spanish peseta strengthened to Pta64.10
to the D-Mark from Tuesday's Pta64.16 close, while the French franc steadied
against the German currency, ending unchanged at FFr3.378.
The underlying problem for sterling is that most of the central banks with
high-yielding currencies have tightened either fiscal or monetary policy to
withstand the D-Mark's rise.
The Bank of Spain appeared to be tightening monetary policy yesterday by
draining overnight funds from the interbank market at 12.75 per cent,
compared to 12.45 per cent previously. The Italians have raised their
discount rate by 1.75 percentage points in the last two weeks, and are also
attempting to slim down their budget.
Yesterday's announcement of a tighter fiscal package by the UK government
may have an effect on sterling in the next few days.
Dollar/D-Mark trading was sidelined yesterday, with most traders confident
that Monday's central bank intervention will keep the US currency trading in
tight ranges for a while. The dollar moved between DM1.4780 and DM1.4900,
closing unchanged at DM1.4885. Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony on the US
economy continued to have little effect on the currency, but unfounded
rumours that the United Nations had started military operations against Iraq
brought support. The dollar ended in New York at DM1.4852.
The yen was lower against both the D-Mark and dollar yesterday following the
resumed slide in the Japanese stock market which left the Nikkei average at
a six-year low of 15,542. As a result, the dollar moved up to Y127.20 at the
start of European trading from an opening of Y125.25. It ended in London at
Y126.85. The D-Mark rallied to a closing Y85.25 in Europe from an opening of
Y84.07. In New York the US unit closed at Y126.68.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuelan oil capacity set to
rise 16% by 1996

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA is aiming to increase its crude oil production capacity to 3.3m.
barrels a day by 1996, compared with 2.83m b/d at the end of 1991, a rise of
16 per cent.
Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of the national oil corporation PDVSA, said in
Caracas that the higher potential should be reached despite cuts in capital
investment. It should enable PDVSA to more or less eliminate dependence on
other suppliers for its US refining and marketing operations.
Mr Roosen also forecast 'abundant crude production' worldwide next year
predicting that international crude prices would 'remain constant, or
slightly lower, than in 1992 in real terms.'
PDVSA is reducing its capital investments this year by USDollars 530m, to
Dollars 4.5bn.
To meet its substantial market commitment in the US the company,which has a
large oil refining and marketing system there, currently has to buy an
average of about 600,000 b/d of crude on the US market.
By steadily raising crude output capacity - and production - over the next
few years, the company hopes to sharply reduce its dependence on crude
purchases from other parties.
Venezuela's crude oil production has risen steadily in recent years.
In 1991 average output of crude, condensates and natural gas liquids was
2.49m b/d, the highest level on record since the Venezuelan oil industry was
nationalised in 1976. It compared with 2.25m b/d in 1990.
Crude production averaged about 2.39m b/d for the first quarter of 1992.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Roses of Ecuador bloom against
the odds - Export growth in the face of Colombian predominance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECUADOR HAS built up a small but profitable flower business in just 10
years, with annual exports now worth nearly Dollars 20m. However, production
is also rising rapidly in other central and South American countries -
especially Colombia - and flowers are flooding into the US market at a time
when spending has been hit by recession.
'If Colombia goes on growing like this, it's very dangerous for the flower
market - it will affect everyone, prices will be very low and there could be
reactions from US flower producers,' says Mr Mauricio Davalos, president of
Ecuador's flower exporters' association.
Ecuador has about 400 hectares under flowers, less than one-tenth of area
covered by Colombia's plantations. Most of the technology and much of the
recent capital has been brought in by Colombians, who have found that
growing conditions on the Equator just north of Quito are difficult to beat.
Soil, sunshine and the great variety of microclimates make it possible to
produce a big range of flower types.
Roses have been particularly successful in Ecuador, while cultivation of
pompoms, carnations and gypsophilia is increasing. Ecuadorean labour is
cheap. Most plantations lie within easy reach of Quito airport but transport
costs from Quito to Miami are relatively high compared with the Bogota-Miami
charges.
Investment in infrastructure is also unnecessarily high, according to Mr
Davalos. 'We have a terrible duplication of investment because the state
services are so bad - we have to buy radios for communication and
electricity generating plants, and there are water problems too,' he says.
Another problem for Ecuadorean growers is the cost of importing many of the
pesticides and fertilisers used in the industry.
The incoming government, which takes over on August 10, is expected to
privatise some state services, including telephones. There will also be more
support for exporters - under the present government devaluation has moved
more slowly than inflation and high interest rates have made credit
expensive. The number of companies exporting flowers has doubled in the last
four years, but this reflects foreign rather than national investment.
About 80 per cent of Ecuador's flower exports go to the US, and another 7
per cent to Germany and Holland. But the freight costs to Europe are almost
prohibitive, particularly now that several African countries with extremely
cheap labour are competing in European flower markets and Colombia already
has well-established links.
Despite a 35 per cent growth in flower income during the first quarter of
1992, Colombian producers have been hit by water and electricity rationing.
This has curbed expansion in recent months, while anti-dumping measures
taken by the US against Colombian carnation and chrysanthemum exporters have
made them more cautious.
Such factors apart, one of Colombia's big advantages is its technical
expertise in floriculture - a benefit that has spilled over into Ecuador as
Colombian agronomists have moved in with Colombian investors.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: German money supply figures bring unease
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORSE-than-expected figures on the German money supply further knocked
confidence in European bond markets yesterday, though an easing of pressure
in the German money markets allowed bunds to recover their poise by the end
of the day.
The keenly-awaited June growth rate for M3 came in at 8.7 per cent, down
from a revised 8.8 per cent for May (previously also recorded at 8.7 per
cent). The news undermined a rally in the bund market, which had been
prompted by speculation early in the day that the M3 data would show a
growth rate of 8.3 per cent.
The latest figure was largely disregarded as a guide to the future direction
of German monetary policy. Last week's move by the Bundesbank to raise the
discount rate while leaving the key Lombard rate untouched would have been
taken with full knowledge of the latest money supply position, analysts
said.
'The key number will be the July figure, which comes out in August,' said
one economist. 'At the moment, it's too close to call.'
In the meantime, the Bundesbank's actions at its weekly repurchase tender
confirmed its apparent intention since last week's rate rise to alleviate
tension in the money market. 'They're giving the impression that the market
has taken their move last week too seriously,' said Mr Neville Quie, an
analyst at Salomon Brothers in London.
The authorities injected a net DM7.7bn into the market, at a general rate of
9.7 per cent. That helped money market rates to fall to below 9.7 per cent,
further below the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate.
The bund futures contract on Liffe traded in a range of 87.05-87.41, before
coming to rest at 87.27, up on the day.
THE UK government bond market was shaken temporarily by the the German money
supply figures, but it recovered later.
Fixated by events in Germany, the news that retail sales in June had fallen
by 0.2 per cent had little effect on the market. 'People are now waiting to
see what comes out of the cabinet about public spending,' said one observer.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, has given stern warnings
that public spending will have to be contained to prevent the fiscal deficit
rising, and the market is now waiting to see whether he can deliver.
Gilt futures, which had opened at 98.23, ended the day lower at 98.17,
though up from the 89.09 they touched after the news from Germany.
ANOTHER decline in equity prices worldwide and speculation that the Federal
Reserve was in the market buying bonds provided US Treasury securities with
a boost.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/2 at 104 3/8
, yielding 7.618 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/16 at 101 3/8 , to
carry a yield of 4.235 per cent.
The main influence on early trading was the fall in Japanese, European and
US stock markets. Hopes that lower equity prices would persuade investors to
move out of stocks and into government securities gave a lift to the long
end of the Treasury market.
The second day of congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Fed, was mostly ignored.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANC ONE, the expansionist Ohio-based commercial banking group, has acquired
an Illinois-based bank in a stock deal valued at about Dollars 125m. In a
separate deal it said it was joining forces with three other regional
banking companies to form an electronic payment services company.
Banc One will form a new company, Electronic Payment Services, in a joint
venture with CoreStates Financial, PNC Financial and Society Corporation.
It said the new company would be the largest US processor of automated
teller machine transactions, with about 20 per cent of the national switched
volume. The new company would be a leading provider of electronic
point-of-sale transaction process services.
Banc One said the new company would process about 1bn annual ATM
transactions, with core markets in the Middle Atlantic and Midwest regions.
Its annual revenue would be more than Dollars 200m.
The four banking groups will all be equity partners in the company. The
joint venture will not have a material effect on the financial statements of
Banc One, PNC and Society. CoreStates will realise a gain of about Dollars
23m and a rise of Dollars 100m in its tangible equity.
The terms are based on Banc One's common stock price. If the market value of
Banc One's stock is between Dollars 47 and Dollars 51 a share, the exchange
rate will result in a market equivalent value of Dollars 31.96 in Banc One
common stock. If the price climbs above Dollars 51, First Community
shareholders will receive 0.6267 shares of Banc One stock for each share in
First Community. If the price falls below Dollars 47, First Community
Shareholders will receive 0.68 Banc One shares.

A SHARP rise in zinc prices helped push Cominco, the Canadian base metals
and fertiliser producer, back into the black in the second quarter.
Earnings were CDollars 18.1m (USDollars 15m), or 22 cents a share, up from
CDollars 7.3m, or eight cents a share, a year earlier.
Cominco suffered a CDollars 4.9m loss in the first quarter of 1992. Sales
advanced to CDollars 416.6m from CDollars 386.1m.
The zinc price was about 20 per cent higher in the second quarter than a
year earlier. Operating profit from mining and minerals climbed to CDollars
146.1m from CDollars 132m. Fertiliser volumes were higher, but were offset
by a continued slide in prices. Operating profit from fertilisers advanced
to CDollars 22.4m from CDollars 18.1m.
Rio Algom, a diversified Canadian mining group formerly 51 per cent
controlled by RTZ, recorded higher second-quarter earnings with better
potash and copper results and a favourable exchange rate.
Profits were CDollars 8.2m, or 17 cents a share, against CDollars 6.4m, or
13 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 264m against CDollars 267m.
First-half earnings dipped to CDollars 13m, or 27 cents a share, from
CDollars 20.4m, or 44 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 507m
against CDollars 540m.

157.3m.
A bigger increase in the effective tax rate than a year ago, however, meant
that net earnings were Dollars 99m, only slightly higher than the Dollars
97.9m earned after tax in the second quarter of 1991.
Sales in the quarter were also only slightly higher than a year ago, topping
Dollars 1.58bn between April and June, compared with Dollars 1.57bn in the
same period of 1991.
The company said revenues from the electronics, information and missiles
group rose 2 per cent in the quarter.
During the quarter, Martin Marietta won a Dollars 37m contract to develop an
improved propulsion system for the Patriot missile, and an initial Dollars
20m contract for Lantirn, a night vision navigation and targeting system,
from the Republic of Korea.
Operating earnings from the aerospace division rose by 12 per cent between
April and June, while earnings at the materials division rose 15 per cent.
Sales backlog for the entire company was valued at Dollars 9.3bn at
end-June, against Dollars 11.3bn a year ago.

FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Amoco falls as margins and
demand weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AMOCO, the fifth-biggest US energy company, yesterday reported a 22.5 per
cent drop in underlying second-quarter earnings, reflecting a squeeze on
margins and weak demand in the group's refining, marketing and
transportation divisions.
Wall Street reacted to the figures by marking Amoco's shares Dollars 1 1/2
lower to Dollars 48 5/8 .
Amoco's results were distorted by a previously announced Dollars 805m charge
for restructuring and job cuts. The provision pushed Amoco into the red for
the quarter.
Excluding the substantial charge in the latest quarter and charges of
Dollars 68m a year earlier, Amoco earned Dollars 237m, or 48 cents a share,
in the 1992 quarter. The result was still lower than the Dollars 306m, or 62
cents, earned a year earlier.
Extraordinary items in both years brought the company's reported net loss to
Dollars 478m, or 96 cents, compared with net earnings of Dollars 238m, or 48
cents, a year earlier.
Revenues advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 7.4bn in the latest quarter from
Dollars 6.8bn, largely because of the settlement of natural gas contracts.
For the first half, Amoco had a net loss of Dollars 244m, or 49 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 13.8bn. A year earlier, earnings were Dollars 1.04bn, or
Dollars 2.08, on revenues of Dollars 14.1bn. Stripping out extraordinary
items in the latest period, Amoco earned Dollars 423m, or 85 cents.
Excluding gains from an accounting change, the company last year earned
Dollars 730m, or Dollars 1.46.
Amoco said its underlying foreign exploration and production results had
fallen in the quarter. Higher exploration expenses and lower crude oil
volumes more than offset the benefits of an increase in crude oil prices and
favourable currency translations.
Including a one-time charge of Dollars 258m and the gas contracts
settlement, foreign exploration and production expanded its loss to Dollars
174m in the latest quarter from Dollars 24m a year ago. Profits from
domestic exploration and production fell to Dollars 60m from Dollars 131m.
Depressed margins cut underlying earnings from refining, marketing and
transportation to Dollars 115m, against Dollars 227m.

MICROSOFT, the world's largest provider of software for personal computers,
yesterday reported a 52 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits of
Dollars 210.1m, or 48 cents a share.
The final quarter took Microsoft's earnings for its fiscal year to Dollars
708m, or Dollars 2.41 a share, well up on the Dollars 463m earned in fiscal
1991.
The strong fourth quarter was attributable to heavy demand for new versions
of the company's Windows operating system, Microsoft Excel for Windows, and
other applications for the system. Sales of applications for Windows almost
doubled in the final quarter against a year ago.
Mr Frank Gaudette, Microsoft's executive vice-president and chief financial
officer, said investments the company had made over the years in graphical
applications of Windows were paying off, and noted that for the full year
net income was a record 25.7 per cent of revenues.
Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, said the company would continue to
invest not just in its existing successful products, 'but in object
technology, consumer systems and in database and work group technology as
well'.
In its latest fiscal year Microsoft invested Dollars 352.2m in research and
development, compared with Dollars 235.4m in the previous year. Total
operating expenses in the year just completed, including Dollars 854.5m on
sales and marketing, reached Dollars 1.29bn, up 56 per cent on the preceding
12-month period.

<TEXT>
PRESS Kogyo, a leading Japanese producer of pressed components for vehicles,
has acquired a 43.9 per cent stake in Press and Platgruppen (PPG) of Sweden
for just under Y600m (Dollars 4.8m).
Following the acquisition, PPG is to set up a venture, Press and Plat, in
Tongeren, Belgium, to supply pressings to Volvo's Belgian car production
plant.
Production is to start next year, with sales expected to reach SKr61m
(Dollars 11.3m) in 1994 and SKr90m a year later. Isuzu Motors, Nissan Motor
and Mitsubishi Motors have minor shareholdings in Press Kogyo.
Europe's components industry is likely to take a wary view of the
announcement.
Japanese car makers setting up 'transplant' manufacturing operations in
Europe - notably Nissan, Toyota and Honda in the UK - have stressed they do
not want to draw in large numbers of Japanese component suppliers in their
wake as has happened in the US.
However, there has been a slow increase in the number of Japanese suppliers
establishing bases or joint ventures in Europe.

MONTREAL Trustco, the financial services arm of BCE, Canada's largest
telecoms group, has posted a first-half loss of CDollars 52.5m (USDollars
43.70), or Dollars 1.39 a share, on revenues of CDollars 673m, after special
provisions of CDollars 94m. They included CDollars 50m to cover loans to
Olympia &amp; York Developments.
A year earlier, the company earned CDollars 29.1m, or 65 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 770m.
The second-quarter loss this year was CDollars 58.5m, or CDollars 1.51,
after the special provisions, against a profit of CDollars 14m, or 31 cents,
a year earlier.
Co-Steel, the Canadian mill group that owns Sheerness Steel in the UK,
continues to feel the impact of low prices, although North American markets
are improving.
One of the few North American steelmakers to post a profit in 1991, Co-Steel
reported second-quarter net income of CDollars 1m, or 4 cents a share, on
sales of CDollars 251m. The year-to-year comparison was distorted by special
tax factors.

ANHEUSER-Busch, the biggest brewer in the US, yesterday reported
second-quarter profits of Dollars 317.2m, up from Dollars 286.7m in the same
period a year earlier. Earnings per share increased from 99 cents to Dollars
1.09 on a fully-diluted basis.
Anheuser scored the increase on sales of Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars
3.26bn in the second quarter of 1991. This takes sales for the first half of
1992 to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 6.18bn, and after-tax profits to Dollars
541.2m, against Dollars 487.6m.
*****
Union Pacific, the US transportation company, yesterday reported a 35 per
cent rise in second-quarter profits, at Dollars 206m after tax, writes Nikki
Tait. The advance lifted net profits for the first months to Dollars 351m,
compared with Dollars 286m in the same period of 1991.
At the operating level, second-quarter figures improved more modestly -
profits were up 15 per cent at Dollars 376m - but the company said there had
been 'strong gains' in all its businesses.
The railroad division pushed up earnings by almost 9 per cent at Dollars
158m and, despite a two-day shutdown in June, car loadings rose by 2 per
cent.
*****
Hershey Foods, the largest publicly-traded manufacturer of chocolate and
confectionery products in the US, saw second-quarter profits rise to Dollars
34.5m after tax, from Dollars 31.9m a year earlier, writes Nikki Tait.
This takes after-tax earnings for the first six months of the year to
Dollars 93.4m, compared with Dollars 80.5m.
*****
Wall Street brokerage house, Bear Stearns, yesterday agreed to work with a
recently-formed consortium of seven Spanish banks to promote asset
securitisation in Spain, writes Patrick Harverson.
This is its second foray into Europe under the asset securitisation banner.
In 1989 it set up a similar joint venture in France with Credit Lyonnais.
*****
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the third largest soft-drinks group in the US, announced
a 13 per cent increase in second-quarter operating profits, to Dollars

After interest expense of Dollars 39.6m, a Dollars 6m charge to cover the
costs of cancelling a Dollars 600m public stock offering, and Dollars 4.6m
in minority interest dividend, however, the group recorded a net loss of
Dollars 2.2m in the quarter. Last time Dr Pepper made a net profit of
Dollars 2.2m.

<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Oil, Canada's biggest integrated oil company and 70 per cent-owned
by Exxon, says its performance is firmly on the mend after the 1991 roller
coaster caused by the Gulf war.
Second-quarter earnings were CDollars 58m (USDollars 48.3m), or 30 cents a
share, up from CDollars 5m, or 3 cents, in the corresponding period of 1991.
Revenues totalled CDollars 2.33bn against CDollars 2.35bn a year earlier.
In the first half, earnings were CDollars 108m, or 51 cents, against
CDollars 201m, or Dollars 1.04, a year earlier. Much of the 1991 period's
profit was due to the effect of the Gulf war. First-half revenues were
CDollars 4.4bn against CDollars 4.76bn.
Imperial said cash provided from operations in the first half, after
dividends, was CDollars 375m against CDollars 290m. Operating expense was
down 15 per cent to CDollars 246m.
'We have set a direction that will restore earnings to acceptable levels,'
said Mr Arden Haynes, chairman.
In resource operations better heavy oil prices and higher synthetic oil
production more than offset declines in conventional oil output. Petroleum
products margins contracted, while chemicals were strong in the second
quarter.

BANKERS Trust yesterday reported an 11 per cent improvement in
second-quarter profits to Dollars 205m, making it the second-best quarter in
the New York banking group's history. Return on equity for the three months
was 26 per cent.
Mr Charles Sanford, chairman (pictured right), said every leading business
line contributed to the strong quarter, but he gave a special mention to the
record-breaking performance of the bank's global capital markets operations,
which use financial derivatives to provide clients with risk management
services.
Bankers Trust said strong worldwide demand for the banks' traditional
derivatives products - such as interest rate, currency and equity swaps and
options - lifted trading revenue, which comprises both client-related and
proprietary business, to Dollars 335m, up from Dollars 329m in the same
quarter a year ago.
Earnings from fiduciary and fund management rose sharply in the quarter,
climbing 28 per cent to Dollars 180m following higher revenues from asset
management activities, particularly performance-based foreign exchange funds
management for institutional clients and private banking services.
Fees and commissions rose Dollars 12m to Dollars 137m, with corporate
finance fees receiving a lift from demand for securities underwriting.
Bankers Trust is one of only two US banks - JP Morgan is the other - allowed
by regulators to underwrite and deal in US securities.
Net interest revenue rose 29 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 252m, thanks
to a big rise in interest-earning assets and an improved interest rate
spread. Non-interest expenses increased 9 per cent to Dollars 589m.
Provision for credit losses in the April-to-June period was Dollars 75m,
compared with Dollars 52m a year ago, and Bankers Trust's net charge-offs
totalled Dollars 109m, the bulk of which was related to non-refinancing
country loans.
On the New York Stock Exchange Bankers Trust's shares rose Dollars  5/8 to
close at Dollars 61 1/4 .

NEWMONT Mining, the Denver-based gold mining group, reported second-quarter
net income of Dollars 24.4m, or 36 cents a share, compared with Dollars 22m,
or 32 cents, in the same period last year.
Lower gold prices held consolidated sales down to Dollars 158.7m compared
with Dollars 167.2m last year. The average price received for gold was
Dollars 388, down 2 per cent from last year's Dollars 395. But the results
for the three months ended June 30 were boosted by Dollars 10.6m from the
settlement of a gold-dollar swap.
The quarter was also affected by lower production at Newmont Gold, the
group's 90.1 per cent-owned subsidiary. Its output dropped to 403,000 ounces
compared with 419,000 ounces a year ago. At the same time, the cost of gold
production at Newmont Gold rose to Dollars 212 an ounce from Dollars 208 an
ounce last year.
Newmont Gold, which reports earnings separately, had second-quarter net
income of Dollars 17.2m, or 16 cents, down from Dollars 29.3m, or 28 cents
last year. Net income was reduced by Dollars 1.5m due to a write-off of
obsolete equipment.
For the first six months, Newmont Mining's net income was Dollars 56.8m, or
83 cents, down from Dollars 59.4m, or 88 cents. The 1992 period included an
after-tax charge of Dollars 11.6m for a shift to new accounting standards.

FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Intel delays launch of advanced
chip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips, said that it would
delay the introduction of its next-generation product, code-named P5, until
the first quarter of 1993 to allow more time for testing.
The P5, which will be renamed before its official launch, is the latest
version of Intel's widely used microprocessor family, which includes the 386
and 486 devices that power most personal computers. Intel had planned to
launch the P5 during the fourth quarter of 1992.
Mr Paul Otellini, vice-president in charge of Intel's microprocessors, said
the delay did not mean that there are problems with the P5. 'We have
(prototype) parts running in multiple systems at Intel and with key
customers. Sampling to a broader range of customers will not be delayed,' he
said.
However, by delaying full- scale production of the P5, Intel will allow more
time to refine its manufacturing process, improve yields and avoid the bugs
that have plagued new microprocessors in the past.
Despite Intel's statements, analysts suspect that Intel has encountered
technical problems, forcing it to delay full-scale production.
Intel is facing rising competition in the high-performance end of the
microprocessor market from makers of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC
) microprocessors. The P5 is Intel's response to this competition.
Intel won some breathing space after Advanced Micro Devices was forced to
delay its plans to clone Intel's 486 by a court ruling on a copyright
dispute. One benefit of the delay, Intel said, was that it would be able to
increase production of the latest versions of the 486 to meet unexpectedly
high demand.

GIO Australia Holdings, the recently privatised insurance group, is expected
to trade at a small premium when the shares are listed on the Australian
stock exchange today.
Brokers said GIO, formerly owned by the state government of New South Wales,
would probably trade at a premium of about 20 cents to the flotation price
of ADollars 2.40.
Brokers had earlier suggested the shares would list at up to ADollars 2.90,
but forecasts have been reduced in line with general weakness in the
Australian market.
The ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 890m) flotation, the biggest privatisation in
Australia, was ADollars 1bn oversubscribed.
Southern Cross Airlines, which hopes to resurrect collapsed Compass Airlines
next month, is expected to begin trading today at a discount to its
flotation price of ADollars 0.50.
The ADollars 50m Southern Cross flotation was 46 per cent undersubscribed,
mainly because of worries about competition following deregulation of the
domestic aviation market in October 1990. Compass, acquired by Southern
Cross, collapsed in December after losing a fare-cutting battle with
government-owned Australian Airlines and Ansett Australia, owned by TNT and
News Corporation.

trials of new Aids drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE international Aids conference brought encouraging news for some
pharmaceutical companies yesterday.
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US was happy with the early clinical tests of
its candidate Aids drug d4T and said it planned larger-scale trials.
And its existing drug DDI, which had not performed as well on its own as
Wellcome's AZT, proved more successful in combination with AZT.
Other new Aids drugs which have recently started clinical trials - and are
giving results promising enough for the companies to continue development -
are Glaxo's 3TC, American Cyanamid's FLT and Upjohn's U-87,201E.
But the conference heard that several other development drugs, notably
Merck's L661, have been dropped because HIV, the virus that causes Aids,
becomes resistant to them rapidly.
Most drugs are continuing clinical development work in the same way as AZT.
They mimic thymine, one of the building blocks of genetic material; when HIV
incorporates a drug molecule into its growing genetic chain, it jams the
mechanism by which the virus replicates. In common with AZT, the new drugs
cannot eliminate HIV but they do slow the collapse of the immune system
which causes Aids. And, like AZT, some have shown side-effects, though the
companies hope these will not matter in practice once they have established
the right dosage.
At present d4T is ahead of the others in its development programme, with 3TC
not far behind. Although the clinical data are too limited to make a fair
comparison, it seems from yesterday's evidence that 3TC may have fewer
side-effects, but d4T may be a more potent anti-viral drug.
FLT is 10 times more potent than AZT, according to laboratory tests but it
has shown anaemia as an unexpected side-effect, forcing American Cyanamid to
repeat the first phase of clinical trials with lower doses. And U-87,201E
has caused some liver poisoning as a side-effect.

interest on debt

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFIM, the Italian state holding group which is being put into voluntary
liquidation, will retroactively pay interest on debts frozen after last
week's decision to wind up the concern.
The news, given in a clarification by the treasury, countered the impression
created at the weekend that no interest payments would accrue for the next
two years. That understanding caused widespread concern in the international
banking community, unused to the idea of a unilateral rescheduling attempt
by a leading industrialised country.
While the announcement removes one of the many uncertainties facing
creditors of Efim, which has total debts of L8,500bn (Pounds 3.87bn),
bankers remain highly critical of the way information about the closure's
consequences for creditors has been handled by the Italian authorities.
Under the terms of the liquidation, repayments of interest and principal on
Efim's debts are being suspended for a maximum of two years while the group
is wound up and assets sold. The Treasury is to issue up to L4,000bn in
government securities from next January to cover the principal of Efim's
bank borrowings, provided creditor banks agree to renounce all guarantees
and interest payments on existing loans.
The rate of interest paid to creditors will be equivalent to that on the
government securities being issued. However, bankers have still to be told
what that rate will be. The decision to set a uniform interest rate also
raises an issue of fairness among Efim's creditors as banks have lent to
Efim at varying interest rates.
The prospect of interest being paid was confirmed by Mr Anrea Monorchio, the
head of Italy's state auditing office. He told a senate committee in Rome he
believed the payments would continue to be made to prevent Italy losing
credibility as a borrower.
The country has recently faced a loss of confidence among bankers and
investors, especially abroad.

FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex embarks on a Dollars
1.85bn gamble - The Mexican group's acquisition of Spain's top cement
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex), North America's largest cement company, has
taken a considerable gamble in bidding Dollars 1.85bn for Spain's two
largest cement companies, Valenciana and Sanson.
The acquisitions, announced within a fortnight of each other, are easily the
largest undertaken in Mexico, and they give a company with little experience
of managing overseas operations 28 per cent of the Spanish cement market,
more than double that of its nearest competitor.
The purchases will not just stretch Cemex's managerial abilities, they will
increase long-term debt by Dollars 760m - and that is assuming re-financing
and fire sales of assets and shares go according to plan. Cemex's immediate
borrowings will rise by Dollars 1.35bn.
In short, the turning points are awesome. For almost a hundred years the
company's fortunes have been rooted in Mexico. Cemex first produced cement
in 1906, and in 1931 merged with its rival, Cementos Portland Monterrey, to
become Mexico's principal cement maker.
With the Spanish acquisitions, sales last year would have been Dollars
2.8bn, turning Cemex into Mexico's second largest industrial company
following Vitro, the glass maker.
About 40 per cent of Cemex's shares are controlled by the Zambrano family.
Forbes magazine recently estimated that Mr Lorenzo Zambrano and his uncle
and president of the board, Mr Marcelo Zambrano were worth Dollars 2bn.
Mr Lorenzo and Mr Marcelo Zambrano evidently feel that sticking to Mexico
makes them vulnerable to foreign competition. Investors may have other
ideas, however.
US and Mexican investors have acquired Cemex stock in the belief they are
buying into Mexico's fast-growing construction market.
Spain's construction market, unlike Mexico's, is slowing, and its cement
industry is suffering.
In future some 40 per cent of Cemex's earnings will come from Spain. In the
two days following the announcement of the Valenciana deal, Cemex's B
shares, which are open to foreign investment, fell 17 per cent. This week
the shares have been especially volatile as investors have reacted to the
second Spanish acquisition and a 15 per cent increase in net profits for the
first six months of 1992.
'Most investors who bought Cemex bought it on a high growth story. To the
extent that Cemex diversifies into countries with less attractive growth
prospects, earnings slow down,' said Mr Jorge Mariscal, manager of Latin
American equity research at Goldman Sachs.
However, with high cash flows and a mature share of the home market, Cemex
clearly needed to do something. It controls 65 per cent of the Mexican
cement market and expects to generate Dollars 1.5bn in spare cash over the
next five years. The choice was stark - expand in high-growth Mexico but
away from cement, or buy more cement companies in slower growing markets
abroad.
Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, chief executive and controlling shareholder, said: 'The
global cement business is becoming increasingly concentrated and we need to
stay with the leaders.' The Spanish acquisitions will raise Cemex's annual
cement capacity from 21.6m tonnes to 32m tonnes.
However, the company is facing increasing pressure at home.
Its main Mexican competitor, Apasco, part of Holderbank, the world's largest
cement producer, is planning a Dollars 260m expansion in Mexico, to raise
output from 5.4m tonnes to 7.15m tonnes by 1994.
To Cemex's obvious concern, Apasco last year opened a plant in Saltillo,
Coahuila, in the heart of what had previously been Cemex territory.
Apasco will open another plant in Colima, on the Pacific coast in 1994,
where it will be able to take on Tolmex, Cemex's subsidiary.
Cemex saw the threat from Holderbank in 1988, and decided then to
concentrate on core cement business, and sell most non-cement operations. In
1989 Cemex bought Empresa Tolteca (Tolmex), then the number two Mexican
cement producer, for Dollars 663m, bringing its market share in Mexico up to
64 per cent. Cemex at the same time bought cement operations in the south
and west US.
'In purchasing Tolteca our main interest was not to put it in the hands of
the Europeans,' said Mr Gustavo Caballero, group finance director. The
decision to buy Valenciana and Sanson is part of the same defensive
strategy.
'The (purchases) strengthen the strategic position of Cemex in the Mexican
market' said Mr Zambrano.
Mr Zambrano is quick to emphasise other benefits of the Spanish
acquisitions. Spain's cement market is large and likely to grow faster than
the rest of Europe's, prices are high, and with 28 per cent of the market,
Cemex will becomes the dominant cement producer.
The company will cut administrative costs by merging Sanson and Valenciana.
Nevertheless most foreign investors would doubtless have preferred Cemex to
have stuck to Mexico, given the present weakness of Spanish demand. In
contrast, Mexican construction is booming, and many analysts expect cement
demand to grow by 6 to 10 per cent a year over the next decade.
The Mexican government has recently released price controls on cement which
has substantially increased profit margins.
In some ways Cemex's bid for Valenciana and Sanson mirrors a strategy
pursued by Vitro, Mexico's monopoly flat glass producer. Vitro moved into
the US market in 1989 with the purchase of Anchor Glass. The deal put more
than half of sales outside Mexico. In common with Cemex, Vitro said it
needed to become a global glass producer to survive.
Yet with sales suffering from the US recession Vitro's share price has badly
lagged the Mexican stock market.
The worry for Cemex must be that Spain's economy may not grow as fast as
Mexico's over the next decade.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pacific Horizon puts new proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO month-old battle for control of Pacific Horizon Investment Trust
yesterday took a new turn when its directors despatched a circular to
shareholders offering new proposals for its future and notifying them of two
rival extraordinary meetings next month.
The circular calls on them to vote against proposals from Jupiter Tyndall
Merlin, the fund management group which manages Pacific Horizon, to
restructure the trust. Instead, the board recommends the appointment of
Baillie Gifford, the Scottish fund management group, as investment manager.
It also wants to widen the trust's investment policy to include Hong Kong,
Singapore, and Malaysia, and to bring its final year forward by 12 months to
1996.
The move comes less than a week after Jupiter Tyndall said it was in
discussions with another investment trust for a possible offer for Pacific.
In June, Jupiter Tyndall blocked an agreed bid for Pacific Horizon by Martin
Currie Pacific and requisitioned an EGM to appoint new directors and
restructure the trust.
Jupiter Tyndall later turned down a request from the board to withdraw its
requisition until after it had published details of a new offer.
The two EGMs, one convened by the board and the other requisitioned by
Jupiter Tyndall are both scheduled for August 18.

In a year which marked a transition from metal trading into printing and
packaging, SW Wood suffered a marginal loss of Pounds 15,000 pre-tax in the
12 months to March 31.
The group, however, expects to return to significant profits this year.
Consequently the single dividend is lifted to 0.25p (0.1p).
The acquisition last August of Proofed Packings will take the group on its
new course via a new subsidiary, Riverside Packaging Printers. In addition
Grange Group, a printer of magazines and journals, was purchased in February
via a placing and open offer.
Acquisitions contributed Pounds 2.34m to turnover of Pounds 5.03m, which
also included Pounds 2.69m from discontinued operations. Gross profit rose
to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 685,000). But operating expenses took Pounds 1.25m
(Pounds 1.04m).

Southend Property Holdings yesterday announced profits before tax ahead by

The result was struck on turnover down from Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 81.1m,
although rental income grew from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 19.1m.
Comparative figures have been restated to reflect a provision of Pounds
743,000 against the amount due from the employee share ownership plan trust,
which directors believe should have been made in 1991.
Substantial cash resources had been accumulated over the year, the company
said: Some Pounds 14.2m was raised from the share issue in connection with
the failed offer for Frogmore Estates - the Frogmore shares acquired were
subsequently sold at an overall profit.
In addition property sales raised Pounds 12.7m and the sale of Hamlet
International raised Pounds 10.3m.
A recommended final of 2.73p makes an improved total of 4.18p (3.8p).
Earnings declined from 5.42p to 2.6p.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVE GROUP yesterday became one of the few contractors and property
developers to announce a dividend increase during one of the worst results
seasons the industry has experienced.
The final dividend goes up from 6.5p to 7p, despite a fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.11m to Pounds 3.26m for the 12 months to end-March, a
decline which reflected lower interest received of Pounds 375,000 (Pounds
1.05m).
Turnover dropped from Pounds 46.6m to Pounds 39.1m.
The total distribution, covered 2.3 times by earnings per share of 22.5p
(29p), increased from 9.2p to 9.7p.
The USM-quoted group's cash position, however, improved by the end of the
year to stand at Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.91m).
Mr Gerald Hough, managing director, described the results as a considerable
achievement in such a difficult market. He expected dividends to continue to
rise provided profits increased in line with general inflation.
The group's strength is its specialist contracting division which is one of
only three companies carrying out work for the National Grid Company,
erecting transmission lines and pylons. The division also erects
transmission towers for radio and telecommunications and television
companies.
This field of work has held up much better and commands much higher margins
than general contracting which only broke even last year.
Construction profits fell by only Pounds 51,000 to Pounds 3.15m, helped by a
strong performance from the specialist engineering division. This was
despite a 16 per cent fall in the division's turnover, from Pounds 43.3m to
Pounds 36.2m.
Property development incurred a loss of Pounds 104,000 following an Pounds
87,000 deficit the previous year. Profits from Trakway, which provides
portable aluminium roadways for construction sites, exhibitions and pop
concerts, dipped from Pounds 786,000 to Pounds 656,000.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Union Discount suffers Pounds 14.8m half-year loss: London's
short-term money markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Discount, one of the leading companies in London's short-term money
markets, claimed yesterday to have put the worst of its troubles behind it
as it reported losses of Pounds 14.8m for the first six months of this year.
The results reflect Union's struggle in recent months to shake off the
effects of a disastrous diversification into leasing during the 1980s, as
well as an attempt to bring its core discount house operation back into
profit.
Union has been one of the biggest casualties of the move by specialist
financial houses to develop into other markets as a result of financial
deregulation in London.
The move was tacitly encouraged by the Bank of England, which halved
discount houses' capital adequacy requirements in the mid-1980s to allow
them to devote more of their resources to new areas. Union said it would not
pay an interim dividend, and could not yet promise a final one.
'We will only pay a dividend if it is prudent. I can't make any commitment
at this stage,' said Mr George Blunden, chief executive.
Pre-tax losses of Pounds 14.8m in the six months to June 30 accounted for a
shrinkage in the company's capital base to Pounds 41m at the end of the
period, down from Pounds 72.8m a year ago. A year earlier it lost Pounds
8.4m and paid an 11.5p dividend. Losses per share were 82.1p against 33.35p.
The group's discount house operations accounted for Pounds 4.2m of the loss
 -Pounds 2.8m due to a deterioration in existing problem loans. The company
hinted that it was close to selling a property in Edinburgh, which it took
on after a disastrous Pounds 20m loan to a property company went sour.
In an attempt to make the discount operations profitable, Mr Blunden said he
had halved the staff since joining the company from SG Warburg in June,
wiping Pounds 1m off the salary bill.
Leasing, which had caused losses of Pounds 14m in 1991, was responsible for
a further Pounds 5.7m of losses in the first half as Union provided Pounds
6.7m against possible bad debts.
Provisions against the worst parts of the leasing portfolio now amount to 30
per cent, with an average for the whole book of more than 10 per cent.
Union changed its deferred taxation policy, resulting in a tax charge in the
accounts for the period of Pounds 841,000.
The company also announced that Mr George Nissen and Lord Remnant had
resigned from its board, while Mr Harry Taylor, deputy chairman of two
subsidiaries, has been appointed. Mr Blunden said further management changes
were likely.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Altered role forces an attitude change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Blunden is an unabashed fan of London's discount market. 'This is
my third discount house' he says, 'and I know they can make money.'
Long-suffering shareholders in Union Discount will be glad to hear it.
The son of a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Mr Blunden has
arrived as chief executive of Union Discount at a critical moment in the
company's history - and that of London's discount market.
Union faces a tough fight to rebuild its profits in the area it knows best -
London's short-term money markets - after being dragged down by a disastrous
move into equipment leasing in the 1980s. However, many people in the
markets think discount houses such as Union are in danger of going out of
fashion.
These are not easy times for the City's nine discount houses. They have
traditionally played a crucial role in the Bank of England's sterling
operations, acting as the valve through which liquidity passes from
Threadneedle Street to the commercial banks. But the environment in which
they operate has changed.
One of the biggest problems has been the small movements in interest rates
since Britain joined Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism. In the past, discount
houses have tended to make money on interest rate movements. When base rates
move downwards, for example, the discount houses make profits because the
capital value of the bills that they hold increases. In the past year,
however, the Bank has signalled rate cuts infrequently.
Mr Blunden believes that, to make money, Union and other discount houses
will need to change their attitude to the money markets.
Discount houses buy short-dated securities from banks and borrow from the
Bank of England. Traditionally, they have held on to these securities for
too long in the hope that longer-dated interest rates will be cut, and a
profit realised, says Mr Blunden. He wants Union Discount to deal more
aggressively.
'You have to adapt your style and your knowledge of how short-term interest
rates are moving and change the time scale in which you operate,' he says.
That means becoming an active trader across all money market instruments,
for instance by using the options and futures markets to take or lay off
risks on interest rate movements. That could make the discount market only a
small - and increasingly unimportant - part of the activities of Union.
Mr Blunden also plans to develop the group's expertise in longer-dated
financial instruments, to enable it to arbitrage between short and
longer-term interest rates. The company is no longer dealing in trade bills,
which provide short-term finance for corporations, but are highly risky
because of the chance that the corporation will default.
Some fear that the discount house business has no long-term future. The move
to European Monetary Union (Emu) will make London's discount house operation
obsolete, because the Bank of England's operations are unlike those in other
European centres. There are suggestions that the Bank will be forced to
operate like the Bundesbank if Emu takes place, dealing directly with the
commercial banks rather than through intermediaries.
However, Mr Blunden says: 'The experience that we have derived over the
centuries will not disappear overnight. If the Bank of England opens up its
operations to a wider audience, we should find ourselves dealing with an
even larger client base.'
The disasters of the past year have wiped Pounds 30m off Union's capital
base, which is now just over Pounds 40m. However, that does not mean it is
no longer a force in the money markets: the special capital regime for
discount houses run by the Bank of England would allow Union to take
positions in the markets worth up to Pounds 3.2bn. As one competitor said
yesterday: 'That still gives them plenty of scope to make profits - or to
make a complete mess of it.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / Compaq advances 43% after price-beating strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ, the US computer manufacturer which last month unveiled a new range
of cut-price personal computers, yesterday reported a 43 per cent jump in
second quarter net income and such strong demand for its products that it
was suffering from a parts shortage.
The figures - at the top end of Wall Street expectations - provided the
strongest evidence yet that the company's new strategy of competing against
clone manufacturers on price, rather than features, was bearing fruit.
The strategy was put in place last autumn after Mr Rod Canion, president and
chief executive of the company, was ousted in a boardroom coup.
Compaq has slashed prices since then and last month introduced a new line of
desktop and notebook PCs with US prices starting as low as Dollars 899
(Pounds 471).
Second quarter net income totalled Dollars 29m, or 35 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 20m, or 23 cents a share, in the same period of last
year. Sales rose 15 per cent from Dollars 718m to Dollars 827m.
Wall Street's mean earnings per share forecast was 29 cents and the shares
rose on the New York Stock Exchange to close Dollars 3 1/8 higher at Dollars
27 3/4 .
The company said unit shipments were up 51 per cent over the second quarter
of last year and 24 per cent ahead of the first quarter. Strong demand had
caused a considerable product backlog because of a shortage of parts. It
expected to have cleared this by the end of the current quarter.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive, said the company was running three
shifts in its Houston and Singapore factories and two in its Scottish plant
and was 'moving aggressively to secure additional materials'.
Analysts, however, said Compaq's failure to forecast demand correctly had
angered dealers and prompted some customers to switch to rivals.
Price-cutting policy hit its gross margin, in spite of cost-cutting.
The margin dipped from 34.5 per cent in the second quarter of last year to
33.5 in the first quarter of this year and dropped to 30.2 in the latest
period.
For the six months the company reported net income of Dollars 74m, or 88
cents a share, compared with Dollars 135m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, in 1991
on sales which dipped from Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars 1.6bn.

insomniacs or investors. The chairman of Cable and Wireless might well have
thought the former were more likely to watch his dawn performance of
Britain's first televised annual meeting yesterday.
Cable &amp; Wireless - The AGM was broadcast at 'the unearthly hour of 5.30am',
according to Lord Young. 'Rather more shareholders, who are normally awake
at a more civilised hour will, I trust, set their video recorders,' he said.
The taped performance was aimed at the company's vast number of small
shareholders, who are often unable to attend either the AGM or the regional
meetings around the country.
Some 56 per cent of C and W's 150,000 UK-based investors own 500 shares or
less and are scattered from John O'Groats to Land's End.
Yet such worthy motives have their economic attractions as well. The bill
for a 30-minute broadcast comes to about Pounds 40,000, considerably less
than the cost of a 10-day jaunt around the country involving top executives.
A C and W spokesman admitted that cost was one of the main reasons for
televising the AGM, and ending the regional meetings.
The idea is catching on, with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Power set to
debut in the next two weeks.
The big question remains whether shareholders will be dedicated enough to
get up at the crack of dawn. Research will be carried out by C and W and the
channel which carried the programme, BMH, to determine the company's
ratings. If C and W has a blockbuster, viewers can look forward to AGM II.

FT  23 JUL 92 / British Gas to separate top jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT EVANS, chairman and chief executive of British Gas, announced
yesterday he was separating the two roles and ceding the post of chief
executive to Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing director, ending months of
speculation that such a move was imminent.
Mr Charles Donovan, co-senior managing director and a competitor for the
chief executive's role, announced his resignation after recognising the
'direct impact' Mr Brown's appointment would have on his duties.
Mr Brown, 57, who joined British Gas in 1966, said he was 'delighted at the
opportunity' to take on the job at a crucial time for the company. He will
be responsible for the day-to-day running of the business, and will also
examine changes needed to ensure the company meets its financial targets.
Mr Evans will retain overall control of strategy, but the pair would work
together closely, Mr Brown said.
Analysts said major changes were unlikely, but suggested Mr Brown might take
a more publicly combative role with the industry regulator Ofgas,
The first test for the new chief executive will be reaching an agreement
with Ofgas on tariffs and terms for the company's transportation and storage
business, due to be hived off into an arm's-length subsidiary by October.
Mr Brown said he was anxious that agreement should be reached as soon as
possible, although Ofgas is thought unlikely to accept British Gas's
submission that it should receive a rate of return of 10.8 per cent on new
investment and 6.7 per cent on existing pipeline assets.
He said he did not rule out a possible referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission if no agreement could be reached.
The new chief executive must also manage attempts by British Gas to expand
its global gas and exploration and production businesses. The company is to
lose 50 per cent of its industrial supply business by 1995, and may soon
face competition in the household supply market.
The news had little effect on the British Gas share price, although analysts
said the City might be disappointed the company had not brought in an
outsider with more experience overseas and in a competitive industry.

FT  23 JUL 92 / British Coal reports record profit of Pounds 170m: Big rise
in productivity helps boost earnings
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRITISH COAL has made a record overall profit of Pounds 170m
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
its biggest since nationalisation in 1947, the company reported yesterday.
The result, for the year ending March 1992, was due to dramatic improvements
in productivity and cost cuts, which boosted the operating profit by 51 per
cent. The company also paid nearly 35 per cent less in interest on debt.
Fifteen pits closed during the year with the loss of about 16,000 jobs,
leaving a workforce of 53,000, of which about 41,000 are miners.
The result was sharply higher than last year's figure of Pounds 78m, British
Coal's first profit in 13 years which followed the restructuring of the
company by the government and the beginning of a more efficient regime.
It was overshadowed, however, by fears that British Coal, which is due to be
privatised in the next few years, will never again be able to sell as much
coal at such a high price.
Mr Ken Moses, the company's joint deputy chairman, warned that British
Coal's sales to the electricity industry could shrink to only 20m tonnes in
the year to March 1994 compared with 65m tonnes today. This would happen if
British Coal was unable to secure new contracts with the electricity
industry.
Its contracts, which give British Coal a favourable price, expire in March
1993. Without them, competing fuels could take a bigger share of the
electricity market.
British Coal said this was hard to accept when in many cases gas had been
chosen by the electricity industry although it was more expensive to burn
than coal.
The outlook for the year to 1993 was for a smaller profit, Mr Neil Clarke,
British Coal's chairman said. Although the company will still earn the
revenue from its electricity industry contracts, it expects to have to close
pits during the second half. That is because the new contracts are expected
to require only about 40m tonnes of coal in the first year, and less
thereafter.
The new contracts would be for smaller volumes and at a lower price, since
the now-privatised electricity industry is forcing British Coal to compete
with other fuel suppliers.
Because the new contracts would determine the size and shape of British
Coal, and its value for privatisation, Mr Clarke said, the company had to
keep cutting costs and improving productivity. In the year to March 1992,
productivity rose by 13.1 per cent, and has risen another 14.6 per cent
since then.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Hurd tries to defuse EC-UN row over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, flew to New York last night in an
attempt to defuse a row between the United Nations and the EC over their
peacemaking roles in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Britain holds the presidency of the
EC.
Mr Hurd's trip followed the publication yesterday of a report by Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, to the Security Council, advising it to
reject the EC ceasefire plan for Bosnia. The plan was agreed by the
country's three warring parties in London last Friday under the chairmanship
of Lord Carrington.
Mr Hurd will attempt in talks with Mr Boutros Ghali to restore EC-UN
co-operation and save the EC's peace conference on Yugoslavia.
Mr Boutros Ghali said in his report that the necessary conditions did not
exist for him to recommend acceptance of the request that the UN should
supervise the heavy weapons of the combatants.
He had already criticised the EC and the Security Council in a letter to
members of the Council on Tuesday, which complained that they took no
account of the practical difficulties faced by the UN on the ground when
they gave their political orders.
Mr Boutros Ghali's report cited questions of principle as well as practical
reasons for opposing the weapons supervision operation by the UN in Bosnia.
The London ceasefire agreement raised the whole question of the relationship
between the UN and regional organisations, such as the EC, in the
maintenance of peace and security.
The relevant chapter of the UN Charter says the Security Council could, in
certain circumstances, make use of regional organisations or agencies.
'There is no provision for the reverse to occur,' the report said, clearly
referring to the EC peace conference's demand for the UN to monitor heavy
weapons in Bosnia.
In reply to the UN secretary-general's criticisms, Lord Carrington has
repeatedly stressed that the EC peace conference merely made a 'request' to
the UN. Moreover, that request came from the warring parties and could not
therefore be described as his own or the EC's 'plan'.
Mr Boutros Ghali said the additional functions which the UN protection force
had been asked to perform were 'beyond the present operational and
logistical capability of the UN.' Diplomats at the UN have been plyaing down
reports of a rift with the EC and do not see a constitutional crisis at the
UN. There have been some suggestions that Mr Boutros Ghali may see the
affair as an opportunity to press for more funds from UN members.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Water companies 'sold too cheaply'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE water privatisation, which raised Pounds 3.6bn in December 1989,
short-changed the taxpayer mainly because it was carried out too quickly,
the Commons Public Accounts Committee said yesterday.
'There is no question that the companies were sold far too cheaply,' said Mr
Robert Sheldon, chairman of the PAC, the select committee which scrutinises
use of taxpayers' money.
'The speed of the privatisation conveyor belt means they ended up being
flogged like over-ripe oranges on a Saturday night.'
The PAC report does not quantify the cost it judges the taxpayer suffered,
but points out that the market value of the 10 water companies of England
and Wales has steadily been higher than the flotation value of Pounds 5.2bn.
Their combined value is now Pounds 9.3bn, a rise of 79 per cent.
The solution it recommends is to sell tranches of a large company in phases,
and small companies individually, not in a pack.
The report, incorporating evidence and recommendations from a National Audit
Office report in February, also criticises the level of fees paid to
merchant banks and consultants by the Department of the Environment, which
was in charge of the sale.
Evidence given to the committee revealed that the final bill of Pounds 8.4m
 -paid to Deloitte Haskin &amp; Sells, the accountants, and Binney and Partners,
engineering consultants - had soared from an original estimate of Pounds 3m.
The report adds: 'We are concerned that additional payments were made where
there was not a clear obligation to do so.'
In evidence to the committee, the environment department said its payments
of a Pounds 2m completion fee to Schroders, the merchant bank, and a
completion bonus of Pounds 200,000 to Dewe Rogerson, the public relations
company, were justified by the success of the flotation.
In future, the responsibility for selling companies and for regulating them
should be split between different government departments, the PAC report
concludes.
The Treasury will publish a formal response to the report on behalf of all
government departments in several months.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nice to see another old Martins Bank man being parachuted into a difficult
situation. Yorkshire-born Harry Taylor, who has been put on the board of
troubled Union Discount, won his wings at Liverpool's Martins Bank, as did
Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive. But whereas Pearse struggled on
after Barclays took over Martins, Taylor joined the Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Company and nearly made it to the top of America's fourth biggest
bank.
He is not in the same class as J P Morgan chairman Dennis Weatherstone, but
for many years Taylor was regarded as the most successful British banker in
the US. While younger readers may never have heard of Martins Bank, it was a
super little regional outfit. Barclays lost a great name when it decided to
merge it into its own business.

There's no doubt many a 'right gude-willie waught' being taken for auld lang
syne at farewell parties in Scotland at the moment. Moreover, the departing
guest is probably one of the minority of folk even north of the Border who
knows what Burns's phrase means.
He is Seiichiro Otsuka, Japan's consul-general in Edinburgh since the
consulate opened there last year, who's away next week to a senior post in
Bangkok. Known to all around as Ichi, he has been a diplomatic triumph in
Scotland, not least because of his consummate knowledge of its national
poet.
Indeed, until his transfer came, he was aiming to cap his acclaimed
performances at Burns Night suppers by winning September's contest in
Dumfries for the best recitation of Tam o' Shanter. So translating
'gude-willie waught' as goodwill drink should be child's play for him,
whereas half of the FT's resident Scots available yesterday failed the test.
Never mind, though. He says he'll be looking for a Burns club in Thailand
and if he can't find one, he'll found it.

No one knows if British Coal really will have to slim itself down from its
current 50 mines to perhaps a dozen big pits. And even if it does, few are
prepared to stick their necks out and name the long-term survivors.
It's not so long ago that Britain dug its coal in colourful mines such as
the Lady Windsor and Marine Six Bells, in South Wales, and Ledston Luck and
Kinsley Drift, in Yorkshire. However, these names have been committed to the
history books, and the list of pits scheduled to survive come hell or high
water has the sound of a pretty boring bunch.
Observer's man at the coalface predicts that they will include Notts pits
like Thoresby, Ollerton and Welbeck, Selby's Stillingfleet, Wistow and
Riccall, and a few others such as Daw Mill in the Midlands and Tower in
South Wales. Sadly, it doesn't sound like a place will be reserved for
Yorkshire's Prince of Wales in the slimline British Coal Corporation.

Guess whose face beams out from civil service recruiting brochures as one
who rose to the mandarin heights despite lacking a degree? The answer is Sir
Peter Kemp, whom Citizen's Charter minister William Waldegrave has ousted as
his top official after publicly praising him only on Monday as an
out-standing success.
Kemp's successor, Richard Mottram, is at least a graduate although not from
the customary Oxbridge finishing school. His degree is from that erstwhile
hotbed of redbrick radicalism, Keele University.
His main claim to fame is that he was the star prosecution witness in the
trial of former civil servant Clive Ponting over the leakage of documents on
the torpedoing of the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano during the
Falklands war.
As private secretary to the then defence minister Michael Heseltine, Mottram
was grilled for four hours in camera over the so-called 'Crown Jewels', a
top-secret document dealing with the events leading up to the sinking.
Dealing with Waldegrave should be a breeze in comparison.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Observer: Warburg's insider
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again the House of Warburg has made a novel choice to head its US
investment banking business. It has hired Thomas Wyman, 62-year-old ex-boss
of the CBS media giant, to be chairman of Warburg &amp; Co Inc.
Warburg, like most of its American and European rivals, has in the past
given its top US job either to insiders from the securities industry or big
financial figures like Anthony Solomon, former chief of the New York Fed.
So why Wyman? The explanation lies in Warburg's ambitions in America, where
it remains (like other European houses) a small player alongside the large
Wall Street investment banks. Nick Verey, an old Rowe and Pitman hand now
recalled to do great things back home, is credited with building up both the
number and quality of its staff, which has risen from around 200 five years
ago to around 350. First Michigan's Perrin Long, an old Wall Street watcher,
says the impression is that they're doing a 'pretty good job'.
Critics, however, suggest Warburg still isn't aggressive enough by Wall
Street standards and needs more clout inside US boardrooms. This is where
Wyman comes in. He knows Warburg well, having sat on the parent board for
four years besides holding directorships at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
General Motors and ICI.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Leading Article: From chronic to critical
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN state is on the brink, both financially and morally. But amid
the stale and corrupt atmosphere of Italy's politics, Professor Giuliano
Amato represents a breath of fresh air. The new prime minister knows his
country is fast heading for a financial crisis and wants to prevent it. Yet
his budget plans are too small to make more than a small dent in the bloated
budget deficit; and his admirable vigour has blown away the veil of
complacency that masked the eyes of the world's financial markets, making
his task even more difficult. Success requires emphatic parliamentary
support for a more ambitious budget package. Failure remains the more likely
outcome.
Italy has been living on borrowed time for almost a decade. Membership of
Europe's exchange rate mechanism signifies Italy's determination to remain
at Europe's centre. But its politicians have never been able to modernise
and slim down the Italian state along European lines. Instead, the ERM and
the abolition of capital controls have removed the inflation tax as a source
of revenue to fund the Italian state. Rather than cut spending or find new
sources of tax revenue, its politicians have been borrowing at an
accelerating and unsustainable rate.
Italy's bluff would inevitably have been called sooner or later. It is the
only European country in which the stock of government debt both exceeds the
annual output of the entire economy and is still rising. Already, in the
first four months of 1992, the budget deficit was overshooting its target
range by more than 50 per cent.
Yet, ironically, the markets have turned against the lira just when a
government appears finally to have realised the seriousness of Italy's
plight. The differential between Italian and German short-term interest
rates has grown by 5 percentage points since the end of April and by more
than 3 percentage points in the past three weeks. And the lira remains close
to the bottom of its permitted range within the ERM.
The markets' nervousness reflects, in part, the government's weakness. Mr
Amato's team of technocrats, backed by only a slim parliamentary majority,
looks feeble set against the massed parliamentary representatives of Italy's
complacent vested interests. Yet the government has also made mistakes. Its
privatisation plans remain vague, while the clumsy handling of the partial
debt default by Efim, the state holding company, can only undermine investor
confidence.
Most important, the government's proposed budget package is too small even
to stabilise Italy's debt stock this year, let alone start to reduce it. A
stable debt ratio is a minimum requirement if the markets are to be
pacified. But the L30,000bn in extra taxes and spending cuts is only half
the figure that would be required to do the job. Even if parliament agrees
to Mr Amato's package, the deficit will remain in double figures while the
primary budget, excluding interest payments, will remain in rough balance.
Stabilising the debt ratio would require a primary budget surplus of at
least 2-3 per cent.
The government, as a result, finds itself locked in a vicious circle of
rising interest rates, slower growth and rising deficits and debt. Every 1
percentage point rise in interest rates adds another L15,000bn to the
government's interest bill, pushing the required primary surplus ever
higher.
Italy must regain the confidence of the financial markets. It cannot afford
to wait until next year's budget to introduce reforms which will set the
debt stock on a downward path. To give in to market pressure and devalue the
lira, without first putting in place a serious fiscal package, would only
further undermine confidence and accelerate inflation. But it cannot go back
to the good old days of capital controls, low interest rates and high
inflation without waving goodbye to the ERM.
An additional budget package of pensions reform and extra direct taxation is
required on a scale which would together cut the budget deficit by a further
3 percentage points this year. This package should be presented to
parliament as a vote of confidence in the Italian state, a vote for
modernisation and against accelerating inflation. Mr Amato represents
Italy's last best hope of avoiding a financial calamity.

have forced Japan's auto makers to build in flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<TEXT>
Nissan Motor's kitchen-clean car assembly plant on Japan's southern Kyushu
Island could easily pass for an exhibition of state-of-the-art robotics and
computer-controlled manufacturing.
Giant mechanical arms hoist seven stamped, steel panels into position and,
amid a shower of sparks caused by 64 simultaneous welds, the main body of a
car is created. Sixteen robots then go to work on the body, performing 600
spot welds in rapid succession in two stages.
Today, production on the line is just getting going, but eventually the
robots will handle up to four different model styles, in eight different
variations, all of it controlled by computer.
Production at the body assembly stage is 100 per cent automated. But more
important than the automation itself is that Nissan has managed to build in
flexibility, albeit at considerable cost.
As Japanese car makers face a labour shortage that is forcing them to
replace human versatility with far less adaptable machines, flexibility in
manufacturing - or rather lack of it - has become a critical issue. Machines
are not easily programmed to install different components for different cars
coming down the line, and they still lack the dexterity of men.
Market trends have also heightened this need. While the Japanese
manufacturers increased sales sharply in the late 1980s, all but Toyota did
this by selling more models in smaller production runs. Being able to
assemble multiple models on a single line increases the utilisation rate of
expensive equipment. Today, with consumer tastes shifting rapidly, some
production lines are running flat out, unable to meet demand, while others
making less popular models go underutilised.
'Our focus in production engineering is to enhance flexibility,' says
Ryuichi Tsukamoto, executive vice president at Honda Engineering, a
subsidiary of Honda Motor. 'Enhancing flexibility is the best way to get
efficient production.'
Tsukamoto's strategy involves two broad approaches: one stresses the
localisation of parts supply for an industry that has in a decade become
global, and a second involves increasing the use of standardised parts and
rethinking the design process for cars to allow standardised robots to
install functionally different components.
Tsukamoto describes the idealised 'lean' Japanese manufacturing process as
direct production, which is essentially similar to the production system
pioneered by Toyota Motor in the 1950s. Tsukamoto tries to match production
capacity for parts and components suppliers precisely with the needs of the
assembly line, with suppliers located near the assembly factory and thus
able to respond quickly to demands from the factory floor.
Honda more or less achieved this in the 1970s at its two main assembly
plants in Japan, in Sayama and Suzuka. However, the start of production in
the US in the early 1980s, followed by a period of hectic growth, led Honda
far from the ideal, as the US plants were dependent on a long umbilical cord
to Japanese suppliers. 'Year by year we have been trying to localise parts
supply and create direct production in the US,' he says.
The US operation is still 20 to 30 per cent dependent on Japan for parts
supply. Honda intends to carry the process further, and has recently
established separate overseas operating divisions aimed at decentralising
the international management in order to enhance local flexibility. Honda is
the most advanced in giving a long leash to its overseas operations, but all
the Japanese companies are heading in the same direction.
The redesign of parts and components themselves has recently become
something of a hot topic in Japan, and Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan,
has been most vocal about the need to reduce the complexity of cars, to use
fewer parts, and to use more common parts in different models, thus allowing
for greater economies of scale in manufacture. Companies like Nissan and
Honda competed in recent years by bringing out new models, which were
designed from scratch with little thought about economising on parts supply.
Honda's experience with the 1990 Accord, its bread-and-butter mid-sized car,
however, caused the company to rethink the design process. The car was
loaded with new technology, but was panned by the Japanese press for being
old hat, mainly on styling grounds, and it flopped with consumers. This
begged the question: if consumers were unable to appreciate innovative
engineering throughout the car, was it all necessary? Might not the use of
more standardised parts in different models produce a car of equal appeal
and quality?
Tsukamoto is now leading a campaign within Honda to improve what he calls
'commonality of design'. The idea is not just to put identical parts into
different models, but to set standards for installation, for example,
putting mounting holes in the same place on different models. The aim is to
allow a relatively inflexible robot to install a wide variety of parts.
Flexibility in this case comes not from the production line itself, but from
the design process.
How far the process can be taken, however, remains an open question,
particularly at a time when automobile technology is changing rapidly in
response to tightening environmental and safety standards around the world.
New technology means changing parts designs that will stand in the way of
standardisation.
Shoichiro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor, is sceptical. 'We have been
trying to use common parts for a long time, but have not been able to do it
very well,' he admits. Toyoda says that while the concept of using common
parts is attractive, in practice it is difficult to achieve without
compromising the quality of different models of cars, where the engineering
requirements are subtly different.
To some extent, Toyoda's scepticism reflects the relative efficiency of
Toyota's engineering and manufacturing process, which has for years set the
standard for the industry. There may simply be less room for improvement at
Toyota.
Toyota has a double advantage because the scale of its operations is
considerably bigger than the other companies, already allowing for greater
economies of scale. And Toyota's habit of adopting a cautious, gradualist
approach to new technology, in order to avoid making expensive errors, has
served it well over the years.
For the rest of the industry, however, the financial pressure to reinvent
the engineering process is intense. With the bloom having come off the car
market, there is less to be gained from dazzling consumers with fancy new
models. Car makers have little choice but to try to match Toyota's
efficiency - and to better it if they can.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: Testing time for professional
relationships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPARE A thought on Monday for two of the super-stars of the UK accountancy
profession, Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, and Mr Richard Stone, corporate
finance head at Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Monday is the day that Mr Stone and Mr Jordan appear before the
professional-conduct panel of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales. They will respond to claims that they breached the
institute's ethical guidelines when they agreed to become the administrators
of Polly Peck International, the fruit, leisure, and electronics group in
October 1990 because during the previous three years there had been a
continuing professional relationship between Coopers and Mr Asil Nadir, the
group's chairman and chief executive.
The disciplinary committee's by-laws mean that the hearing will take place
behind closed doors, which has already drawn a good deal of unfavourable
comment in some quarters.
Coopers is confident, on the advice of leading counsel, that they have not
broken the guidelines.
The number of large accountancy firms is dwindling and administrations
continue to proliferate. Almost every firm has a relationship with most big
companies.
For instance, Touche Ross, the accountancy firm of the third Polly Peck
administrator, Mr Christopher Morris, audited Sansui, the Japanese audio and
consumer electronics subsidiary that Polly Peck acquired in the year before
its collapse. To be fair this is a much more remote link than Coopers' role
as advisers to Mr Nadir, which went back over a decade.
So there must be many accountants who are hoping that the hearing will make
it clearer just how the ethical guidelines are to be interpreted.
Beyond that, there is probably not a great deal that can be said at this
stage about the hearing itself. But it is perhaps a suitable moment to cast
an eye over the 21-month history of the Polly Peck administration over which
Mr Jordan and Mr Stone have presided, along with Mr Morris.
At the time of the group's collapse in October 1990, Polly Peck was by far
the UK's largest and most daunting administration. Since then several of its
dramatis personae among the administrators have resurfaced first in the BCCI
liquidation and then in the Maxwell administration, but the scale of the
challenge for Mr Jordan and Mr Stone remains undeniable.
Polly Peck in October 1990 seemed to be a case of a debt-ridden central
operation in London with debt-free subsidiaries across the world that were
either cash rich or which, like Sansui, needed some cash to turn them around
but seemed to have reasonably good medium term prospects.
A few months earlier the group had been worth Pounds 2bn on the market, and
only a week or two before it went into administration its bankers were being
told that if there were to be a liquidation, there should be around Pounds
300m left over for the creditors.
Not surprisingly under these circumstances, and entirely creditably, Mr
Jordan and Mr Stone decided that the best course would be to try and
straighten out the group's affairs with a view to refloating it eventually
on the stock exchange. They sold off a few of the group's fringe assets from
Joseph Le Shark, the small textile company, to the sumptious antiques
collection at 42 Berkeley Square, the Polly Peck group headquarters, and
persuaded the bankers (some of whom seem to have taken a relatively rosy
view of the group's affairs even after it had collapsed) to inject a little
more money - and off they went on a world tour.
Even Henry Kissinger might have blanched at the journeys that lay ahead of
the Polly Peck administrators as they shuttled across the globe struggling
to tie up a multitude of corporate loose ends - from Curacao to Taiwan and
Hong Kong, and from the US to Nicosia and Istanbul.
Just in case any reader should feel a twinge of envy at all this
jet-setting, it is only fair to report that these whistle-stop journeys for
a few hours in foreign capitals cannot have been much fun. On the other hand
they were inevitably very expensive.
By most standards the global shuttling was also not very productive, either
for the businesses concerned or for the creditors. One grumble sometimes
heard from the creditors is that the administrators did not take a very
commercial approach to the hydra's head of decisions confronting them or do
what corporate financiers might have done.
Sansui plunged into heavy losses last year, mainly because of write-offs of
good will, and was sold off to a Hong Kong entrepreneur for a dollar.
Hopes of floating PPI Del Monte on the New York stock exchange were dangled
before the creditors' committee last autumn, only to be withdrawn this
spring when the price of bananas collapsed on the world market, thus
depriving the administration of a deal that might have netted upwards of
Pounds 400m for the creditors.
The other businesses in the group, which reported turnover over Pounds
1.16bn in 1989, have turned out to amount to relatively little in terms of
saleable assets. Vestel, the Turkish consumer electronics operation, has
survived but there has been a dramatic fall in its profits and market share
and it has been shedding subsidiaries to raise cash.
There seems to be no chance of Vestel remitting substantial amounts to the
rest of the group or of selling it off and raising money for the
administration. Buyers seem to have been found for PPI's shipping line and
perhaps also for the Antalya Sheraton Hotel. But there seems to be little
chance of raising much from the fruit businesses.
An endless series of trips by the administrators to the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus has not unlocked either the records of the Polly Peck
companies on the island or any cash balances in accounts there, or even
secured control of the group's hotels there for the administration.
The most recent disappointment came when an attempt by the administration to
take over Jasmine Court Hotel ended with a scrimmage and a fresh case for
the Turkish Cypriot courts.
At the peak of the administration, Coopers had around 30 people working full
time on Polly Peck and there are still between 10 and 15 employed. The
services of a top administrator cost around Pounds 200 an hour, those of a
junior accountant between Pounds 100 and Pounds 150. Not surprisingly, since
October 1990 the costs of the administration (Pounds 13.1m) have dwarfed
Polly Peck's salary bill (Pounds 5.02m). Lawyers' fees have made up a
further Pounds 7.5m. They presumably include the Pounds 50,000 paid to Mr
Mentes Aziz, the Nadir family lawyer, for his advisory services. Mr Aziz
subsequently ended up on the receiving end of a Mareva injunction from the
administrators who are now trying to reclaim Pounds 5.9m from him.
All in all, in 18 months Polly Peck had total income of Pounds 51.5m, a good
chunk of it garnered from fire-sales of antiques, motor vehicles, and a
yacht, and expenditure of Pounds 48.9m. Its far-flung cash rich subsidiaries
ended up taking Pounds 11.44m for repayment of inter-company debt and not
remitting profits to the parent company in London. A mere Pounds 2.5m was
left over for creditors at the end of April this year and there is now talk
of a payment of 3p in the pound or 11p on the most optimistic forecast.
One suspects that whatever is said behind those closed doors at the
institute on Monday could be decorous and restrained compared to what is in
store at the next meeting of Polly Peck's creditors.

FT  23 JUL 92 / NHS costs exceed inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Health Service inflation is running at about 5.7 per cent,
according to the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts'
annual financial survey.
That is 1.2 per cent above the inflation estimates used by the government in
the Autumn Statement. Health-sector inflation regularly runs ahead of price
increases in the overall economy, and has been a frequent source of
financial pressures on the NHS in the past.
The association says, however, that the 5.7 per cent inflation estimate
would still leave 'real growth in finances of around 3.8 per cent this year'
if financial allocations to GP fund-holders were included in the
calculation. If the budgets of GP fund-holders - who shop around for
hospital care on behalf of their patients - were excluded, district health
authorities faced a 'zero or slightly negative real change in their spending
power this year'.
The survey confirms that there was a sharp increase in hospital activity
between 1990-91 and 1991-92.
Day cases - patients treated without being admitted to hospital beds - rose
by nearly a third. In-patients increased by 3.5 per cent and total
out-patient attendances by 3.2 per cent.
A drive by the government to ensure that no one waited more than two years
for an operation had led to a 97 per cent reduction in people waiting more
than two years.

NALGO, the largest union for local-authority white-collar workers, yesterday
'agreed reluctantly' to a pay offer that will increase local authorities'
pay bill by 4.1 per cent.
Delegates at a conference in London voted 3-1 to accept the offer, which is
weighted to favour the lowest-paid, who would gain rises of 4.4 per cent.
Those at the top end of the scale would receive 4 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government said last night that it was freezing the sale of County Hall,
former headquarters of the Greater London Council, until the end of this
month.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, told the London Residuary Body,
which controls the site, to suspend action on sale until July 31 to allow
the London School of Economics a fair chance to submit a bid for the
premises.
The department said it had received assurances from the director of the LSE
that the school could submit a bid by that date.
Mr Howard said, however, that if no bid was forthcoming by the deadline, the
LRB would be free to act as it sees fit in pursuit of its statutory
responsibilities.

FT  23 JUL 92 / SFO in court challenge on Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday began a High Court challenge against a
judge's decision to throw out 46 charges of theft totalling Pounds 119.5m
against Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck International, John
Mason writes.
At an earlier hearing, the trial judge, Mr Justice Tucker, dismissed the
charges relating to the transfer of money from PPI to Unipac, a subsidiary
company, saying Mr Nadir had authority for those transactions. Mr Robert
Owen QC for the SFO, later said the judge had made an error of law that
amounted to 'a fraudster's charter'.
Contrary to the judge's ruling, Mr Nadir did not have authority for the
transfers from PPI to Unipac, since the money was destined for himself or
his private interests, Mr Owen said yesterday.
The SFO was alleging that Mr Nadir stole Pounds 150m from the parent company
between August 1987 and August 1990, he said. Mr Nadir used the Unipac
subsidiary as a conduit because it gave the appearance of legitimacy.
The 16 theft charges now against Mr Nadir relate only to money transferred
out from the Unipac subsidiary. If the SFO succeeds in restoring the
charges, the cash transfers from PPI, rather than Unipac, will form the
basis of its case against Mr Nadir.
The hearing is expected to end today.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Exports fall widens trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S exports, one of the few bright spots in the economy since the
recession began, fell sharply last month, contributing to a further widening
of Britain's trade deficit.
A 3.5 per cent fall in the value of exports to Pounds 8.8bn last month from
Pounds 9.2bn in May more than offset weaker import figures. That caused the
visible trade deficit to increase from Pounds 830m in May to Pounds 922m.
The value of imports in June, at Pounds 9.8bn, was 2.5 per cent lower than
in May when it was Pounds 10bn.
The fall in exports and imports was bad news for the government, reflecting
both muted consumer demand at home and weakening overseas markets.
A further worry was that, although exports have held up relatively well
since the beginning of last year, three-monthly trends show that imports
continue to outstrip exports at a time when consumer demand is weak.
Measured in volume terms, and minus oil and so-called erratic items such as
aircraft, ships, oil rigs and precious stones, imports grew by 3 per cent in
the second quarter compared with the first quarter and by 8 per cent
compared with the corresponding quarter last year.
That compares with exports which, measured in the same terms, grew by 2 per
cent in the latest quarter and by 2.5 per cent compared with the same
quarter a year ago.
The visible trade deficit excluding oil and erratic items, which is often
taken as the best guide to the underlying trend, widened to Pounds 3.8bn in
the second quarter compared with Pounds 3.5bn in the first quarter.
The current-account deficit, which includes a projected Pounds 200m surplus
from 'invisible' trade, such as services and transfer payments, was
estimated by the Central Statistical Office to have increased last month to
Pounds 722m from Pounds 630m in May.
Exports to the European Community - which account for more than half of UK
exports - fell from Pounds 5.3bn in May to Pounds 4.9bn in June, but
remained 1.5 per cent up in the second quarter compared with the previous
three-month period.
Exports to the the US grew by 6.5 per cent.
Imports from the EC rose by 3 per cent in the latest three months, while
imports from the US fell by 8.5 per cent.
A breakdown of exports shows that food, drink and tobacco exports performed
best in the latest three months.
Volumes grew by 9.5 per cent compared with the three months to March.
Exports of cars fell by 2 per cent in the second quarter and were 18 per
cent lower compared with the second quarter of 1991.
Imports of cars rose by 9 per cent in the latest three months, but the CSO
said that was mainly a build-up to August 1, when new-registration cars come
on to the market.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Civil servant's exit sparks sharp reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS sharp reaction yesterday to the news that Sir Peter Kemp, the top
civil servant spearheading the government's Civil Service reforms, had been
forced into early retirement.
Sir Peter, permanent secretary at the Office of Public Service and Science,
is to retire in September, two years before the normal Civil Service
retirement age of 60. He is leaving after being told that there was no
longer a job for him to do.
The Association of First Division Civil Servants (FDA) said yesterday that
many members would be 'astounded' at the news. His work in establishing 75
executive agencies in which more than half the Civil Service now worked had
been 'an unprecedented achievement'.
Mr Giles Radice, the senior Labour member of the Commons Treasury and Civil
Service committee, said Sir Peter's departure was the result of 'outrageous
manoeuvring'.
'This is clearly a case of Peter Kemp's face not fitting,' he said. 'To boot
out this highly capable and energetic civil servant in this manner is very
shabby treatment.'
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister who is responsible for
the Civil Service, is understood to want a new head for his department,
which was created after the general election.
The department is in charge of the Citizen's Charter, along with the
programme of contracting out Civil Service work and the creation of
executive agencies to deliver government services.
Mr Radice said that the announcement of Sir Peter's departure had been
delayed until the parliamentary recess to avoid questioning by MPs. He
intended to question Mr Waldegrave about the matter when the minister
appeared before the select committee in the autumn.
Sir Peter's successor as head of the OPSS is to be Mr Richard Mottram, the
deputy secretary at the Ministry of Defence. Mr Mottram, who is 47, has been
in charge of the 'options for change' programme to cut the UK armed forces.
He was private secretary to both Sir John Nott and Mr Michael Heseltine when
they were at the Defence Ministry.
Also announced yesterday was the appointment of Sir Geoffrey Holland as
permanent secretary at the Education Department when Sir John Caines retires
in January 1993. Sir Geoffrey, at present permanent secretary at the
Employment Department, was director of the Manpower Services Commission
between 1981 and 1988.
The new head of the Employment Department will be Mr Nick Monck, second
permanent secretary at the Treasury. Mr Andrew Turnbull, principal private
secretary to Mrs Thatcher and Mr Major, will succeed Mr Monck.

MR JOHN SMITH, the new Labour leader, yesterday won a bloodless victory at
the first meeting of the party's national executive committee that he had
ever attended. Members decided unanimously to press ahead with plans to cut
the unions' block vote from 90 per cent to 70 per cent of votes cast at
party conferences.
It was agreed before the general election in April that the change would
take effect next year even though there was a widespread belief that some
union leaders wanted the process delayed so that it could be considered as
part of the reform of the party's links with the unions that is due to be
brought forward at next year's conference.
But while some NEC members said after the meeting that they wished the issue
had been scheduled to be wrapped into the full review, a truce had clearly
been reached in the meeting itself. It means that the unions' vote will have
been reduced before the party conference debates their future role in party
affairs.
Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe, the public employees'
union, said he would have liked the issue to be part of the fuller review.
But he added: 'The unions are unanimous in welcoming a change in the balance
of power. This is only the first step.'
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'The mood throughout the
party is in favour of this move . . . It does not pre-empt or preclude wider
and further reforms to modernise the relationship between the party and the
unions.'
The NEC also agreed that a strategic document on the party's political
direction under its new leader would be presented to the conference. Before
then, it will be considered at a special NEC meeting in September.
Mr Larry Whitty, Labour general secretary, said that the party had agreed
increases in the full subscription and in the union affiliation fee from the
beginning of next year as emergency measures to deal with Labour's Pounds 2m
overdraft. The full subscription will rise from Pounds 15 to Pounds 18 a
year and the affiliation fee from Pounds 1.60 to Pounds 1.70.
At Westminster, the party is in negotiations about a review of the 'short
money' funds it receives from the government for carrying out parliamentary
opposition duties.
The NEC also agreed the arrangements for the conference to discuss the
general election and the party's membership and finances.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Dangerous liaisons soured by gossip: The delicate working
relationship between journalists and MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IT IS, in the end, mere office gossip
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but gossip in the most fiercely factional, closely monitored and widely
reported office in the land.
Office gossip in parliament is a well paid profession, pursued by several
hundred journalists, including 80 regular Commons attenders and a
pantechnicon or two of television crews. Often forgotten is that it is also
the stock-in-trade of the 650 MPs themselves.
Unattributably - 'strictly no fingerprints, please, old boy' - MPs and
ministers use it to badmouth rivals, promote themselves or to 'float' policy
proposals. If the idea sinks, it can be disowned. Corridor chat, a quick
word in the members' lobby, a fulsome Covent Garden dinner and the political
world may shift on its axis.
Most of the time, it works as a viscous oil to the machinery of government
and opposition. But, just occasionally, it acts as a spanner in the works.
For all these reasons, this week's outbreak of open warfare - some might say
posturing - between the Conservative government and what is still known as
Fleet Street is itself a news story: all the more so because the latest
developments have shown a falling-out between a Conservative government and
the most loyal of Tory tabloids, The Sun.
Unwritten rules of confidentiality are being flagrantly broken, the
so-called 'lobby system' has broken down, with the curtain that cloaks it
flapping open to the world.
The reason - some journalists say - is the strong odour of humbug prevailing
in Whitehall. Men, and women, who make their careers with election
addresses, replete with happy family snaps and sober words about 'family
values' must live up to them, the argument goes.
They must also take care not to say one thing about privacy in public, and
another in, well, private.
Politicians might counter that circulation wars and the profit motive - not
a mission to explain - lie behind the press's holier-than-thou indignation
over alleged sins that are not unknown in newspaper offices.
What makes this different is that the row is taking place against a growing
groundswell of opinion among MPs, reportedly shared by the prime minister
himself, that things have gone far enough and that statutory measures are
now the only way to restrain an over-enthusiastic press.
Yet what of over-enthusiastic cabinet ministers? Conservative Central Office
claims that none of these right honourable gentlemen would dream of leaving
information incriminating an opponent in the safe-keeping of a newspaper
editor, let alone one with a circulation not so far off 4m.
But then, in the words of a certain Ms Mandy Rice-Davies, it would say that,
wouldn't it? If Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, is not mistaken,
then someone has exceeded the normal proprieties by a considerable degree.
Dangerous liaisons between individual politicians and journalists are the
timeless tradition of Westminster. Back in the 1960s, Harold (now Lord)
Wilson would talk of a 'white commonwealth' - trusty journalists who could
be used as a conduit to the outside world.
Less than a year ago, Lord Wakeham thought it appropriate to let his friends
in the lobby know that the general election was postponed - coincidentally,
just before Mr Neil Kinnock's crucial speech to Labour's annual conference.
The Westminster gossip machine sometimes serves to alert ministers to their
imminent demise. Mr John Biffen MP, when leader of the Commons, heard that
he had become 'semi-detached' from the government - not soon after he was
fully so.
Some newspapers have tried to rise an inch or two above the system. The
Independent and The Guardian both, for a while, boycotted the daily
off-the-record briefings held by Downing Street. But at no time did either
paper order its correspondents to shun the members' lobby itself  - the
hallway where reporters mingle with MPs.
Under the (marginally) more liberal reporting rules of the Major era -
Downing Street can now be cited as a source - no newspaper now forbids its
staff to attend.
This week's bitter recrimination is fuelled by a mutual sense of guilt and
betrayal. The Conservative government and its Tory tabloid admirers are
behaving like rowing lovers who want an open marriage but only when it suits
them.
The government is threatening legislation. Fleet Street has given notice
that it will kiss and tell. As one cabinet minister put it: 'These are
dangerous days.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / Consumer demand remains weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK consumer demand has been underlined by government figures published
yesterday showing that retail sales volumes fell 0.2 per cent last month
compared with May.
The seasonally adjusted figures show that people are still refraining from
large increases in shop spending, a factor holding back recovery.
On an underlying basis, retail sales have shown a small increase since
earlier this year after a flat period between the third quarter of 1991 and
the first quarter of this year.
With shop sales accounting for about a quarter of the economy, though, Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, needs a much bigger increase if anything
other than a fragile upturn is to develop in coming months.
Retail sales volumes in the second quarter were 0.6 per cent up on the first
quarter. They showed a 1.3 per cent rise on the corres-ponding period last
year.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, food retailing showed a 0.7 per cent rise in
the April - June period, while non-food businesses increased sales volumes
by 0.2 per cent. Shops selling clothing and footwear showed a 2 per cent
increase in the second quarter compared with the first, and retailers in
household goods saw a 1 per cent fall.
The small decrease in sales volumes for the retail sector last month
compared with May contrasted with market expectations of a 1 per cent
increase. It came after a revised 0.4 per cent rise in sales volumes between
April and May.
The British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the sector, said June had
been 'difficult' for most retailers. One bright spot had been good sales of
fruit and vegetables, and food and drink generally. Sales of furniture and
carpets had been depressed because of the flat housing market.

FT  23 JUL 92 / TUC invites CBI chief to congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress has for the first time invited the top official at
the Confederation of British Industry to address its annual congress.
Mr Howard Davies, the new director-general of the CBI, has accepted the
invitation to the Congress at Blackpool in September.
The TUC has been marginalised in recent years but hopes, through the
invitation, to underline its embrace of 'social partnership' and readiness
to build bridges with employers and the government on issues such as
training, health and safety. The invitation also reflects the belief of many
union leaders that they have more in common with Mr Davies than with his
predecessor, Sir John Banham.
Some union leaders have spoken at CBI annual conferences, but the CBI said
yesterday there were no plans to invite Mr Norman Willis, general secretary
of the TUC.
It also emerged that Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, will not address this
year's TUC congress. Mr Smith told TUC officials that he wanted to make his
first big speech to the Labour party.
TUC officials said this was not a 'snub' and that past Labour leaders had
often declined the open invitation to address the congress. However, union
leaders worried that Mr Smith may be tempted to move too far in cutting
union links with the party will not be re-assured by his decision.
The main argument at this year's congress is likely to centre on a motion
from the NUJ journalists' union opposing the return of the former EETPU
electricians' union to the TUC through its merger with the AEU engineering
union.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Construction industry recession is worsening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE deepest recession to afflict the construction industry for more than
half a century is getting worse, according to government figures published
yesterday.
These indicated that construction orders during the three months to the end
of May fell by 16 per cent compared with the previous three months and by 9
per cent compared with the March - May period last year.
A separate survey of 140 English and Welsh estate agents, also published
yesterday, confirmed the lack of recovery in either house prices or sales.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which conducted the study,
appealed to the government to double the threshold at which stamp duty
becomes payable on house purchases from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000.
A government concession to withdraw stamp duty for purchases of up to Pounds
250,000 ends next month. The ending of the concession has been strongly
criticised by housebuilders and estate agents.
The institution said that raising the threshold to Pounds 60,000 would
assist first-time buyers.
Slightly more than 41 per cent of agents questioned by the institution said
that house prices had continued to fall during the three months to the end
of June. A further 57 per cent said prices had remained static. Less than 1
per cent reported a price increase.
Mr Peter Miller, an official at the institution, said there was no
improvement in the market, even if the worst of the price falls appeared to
be over.
Figures from the Department of the Environment showed that the value of
construction orders for private homes, in constant 1985 prices, fell by 11
per cent during the three months to the end of May compared with the
previous three months, and was 13 per cent lower than during the
corresponding period last year.
Private industrial orders for the three months to May were 24 per cent lower
than in the previous three months, and 21 per cent lower than during the
March - May period last year.
Private commercial orders, mainly for offices and shops, were 9 per cent
lower than both the previous three months and the corresponding period a
year before.
Public-works orders - which cover roads, hospitals and other infrastructure
 -were 14 per cent and 5 per cent lower respectively.
Only public-housing and housing association orders for the three months to
May showed any improvement. They were 34 per cent lower than in the previous
three months but 89 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last
year.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Welfare cost fears dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that thousands of European Community citizens living outside Britain
will add millions to the bill for UK welfare benefits are groundless, the
government said yesterday.
The scare arose after a ruling in the European Court of Justice that the UK
government was wrong to deny family credit, which is designed to supplement
low incomes, to the wife of a civil servant who worked in Northern Ireland
but lived in the Irish Republic. The court held that the UK's arguments
would impede freedom of movement for workers.
The ruling means that people who travel to work in Britain leaving
dependants behind in their home states will be able to claim family credit
on behalf of their families.
'We are not expecting a flood of successful claims costing the Treasury
millions,' the Department of Social Security said. 'You have to be on a low
income to qualify for it, and most EC workers either bring their families
with them or are single with no dependants.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / Coal's sell-off faces pitfalls: Profits disguise questions
over contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE British Coal board member said ruefully at lunch: 'Any other company
would have been sticking its chest out.'
The company yesterday announced a Pounds 170m profit for the year to March,
its best yet and a promising prelude to its forthcoming privatisation.
But questions, not congratulations, hung in the air at British Coal's
headquarters.
That Pounds 170m is testimony to the fact that British Coal is now more
efficient than ever before. But it was almost all earned from British Coal's
contract with the electricity industry, put in place by the government and
expiring in March.
Moreover, until new contracts are settled in the coming months British
Coal's future revenue and profit are uncertain.
The message from British Coal yesterday was that this is the last year of
big profits. Next year, according to Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman, the
company will not match this year's big increase. The reason is that the
contract with the generators will still be in place.
He said yesterday that there might, however, be a 'cliff edge' in the second
half of the year if the new contracts with the generators meant that the
company had to start closing collieries quickly and writing them off against
profits.
The company's future would then hinge on the new contracts. British Coal has
made an offer to the generators, understood to be based on a price of Pounds
1.50 a unit of energy from coal. It is understood to include a volume of 40m
tonnes at the start of the contract, falling perhaps to around 25m over a
five-year period.
That compares with Pounds 1.85 a unit today and a volume of 65m tonnes.
Revenues and profits, as Mr Clarke admitted, will inevitably fall.
British Coal can try to squeeze out more costs and boost productivity. This
year's profits show big productivity gains, admittedly from a low base.
Output per manshift rose 13 per cent over the past year, and so far this
year it has risen a further 14.6 per cent. Mr Clarke said there would be
additional improvements.
Costs - of which the wage bill is the most substantial - fell only a couple
of per cent, and there seems little sign that they can be tightened further.
The background is that the UK market for coal is shrinking and British
Coal's task is being complicated by competing fuels, notably gas.
'The total market for black fuels (coal, heavy fuel oil, and similar
products) will be 60m tonnes,' Mr Ken Moses, British Coal's joint deputy
chairman said. 'The issue, then, is how will the generators react to that?
It is con-ceivable that they could not take a coal contract at all.'
In the worst scenario, he said, British Coal might end up supplying only 20m
tonnes to the UK electricity market, compared with 65m today.
That makes it hard to see why anyone should be interested in buying British
Coal when it is privatised some time after the contracts have been signed.
Some potential buyers admit they find it hard to value the company.
'I always find British Coal's results very academic,' said the head of one
international company's coal division. Its prices and tonnages were
artificial, he added.
The company had a level of profitability 'you wouldn't expect in the
industry', he said. The reason for this was that coal had 'an exceptionally
high price that was forced on the customer'.
Even so, Mr David McErlain, chairman of Anglo-United, the fuel group,
believes the profit has a positive message for potential buyers.
'It's an exceptional performance in the year when they needed it, that is
just before privatisation,' he says. 'They deserve enormous credit for that,
and they deserve credit for pushing through the colliery closures that
helped them achieve it.'
While acknowledging that nobody can say what volumes British Coal can sell
at what price after March 1993, Mr McErlain believes the profits show that
costs can be squeezed out of the business.
'A purchaser will look at the strength of the contract with the generators,
and then he'll take his own view on what costs can come out. After that,
it's a financial exercise.'
Until more details emerge of how the mines will be packaged, most potential
bidders are keeping quiet.
Peabody, the US coal company which is part of the Hanson group, is thought
to be a prime candidate.
Hanson was reticent about British Coal's results. 'It is not for us to
comment,' Hanson said. 'But we've said that, if the government decided to
sell it through a trade sale, we'd have a look at it.' RTZ, the
international mining group, said it had no comment.
British Coal's Mr Clarke, himself a former chairman of an international
mining group, says the company would provide a buyer with a strategic
foothold in the UK market, the only relatively open market in Europe and one
that may open up further.
British Coal's future profit is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that
whoever buys the company is unlikely to get it to outperform yesterday's
record result.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Shephard firm on EC laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community legislation on social and employment matters is to be
reviewed to ensure that it conforms to the principles of 'subsidiarity', Mrs
Gillian Shepherd, employment secretary, said yesterday. 'Subsidiarity' means
legislating at whichever level, national or EC-wide, is appropriate to the
law in question.
'I shall be conducting a thorough review of EC legislation in this area,'
Mrs Shephard, who chairs the EC's council of labour ministers, told Unice,
the EC employers' body.
'Too often there have been proposals for Community legislation on matters
which are more appropriately determined by individual member states,' she
explained.
Meanwhile the Trades Union Congress has also, in effect, admitted that the
high water mark of EC social legislation has passed for the present.
The TUC, in a paper urging that the Maastricht Treaty be ratified, said:
'The resolve of the 11 member states (minus the UK) to develop a strong
social policy has temporarily weakened in the face of economic
difficulties.'
The TUC general council decided that a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty
would not be appropriate.
In a separate paper on European collective bargaining, Mr David Lea, TUC
assistant general secretary, said that 'to contemplate European pay
bargaining would be to forfeit credibility'.
But that should not rule out an attempt to negotiate 'European models for
overtime rates', he added.

FT  23 JUL 92 / OFT acts against timeshare group: Watchdog has received a
'stream' of complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday revoked the consumer credit licences of
six companies associated with Club Riviera, one of the UK's leading
timeshare groups.
This is the first time the OFT has taken such action against a timeshare
company.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said: 'We have received and
continue to receive a stream of complaints against some of these companies
which suggest that their conduct has been seriously misleading and
deceptive.'
He added that the complaints included 'allegations that the companies have
induced customers to purchase timeshare accommodation by making false or
misleading statements'.
Club Riviera and the other five companies were told three weeks ago they
might lose their licences and were invited to make their case. Sir Bryan
said no representations had been made.
Three of the companies, Club Riviera (UK), Club Tenerife Sales and Regency
Palms Sales, are subsidiaries of the Manchester-based Riviera group. The
companies specialise in selling timeshare properties in Spain and the Canary
Islands.
The Riviera group has management contracts with the three other companies
involved in the OFT decision - Ryefix, Canary Islands Holiday Club and
Marbella Beach Club - which are registered in the Isle of Man.
The effect of the OFT move is to bar the companies from either offering
credit themselves (to finance sales) or acting as a broker for other
companies to do so.
Last September, Club Riviera was convicted by Staffordshire magistrates on
charges of making false advertising statements.
Mr Simon Clarke, director of Club Riviera, said yesterday that his company
had no intention of appealing against the OFT's verdict.
'The action of the OFT today is solely aimed at preventing finance to
purchasers,' he said. 'We don't provide finance, we haven't for a long time
and we have no intention of providing finance in the future. For those
reasons we have decided not to make representations.'
He added that 'in no way whatsoever' would it affect his business; he
expected to gain about 6,000 more timeshare customers this year.
Mr Clarke rejected the idea that the OFT ruling cast a stigma over both his
business and the timeshare industry generally.
He said: 'We don't see it like that. Being in the timeshare industry alone
is as bad as you can get as far as company credibility can go. In terms of
public awareness, you don't have good timeshares and bad timeshares, you
just have timeshares.'
Later this year the Timeshare Act is due to come into force in the UK. It
will provide a mandatory 14-day 'cooling-off' period before the final
completion of timeshare purchases.
The European Commission is also considering a directive on regulation of
timeshare.
The group has the right to appeal to the trade and industry secretary within
28 days, or the OFT's judgment will stand.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Barclays seeks to halt US action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank is trying to stop the administrators of Maxwell Communication
Corporation suing it in the US for Dollars 30m paid to it by MCC three weeks
after the death of Robert Maxwell last November.
Touche Ross, the administrators, claim that the payment was an unlawful
preference and should be returned to MCC.
They contend that the decision on where to sue for it is a matter for them.
Barclays argued in the High Court yesterday that any claim to the money -
part repayment of an overdraft facility granted to MCC - should be made in
the English court.
The bank sought an injunction restraining the administrators from suing for
the return of the money outside the UK and from making any claim for it in
proceedings under the US bankruptcy code.
Last December, MCC filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
US bankruptcy law.
Mr Nicholas Merriman, QC for Barclays, said the overdraft facility, under
which the bank was still owed Pounds 32.3m, was an English commercial
transaction making working capital available to an English company and its
UK subsidiaries, and was governed by English law.
The English court was the natural forum in which to try the dispute, he
said. The administrators were using the extra-territorial jurisdiction of
the US 'in order to circumvent what would otherwise be an unsuccessful claim
under English law'.
Mr John Higham QC, for the administrators, said Barclays was saying that the
US court ought not even to consider whether it should deal with the case,
but that the English court should dictate the answer.
The hearing continues today.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Papers to challenge ban on reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS are to challenge a magistrate's reporting ban on
proceedings being taken against a man who faces jail for refusing to answer
questions from the Serious Fraud Office.
In the High Court yesterday the newspapers, including the Financial Times,
were given leave to seek judicial review of the ruling by a magistrate at
Clerkenwell court in London last week.
The man, who has been charged with criminal offences and cannot be
identified, had been served with a notice under section 2 of the 1987
Criminal Justice Act requiring him to give information to the SFO. When he
refused, the SFO took action against him under a provision in the act that
makes a failure to comply, without reasonable excuse, an offence punishable
by a maximum jail sentence of six months, a fine or both.
The case came before the Clerkenwell court on July 15, when the ban was
imposed. Two days later the newspapers applied unsuccessfully to have it
lifted. Yesterday the newspapers said they wanted to challenge the
magistrate's ruling that they did not have the legal standing to apply to
him to have the ban, made under the Contempt of Court Act, set aside.
They also contended that the ban was too wide because it appeared to prevent
reporting of background matters relating to the criminal charges the man
faces, and that reports of the proceedings in the magistrates court would
not prejudice the pending criminal trial.
The newspapers' application was opposed by counsel for the SFO and for the
man concerned who argued that there was clearly a 'gross and obvious' risk
of prejudice to the criminal trial if the ban were lifted.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Insurers' association to face calls for shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE leaders of the Association of British Insurers will face calls from some
of its members for a shake-up of the trade organisation at its first
extraordinary meeting today.
The move is primarily the result of widespread dissatisfaction with the
performance of the association, which represents life and general insurance
companies, in the face of fierce public criticism of the life assurance
industry.
The Building Societies Association is seen as a more effective lobby group.
'The building societies have a much better image than they deserve,' a
leading insurance industry executive said. 'The insurance industry deserves
a much better image than it gets. We need to combat the impression of the
public that the industry is incompetent and that the public is paying for
its mistakes by charging more.'
The most important demands are for a change of management at the top of the
association. The new board would function more as a board of management -
meeting more frequently and playing a more hands-on role.
The association has a budget of more than Pounds 19m and over 180 staff,
many devoted full-time to public relations.
Critics say the association has failed to respond adequately to criticism
from regulators and consumer groups about the products it sells and the way
it sells them. They argue that the association has fallen short in its
efforts to present a positive image of insurance to the public.
'When the question of members' contributions came up, people began to ask
what they were getting for their money,' said a life company chairman.
Pressure for the meeting has been engineered largely by nine leading life
insurers which last year formed a pressure group to respond to the
increasing complaints against business practices. The nine - Commercial
Union, Eagle Star, General Accident, Guardian Royal Exchange, Legal and
General, Norwich Union, Prudential, Royal Life and Sun Alliance - founded
the 'Watford Group'. Between them they control about 30 per cent of the life
assurance market.
Life assurance members feel the association has responded badly to a study
by the Securities and Investments Board showing that a quarter to a third of
all insurance and personal pensions policies were cancelled within the first
two years. The association's response had been to question the validity of
the data, even though many in the industry privately acknowledged that they
were correct.
'In particular, it was the way that the ABI responded to the Securities and
Investments Board's proposals on disclosure,' said a senior official at one
life company. The association, he said, had failed to appreciate the
public-relations storm that would ensue from opposing what in the public's
mind is an issue that cannot be opposed - disclosure of fees and charges.
The association executive says it is unaware of any general dissatisfaction.
However, an official conceded: 'In certain circumstances the decision-making
process is cumbersome.' He acknowledged members' desire to rein in costs.
Members blame the association's failure to promote their cause on an archaic
'committee' system under which an individual's seniority rather than the
employer's market share determines chairmanships and eventual appointment to
the association's board. Today's meeting will hear a proposal to drop the
seniority requirement for committee chairmen.
The qualification for committee chairmanship is nine to 10 years of
committee membership. Heads of big insurance companies are unable to devote
so many years to the association. As a result, those with the largest market
share have the least say in how the association is run.
At today's meeting, members will be asked to approve a new board of 10 to 16
members, instead of the present 14. However, it is expected that the board
will be at the low end of the range. While the chairman and deputy chairman
will continue to hold their seats, new members, including Mr Mick Newmarch,
Prudential chief executive, will be elected.
There is also dissatisfaction on the general insurance front. An executive
with one of the leading composite insurers, which underwrite general as well
as life insurance, said: 'We are determined to do something about it. There
is real dissatisfaction among the major companies. They have been footing
the bill and they don't think they have been getting the service that they
should.'

TWO US companies plan to convert uranium from dismantled Russian warheads
into fuel for nuclear power plants.
The companies are Allied-Signal, a high technology group, and Nuclear Fuel
Services, a privately owned supplier of reactor fuel to the US navy.
Under a preliminary deal with the Russian atomic energy ministry (Minatom)
and the Russian Academy of Sciences, Minatom would provide highly enriched
uranium from retired Russian weapons, and other sources, for conversion into
the low-enriched fuel used in commercial reactors.
British, French, Japanese and other US groups are understood to have held
similar discussions with the Russians.
The joint venture expects to sell the fuel to the world's nuclear energy
industry in conjunction with the US government. The US Department of Energy
supplies 60-70 per cent of the west's commercial nuclear fuel.
The venture plans to build a conversion plant in Russia, but to ensure an
early start, it would ship highly enriched fuel to the US from next year and
convert it at a plant in Tennessee owned by Nuclear Fuel Services.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Canada's summer not all fun: Some crucial political
decisions must be taken soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUGUST, when Canadians usually try to confine their thoughts to baseball,
boating and barbecues, is shaping up this year as a crucial period in
national politics.
Several issues in the endless wrangle over Quebec's future place in Canada
will be brought into sharper focus over the next few weeks. Mr Robert
Bourassa, the Francophone province's premier, must decide soon whether to
proceed with a national-unity referendum scheduled for late October and, if
so, what question he will pose.
Mr Bourassa, however, cannot make this decision without greater clarity
about the willingness of the nine English-speaking provinces to compromise
on a package of constitutional proposals which they presented to Quebec
earlier this month. Some key parts of the package have already stirred up a
hornet's nest there.
The political activity is most intense in Ottawa, where Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney and Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark are working
feverishly to bridge the gap between English Canada's offer and Quebec's
demands.
As it stands, the offer would bring far-reaching changes to the way Canada
is governed. The Senate, the upper chamber of parliament, would be changed
from an appointed body to an elected one, with an equal number of
representatives from each province (plus a handful from the Northwest
Territories and Yukon) and with limited powers of veto.
The federal government would be considerably weakened by the transfer of
various powers to provincial jurisdiction, notably those on job training,
culture and immigration. Aboriginal people would gain a right to
self-government, the extent of which would probably be left to the courts to
define.
Quebec, which has boycotted the national-unity talks since the collapse of
the Meech Lake accord two years ago, is unhappy about several aspects of
what is now being dubbed the Pearson accord (after the building in Ottawa
where it was crafted).
The province contends that some parts, notably the constitutional
recognition of the Francophone province as a 'distinct society' and the
powers over immigration, are weaker than the equivalent sections of the
Meech Lake agreement.
Quebec sees itself not simply as one of 10 provinces, but as the home of one
of Canada's two founding peoples. It thus has severe misgivings about a
Senate where probably no more than eight out of 84 members would have French
as their mother tongue. Although this would be offset by greater
representation for Quebec in an enlarged House of Commons, Quebecois fear
that the upper house of parliament would effectively cease to be bilingual.
Mr Mulroney and Mr Clark are trying to find sufficient common ground between
Mr Bourassa and his English-speaking counterparts to justify a meeting of
all provincial premiers. Among the compromise proposals being toyed with is
one which would guarantee some Senate seats for French-speaking minorities
outside Quebec.
Ideally, the meeting - which could take place as early as next week - would
be an occasion for everyone to put their signatures to a new constitution.
Mr Bourassa could then return in triumph to Quebec City and call a
referendum, confident that he had gained enough to spike the guns of the
Quebec separatists.
But such a happy outcome is by no means a certainty. Among the other
scenarios that could unfold are an unravelling of the package agreed by the
nine provinces, an effort by the federal government to impose its own set of
compromise proposals, and a delay in the Quebec referendum.
Even if an agreement is reached soon, one wild card is the possibility of
opposition to the new deal outside Quebec. The Meech Lake accord was signed
by all the premiers in 1987, only to fall apart as ratification by
provincial legislatures became bogged down in growing public doubts.
This time round the provinces will not only need to ratify a deal, but some
have also committed themselves to public hearings and referendums.
Serious reservations are already being expressed about the offer to Quebec,
with critics labelling it as an unworkable agreement born of desperation
rather than a recipe for effective government.
Trade unions fear that the transfer of job training to the provinces could
imperil the national unemployment insurance scheme. Even Mr Michael Wilson,
industry and trade minister, who is one of the most senior members of the
Mulroney cabinet, publicly voiced his displeasure over what he considers the
wishy-washy mechanism to bring down pervasive inter-provincial trade
barriers.
The question is whether Canadians are now so fed up with the interminable
constitutional merry-go-round that they will accept virtually any agreement
signed by the prime minister and all 10 premiers. Or can they still be
persuaded that no agreement is better than a bad one?
There is little doubt, however, that the longer the debate goes on, the
greater the threat to Canada's long-term political stability. If an
agreement cannot be reached and ratified soon, attitudes in all parts of the
country are likely to harden as recriminations begin.
Canada's latest identity crisis would not only be prolonged, but deepened.

PRESIDENT Cesar Gaviria of Colombia last night admitted that Mr Pablo
Escobar, chief of the Medelln cocaine cartel, had not been found since
troops stormed the jail where he was being held.
The president said it was unlikely, but not impossible, that Mr Escobar had
escaped the military forces. The search for him was continuing in and around
the prison.
After resisting attempts to transfer him to a military jail on Tuesday, Mr
Escobar and 13 other prisoners used weapons taken from guards to seize
hostages - including Mr Eduardo Mendoza, deputy justice minister, and
Colonel Hernando Navas, director-general of prisons. Troops were later sent
in and the hostages escaped during the ensuing fight.
At least six people were killed and several injured.
Mr Gaviria called a national security council session late on Tuesday and
postponed his trip to the Ibero-American summit in Madrid.
A local radio station reported that Mr Escobar had said on tape he was
prepared to resist to the last the authorities' attempts to transfer him to
another jail. His nephew had said Mr Escobar and others were in a tunnel
under the jail with food to last some time.
The government decided to transfer Mr Escobar after he continued 'to be
involved in committing crimes directly and personally from inside the jail,'
with the complicity of prison guards.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Baker poised to answer Bush's call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Baker has the reputation of being a political magician. If he pulls
President George Bush's re-election campaign out of its present troubles he
will be promoted into the miracle-worker class.
That the secretary of state is to return to the White House soon to take
charge of both the campaign and domestic policy is now 'a done deal,'
whatever Mr Baker's or others' protestations to the contrary. The move has
been expected for weeks; Mr Bush's substantial trailing of Governor Bill
Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has rendered inevitable a repeat of 1988,
when Mr Baker left the Treasury to manage the Bush effort when the then
vice-president was trailing in the polls, though by a narrower margin than
now.
Mr Baker is currently on a trip to the Middle East and Asia. The shift may
not be formally announced until after Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new prime
minister, comes to Washington next month, a visit with domestic political
connotations just before the Republican party convention.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, Mr Baker's deputy, is likely to be appointed acting
secretary of state. Federal law permits the president up to 120 days to
nominate a permanent replacement, allowing him to avoid a potentially
difficult confirmation process in Congress before the November 3
presidential election.
Mr Clinton was quick to argue that transferring Mr Baker demonstrated the
limits of Mr Bush's commitment to an active foreign policy, at a time when
Israel's change of government opened new possibilities in the Middle East.
Mr Baker will come in over the heads of Mr Sam Skinner, the White House
chief of staff, and Mr Robert Teeter, titular campaign chairman and also an
old friend. Neither will object to being superseded.
He may bring with him some of his inner circle of advisers at the State
Department, including Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the spokeswoman, and Mr Robert
Zoellick, the counsellor who effectively takes charge of international
economic policy.
The toughest issue for the campaign lately has been whether to dump
Vice-President Dan Quayle from the Republican ticket. Mr Quayle, whose
selection by Mr Bush in 1988 did not meet Mr Baker's approval, is unpopular
except with party conservatives. One poll this week reported that 60 per
cent of those questioned would not mind if he were replaced.
But Mr Bush yesterday dismissed rumours that Mr Quayle might be dropped.
Asked by reporters if Mr Quayle's status was uncertain, Mr Bush responded:
'No, it's very certain.'
Replacing Mr Quayle would be tricky. If General Colin Powell, chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff and Gulf war hero, ran with Mr Bush it might be
easy to argue that ditching Mr Quayle was not an act of desperation. But Mr
Baker himself is thought to harbour presidential ambitions and might be
reluctant to advance the cause of potential rivals by promoting them to
number two on the ticket. They include Mr Dick Cheney, secretary of defence,
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and Governor Pete Wilson of California.
It is probable, therefore, that Mr Quayle will stay where he is, which could
help win back some of the conservative support that defected to Mr Ross
Perot, who ruled out a bid for the presidency last week.
The overriding task, in any case, is to transform Mr Bush into a candidate
in whom the country can have confidence for four more years. At present Mr
Clinton, full of confidence and ideas, is making all the running.

GENERAL Electric of the US yesterday pleaded guilty and agreed to pay
Dollars 69m (Pounds 36.1m) in fines in a bribery and fraud scandal involving
the sale of military jet engines to Israel, Reuter reports from Cincinnati,
Ohio.
Prosecutors said Dollars 40m was diverted in the largest case of fraud ever
under a US government programme to finance sales of military equipment by
American companies to foreign governments.
The company admitted four counts of conspiracy, money laundering, submitting
false claims and failure to make and keep accurate books and records.
In June the Pentagon's Defence Logistics Agency suspended GE Aircraft
Engines, which is based near Cincinnati, for four days from competing for
contracts.
GE employees were alleged to have bribed an Israeli air force general to
influence his choice of a contractor for military jet engines.
GE, the third-largest defence contractor in the US, said it went to the
authorities as soon as it became aware of alleged wrongdoing by company
employees. The charges arose after Mr Chester Walsh, who was manager of GE's
aircraft engine business in Israel from 1984 to 1988, brought the scheme to
the government's attention.
Mr Walsh filed a civil suit against GE under the Federal False Claims Act,
which the Justice Department joined in August after an investigation by the
FBI.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL has indicated to the US that it will make a 'severe and substantial
reduction in settlement activity' in the occupied territories, Mr James
Baker, the US secretary of state, said yesterday.
Speaking after a meeting with Mr Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president, Mr Baker
gave an upbeat assessment of steps taken by the new Israeli government
towards Arab demands for a settlement freeze pending a resumption of peace
talks. 'I am really very satisfied with the philosophy and the orientation
of this new government of Israel towards the question of settlements and I
am satisfied that you are going to see severe and substantial reduction in
settlement activity,' Mr Baker told reporters.
Mr Baker's remarks were his most positive yet about efforts by the new
Israeli administration to rein in settlement activity, and indicate that
Israel has virtually assured itself of receiving US loan guarantees to help
it absorb a flood of Soviet Jewish immigrants. The Bush administration had
withheld some Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in guarantees because of the
refusal of the previous government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir to halt settlements.
The secretary of state was also clearly using his Cairo press conference to
signal to Arab states and the Palestinians that Washington expected
reciprocal goodwill gestures once peace talks resume, possibly as soon as
next month.
'The results and the momentum are only going to be produced by the parties
themselves sitting down at the table. But I am very optimistic that we have
an opportunity to see that happens,' Mr Baker said.
Israel and its Arab neighbours, including Syria, Lebanon and a
Jordanian-Palestinian team, have conducted five rounds of desultory
negotiations since the latest US-sponsored peace effort was launched in
Madrid last October.
Mr Mubarak, while calling for more concrete steps by Israel to persuade the
Arabs that it was sincere about halting settlement activity, also praised
efforts by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the new Israeli premier. 'Do you expect the man
to do miracles in one week?' he asked. 'We should not be in a hurry. One
week is not enough . . . please give him time.' Mr Rabin visited Cairo
yesterday for the first summit between Israel and Egypt for six years in an
effort to warm relations and advance peace efforts. Egypt is the only Arab
state to have made peace with Israel.
Mr Baker flew to northern Syria late yesterday for a meeting with President
Hafez al-Assad of Syria. Mr Assad is the key to US and Egyptian efforts to
introduce a spirit of compromise to the negotiations. Syria, which fears
that attention will focus on the Palestinian issue at the expense of its own
demands for the early return of the Golan Heights captured in the 1967 war,
has warned its fellow Arabs to treat warily Israeli peace overtures.
The Syrians have summoned Arab foreign ministers to Damascus this weekend to
try to ensure solidarity before the resumption of peace talks.

FT  23 JUL 92 / S African strike looms as talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA faces the renewed prospect of industrial strife, after the
breakdown yesterday of talks between business and labour aimed at averting a
lengthy general strike next month.
'An historic opportunity has been thrown away by employers,' the 1.3m-strong
Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said. It had no option but
to go ahead with plans for a stoppage 'for the week of August 3'.
Cosatu, the largest union grouping in the country, had been holding talks
for the past two weeks with the South African Co-ordinating Committee on
Labour Affairs (Saccola), an umbrella employer body.
The two parties had hoped to negotiate a pact that would avoid a general
strike and help break the country's constitutional deadlock.
They agreed a draft charter for 'peace, democracy and economic
reconstruction', but then apparently both sides had difficulties in
persuading their constituencies to go along with them.
Cosatu said the parties failed to ratify the draft accord because of
differences about a compromise one-day shutdown on August 3, which was
proposed instead of a longer all-out strike.
The one-day shutdown would have been a voluntary exercise, in which both
business and labour would have participated.
Their fruitless efforts coincided with an escalation in the mass action
campaign of the African National Congress (ANC) and its allies.
This week has seen the ANC embark on an extended series of sit-ins in
government offices, police stations and magistrates' courts.
Protests yesterday included shoppers running up bills at tills of leading
stores and then refusing to pay.
Demonstrators also gathered at the Pretoria central prison, demanding an end
to township violence and a swift transition to democracy.
More than 1,000 protesters have been arrested since Monday, although few
have been held for long in police custody.
The United Nations special envoy to South Africa, Mr Cyrus Vance, yesterday
met President F W de Klerk.
Mr Vance's trip, which springs from a UN Security Council resolution last
week, is aimed at creating a climate for negotiations.
The envoy held two hours of talks with Mr de Klerk, who briefed him on the
government's position on constitutional talks with the ANC and other
black-led parties and on the country's wave of violence.
Mr Vance is scheduled to meet the ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom
party today.
The ANC withdrew from talks on a multi-racial constitution last month in
protest at the massacre of at least 43 people at Boipatong township. It
accused Mr de Klerk of condoning the attack and of trying to cling to
minority rule.
Toyota and the National Union of Metalworkers have signed an agreement
ending the two-month strike at the Japanese company's Durban manufacturing
plants, opening the way for the re-employment of 6,000 sacked workers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS studying long-term survivors of HIV, the virus that causes Aids,
have discovered a type of immune cell which enables people to remain healthy
for more than 10 years after infection.
Dr Jay Levy, of the University of California, San Francisco, described the
discovery to the world Aids conference in Amsterdam yesterday. He predicted
that it would soon lead to new ways of treating HIV.
The vital finding is that a white blood cell, called CD8, seems to determine
how long people with HIV stay healthy. Its role is to attack other infected
cells - and either kill them or suppress the virus.
In most people with HIV the CD8 cells lose their activity after a while.
Then the CD4 cells - the immune cells whose loss is normally used to define
the progress of the disease - disappear and the patients start to suffer
Aids symptoms.
Dr Levy's researchers are purifying a protein, known as a cytokine, which
CD8 cells secrete to stop HIV replicating in other immune cells. They expect
to have isolated and identified it within six months.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Tokyo shares pulled down by debt fears

<TEXT>
THE Tokyo stock market fell yesterday to its lowest level since April 1986,
as doubts spread about the health of the economy following release of a
gloomy Bank of Japan quarterly forecast.
The Nikkei stock average slipped 2.9 per cent to close at 15,541.95. Prices
continued to fall early today, with the Nikkei down more than 150 points in
initial trading.
The Bank of Japan said yesterday that it was closely watching the
restructuring of troubled non-bank financial institutions, whose
difficulties have been heightened by the renewed weakness of Tokyo stock
prices.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, said the financial system was
secure in spite of difficulties facing non-bank lending institutions, which
fuelled the stock and property price spiral of the late 1980s, but now have
fast accumulating bad debts.
He said non-banks and other institutions should not necessarily support all
of their troubled borrowers, and suggested that financial institutions
restructuring their operations should maker further changes to ensure their
profitability.
Mr Mieno's comments made clear the central bank has revised its outlook on
the economy, and that a recovery expected in the autumn will come later. He
pointed to decelerating consumer demand as an important reason for delays in
adjustment of inventories. Concerned that the stock market decline could
prompt further falls in the next few days, Mr Sakae Kudo, chairman of the
Japan Securities Dealers' Association, said the market correction must be
close to completion.
But Mr Sakae said stock prices were being weighed down by concerns about the
domestic economy and suggested the Bank of Japan reduce the official
discount rate from the present 3.75 per cent.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is growing in confidence that it
will win a larger than generally predicted share of seats contested in an
election on Sunday for half the upper house of parliament.
Opposition parties admitted their campaigns had been flawed. Polls suggest
the LDP could take about 70 of the 127 seats, instead of the 60 or fewer
seats forecast when the campaign began. If so, the party and two coalition
partners, Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party, will consolidate their
control over the upper house.

The rapid growth in German money supply, which led to last week's increase
in the Bundesbank's discount rate, continued in June, the bank reported
yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes from Bonn.
The broad M3 measure grew at an annualised 8.7 per cent, compared with a
revised 8.8 per cent in May. Bank lending to the private sector increased by
more than 11 per cent in the six months to the end of June, compared with 'a
good 12 per cent' in the six months to the end of May, the bank noted.

The Truehand's debts now look set to exceed government estimates of DM250bn

arising from the extensive ecological damage caused by east German

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Social Democrat (SPD) opposition yesterday called for the
immediate withdrawal of federal troops from the allied force monitoring the
United Nations trade embargo against Serbia and Montenegro.
It also urged the government to press for war crimes charges to be prepared
in the UN against Serbian leaders whom it accused of 'genocide' in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In a sustained attack on the Bonn cabinet's decision last week to send a
destroyer and three aircraft to join other Western European Union and Nato
forces in the Adriatic, Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, leader of the SPD
parliamentary party, said the mission was unnecessary and would be of no
help to the people of the former Yugoslavia.
Surveillance could be carried out equally well by satellites or the secret
service, he told Bundestag members called back from holiday for a special
sitting.
The cabinet's decision to send the forces without full consultation was a
snub to parliament and an attempt to expand Germany's global military role
in defiance of the constitution, he declared.
The SPD group agreed on Tuesday night to appeal for a ruling at the
constitutional court in Karlsruhe. The government firmly defended its
position, citing the use of German forces in non-interventionist supporting
actions going back 30 years.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of the governing group of Christian Democrats
and the Christian Social Union, said he was confident the court would back
the move. To be able to take part in the future European union, Germany had
to be able to play a full role in common security and foreign polices, he
said.
Whatever the ruling, it will help clear the foggy constitutional position,
and prepare the ground for change. The SPD has proposed changes which will
limit German forces to peace-keeping missions under the auspices of the
United Nations.
The government, which has made no specific proposals, wants a full
commitment to both peacekeeping and peacemaking.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, yesterday accused the
international community of trying to bring Serbia to its knees and to 'tear
Yugoslavia apart'.
Mr Milosevic, in a rare public appearance, said the political motives behind
international sanctions were 'to force Serbia . . . to accept humiliating
terms and give up the chance to show solidarity with Serbs in other
republics'.
Speaking to politicians in Leskovac, south-eastern Serbia, a region of
traditional support, he blamed the international community for 'foisting a
war on the former Yugoslav republics in order to break up Yugoslavia'.
He warned that it was 'most important to eliminate the danger of war in
Serbia' and lashed out at Serbia's opposition parties for 'serving the
interests of the rich and mighty' - a reference to the international
community.
While he denied that Serbia was aiding Serb fighters in Bosnia, he said: 'We
are supporting the war, but in the sense of . . . the just battle of the
Serbian people in the former Yugoslavia . . . for an equal position in every
aspect'.
His comments came after Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia,
formalised an agreement with Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, to
fight together against Serbian-backed forces if international efforts to end
the bloodshed fail. The two leaders urged the UN, the US and the EC to
undertake real and effective measures to stop the aggression.
Mr Izetbegovic has pressed for foreign military intervention to aid the
mostly Moslem forces loyal to the Bosnian government. His agreement with Mr
Tudjman appears partly to reflect his loss of faith in international efforts
to end the war, a western diplomat said. 'Izetbegovic is over a barrel.
Although he has serious cause to wonder what Croatia's long-term plans are,
he depends on support from Croatian forces in Bosnia,' he said.
UN officials in Sarajevo yesterday warned that the escalated fighting could
jeopardise the international relief effort. 'The thread is getting very thin
that's holding this together,' said Canadian General Lewis MacKenzie after
an encampment of 350 Canadian peacekeepers came under mortar and gun fire.
Sarajevo radio reported fighting in Dobrinja, a suburb of Sarajevo near the
airport. It said one person was killed and buildings were ablaze in central
Sarajevo and Dobrinja.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Watchdog gives tacit support to press coverage of Mellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Press Complaints Commission, meeting in the wake of reports about the
private life of Mr David Mellor, the national heritage secretary, said
yesterday that the public had a right to be informed about private behaviour
of politicians which might affect the conduct of public business.
However, Lord McGregor of Durris, commission chairman, insisted there had
been no adjudication of the Mellor case at the hastily convened meeting, as
there had been no complaints from the parties involved.
Instead, the commission had discussed the whole issue of privacy and had
decided to conduct a review of the industry's voluntary code of practice
before deciding whether there should be any amendments or additions.
Nevertheless, the meeting, attended by 10 of the 15 members of the
commission, was widely seen as supporting the publication at the weekend of
reports of an alleged affair between Mr Mellor and an actress, Miss Antonia
de Sancha.
The unanimous statement, in effect confirming support for a voluntary code
policed by the industry and opposing any form of statutory legislation,
could bring the commission into conflict with the government if min privacy.
The commission said the holders of public office must always be subject to
public scrutiny, and Lord McGregor said after the meeting: 'In the case of
politicians, it is right for the public to be informed about private
behaviour . . . direct intervention by the government would destroy the
freedom of the press.'
The review of the code will be submitted to Sir David Calcutt, QC, who was
asked by Mr Mellor earlier this month to review the commission's work.
The commission's statement was attacked by Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP,
who intends to introduce a bill to make the commission statutory. 'They are
putting a nail in their own coffin. They won't please Tory MPs and they
won't please people like me, simply because they have not studied the
(Mellor) case and they are suggesting that no one in public life has any
privacy at all,' he said.
Mr Bill Hagerty, editor of The People, which first published the reports on
Mr Mellor's private life, said that although the commission's statement was
'a little woolly', it had decided the story was in the public interest.
The 10 members of the commission at the meeting were Lord McGregor, Mr
William Anderton, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, Ms Patsy Chapman, Sir David
Chipp, Lord Colnbrook, Dame Mary Donaldson, Mr Brian Hitchen, Sir Edward
Pickering and Professor Robert Pinker.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Government to tighten controls on spending: New policy
likely to prompt reductions in departmental programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET yesterday agreed a tough new policy to tighten control of public
spending, in the most sweeping effort for a decade to rein back spending
increases.
Put to cabinet by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, the new approach, which
is likely to lead to large cuts in some departmental programmes during the
next few years, incorporates a new procedure for enforcing Treasury control.
It may produce cuts in the financial year beginning next April in areas such
as transport and housing.
The new policy is intended to demonstrate to financial markets that Britain
is determined to limit increases in the public sector borrowing requirement
by linking spending to the expected low economic growth in the next few
years.
Ministers agreed to increase public spending over the next three financial
years by a rate below the expected level of economic growth.
During the general election campaign, Mr John Major emphasised his party's
determination to keep a firm grip on public spending. After yesterday's
cabinet meeting ministers admitted that the existing system had 'failed to
deliver public spending control'.
From next year, the current system - under which ministers bargain with the
Treasury for extra spending - will be scrapped. In its place, the cabinet
will decide overall spending limits, with negotiations among ministers being
limited to how the total is shared out.
Any increases in one department's spending will mean cuts for another
department. It will almost certainly end the large increases in public
spending of recent years.
Last November, Mr Lamont agreed to increase spending in 1993-94 by Pounds
13bn over previously agreed levels. There was also a large increase in
spending for the current financial year, in a package designed to appeal to
voters ahead of the general election.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, began what will be a sustained
Labour attack on the government's decisions, by accusing the prime minister
of 'the fastest betrayal in history'.
'With the recession costing an extra Pounds 4bn alone, this public spending
announcement means further cuts in public services next year and with Pounds
16bn of cuts in the changes that follow, promises made in April are being
betrayed in July after only 100 days of government,' he said
The government assumes that inflation will be kept low over the next few
years by Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. As a
result of low inflation, increases in public spending at current prices
should also be kept low, while maintaining the quality of public services.
The new procedure will feature a 'control total', to be decided by the
cabinet early in each year's public spending round. The concept will be
introduced into next year's spending round, applying to 1994-95. Next year's
decisions will also be the first to link spending plans with Budget targets
for government revenues.
The definition of the control total - which will exclude social security
payments related to unemployment - has yet to be finalised by the Treasury.
For the 1993-94 financial year, the government will stick within its
existing planning total for public spending of Pounds 244.5bn agreed last
November.
Since unemployment-related social security benefits, which account for up to
one fifth of public spending, are set for a large rise because of the
longer-than-expected recession, the new policy may mean cuts in other areas,
such as housing and road building.
Whether cuts will be needed will depend on how much the increases in social
security payments eat into an unallocated Pounds 8bn reserve which is part
of the Pounds 244.5bn total for 1993-94.
Under the arrangements, once cabinet has agreed a control total, the chief
secretary to the Treasury will discuss the allocation of that money with
departmental ministers. A new committee, chaired by the chancellor, will
decide on the final share-out.
Faced with the prospect of having to hold back on specific election spending
pledges, ministers yesterday emphasised the government's manifesto
commitment to reduce public spending as a proportion of national income.
The three-hour cabinet meeting agreed the control total would grow by no
more than 3 per cent in 1994-95 and 3.25 per cent in 1995-96 in cash terms.
These figures assume inflation will be 2.25 per cent in both years.
Under existing arrangements the planning total for 1994-95 and 1995-96 in
both years is due to increase by about 5 per cent a year. Although
comparisons between the planning total and control totals are difficult,
this indicates that some cuts in programmes may be needed.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Poor trade and sales figures add to UK economic gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR TRADE and retail sales figures yesterday added to growing evidence that
the UK economy is failing to recover from recession.
The figures, revealing a fall in high street sales and a sharp drop in
exports last month, increased nervousness on the London stock market, where
the FT-SE 100 share index ended 27.7 lower at 2,387.9.
They also depressed the pound, which closed in London at DM2.8325, just a
quarter of a pfennig above its lowest close since joining the European
exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. In late trading in New York it was
at DM2.8328.
The Central Statistical Office data, showing a 0.2 per cent drop in retail
sales in June and a 2.5 per cent monthly drop in the value of imports,
indicated that consumer demand is still muted.
The fall in imports was outstripped by a drop in exports, reflecting
weakening overseas markets. The value of exports fell by 3.5 per cent from
Pounds 9.2bn in May to Pounds 8.8bn in June.
This caused the visible trade deficit to deteriorate from Pounds 830m in May
to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 922m in June. The current account deficit,
which includes a projected Pounds 200m surplus from 'invisible' trade, such
as services and transfers, was estimated by the CSO to have increased last
month to Pounds 722m from Pounds 630m in May.
The underlying deficit, which excludes oil and erratic items, such as
aircraft and precious stones, remained stable at Pounds 1.2bn, the same as
in May.

FT  23 JUL 92 / CBS chief in talks on rescue bid for Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LARRY TISCH, the billionaire US chairman of the CBS television network,
has had talks with Mr Paul Reichmann about making a joint rescue bid for
Canary Wharf, the financially troubled east London property development.
Financiers with a close knowledge both of Mr Reichmann, who created the 4.5m
sq ft Docklands development, and Mr Tisch confirmed that discussions have
been taking place.
Canary Wharf is in administration under UK insolvency procedures. Bankers to
the project fear it will be liquidated unless a successful takeover bid can
be made before the end of September.
Mr Tisch's net worth has been estimated by Forbes, the US financial
magazine, at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 730m). Apart from controlling CBS, Mr
Tisch is also chairman of Loews Corporation, the family group that had
Dollars 13.6bn of turnover last year and has interests in insurance,
cigarettes, hotels, watchmaking, shipping and oil and gas drilling.
However, a final decision on whether to participate has not yet been taken
by Mr Tisch. He is thought to be concerned about committing his capital
while it remains uncertain whether the Jubilee line extension into Docklands
will be built.
Like other potential investors in Canary Wharf, he believes that the
prospect for the development will be vastly improved if the line is built.
But he is reluctant to make the Pounds 170m private sector contribution to
the line's costs which has been demanded by the UK government.
However, Mr Reichmann is understood to be hopeful that a deal can be struck.
In a separate development, it also emerged that Britain's second biggest
property company, MEPC, had contemplated and then decided against
participating in a bid for Canary Wharf.
Potential bidders who remain interested in joining a consortium bid include
Richardson Brothers, the Midlands-based property developer. Other possible
participants in any bid, with or without Mr Reichmann, are Hanson, the UK
conglomerate, and British Land, the property company.
The deadline for putting together a takeover package is probably the date of
any decision by the government on whether to build the Jubilee line
extension, since without the extension there is a greater prospect of Canary
Wharf being liquidated, according to bankers.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (7): Increasingly competitive - A
look at UK marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT takes up to 12 years and an investment of Pounds 100m-Pounds 150m to
discover one new drug in the UK, but even this level of investment is no
guarantee of commercial success.
Cost pressures, generic substitution and the continual demand for new and
effective products are making for an increasingly competitive marketplace,
so how are Britain's top pharmaceutical companies shaping up to the
challenge?
According to Mr Ben Hayes, spokesman for the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), the difficulty faced by the prescription
industry in marketing their products to the NHS is to show that they are
cost-effective.
'The challenge of all new products coming onto the market is to be new,
bigger and better, and to cost less in the long run,' said Mr Hayes.
Medicines prescribed by the NHS last year cost more than Pounds 3bn, about
10 per cent of total NHS expenditure. When the Pharmaceutical Price
Regulation Scheme (PPRS) is renegotiated this September, further pressure to
reduce the drugs budget is expected.
Companies foresee a greater movement towards economic evaluation in the
future, but how does 'cost-benefit' relate to the 'clinical benefit' of a
particular drug?
'The clinical benefit comes first,' says Mr Andrew Smith, managing director
UK for SmithKline Beecham. 'The economic argument is a very powerful weapon
if it backs clinical benefit.'
Nearly 80 per cent of existing drugs will come off-patent over the next five
years. How to stem the transfer of profits to generic manufacturers and get
a full return on their research and development investment is a problem for
drug companies.
Generic competition, which lowers the price of branded products by at least
50 per cent, now accounts for 43 per cent of prescriptions and is expected
to rise to 60 per cent by the end of the decade.
Among the short-term solutions tried is the promotion of different
variations of an old product. A good example is SB's Amoxil, the second most
widely prescribed antibiotic in the UK, which came off-patent four years
ago. The company now has a different series of formulations of the drug,
from drops to capsules, to a fizz tab.
'Although novel formulations do slow down the decline in sales of a product,
you're often converting the business into a product which doesn't make much
money,' said Mr Smith. Under the PPRS, a product which is more than five
years old has to be priced per milligram to the price of the original
product. 'You have to charge the same price as you did 20 years ago for
Amoxil,' he said. 'Long-term, it is not a strategy or a way forward.'
Greater investment in R&amp;D, leading UK drug companies claim, is a more
effective solution. As Mr Colin Wight, marketing director at Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, says: 'Our track record points the way ahead. In a market where
generic use is increasing, our company should continue to develop innovative
new medicines as long-term protection.'
The industry now spends four times as much in R&amp;D as it did 10 years ago.
This year, SB will spend Pounds 400m and RPR Pounds 263m on R&amp;D.
Concentration on novel products along with new patent legislation - under
which a company can apply for a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC)
giving it up to five years longer on a patent in the country in which it was
first licensed - will balance out some of the loss in sales to generics.
Another consideration for companies is whether they should start marketing
medicines over-the-counter. Both SB and RPR have their own OTC arms with
established products and more prescription-only medicines (POMs) to OTC
switches to follow.
For example, take RPR's Ketoprofen, the number two non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory in the UK with sales of Pounds 20m. The company expects it
to take the product over-the-counter within five years.
An OTC licence in the UK, Mr Wight says, would 'open up a whole new field of
opportunity.' Switching a POM into the OTC field, companies admit, is not an
easy marketing decision. As well as safety and efficacy considerations,
going OTC demands a radically different marketing approach.
'They are totally different markets with different drivers and there is
absolutely no guarantee that a highly successful product in the
pharmaceutical sector is going to be highly successful in the OTC sector,'
said Mr Smith.
Tagamet, SB's blockbuster anti-ulcer drug, came off-patent in March. The
company expects Tagamet to switch to OTC in the UK within the next year, and
is realistic about its chances of success: 'We're not going to take Pounds
500m worth of Tagamet business and convert it into an equivalent amount of
OTC business.'
Given that only one in 5,000 compounds investigated by companies reaches the
marketplace, and new medicines account for 9 per cent of total sales, the UK
pharmaceutical business is becoming increasingly risky.
Switching products to OTC will lead to more consumer advertising, but
companies maintain that the marketing of pharmaceuticals will never become
as blatant as selling a car. As Mr Smith points out: 'You cannot encourage
people to buy medicines because of the image, because if they don't work,
they don't buy them again.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (5): Companies focus on new drugs
and more research - Japan's drugs industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNTING worries over international expansion by Japan's pharmaceutical
industry - following their counterparts in the vehicle and electronics
industries - have been calmed by slower-than-expected results by the
overseas operations of the drugs groups.
However, the Japanese pharmaceuticals industry is at a turning point, as
companies are shifting focus towards production of new and effective drugs
and boosting research and development.
Compared to their western counterparts, Japanese drugs companies have
operated on a smaller scale, focusing on the domestic market, the
second-largest in the world with annual sales of Y6,000bn. The companies
traditionally relied on small-step innovations of existing drugs, mainly
lower-value antibiotics and vitamins.
However, a decline in profitability of domestic operations, brought about by
recent reforms by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, has forced companies
to shift emphasis on R&amp;D in order to create world-beating innovatory
products.
Until recently, Japanese drug companies have been complacent about R&amp;D
because of the government's drug-pricing policy, where all new drugs were
awarded premium prices whether or not they were dramatic improvements.
Companies, lacking the incentive to develop innovative drugs, chose only to
make small changes to existing drugs rather than spend big sums on product
development. Companies also relied on profit margins from the distribution
of drugs supplied by foreign companies under licence for the Japanese
market.
The push by the government for new and effective drugs has been prompted by
a change in pricing rules. From this fiscal year, the only drugs to be
allowed premium prices will be those which represent a new concept, are more
effective than existing drugs and which make a noticeable contribution to
treatment.
Profits at companies lacking new products have been squeezed by the
government's official price cuts implemented every two years from 1981 and
averaging from 10 to 15 per cent. The cuts are applying pressure on
companies to produce new drugs because the impact on the profit margins of
new drugs is less severe.
In addition, foreign drug companies have started to terminate distribution
tie-ups as they establish their own networks in Japan, reducing commissions
for the former Japanese partners.
As companies increase R&amp;D and capital investment spending, the need to
establish a worldwide presence in order to recoup costs has increased
sharply. Japanese companies also say that market share in Japan has hit a
ceiling. 'Profits have reached upward limits,' says Fujisawa Pharmaceutical,
Japan's third-largest with sales of Y227bn.
R&amp;D expenditure has doubled during the past 10 years while net sales
increased by only 50 per cent during the same period.
The percentage of R&amp;D expenses to net sales rose to 11.1 per cent in the
last fiscal year from 7.2 per cent in fiscal 1982.
Because a typical drug takes 10 years and Y10bn to develop, only those
companies large enough to absorb costs will be able to survive in the long
run.
'Companies without strong R&amp;D pipelines and new innovative products will
drift sideways,' says Mr John Wilson, analyst at James Capel in Tokyo.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, one of the most aggressive in international
expansion, admits that it will take another 10 years before the company
becomes truly global.
Fujisawa is also increasing production and marketing capacity in the US and
Europe ahead of the launch of FK-506, an immune system suppressor used to
prevent transplant patients rejecting new organs.
Japanese drugs makers are currently boosting efforts to build comprehensive
and independent operations in R&amp;D, production and marketing.
However, compared with the large-scale mergers and acquisitions in the US
and Europe, the purchases and joint ventures have been modest in size.
Mr Thomas Hofstaetter, executive managing director at Hoechst Japan, says
there is a lack of candidates for acquisitions by Japanese companies.
'The targets are often expensive and it is not economical,' he explains.
Meanwhile, the sharp decline in asset values in Japan, bought on by the
slump in the stock and property markets, have made small and medium-sized
Japanese drugs companies ideal targets for global pharmaceutical groups
looking to expand in Japan.
The country's market holds substantial potential for further growth as the
population ages rapidly and consumers become increasingly health-conscious.
Corporate financiers point out that the smaller companies, unable to survive
through the industry's consolidation due to the lack of financial and R&amp;D
resources, are receptive to cross-border mergers and acquisitions.
Pfizer, the US drugs and chemicals group, announced plans to buy Koshin
Medical, a privately-owned medical equipment distributor earlier this year.
Last year, Monsanto of the US acquired 12 per cent of Hokuriku
Pharmaceuticals for Y14.5bn.
Mergers and acquisitions among Japanese companies, including rescues of
smaller companies, are also expected to increase. But Mr John Wilson at
James Capel predicts that alliances between industry leaders to create
larger pharmaceuticals groups would be unlikely due to lingering negative
attitudes towards M&amp;A among Japanese companies.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (6): Prices continue to be a big
issue - Marjorie Shaffer examines developments in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARJORIE SHAFFER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US pharmaceutical industry prospered mightily in the go-go years of the
1980s. Profit margins widened and revenue growth marched steadily and
reliably upwards.
But no one expects a repeat performance in the 1990s amid continuing
pressure from Washington, patient advocacy groups and insurance companies to
slow the rise in prescription drug prices.
Over the past decade, the industry habitually raised the price of
prescription drugs in the US at least twice or three times the rate of
inflation. The steep price increases contributed to hefty double-digit
profit gains of 17-20 per cent.
But because of the pressure to limit price increases, most analysts agree
that annual profit gains will slow to 13-15 per cent by 1995. Some analysts
even predict that overall industry earnings growth could dip below 10 per
cent.
Whatever the numbers eventually turn out to be, heavy criticism of US
prescription drugs is forcing the industry to act with more restraint.
Pharmaceutical giant Merck said last year it would not raise prices more
than the rate of inflation and other companies, including Pfizer and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, have followed suit.
'I think there is less pricing flexibility than in the past,' said a
spokesman for Warner-Lambert, a New Jersey-based drug company which has
announced that its price increases will be 'reasonable'.
The pressure to stem the rise in drug prices is apparently taking a toll
already in some areas. Earlier this year, drug companies reported below par
first-quarter results, leading to a sell-off on Wall Street. The first
quarter is when the industry usually puts through its annual price raises.
This year, price increases were halved to 5-6 per cent from the 10-12 per
cent typical of the past five years.
Analysts say continuing pricing constraints will hurt companies without
strong product pipelines.
Upjohn, a drugs company based in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that many analysts say
lacks a strong research and development pipeline, has announced that it
expects its second-quarter net income to be flat. It said it was offering
voluntary retirement to about 10 per cent of its workforce to reduce costs.
Bristol-Meyers Squibb surprised Wall Street last month when it released a
disappointing second-quarter earnings forecast.
While price increases have apparently moderated, Americans still pay some of
the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In most other
countries, prices are subsidised by governments that negotiate with drugs
companies, but drugs companies in the US have long set their own prices.
Elderly consumers bear the brunt of the costs, according to a study by
Purdue University's Pharmaceutical Economics Research Center in Layfayette,
Indiana. The Purdue study estimates that the elderly account for nearly 35
per cent of retail expenditures for prescription drugs in the US.
The cost of prescription drugs can be an overwhelming burden for people on
fixed incomes. Senator David Pryor, chairs the Senate Special Committee on
Ageing and is a critic of prescription drug prices. Earlier this year the
Senate defeated a bill proposed by Senator Pryor to control pharmaceutical
prices, but he intends to keep the pressure on.
Some well-publicised prices for newer drugs underscore the issue. In May,
cancer experts criticised Johnson &amp; Johnson for setting too high a price for
the drug Levamisole to treat colon cancer. The company set the price at
Dollars 1,250 to Dollars 1,500 for a year's supply, some 100 times higher
than an older version of the drug used in veterinarian medicine.
Advocates for the mentally ill have attacked Swiss drug giant Sandoz for the
price it has set for Clozapine, used to treat schizophrenia: Dollars 7,500
for the drug itself plus a required weekly blood monitoring.
And even before the experimental cancer drug Taxol is out of clinical
trials, advocates for breast cancer patients wonder if the price of the
drug, which may eventually reach Dollars 2,000 a gram, will simply be out of
reach of most women.
The pharmaceutical industry has long justified its prices by citing huge
research and development costs. According to the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association (PMA), the industry's trade group in Washington,
research costs will near Dollars 11bn in 1992, up from Dollars 9.6bn in 1991
and about Dollars 600m in 1970.
The industry argues that it has to recoup its R&amp;D costs. In the US, it
spends a little over 16 cents out of each sales dollar for R&amp;D, compared to
4.5 cents to 5 cents for all other industries, said Mr Jeff Trewhitt, PMA
spokesman. 'Of course in nations where there are price controls, like
southern Europe, the prices are lower', said Mr Trewhitt, adding that in
those countries with price controls there is little biomedical innovation.
'Between 1975 and 1989, 47 major world-class drugs originated in the US
alone. This innovation has been fostered in a free-market atmosphere.
Certainly, the R&amp;D costs have to be covered', said Mr Trewhitt.
Despite the industry's protests, drug prices continue to be a big issue,
according to analysts. 'It will stay very difficult to increase prices three
times whatever the consumer price index is,' said Mr Neil Sweig, a drug
analyst with Capital Institutional Services.
Indeed, as the US pharmaceutical industry braces itself for a colder
business climate, analysts say the near future will be filled with lower
growth rates and lower share prices.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (3): Emphasis shifts to elderly -
Alan Archer assesses threats to profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN ARCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a time when most of the world's industry has been undergoing a
restructuring phase brought about by the recession, the pharmaceuticals
industry worldwide (not accounting for the former communist bloc for which
reliable sources are not yet available) has been putting forward its
defensive qualities and has lived up to its description: 'almost
recession-proof.'
Industry executives are asking themselves, with increasing nervousness, how
much longer the good times can last. Drug sales are hardly affected by the
ups and downs of the economy, but how long can the drug companies continue
to announce earnings growth of 15 per cent per year?
According to Mr Sam Isaly, of Mehta and Isaly, New York, the world market
grew 10 per cent with total sales of Dollars 165bn in 1991. The industry's
annual growth rate has slowed a little over recent years but continues to
exceed the rate of growth of the world economy as a whole.
The past few decades have proved to be a golden era for the pharmaceutical
industry but despite the rise in sales the industry is still in a transition
period highlighted by the amount of consolidation taking place in the past
few years.
On the positive front, many in the industry feel that the underlying demand
for innovative drugs to meet and satisfy medical needs will be boosted by
the shift of focus towards the elderly. This is a continuing campaign run by
the UK pharmaceutical industry, according to Mr Ben Hayes, spokesman for the
Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). The impact on
pharmaceuticals demand will be considerable.
Using the UK as an example, drug expenditure per head in the over-65 age
group is four times the level of the rest of the population. Companies which
will benefit most from the changing demographic pattern will be those that
provide for the chronic diseases of old age; arthritis, coronary disease,
hypertension and central nervous system-related illness.
Many companies are investing heavily in this latter area, particularly in
research into Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
The company which comes out first with a product that treats these ailments
would be guaranteed spectacular sales, as Wellcome has had with its Aids
treatment, Retrovir (Zidovudine).
Another important issue is that of demographic changes and their impact on
demand. The world population is growing rapidly - by some 17 per cent a year
 -with the poorest countries growing the fastest. The less-developed regions
of the world account for 76 per cent of the population and at present less
than 15 per cent of pharmaceutical consumption. But many industry observers
believe that this will rapidly change over the next two decades.
It is thought that this demand will be satisfied by the launch of new
products resulting from new technology such as molecular biology which is
now producing a large quantity of new drug products based on the rational
drug design.
On the negative side, there are many cries from the industry forecasting
reduced profitability in the next decade. There are several forces affecting
this profitability:
Pricing pressures from governments worldwide and also private buying
organisations. Drugs are a tempting target for governments wishing to
restrain soaring healthcare costs, although they represent only about 10 per
cent of health spending and can save money if used sensibly.
The increasing trend in generic prescribing and generic substitution means
that products will lose their market share rapidly after patent expiry. This
will be further highlighted by the fact that tried and tested branded
products such as Tagament, Capoten and Tenormin will be included in the new
generics being offered in the near future.
Increasing regulatory requirements are delaying product launches and causing
an erosion of patent life. In many countries, regulatory departments have a
backlog of filings awaiting review.
Escalating research and development costs. According to the US
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the most recent estimate of cost
involved in developing a new drug has risen from Dollars 125m in 1987 to
Dollars 245m in 1991.
For several years, many drug companies had no clear policy on what
therapeutic product groups and geographical areas they wanted to trade in,
taking a somewhat haphazard approach. But the current consolidation process
has changed all that.
Pressure is building and only companies with a clear strategy on what areas
they want to compete in will be successful.
'Most companies have decided where they want to be by the year 2000,' says
Mr Robin Gilbert, analyst at James Capel. 'Certainly Merck and Glaxo have
clearly defined their role, but others like Upjohn, Warner-Lambert, Pfizer
and Syntex are not completely clear what their position is.'
The 1990s have brought about the need for a much greater awareness of the
drugs available and the world's drug market. GPs now have a much better
choice of medications for prescribing and are increasingly using computer
data bases, not only for information sourcing but also the ordering of
pharmaceuticals.
The greater concern taken by the general public (action and lobby groups)
and media to investigate wherever possible the cost benefits and safety of
the drugs they are prescribed.
An increasing collaboration world-wide by regulatory bodies. The
globalisation of industry in the 1990s will be assisted by the
standardisation of regulatory approval procedures for new drugs. As European
regulations are unified after 1992, they will gradually come together with
those of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The use by the FDA of European data for the investigation of Glaxo's filing
of its new migraine drug, Imigran (sumatriptan), is a very good example.
Launched in the UK in October 1991, the drug has been fast-tracked in the US
and approval by the FDA may be imminent.
The growing knowledge by competing companies of each other's R&amp;D programmes
and general strategies. Professor Horst Meyer, head of Bayer Pharmaceuticals
thinks further concentration of the world's pharmaceutical industry is
inevitable. The need for substantial investment in research and development
required to discover 'block-buster' drugs with sales of more than Dollars
500m a year was beyond the means of all but the largest companies.
Prof Meyer said the top 10 companies were spending 35 per cent of all money
dedicated to pharmaceutical R&amp;D and the proportion was likely to increase.
In addition, smaller companies were handicapped by their inability to market
drugs in the three largest markets - the US, Europe and Japan. The top
pharmaceutical groups were able to recover their ever-larger investments by
selling the drugs in all three areas, added Prof Meyer.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (4): Ideals or eyewash? - The EC
single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IDEALISTIC rhetoric about the completion of the internal market for
pharmaceuticals does not seduce the European Court of Justice.
Only a few weeks ago it overruled the pleas of the EC Commission - and set
aside more than 25 years of Community harmonisation - by ruling that 'It is
up to the national authorities. . . to decide whether each product is a
medicine or not'. By one of those ironies that occasionally enliven EC
wrangles, the product in question was an eyewash.
The case is another demonstration that despite impressive progress -
particularly in harmonised requirements on testing, production and product
information, and in increased patent protection - there are still important
gaps in the single market programme for pharmaceuticals.
The priorities now, the Commission admits internally, are the creation of 'a
better European authorisation system' and action 'in the areas of pricing
and social security coverage of medicines'.
Medicine manufacturers agree: the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry says its members' prosperity and research capacity depend on
getting European agreements on a new authorisation system and on 'an
appropriate means of ensuring a fair price is paid for innovative
medicines'.
Last month, a marketing authorisation solution came closer, with a political
agreement among the member states to set up a new European Medicines Agency
which will make binding European decisions. One of the most significant
remaining impediments to free circulation could disappear as from 1994.
But on pricing and reimbursement, the outlook is more confused - largely
because of the distinct objectives of each of the different players. Member
states focus mainly on their health budget, within which the drug bill is
merely one element in a complex national balance of many political factors.
The research-based industry wants free market conditions that, it says, will
allow it to compete with its US and Japanese rivals: intervention of all
types is denounced as 'leading inevitably to market distortions' by Mr
Alberto Aleotti, Menarini's chief executive officer.
Generic medicine manufacturers, stung by patent term extension, are calling
for 'compensatory measures to ensure a significant presence of generic
medicines on the European market'. European consumer representatives such as
Mr Luc Joossens complain that EC legislation on pharmaceuticals has already
excessively favoured the industry (he terms the recent patent term extension
measure 'a catastrophe'), while on consumers' long-standing criticisms of
companies' pricing policies, he says: 'Nothing has been resolved'.
When the Commission rolls out its pricing proposals this autumn, it will
probably stop well short of interventionism - now out of fashion in
subsidiarity-sensitive Brussels. It is likely, instead, to update the
existing EC 'transparency' requirements which are designed to prevent abuses
by making member states come clean on the mechanisms they use to control
prices, profits and reimbursement - but which leave the industry with much
of the onus for policing.
Most industry voices favour such a 'hands-off' EC approach, on the basis
that the wrong sort of EC pressure for convergence could make things worse
everywhere in the Community and flatten revenues overall. But the approach
still carries risks for industry: the EC Commission's non-interventionism
was loudly acclaimed by the German drug industry on a ceremonial visit to
the European Parliament's June plenary session in Strasbourg. Only days
later, the German government announced its decision to impose severe cuts on
pharmaceutical spending as from the beginning of the year.
In any event, the internal market for pharmaceuticals is not going to
introduce predestination to pharmaceutical provision; the Commission is
giving greater emphasis to the market in its public pronouncements. The
continuing diversity of national health care systems and habits will put a
premium on initiative, adaptability and resilience, says Mr Igor Landau, who
heads France's biggest drug company, Rhone-Poulenc Sante:
'Better prices for new products can be won, even in traditionally
lower-priced countries', he says, 'But firms will have to keep up the
pressure with demonstrations of product cost-effectiveness.'
Each operator will have to develop his own strengths to maximise his single
market benefits: Glaxo says it 'derives some general advantage from being
established in virtually every EC member State'.
Mr Didier Wold, a Paris-based consultant to the industry, predicts that the
European pharmaceutical market will still be a maze after 1993 and that
finding the right paths through it is going to become more important than
ever.
The US drug industry association has had an office in Brussels for three
years now and Mr Michael Calingaert, its European director, believes
American companies have the advantage that they are already 'comfortable in
a single market context'.
Even mainline wholesalers, catalysed by the prospects for the single market,
are now internationalising; their objective is to become 'big enough to
drive better bargains than in the past with multinational manufacturers',
warns Mr Mike Watts of the British Association of Pharmaceutical
Wholesalers. And the non-prescription medicines sector sees new
opportunities from what it calls the validation of its products by single
market rules on advertising, product category and information, according to
Dr Hubertus Kranz of AESGP.
Parallel importers too, flourishing in their new respectability among
economy-conscious governments, are looking forward to sustained growth and
continued official support - despite the outrage of manufacturers such as Mr
David Godfrey of Wellcome, who observes that 'there could not be a market
situation more distorted than this' and that the EC Commission 'should not
countenance it'.
He says that parallel imported products account for about one in five of all
branded NHS prescriptions dispensed by retail pharmacists - up to a third in
the past year - and: 'The winner is the trader who can best exploit the
system by shopping in the member state with the most repressive pricing
system'.
Mr Paul de Souter, chairman of the Belgian drug industry association, AGIM,
says gloomily that if the single market brings increased parallel importing,
tougher wholesaling deals and generic substitution: 'This could prove to be
too high a price for some small additional patent protection and a possible
drug registration agency'.
The EC Commission's Mr Fernand Sauer, one of the chief architects of EC drug
regulation, dismisses industry concerns over parallel importing as 'a
problem of the past'. He says that it amounts to no more than 2 per cent of
the total EC medicines market, and 'companies have already learnt how to
deal with it'.
Instead, Mr Sauer emphasises the opportunities he sees for companies to
build their future: free circulation will allow companies to rationalise
their EC operations; harmonisation of drug testing requirements will permit
reduced development costs; increased transparency will disclose abusive
member state practices on pricing and reimbursement.
But he insists that it is up to each player to decide whether and how to use
the opportunities. 'There is certainly going to be a single market', he
says, 'and there will be firms and subsectors that benefit from it. But at
the same time, those who get it wrong could be victims of it'.
The internal market will be more successful for Europe as a whole if it is
free from eyewash, but it is certain that clarity of vision will be a vital
determinant of each player's ability to see its own ideals achieved.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (1): Shake-up is on the way -
Drugs companies are concerned that they could be forced to negotiate not
only the traditional hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy, but a new one
 -that of cost-benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICAL companies have withstood the recession as though charmed.
Apparently inoculated against the slowdown in the world economy, the sector
has offered conspicuously impressive earnings growth.
But parts of the pharmaceuticals business look sick and the prognosis for
some groups is gloomy. Income growth looks set to slow while costs continue
to escalate. Faced with the danger of falling returns, the sector looks set
for significant restructuring, with the strong becoming stronger and the
weak driven into mergers or even forced to exit.
The main driving force behind the coming shake-up is increasing state
interference with drug prices. Governments everywhere are trying to control
rapidly expanding healthcare budgets. Ageing populations and the growing
cost of health technology have led to an alarming increase in healthcare
expenditure.
In the US, spending on health increased between 1960 and 1991 from 5.5 per
cent of GNP to 12 per cent, according to Mr Peter Lauper, head of
pharma-economics at Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss group. He estimates the figure
will reach 15 per cent by the end of the decade.
For governments, the agony has been compounded because the burden of such
increases has fallen disproportionately on the state. Over the past 20
years, the proportion of healthcare spending paid for by the US federal and
state authorities has risen from 22 per cent to 41 per cent.
Governments, scared by such figures but politically shy of tackling
expenditure on hospitals and doctors, see drugs expenditure as an attractive
target for cost savings.
Most governments have attempted to achieve savings through aggressive
pharmaceuticals price controls. The pace of such interference is
accelerating. Last month, the German government extended its reference
pricing system, setting limits for the reimbursement of certain drugs.
Patients pay the balance. In Japan, the Finance Ministry launched the latest
in a series of price cuts last April.
In the US, political pressure from politicians has drawn blood. Last month,
Mr Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, said drugs companies supplying a third of the US market had
promised voluntarily to keep price increases at or below the rate of
inflation.
As price controls start to bite, so growth in the world pharmaceuticals
market will decelerate. Wellcome, the British group, estimates that between
1985 and 1990, the world drugs market increased on average by 13 per cent a
year. For the five years after 1995 that figure could fall to only 5 per
cent, it believes. Others believe the figure could be about 9 per cent.
The other force driving change is the rapidly rising cost of research and
development. The industry spends about Dollars 26bn at present. In the US,
R&amp;D expenditure was Dollars 11bn in 1992, up from Dollars 9.6bn in 1991 and
about Dollars 600m in 1970. Dr Armin Kessler, president of the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations, has warned that even
the existing level of expenditure is unsustainable.
It is in this context of rising costs and slowing growth that
pharmaceuticals groups and the drugs divisions of almost all the big
chemicals companies are trying to expand. But the industry cannot
accommodate them all, warns Mr David Alcraft, director of healthcare and
pharmaceuticals at PA Consulting Group.
Competition is increasing. In the UK, for example, there were 28 per cent
more drugs on the market in 1990 than in 1980, according to Mr Martyn
Postle, a consultant at Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
With slowing revenue growth and increasing costs, the industry's return on
capital is bound to fall, warns Mr Postle. He argues the sector is on the
threshold of a significant shakeout. In 1989, half of world sales were in
the hands of 25 companies. He believes that by the end of the decade that
figure will be 15.
The impact of the slowdown will fall unevenly. Those companies that have
previously been able to offset a lack of new products by increasing prices
will prove most vulnerable. Analysts believe US companies such as Warner
Lambert and Upjohn have been highly dependent on price increases for revenue
growth.
Those that survive must be doubly strong. First they must create innovative
products that can command premium prices. Then they must have the necessary
marketing networks to exploit them fully.
Creating such innovative products is far from easy. Discovering new chemical
entities is fairly simple. The difficult part is identifying which ones are
likely to provide competitive advantage through greater safety or efficacy.
Mr Lauper at Ciba-Geigy explains: 'The essential component is quality of
spend. You have to learn to manage the pipeline, accelerating development of
selected compounds so you can reach the market more quickly, while at the
same time remaining ethical - in other words not cutting corners.'
In the battle to demonstrate the extent to which a drug is innovative,
pharmaceuticals groups are adding a new weapon to their armoury: health
economics. In order to guarantee premium prices for innovative products, the
drugs groups are looking to demonstrate the cost-benefit of new compounds.
'Previously you just had to demonstrate the drug's quality, efficacy and
safety. Now you have to show it is cost-effective,' says Mr Lauper.
The industry, for the most part, welcomes the opportunity. Some benefits are
easily demonstrated. SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet and Glaxo's Zantac both
allow stomach ulcers to be treated at home rather than using expensive,
potentially dangerous, surgery.
However, there is concern that drugs companies could be forced to negotiate
not only the traditional hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy, but a new
fourth - that of cost-benefit. The danger is that regulatory authorities,
currently only concerned with the safety, quality and efficiency of drugs,
will in future only licence medicines that also demonstrate they can save
costs elsewhere.
Meanwhile, marketing will continue to be vital. Drugs groups will need
access to worldwide marketing forces so they can maximise sales during the
short period when the drug's patents remain valid, says Mr Postle.
Several groups have been been able to increase their revenues significantly
by setting up joint-marketing agreements.
Wellcome, for example, has agreements to market Zovirax, its anti-viral
medicine, with Hoechst in Germany, Sigma Tau in Italy and Sumitomo in Japan.
Some small companies should be able to survive by creating niches, either in
research, using new technologies, or in marketing in specific therapeutic or
geographical areas, says Mr Alcraft.
The main losers will be those caught in the middle, he warns. Without
sufficient critical mass in research and development, they will have few
compounds and little experience in negotiating the necessary regulatory
hurdles.
In addition, they will have increasing difficulty attracting good
researchers.
Mr Alcraft explains: 'The problem for the medium-sized players is that
emotionally it is difficult to admit you aren't going to be the next giant.
The option of being a niche operator is open, but it's a tricky decision to
make.'
One solution for smaller organisations is to set up joint ventures to share
the costs of marketing and to increase revenues that will offset massive
expenditure on research and development.
Otherwise, one option for such groups is to merge. The main synergies appear
to be that marketing reach is extended and that cost-savings are achieved by
rationalising headquarters costs.
The pace of change is likely to prove variable. Many pharmaceuticals
companies are parts of larger chemicals groups.
In the short term, most main boards will be unwilling to give up their
high-performing pharmaceuticals divisions.
But in the long term, pharmaceuticals groups must gain critical mass, find
niche areas of specialisation or wither.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (2): The challenge; speed
invention and curb costs - R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICAL laboratories come in many shapes and sizes. Grandest of all
is the Pounds 500m research centre now under construction for Glaxo in
Stevenage, 30 miles north of London.
The Glaxo labs - said to be largest building project in the UK after the
Channel Tunnel - will house 1,400 researchers when they open in 1994.
Having so many scientists working together on one site gives them all access
to the best possible range of expensive up-to-date equipment. There is a
danger, however, that bureaucracy will smother the imaginative approach that
is essential for developing innovative drugs. Glaxo will try to overcome
this by clever research management, to make the scientists feel they are
working in small units.
The opposite school of thought - that research flourishes best in genuinely
small groups - is illustrated by Scotia Pharmaceuticals, an emerging UK
company which specialises in drugs based on essential fatty acids.
Scotia has no more than 170 employees altogether. Yet it carries out
research and development on six widely separated sites: at Callanish on the
Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Dundee on the east coast of Scotland,
Carlisle in north-west England, Writtle in Essex, Guildford in Surrey and
Nova Scotia in Canada.
Dr Iain Law who is in charge of R&amp;D at Callanish - surely the most remote
pharmaceutical laboratory in Europe - says he keeps in good touch with the
other facilities through visits from colleagues and through the weekly notes
written by all Scotia R&amp;D managers and circulated around the company.
All pharmaceutical labs, whatever their size and location, face a common
challenge: how to restrain the soaring costs of R&amp;D and at the same time
speed up the discovery and development of new drugs.
According to data collected by the Centre for Medicines Research in the UK,
worldwide spending on pharmaceutical R&amp;D increased by an average of 16 per
cent a year during the 1980s. The global total reached Dollars 24bn in 1990;
15 per cent of pharmaceutical sales. Almost half of the industry's R&amp;D
expenditure is in Europe, 36 per cent in the US and 15 per cent in Japan.
Unfortunately the rapid rise in R&amp;D spending has not produced a
corresponding increase in the flow of new drugs onto the market. The number
of medicines launched during the early 1980s averaged about 60 per year.
During the three years 1989-91 it was close to 40 a year. The number of new
drugs originating in Europe has fallen over the decade from 30-40 a year to
10-20 a year.)
The total time taken to develop each new drug has increased steadily since
the 1960s. The clinical phase - testing the drug on human patients - doubled
during the 1980s to reach an average of seven years. Trials are taking
longer because regulatory authorities are requiring more and more clinical
data, while doctors and their patients are becoming more reluctant to take
part. Companies are having to spend more time and money to recruit the
hundreds or even thousands of people they require to test each drug.
The industry is responding in two main ways: lobbying the authorities to
reduce the regulatory burden, and operating its R&amp;D effort more efficiently.
One way to ease the regulatory burden is to harmonise requirements around
the world, so that companies do not have to repeat tests unnecessarily to
satisfy authorities in different countries. This is already happening within
Europe through the EC.
On a global level, the first international conference on harmonisation in
Brussels last November was an important step toward bringing the US, Japan
and Europe into line. It was agreed then, for example, that routine 12-month
toxicity tests on animals should be abandoned in favour of six-month
studies.
But much more needs to be done, particularly to harmonise clinical
requirements. Complete standardisation is unattainable because medical
practice and social conditions vary so much around the world. The ultimate
objective is to retain only those differences that can be justified by
rational criteria.
At the same time companies are trying to improve the productivity of their
researchers, particularly in the pre-clinical phase which they can control
more closely than clinical trials. They are investing heavily in new
technology - ranging from computerised chemical databases to molecular
modelling graphics and automatic gene sequencing machines - to help the
scientists select and adapt compounds more rapidly for drug development.
Besides introducing new technology, the industry is changing the way it
manages R&amp;D. A good UK example is ICI Pharmaceuticals. 'We have redesigned
our approach to get the fastest possible answer to the question: Does the
drug behave in humans in the way we would predict from our laboratory
models?' says Dr Tom McKillop, technical director.
ICI is now consistently achieving its target of administering candidate
drugs to human volunteers within 14 months of their first synthesis - a
great improvement on the company's previous average performance of 30
months. At the same time, ICI is being much more ruthless in abandoning
compounds that do not live up to their initial promise. Dr McKillop says the
new regime is quite different to ICI's traditional approach which 'assumed
that every drug was going to succeed.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index collapses through 2,400
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNSETTLING reports on the domestic economy left the London stock market
vulnerable yesterday to the widespread setback across European bourses which
followed Tokyo's fall to a six-year low. Although selling pressure remained
moderate, the UK market collapsed through the FT-SE 2,400 mark, finishing
27.7 down at 2,387.9, its lowest closing level since April 3, when the stock
market was gearing itself for the UK general election.
Equities opened weaker, and soon moved lower following a poor start by the
September futures contract on the Footsie. In addition to the bad news from
Tokyo, shares had to face continued softness in sterling. Throughout the
session, the Footsie September future provided a depressing lead, slipping
to 2,384 at one stage and failing to hold a rally in later dealings.
Worries about the UK housing market deepened after the building societies
disclosed a heavy annualised fall in mortgage commitments. The reaction on
the German stock market to the latest domestic money supply data revived
fears that the key Lombard rate might be raised, forcing UK rates to follow
suit.
At mid-morning, statistics showing a 0.2 per cent dip in UK retail sales and
a current account deficit on trade of Pounds 722m in June were taken as
remains depressed. Unsubstantiated reports that the UK government was about
to announce swingeing cuts in public spending completed the mood of gloom.
At the day's low, just after the trade figures announcement, the Footsie
sank to 2,376.8, down 38.8. There were substantial losses in shares across
the range of the market, with many building and construction stocks
suffering afresh.
There was little support behind the closing rally in share prices, which
most traders believed reflected little more than bear-closing operations by
traders wanting stock to meet earlier selling commitments. The argument that
UK stocks offer good value was repeated, albeit desparingly, by equity
strategists.
However, some comfort was drawn from the modest level of turnover; Seaq
volume of 428.1m shares compared with Tuesday's 421.5m, which was worth only
Pounds 864.1m in terms of customer business. Traders also pointed out that
London's fall of 1.1 per cent was only about a half of the losses suffered
yesterday on the French and German equity markets.
Suggestions that the UK government might be about to introduce heavy
reductions in public spending found a ready reception in a market where fund
managers are said to be depressed by 'a feeling of helplessness, as if the
government cannot do anything about this recession'.
There were very few exceptions to the general gloom. British Airways lost
the gain of the previous day as the stock market reassessed the implications
of the deal with USAir. ICI, with trading figures due shortly, gave ground
again, and Reuters weakened sharply as Wall Street opened the new session
with a 26 Dow points fall in early trading.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTING monthly data on UK retail and trade figures, together with
falls in other European markets, prompted a further fall in stock index
futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened firmly at 2,403 but selling by
independent traders in the first few minutes sent it falling to 2,394.
Attempts at a rally soon petered out, however, as dealers focused instead on
the falls in other European markets which followed talk that the Bundesbank
may soon be forced to raise its Lombard rate. Sentiment was further weakened
by the release of the UK trade and retail figures, after which the September
contract dipped to the day's low of 2,384.
After a period of sideways trading, bargain hunting helped the Footsie
future contract regain some of its earlier fall. The contract closed at
2,401, down 23 from the previous session and around 5 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover reached 8,637.
Dealers reported a further recovery in the contract in after-hours' trading.
The expiry of the July stock options provided the main feature in the traded
options market, where turnover totalled 36,381 lots. Some 10,358 contracts
were transacted in the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  23 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fears of further German rate
rise upset bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FEARS that the Bundesbank would be forced to raise the Lombard rate added to
the negative factors weighing on continental equities, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT was depressed by disappointing money supply figures, a downgrading
of Thyssen and poor car registration figures for the first half. The DAX
fell 31.55 or 1.9 per cent to 1,628.22, its lowest close since mid-January,
while the FAZ was 7.28 lower at 649.04 by midsession. Turnover fell to
DM6.3bn from DM6.9bn.
The 8.7 per cent growth in M3 money supply in June, little changed from May,
upset the market which had hoped for a month-on-month decrease.
There was active trading in Thyssen after analysts cut their recommendations
from hold to sell following a meeting with the steel group on Tuesday.
Analysts are now forecasting that Thyssen will cut its 1991/92 dividend by
up to DM2 from DM10 a year earlier. The shares lost DM15.40 or 6.9 per cent
to DM207.60, but off the day's low of DM205. Other steel groups weakened
with Hoesch down DM6.10 at DM235 and Kloeckner-Werke losing DM8.50 to DM100.
Car shares fell after the release of figures showing a 9.2 per cent decrease
in new registrations for the first six months. Daimler-Benz lost DM14 to
DM705.50, Volkswagen fell DM9.90 to DM354 and BMW shed DM5.50 to DM538.50.
After the close, Volkswagen said that its share of the West European car
market had risen to 17.8 per cent in the first half of 1992 from 16.7 per
cent last year.
PARIS dropped to its lowest level since Christmas, as the CAC-40 index ended
35.18 or 2 per cent lower at 1,727.49 on turnover of FFr2.63bn.
Alcatel remained busy on arbitrage-related business, falling FFr11 to
FFr613, but the FFr31 fall in BSN to FFr1,059 reflected genuine
disinvestment by investors reducing their exposure to the market. An
increasingly bleak outlook for the luxury goods market prompted selling of
LVMH which closed FFr102 lower at FFr3,463.
Euro Disney fell a further FFr2.75 to FFr97.25 on a growing consensus that
the theme park operator would have to reduce prices.
MILAN continued to fall, with the banking sector particularly badly hit by
fears of mounting bad debts following last Friday's compulsory winding up of
Efim, the state industrial holding group. The Comit index fell 1.95 to
409.76 in turnover estimated at L100bn after Monday's L136bn.
The banking sector fell 1.85 per cent, with Banca Commerciale Italiana,
which is said to have the biggest exposure to Efim among the domestic banks,
falling L119 or 4.7 per cent to L2,401. Credito Italiano and San Paolo,
which reportedly have smaller loans to Efim, fell L40.5 and L25 to L1,310
and L10,075 respectively.
Benetton dropped L840 or 7.3 per cent to L10,700 on a domestic newspaper
report that the company had sacked its managing director. After the close
the company confirmed that Mr Emilio Fossati had resigned, but under
amicable circumstances.
ZURICH was generally weaker and the SMI index declined 27.4 or 1.5 per cent
to 1,757.1. Union Bank led the sector lower and its bearers fell SFr7 to
SFr684. Among insurers, Zurich bearers lost BFr20 to BFr1,795.
AMSTERDAM retreated, the CBS Tendency index closing down 1.1 at 116.5.
Fokker fell 40 cents to Fl 29.20 on fears that talks between Dasa of Germany
and the Dutch government might break down when they resume today.
Among multinationals Unilever lost Fl 2.40 to Fl 180.80 and Royal Dutch shed
Fl 1.30 to Fl 145.80.
BRUSSELS caught up with world markets after its two-day holiday, the Bel-20
Index falling 25.49 or 2.2 per cent to 1,145.35, its lowest level since
January 14. Petrofina fell BFr200 or 1.8 per cent to BFr10,750.
VIENNA fell back, in line with major bourses. The 18-share ATX index lost
8.76 to 803.95. Erste Allgemeine ordinaries fell Sch80 to Sch3,020, but
preference shares rose Sch45 to Sch1,880 after the insurer reported improved
1991 profits.
MADRID's general index fell 4.46 or 2 per cent to 216.10 as the market
reacted negatively to the government's measures to reduce the budget
deficit. In the construction sector FCC lost Pta500 to Pta6,300 and
Cubiertas was Pta190 lower at Pta5,380.
STOCKHOLM was driven lower by a wave of selling in the final 30 minutes. The
Affarsvarlden index shed 9.0 to 851.1 as turnover remained low at Skr292m.
OSLO's all-share index dropped 4.22 or 1.1 per cent to 373.89 in low
turnover of NKr117.08m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr3 to NKr145 while Saga Petroleum
A shares shed NKr2 to NKr61.5.
ISTANBUL fell 1.3 per cent in trading which concentrated on minor shares.
The 75-share index closed down 51.71 at 4,091.90.

FT  23 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes at its
lowest level since April 1986

<TEXT>
GROWING pessimism about the economy and corporate earnings prompted a fall
in the futures market, and the Nikkei average dropped 2.8 per cent to its
lowest level since April 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 460.46 down at 15,541.95 on futures-linked
arbitrage unwinding and short-selling by investors. The index rose to the
day's high of 16,059.61 soon after the opening, encouraged by Tuesday's Wall
Street showing. But a fall in the futures market triggered weakness in cash
prices, and the Nikkei tumbled to the session's low of 15,432.36 in the
afternoon.
Volume increased to 250m shares from 205m, but market participants said the
bulk of activity was futures-related. Declines led rises by 876 to 108, with
113 stocks unchanged. A total of 213 issues fell to new lows for the year.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 23.63 to 1,205.75, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 6.06 to 940.11.
Worries about a prolonged slump in the economy and possible downward
revisions in corporate earnings sent jitters through the market. Mr
Hiromichi Ishikawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities, commented:
'The market will not rebound until we can see a real recovery.'
Nippon Life said institutions, especially life assurers, would not commit
funds until they believe the risk in the market has faded. 'With most of the
unrealised gains on stock holdings lost, life assurers cannot take risks on
investments,' said an analyst.
Analysts said banks, which faced problems meeting capital ratios set by the
Bank for International Settlements due to the sharp decline in hidden
assets, were trying to reduce exposure to the stock market by selling
futures contracts. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said: 'It is a
vicious cycle since a fall in the futures market in turn depresses the cash
market.'
Market participants have become increasingly bearish towards the electronics
sector, following last week's disappointing second quarter earnings from
IBM.
Analysts expect many of the Japanese electronics groups to be hit by slowing
demand and increasing inventories. Hitachi dipped Y4 to Y748 and Fujitsu Y14
to Y569. Rumours that Sony was going to announce a downward revision in its
earnings forecast sent the issue down Y90 to Y3,940.
Brokerage houses were also sold on a depressing earnings outlook. Market
participants expect their revenues to suffer from the low market volumes.
Nomura Securities receded Y30 to Y1,240 and Nikko Securities Y20 to Y511.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 408.54 weaker at 17,942.53, its lowest
closing level since November 1986. Volume expanded from 15.8m shares to
23.4m.
Roundup
THE REGION'S markets showed mixed performances yesterday, while Hong Kong
was closed down because of the approach of a typhoon.
SINGAPORE regained some ground after two consecutive days of declines. The
Straits Times Industrial index improved 2.44 to 1,436.90 with some 45.8m
shares traded.
Among the active issues, SIA put on 20 cents to SDollars 12.90 and
Industrial Commercial Bank gained 15 cents to SDollars 6.20.
SEOUL achieved a 2.7 per cent advance in moderate trade, the composite index
ending 14.16 ahead at 526.00. Turnover grew to Won162.96bn from Won107.53bn.
Rises outnumbered falls by 680 to 101 and a total of 248 shares attained
their upper limits for the day.
AUSTRALIA saw a strong opening but then declined in reaction to Tokyo's
fall. The All Ordinaries index shed a net 2.0 at 1,607.2.
Rothmans, down 50 cents to ADollars 6.70, registered one of the day's
steepest falls after the resignation of the chief executive. This is the
first time that the shares have closed below ADollars 7 since 1987.
Banks were mostly weak, although National Australia Bank added 3 cents at
ADollars 7.90 in the wake of Tuesday's bid for Bank of New Zealand.
TAIWAN finished slightly lower after early buying in low-priced issues
failed to boost sentiment. The weighted index lost 4.22 at 4,154.80 and
turnover contracted to TDollars 18.57bn from TDollars 23.73bn.
Food, plastic, textile and cement shares showed gains but other sectors
fell.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index ended 8.43 higher at 1,568.51. Fletcher
Challenge rose 8 cents to NZDollars 3.38 and Carter Holt Harvey firmed 5
cents to NZDollars 2.65. Air New Zealand closed at a year's high, up 6 cents
at NZDollars 2.51.
Independent Newspapers moved up 25 cents to NZDollars 5.55 on rumours that
News Corp might sell part of its 49 per cent holding.
MANILA closed stronger on bargain hunting. The composite index gained 20.75
at 1,453.79, with Philippine Long Distance Telephone ahead 20 pesos at 1,025
pesos. Combined turnover declined to 313.7m pesos from 371.6m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR rose in heavy trading, with interest focused on speculative
stocks. The composite index moved up 3.63 to 608.79. Extended trading hours,
which began yesterday, contributed to the high volume of 166m shares.
BANGKOK's SET index added 3.71 at 757.96 in low turnover of Bt6.42bn.
Advancing issues outpaced losers by 139 to 71.

FT  23 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Volume improves in Brussels and Paris -
A generally depressing month for European turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the roller-coaster ride of the last few days, June seems a long time
ago. Almost lost now in the mists of time was the shock that greeted the
Danish referendum result on the Maastricht treaty. The 'No' vote took Europe
by surprise, and sent jitters through the financial markets.
With President Francois Mitterrand, of France, opting to put the treaty to
referendum in September and Prime Minister John Major, of the UK, fending
off a revolt among members of his own Conservative party who wished to
distance themselves from the Continent, the view took hold that the treaty's
political and economic convergence theories were in serious danger of
collapsing.
Consequently, volumes were depressed, with two main exceptions: both Belgium
and France registered significant improvements against May. Elsewhere,
turnover shrank by between 18 per cent, in the case of the Netherlands, and
3 per cent, for the UK.
Belgium's increase is partly ascribed to the fact that May's volume had been
depressed by the large number of companies going ex-dividend. However, the
market was also less affected by the Maastricht fallout than other European
bourses.
In a recent report, Ms Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson notes that in spite
of this, daily volume remained below BFr1bn (Dollars 32.7m) and was likely
to stay there for some time to come. Nevertheless, she says that 'within a
European context, Belgium has been one of the best performing markets
against a background of general nervousness surrounding the future of the
Maastricht treaty'.
'Most of the bad news in terms of company projections for 1992 earnings, the
decreasing likelihood of an interest rate cut in Germany by the year's end,
and a weak economic environment has already been digested by the market,'
she wrote.
The situation in France, which saw the biggest climb in volume during the
month, was a consequence of heavy selling following the Danish vote and
President Mitterrand's decision to call an autumn referendum.
Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, who supplies the monthly data, notes
that 'end-quarter options and futures expiry and window dressing at the end
of the first half of the year' also swelled the figures.
A weaker dollar and further worries about the pace of US economic recovery
affected the Netherlands, which prompted investors to switch out of cyclical
stocks and into defensive issues.
Negative corporate news, particularly from Philips, the Dutch-based
electrical giant, also affected sentiment. Philips lost 18 per cent in one
day as analysts downgraded the stock following a profits warning from the
company.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hanson in dispute over Nevada
gold deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has become embroiled in an
escalating dispute with Placer Dome of Vancouver over ownership of the
sizeable Pipeline gold deposit in north-east Nevada.
Placer this week filed the latest in a series of lawsuits between the two
groups and other companies involved in exploration of the Pipeline property.
Alleging that Hanson Natural Resources - a partnership which includes
Hanson-controlled Gold Fields Mining - has interfered with its contractual
rights, Placer has asked the court to declare that they have no claim
against it.
The suit is a response to allegations by the Hanson group that Placer failed
to disclose that it had made a major gold discovery when it took up an
option in August 1991 to buy the Pipeline property from Gold Fields. Placer
estimated last April that the deposit has gold-bearing reserves of 11.3m
tonnes, with a grade of 0.237 ounces per tonne. The gold content is
estimated at 2.7m ounces.
The dispute hinges partly on conversations between officials of the various
companies, but also on the extent to which a mining company is entitled to
keep its exploration data confidential.
The Pipeline deposit abuts the existing Cortez joint venture in Nevada,
which is owned 60 per cent by Placer and 40 per cent by Kennecott. The
disputed area, which is six miles north-west of the Cortez processing plant,
is estimated to contain about 45 per cent of the total Pipeline reserves.
The rest of the deposit is part of the Cortez operation.
A Placer official said that evaluation of the Pipeline deposit was
proceeding 'as if nothing had happened.' A feasibility study is due to be
completed early next year. But Mr Rich Cohen, mining analyst at Goepel
Shields in Toronto, predicted yesterday that output, which had been forecast
to begin within the next 2-3 years, could be delayed if the dispute drags on
through the courts.
Mr Cohen estimated that Pipeline was worth between CDollars 300 and CDollars
500m to Placer, equal to about CDollars 2 a share. Placer shares, which
stood at CDollars 13.63 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday morning,
dropped sharply when the Pipeline dispute first surfaced, and have continued
to under-perform the rest of the Canadian gold sector in recent weeks.

FT  23 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool auctions are resumed next week. The market during the recess
has been nominally static, but with dollar currencies weakening for most of
the month, price ideas in most major consuming countries have eased. The
Australian view is not by any means bearish, however, and some European
traders consider that prices could possibly rise to begin with. Calculations
further ahead are influenced by the four million bale stockpile, which has
to be disposed of at some stage, by recession and by the inability of the
old Soviet countries to buy.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coconut prices weather
'malicious propaganda' - Prices have risen sharply on the world market
despite health attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY THIS year Malaysia organised an 11-nation international coconut tree
climbing contest in order, the organisers said, to promote the crop. The
competition, won by Sri Lanka, was well-timed. Since mid-1991 world prices
for most coconut products have risen over 50 per cent.
Coconut is a remarkably versatile crop: its flesh can be desiccated and
creamed, or turned into copra for animal feed; coconut oil is used in
shampoos, cosmetics, cooking oils and margarines; its shell makes high
quality charcoal and can be transformed into activated carbon.
Officials at the headquarters of the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community in
Jakarta, whose 14-member countries account for 82 per cent of world coconut
production, describe the coconut tree in almost mystic terms as 'the tree of
life'.
This stands in contrast to an allegation by soyabean producers in the US
that tropical oils, which are high in saturated fat, raise human cholesterol
levels and are a possible contributor to coronary heart disease.
Mr PG Punchihewa, executive director of the APCC, describes the charge as
'entirely false' and 'malicious propaganda'. Indeed, the soyabean farmers'
allegation arouses deep feeling in the coconut fraternity. It is 'a lie of
fantastic proportions,' says Mr Chris Mudd, author of Cholesterol and Your
Health - the Great American Rip Off*.
The issue of which oils - such as coconut, palm, soyabean and rapeseed  -
are best for your health is at the centre of a battle among producers for
market share. Medical research is inconclusive and continuing studies on the
health-effects of fatty acids may tip the balance back in the favour of
tropical oils.
The rise in the world price of coconut products - coconut oil averaged
Dollars 337 a tonne in 1990 and is currently hovering around the Dollars 560
mark - has come as a welcome relief to producers. The reason for the
increase, however, is not a victory in the propaganda war, but a sharp fall
in production in the Philippines, the world's leading coconut exporter.
In January it was estimated that 1992 Philippines production, measured in
copra equivalent, at 1.98m tonnes but, because of an extended period of low
rainfall which began last October, the figure has been revised to between
1.4m and 1.5m tonnes.
Weather problems have been exacerbated by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and
a recovery in production is not expected until 1994. It may take until the
second half of the decade before output returns to the 1990 level of nearly
2.5m tonnes.
With the Philippines holding a quarter share of world copra exports and over
50 per cent of coconut oil exports, a rise in world prices has resulted.
This has been good news for other producers, such as Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.
Indonesia, with an estimated 3m coconut farmers and production of 2.3m
tonnes last year, has overtaken the Philippines as the largest producer but
over 80 per cent of its production stays at home. Domestic prices shadow the
world market and coconut oil in Java has risen from Rupiah 718 (35 US cents)
a kilogram in June last year to about Rp1,175.
Indonesia's coconut production is expected to decline marginally this year
to 2.25m tonnes, although rainfall has been better than forecast. The area
under cultivation has risen sharply over the past 10 years from 2.5m
hectares to about 3.3m hectares. Exports of coconut oil, however, have
declined from a high of 206,647 tonnes in 1988 to an estimated 155,000
tonnes this year.
This has added to concerns that world demand for coconut products will
outstrip supply in the medium-term.
The APCC estimates that Philippines copra meal exports for January-April
amounted to 141,019 tonnes, down 35 per cent on the same period last year.
Indonesia's were 38,162 tonnes for January and February, a 59 per cent
year-on-year decline.
World copra meal stocks in April stood at 58,000 tonnes, compared with
nearly 100,000 tonnes a year earlier. There has been a similar decline in
coconut oil stocks held in Rotterdam, the main trading centre, to 61,175
tonnes in mid-May from 134,575 tonnes a year before.
The market for coconut oil has historically been volatile, collapsing from
Dollars 1,155 per tonne in 1984 to Dollars 297 in 1986, and if production
does pick-up, traders expect prices to fall quickly.
Mr Punchihewa expects stiff competition from soyabean, rapeseed and palm
oils but notes that 'there is an element where it (coconut oil) cannot be
substituted' in end products. He says the industry will move toward
value-added products such as fatty alcohols and glycerine, and there is
substantial room for expansion simply by cutting down wastage. APCC
officials estimate that only 40 per cent of Indonesia's coconut crop is
processed and of the 50bn coconuts produced in the world each year, the
shells and husks of half are simply thrown away.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc price rises prompt call
for action by LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE FOR the London Metal Exchange executive to take action to head off
technical squeezes in some of its markets increased yesterday as zinc prices
rose sharply again because of impending supply tightness in October.
Traders suggest there are also signs that a squeeze is looming in the LME's
'flagship' copper contract for the fourth quarter of this year and early
1993.
The lead contract might be the next to be subjected to a squeeze, warned Mr
Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, the financial services
group, yesterday. He said: 'We would warn hedgers about actually shorting
lead (selling metal they do not own in the expectation of buying later at a
lower price) in the coming weeks. This market could take off as zinc did.'
Zinc for delivery in three months closed on the LME last night up Dollars 32
a tonne at Dollars 1,376.50 while zinc for immediate delivery ended Dollars
40 up at Dollars 1,362.50. Prices have risen by 9.5 per cent since July 16
when the LME removed limitations imposed to ease the impact of a squeeze in
June.
Six to eight zinc producers accounting for about 1m tonnes of annual output
and a big trader seem to be involved. Producers would prefer to keep the LME
zinc price - which is a reference point for contracts signed all over the
world - above their break-even level of Dollars 1,300 a tonne. To do this
they have built up a big long position (bought metal today for future
delivery) for delivery in October.
Those involved say they are not colluding but each came to a similar
conclusion when the price languished last year at Dollars 1,000 a tonne. One
of the participants explained to Reuter yesterday that they had built up
long positions for delivery in June this year and, when the LME intervened,
these were simply rolled over into October.
Some consumers complain they are being forced to pay artificially high
prices for zinc at a time when LME stocks are at record levels.
However, Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, pointed out, the zinc price
was being underpinned by good demand.

<TEXT>
THE RALLY in COCOA prices that began on Tuesday morning continued yesterday
and accelerated in late trading, pushing the September position on the
London Futures and Options Exchange to Pounds 585 a tonne, up by Pounds 15
on the day and by Pounds 30 from Tuesday's low. Dealers said the late move
enlivened an otherwise extremely dull day with the market appearing to have
entered a period of comparative stability after the recent run-up and
retracement. They said the quickening of the rise was partly because of the
triggering of stop-loss buying orders set by operators who had speculated on
the recent fall continuing. At the London Metal Exchange early gains were
generally pared back, but all base metals finished with net gains on the
day. Apart from zinc (see story above) the strongest LME contract was TIN,
which ended Dollars 167.50 up in the cash position at Dollars 7,047.50 a
tonne. Once again stop-loss orders were instrumental in the advance, which
was later halted by profit-taking. Talk of delays to Chinese shipments were
also supportive. Cash COPPER ended Pounds 18.50 up at Pounds 1,354 a tonne
with the market underpinned by the continuing Polish mine strike.

FT  23 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico plans its first New
York issue in 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is preparing to re-enter the New York bond market for
the first time since it triggered the onset of the debt crisis 10 years ago
with its announcement that it could not meet its foreign debt payments.
Mr Angel Gurria, undersecretary for international financial affairs in the
Mexican Ministry of Finance, said an issue was being planned in the name of
the United Mexican States for around Dollars 200m. It would be the first
government issue of a so-called Yankee bond since 1980-81.
He said that, as the government was running a budget surplus, it had no
urgent need for the money and so the issue would only go ahead if market
conditions were right. The government was aiming to establish a benchmark
from which other Mexican borrowers could price their bond issues. It also
wanted to re-establish its name in the New York market, and hoped to use the
issue to lengthen further the average maturity of Mexico's debt.
Mr Gurria, in an interview in Madrid, said Mexico was already tapping the
commercial paper markets in the US and in Europe, where it was able to
borrow at 150 basis points (1.5 percentage points) over US Treasury bill
rates. It had also issued 10-year bonds in the Eurobond market at 195 basis
points over US Treasuries.
Mexico does not at this time have an investment grade rating from the main
US rating agencies, but Mr Gurria believes a rating might be possible within
months.
Mexico's return to the New York market and its promotion as an investment
grade credit would mark its final reacceptance in the international capital
markets. Helped by a 1990 agreement to reduce its debt, the Mexican
government now devotes 4.2 per cent of its gross domestic product and 16 per
cent of its budget to interest payments, compared with 18 per cent and 42
per cent respectively as recently as 1986.

FT  23 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexican exchange to offer
warrant trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO is to introduce a market of listed warrants in the second half of
August, according to the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV).
The warrants will be listed and traded on the Mexican stock exchange, and
issued by brokers, banks and companies on which the warrants are traded.
Warrants will be based on either individual stocks or baskets of stocks.
The authorities hope the warrants will boost the underlying stock market's
liquidity, and stem the growing tide of warrants business being conducted
offshore. Merrill Lynch, Nomura and Banamex all offer warrants listed in
Luxembourg on baskets of Mexican stocks, while the listed options on Telmex,
the telephone monopoly, are traded in New York.
CNV plans to offer a listed options market in the near future and a
financial futures market later. The warrants and options market will let
investors protect themselves from price changes, and better control the risk
of buying into the volatile Mexican market.
The options and warrants market in Mexico is unlikely to take off while
restrictions remain on margin trading and short selling in the underlying
market, and while brokerage fees stay higher than in the US. Such obstacles
inhibit the arbitrage between the underlying and derivative market, thus
making it difficult to use options and warrants as efficient hedges.

FT  23 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Argentina stays in spotlight with two
more launches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO companies yesterday maintained the high profile of Argentina in the
international bond market by launching Eurodollar transactions.
The issues, for Telefonica Argentina and Banco de Credito Argentina, follow
hard on the heels of a Dollars 200m deal for Argentina Telecom launched last
Friday. Acindar, a steel company, is expected to launch a Dollars 100m deal
soon.
The spate of issues follows approval by the CNV, the Argentine regulator.
Borrowers are also keen to launch issues before the end of July and the
start of the holiday season in the US and European markets.
Telefonica Argentina yesterday raised Dollars 100m over three years through
a deal lead-managed by Lehman Brothers International. The bonds pay an 8 per
cent semi-annual coupon and were re-offered to investors at par. At this
level the yield is 328 basis points more than US Treasury bonds.
The borrower is a monopoly provider of telecommunications in southern
Argentina and the business areas of Buenos Aires. On Friday, Argentina
Telecom, which supplies the north of the country, raised Dollars 200m
five-year funding at a yield spread of 345 basis points.
Banco de Credito launched a Dollars 75m two-year issue, with a put option
after one year, via Citicorp Investment Bank. The yield spread was far wider
at 545 basis points, reflecting the weaker credit quality of the issuer.
From an issue price of 98.666, the bonds were quoted at 98.875 bid by late
afternoon.
Participants in both issues reported smooth placement underpinned by demand
from retail investors.
Earlier this month, accusations of corruption against Mr Collor de Mello,
Brazil's president, and weak stock markets in the region caused most new
issue plans to be shelved.
While the Collor scandal remains unsolved, Brazil has since agreed a debt
restructuring package with its commercial bank creditors. Last week,
Argentina's credit rating was raised by two notches to B1 by Moody's
Investors Service.
While the mood among investors is now more positive, bringing issues for
Latin American borrowers can still be difficult. Banco de Chile's planned
Dollars 75m issue via Bankers Trust, the first by a Chilean borrower, has
been postponed beyond this week. Sources said negotiations between the
issuer and the Chilean authorities were slowing the progress of the deal.
In the mainstream of the international bond market, potential issuers were
detered by the uncertain tone of European bond markets. General Electric
Capital launched a Dollars 150m four-year deal, lead-managed by
ScotiaMcLeod.
The 6 1/2 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.55, for a yield of 6.63 per cent. The lead manager said the deal was
priced to yield 43 basis points more than a new Canadian government bond
which also carries a 1996 maturity date. However, other participants in the
deal claimed the spread was as low as 15 basis points over the government
bond yield curve.
Following a sharp rally in the Canadian market in recent weeks there are few
outstanding issues trading below par. For example, an outstanding GECC issue
maturing 1996 was trading at 110 per cent of face value.

FT  23 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Nine UK housing associations
raise Pounds 83m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE UK housing associations yesterday raised Pounds 83m (Dollars 158.53m)
from institutional investors by making a bond issue through a joint venture
company.
The deal, underwritten and arranged by Kleinwort Benson, marks a further
step in the battle by housing associations to secure long-term private
sector funding. The associations are non-profit-making organisations devoted
to providing low-cost housing. The cash raised will be used for building
homes and upgrading housing stock.
The government has pledged Pounds 1.7bn this year to back development but
about Pounds 500m private sector finance is needed.
Most private sector funding comes from short-term banking facilities, but
housing associations are keen to raise long-term institutional cash.
Yesterday's issue was made by Haco, a joint venture company set up by the
nine housing associations. Similar vehicles have been used by smaller
brewery companies and investment trusts to raise funds from the bond market.
The bonds pay a semi-annual coupon of 10 5/8 per cent and were priced to
yield 173 basis points more than long-dated UK government paper. Most of the
paper was placed with UK institutional investors, although only a small
number of institutions are active in the sector. Bankers estimated that
yesterday's issue was bought by 25 to 30 life insurance companies and
pension funds.
Previous bond issues have been made through The Housing Finance Corporation
(THFC), which was set up with the backing of the sector regulator, the
Housing Corporation, and the National Association of Housing Associations.
THFC has raised Pounds 300m through fixed-rate and index-linked bond issues.
The bonds are secured on the assets of the nine associations, with interest
payments covered by rental income. The nine must maintain interest cover of
125 per cent.

AMERICAN Brands, the tobacco and consumer products conglomerate, reported an
8.7 per cent increase in second-quarter profits to Dollars 202.6m after tax,
writes Nikki Tait.
Total revenues rose by 10.5 per cent to Dollars 3.25bn, and net profits for
the first six months of the year were up by 11.3 per cent to Dollars 447.8m.
Mr William Alley, the company's chairman, conceded the economic environment
had been tough, and price competition had intensified 'in almost every
market'.
Operating profit from tobacco, the largest single division, increased by 7.2
per cent in the second quarter, to Dollars 231.2m, while life insurance
profits were up by 15.9 per cent to Dollars 42.9m.
The drinks side saw the largest profits rise, up 35.3 per cent at Dollars
44.5m, but this partly reflected the acquisition of seven spirit brands from
Canada's Seagram in 1991.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANC ONE, the expansionist Ohio-based commercial banking group, has acquired
an Illinois-based bank in a stock deal valued at about Dollars 125m. In a
separate deal it said it was joining forces with three other regional
banking companies to form an electronic payment services company.
Banc One will form a new company, Electronic Payment Services, in a joint
venture with CoreStates Financial, PNC Financial and Society Corporation.
It said the new company will be the largest US processor of automated teller
machine transactions, with about 20 per cent of the national switched
volume. The new company will also be a leading provider of electronic
point-of-sale transaction process services.
Banc One said the new company will process about 1bn annual ATM
transactions, with core markets in the Middle Atlantic and Midwest regions.
Its annual revenue will be more than Dollars 200m.
The four banking groups will all be equity partners in the company. The
joint venture will not have a material effect on the financial statements of
Banc One, PNC and Society. CoreStates will realise a gain of about Dollars
23m and a rise of Dollars 100m in its tangible equity.
Banc One's merger with Illinois-based First Community Bancorp will not be
completed until the first half of 1993. It is structured as a tax-free
reorganisation and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.
The terms of the deal are based on Banc One's common stock price. If the
market value of Banc One's stock is between Dollars 47 and Dollars 51 a
share, the exchange rate will result in a market equivalent value of Dollars

GIO Australia Holdings, the recently privatised insurance group, is expected
to trade at a small premium when the shares are listed on the Australian
stock exchange today.
Brokers said GIO, formerly owned by the state government of New South Wales,
would probably trade at a premium of about 20 cents to the flotation price
of ADollars 2.40.
Brokers had earlier suggested the shares would list at up to ADollars 2.90,
but forecasts have been reduced in line with general weakness in the
Australian market.
The ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 890bn) flotation, the biggest privatisation in
Australia, closed ADollars 1bn oversubscribed just 36 hours after it opened.
More than 75 per cent of the 500m shares were sold to small investors in
parcels of less than 5,000.
GIO is expected to announce that it is to acquire SIO, formerly the state
insurance office of Victoria, being sold by the state government.
Southern Cross Airlines, which hopes to resurrect Compass Airlines next
month, is expected to begin trading today at a discount to its flotation
price of ADollars 0.50.
The ADollars 50m Southern Cross flotation was 46 per cent undersubscribed,
mainly because of worries about competition among airlines following
deregulation of the domestic aviation market in October 1990.
Compass, which has been acquired by Southern Cross, collapsed in December
after losing a fare-cutting battle with government-owned Australian Airlines
and Ansett Australia, owned by TNT and News Corporation.
The relaunched Compass plans to concentrate on high frequency routes on
Australia's eastern seaboard, initially using a fleet of five 142-seat MD-80
aircraft flying between six cities.
Southern Cross has forecast a net loss of ADollars 7.75m for 1992-93,
followed by a net profit of ADollars 13.23m in the following year.

McCARTHY, South Africa's largest car sales group, and Prefcor, a mass-market
retailer, are joining forces.
The newly-merged group, McCarthy Prefcor, will have annual turnover of
R4.5bn (Dollars 1.63bn) and a market capitalisation of R900m. McCarthy is
acquiring Prefhold through issue of its paper. It will then sell some
Prefhold subsidiaries.
McCarthy, a mature business, is seeking diversification. It is joining
Prefhold, a young group, to benefit from prospects in consumer durables and
clothing.
McCarthy, in which Anglo-American holds 37 per cent, is a doyen of South
Africa's business establishment. It contrasts dramatically with Prefhold,
which has a more informal management ethos.
The deal also breaks new ground for Anglo because it offers it exposure to
mass-market retailing.
Anglo and its industrial arm, Amic, hold 37 per cent of McCarthy. After the
merger, this stake will be reduced to between 20 and 27 per cent, depending
on the degree of acceptance of McCarthy's offer to Prefhold.
Mr Brian McCarthy will be chairman of the enlarged group.

ANHEUSER-Busch, the biggest brewer in the US, yesterday reported
second-quarter profits of Dollars 317.2m, up from Dollars 286.7m in the same
period a year earlier. Earnings per share increased from 99 cents to Dollars
1.09 on a fully-diluted basis.
Anheuser scored the increase on sales of Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars
3.26bn in the second quarter of 1991. This takes sales for the first half of
1992 to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 6.18bn, and after-tax profits to Dollars
541.2m, against Dollars 487.6m.
The St Louis-based company said its second-quarter results reflected higher
profits from all its main business units and lower financing costs.
It acknowledged that economic recovery was proceeding at 'moderate pace,'
and that this was dampening volume growth, but said it was optimistic of
'another good year'.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has partially re-nationalised its flag carrier, Aerolneas
Argentinas, 21 months after it sold the company to a group of local and
Spanish investors led by Iberia, Spain's national airline.
The collapse of Argentina's first big privatisation is a blow to the
government's ambitious programme, under which it plans to sell nearly all
its state companies by December.
The government was forced to raise its holding in Aerolneas to 33 per cent
from 5 per cent because local minority investors were unable to inject fresh
funds into the loss-making company.
However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said Iberia would continue
managing the airline. He said the state hoped to sell its Aerolneas shares
as soon as is advisable.
Iberia's 30 per cent holding, the 19 per cent held by Spanish banks, and the
10 per cent owned by the employees remains unaltered.
The government raised its stake at the expense of the minority Argentine
investors, whose holdings have fallen to 8 per cent. It will not pay for the
shares.
Instead, the government cancelled Dollars 21.7m in debts still owed to it by
the buyers. It is expected to subscribe over Dollars 145m worth of new
shares during the year.
The re-nationalisation of Aerolneas is the latest chapter in a saga of
disputes between the government and the airline's new owners, and between
the consortium that began even before the ink had dried on the sale
contract.
The disputes arose from the inability of the under-capitalised Argentine
investors to finance the loss-making company. The government and the
operators also argued over the terms and price to be paid for the company.
According to its initial financial accounts, Aerolneas lost Dollars 25.8m in
its first seven months under Iberia's management. The government has agreed
to Iberia's request to review a mandatory Dollars 684m, five-year investment
programme.

BENETTON, the Italian clothing group, suffered an unexpected blow yesterday
with the announcement that Mr Emilio Fossati is to step down as managing
director. The news triggered a slump in the share price to L10,788 from
L11,320 on Tuesday.
Benetton, which is controlled by four members of the founding family, has
had some difficulty retaining senior executives from outside the immediate
family circle. In 1990, Mr Aldo Palmeri, a former Bank of Italy official and
Mr Fossati's immediate predecessor, left the company for a top job at
Citibank in Milan.
Mr Fossati, a former managing director of the Mondadori publishing group, is
to begin a new career as an entrepreneur. He will remain on Benetton's board
until 1994. His functions as managing director will be taken up by Mr
Gilberto Benetton, the chairman, pending the appointment of a successor.
Mr Giuseppe Bruno, for eight years in charge of the London branch of Credito
Italiano and most recently the head of the bank's domestic and foreign
markets division, has been appointed joint managing director.

<TEXT>
TOTAL operating profits at South Korea's 21 commercial banks rose 39.1 per
cent to Won1,128bn (Dollars 1.43bn) during the first half of 1992. Net
profits, however, increased by only 9.9 per cent to Won332bn, according to
the country's Office of Bank Supervision.
The slower growth in net profits was blamed on appraisal losses on
securities due to the slump in the Seoul bourse, as well as increased
loan-loss provisions as bankruptcies rose 66 per cent to a record level.
The six main commercial banks - Cho Hung, Commercial Bank, Korea First,
Hanil, Bank of Seoul and Korea Exchange - reported total net profits of
Won133.6bn, an increase of 2.2 per cent. They have larger securities
holdings than the provincial banks and a bigger exposure in corporate
lending.
Operating profits among the six main banks rose 51.1 per cent to Won712.1bn.
The sharp rise in operating earnings reflected the big interest rate margins
enjoyed by Korean banks. The interest rate margin is around 4.5 per cent
compared with 2.3 per cent for US banks and 1.9 per cent for Japanese banks.
Although interest rate margins on short-term funds have expanded due to
recent financial deregulation measures, controls remain on other interest
rates.
Total interest income rose 34.1 per cent to Won1,440.7bn. Non-interest
income, including premiums and foreign exchange gains, increased by 20.2 per
cent to Won543.9bn.
Cost grew at slower pace than income, up 24.7 per cent.
Korea First Bank had the highest operating profits at Won139.9bn, an
increase of 59.9 per cent. It also reported the largest increase in net
profits among the main commercial banks, with a rise of 112.6 per cent to
Won45.7bn.
Hanil had the largest net profits at Won48.3bn, an increase of 3.6 per cent.
It ranked second in terms of operating profit at Won130.3, a rise of 36.9
per cent.
Cho Hung reported a 34.9 per cent increase in operating profits to
Won124.8bn, but net profits fell 58.7 per cent to Won12.6bn, the steepest
decline among the main banks.
Korea Exchange had the highest increase in operating profits among the main
banks, with a 107.5 per cent rise to Won124.1bn. Net earnings rose 40.3 per
cent to Won10.1bn.
Commercial Bank had a 46.5 per cent increase in operating profits to
Won108.3bn, but net earnings fell 15.6 per cent to Won12.4bn.
The Bank of Seoul suffered a 55.9 per cent drop in net earnings to Won4.5bn,
although operating profit rose by 35.5 per cent to Won84.7bn.
Shinhan, a Seoul-based bank, was the most profitable in the country with net
earnings of Won65.8, an increase of 7.3 per cent. It also had the second
highest operating profits at Won130.5bn, a rise of 48.5 per cent.
SOUTH Korea's three largest consumer electronics groups reported mixed sales
results for the first five months of 1992, writes John Burton.
Samsung Electronics, the biggest electronics concern, achieved a 2.1 per
cent rise in turnover to Won709bn (Dollars 902.6m).
It said sales of colour TVs and audio systems rose 8 per cent, while demand
for VCRs slid 16.4 per cent.
Sales of air conditioners also plunged 50.5 per cent. This was due to a
government campaign to discourage their use in order to save electricity and
reduce the country's oil import bill.
Goldstar unveiled a 3.5 per cent drop in sales to Won507.5bn due to lower
demand for VCRs, washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners. Sales
of audio systems, however, rose 11 per cent, while microwave oven sales rose
29 per cent.
Daewoo reported a 21 per cent jump in sales to Won302.3bn. The introduction
of a new 'air bubble' washing machine resulted in a 172 per cent increase in
washing machine sales, to Won53.5bn. Colour TV sales rose 85 per cent to
Won42.7bn.

<TEXT>
CHEMICAL BANKING, the third biggest US bank formed recently by the merger of
Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, unveiled a 30 per cent rise
in second-quarter net profits to Dollars 240m.
For the first six months of 1992 the net income was Dollars 500m, up by 37
per cent year-on-year.
These are the first quarterly results from Chemical since the merger was
formally completed last month, and the comparative 1991 figures cited
represent a pooling of the two precursor banks. Combined total assets are
now Dollars 142bn.
Earnings per share in the second quarter were unchanged year-on-year at 83
cents, while the net income per share for the first six months was Dollars
1.83, against Dollars 1.67 in the first half of 1991.
The earnings per share figures are affected, however, by the fact that the
bank sold 57.5m new shares last January, in an issue that raised Dollars
1.5bn.
Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman, said the bank's earnings momentum continued
in the second quarter, with strong results in most businesses. He said
pre-tax earnings were 72 per cent improved year-on-year and the results were
achieved against the backdrop of high bad-debt provisions and loan
write-offs.
Net interest income in the second quarter improved 14 per cent at Dollars
1.1bn, while non-interest revenues were Dollars 744m, up from Dollars 713m a
year ago.
Bad debt provisions were Dollars 345m in the second quarter, compared with
Dollars 303m a year ago and Dollars 375m in the first quarter of 1992. Mr
McGillicuddy said the provision level would decline during the rest of the
year.
Non-performing assets were Dollars 6.56bn at the end of June, about the same
level as a year ago and more than Dollars 300m higher than the level at the
end of March 1992.
Commercial loan write-offs during the quarter amounted to Dollars 345m, up
from Dollars 273m a year ago. If less-developed-country write-offs are
added, the figures rise to Dollars 398m, against Dollars 759m a year ago.
Total staff at the end of last month was 39,974, down by 4,528 since the
merger was first announced last July.
The bank said its cost saving plan was proceeding ahead of schedule, with
expected annual savings of Dollars 280m by year-end, up from the original
target of Dollars 225m.
It said it was well on its way to exceeding the annual Dollars 750m savings
by 1995, projected at the time of the merger.

FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Outlook for US property market
remains bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm, concludes in a gloomy study of the
US property market that it will take about 12 years to absorb all the vacant
office space across the country.
The study reveals 'a nation that is awash in vacancies' and says there is
ample justification for the bearish state of the development and
construction industries.
The survey reports there are 62 sq ft of empty office space for every US
office worker and close to 52 sq ft of unoccupied shop floor for every
industrial worker.
Across the US, Coopers &amp; Lybrand says 1m hotel rooms a day are unfilled and
the equivalent of 3,800 shopping centres stand idle.
'These numbers indicate just how pervasive and enduring a problem was caused
by the massive overbuilding of the last decade,' said Mr Bjorn Hanson,
chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's national property division.
The report summarises significant land uses throughout the country across
property types, and it charts inventories, vacancy rates and the outlook.
The worst surfeit of space is among office properties, where the national
vacancy rate now exceeds 19 per cent.
Absorption of vacant office space will take at least 12 years and even under
the most optimistic scenario, Coopers &amp; Lybrand forecasts it will be 1999
before there is a return to traditional rate of vacancy.
The hotel segment is about four years away from its normal supply-demand
equilibrium, in spite of the fact that its vacancy level of 38.7 per cent is
only running at 4.7 percentage points above the traditional rate.
On the industrial side, the survey concludes it will take three years to
shave the segment's 9.7 per cent vacancy rate back to more traditional
levels of 5 per cent to 7 per cent.
An economic recovery would do little to help the retail segment, where the
study notes it would take at least three years to fill enough empty stores
to bring double-digit vacancies back to a normal range.
By far the brightest spot on the horizon for the property market is on the
residential side, where Coopers &amp; Lybrand finds potential tenants and owners
at least outnumber the available housing stock.
Single-family and apartment occupancy could return to normal within a year
if consumer confidence continues to recover, the study says.

<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in zinc prices helped push Cominco, the Canadian base metals
and fertiliser producer, back into the black in the second quarter.
Earnings were CDollars 18.1m, (USDollars 15m), or 22 cents a share, up from
CDollars 7.3m, or eight cents a share, a year earlier. The company suffered
a CDollars 4.9m loss in the first quarter of 1992.
Sales rose to CDollars 416.6m from CDollars 386.1m.
The zinc price was about 20 per cent higher in the second quarter than a
year earlier. In spite of a fall in prices for other metals, sales volumes
of lead and nickel climbed substantially. Operating profit from mining and
minerals climbed to CDollars 146.1m from CDollars 132m.
Fertiliser volumes were higher, but were offset by a continued slide in
prices. Operating profit from fertilisers advanced to CDollars 22.4m from
CDollars 18.1m.
Cominco confirmed that a decision on the future of its troubled lead smelter
at Trail, British Columbia, has been delayed until late this year or early
1993. The company said its Quebrada Bianca project in Chile was scheduled to
be brought on stream in mid-1994.
Rio Algom, a diversified Canadian mining group formerly 51 per cent
controlled by RTZ, recorded higher second-quarter earnings with better
potash and copper results and a more favourable exchange rate. But
performance of its uranium, coal and metals distribution units weakened.
Profits were CDollars 8.2m, or 17 cents a share, against CDollars 6.4m, or
13 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 264m against CDollars 267m.
First-half earnings dipped to CDollars 13m, or 27 cents a share, from
CDollars 20.4m, or 44 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 507m
against CDollars 540m.
The 1992 period included a special loss of CDollars 5.8m by its Nova Scotia
tin mining operation recently shut down. Also uranium, metals distribution
and investment income was lower. Earlier this month RTZ completed the sale
of its 51.5 per cent interest for CDollars 362m through a secondary
offering.

UNION PACIFIC, the US transportation company, yesterday reported a 35 per

The advance lifted net profits for the first months to Dollars 351m,
compared with Dollars 286m in the same period of 1991.
At the operating level, Union Pacific's second-quarter figures improved more
modestly - profits were up 15 per cent at Dollars 376m - but the company
said there had been 'strong gains' in all its businesses.
The railroad division pushed up earnings by almost 9 per cent at Dollars
158m and, despite a two-day shutdown in June, car loadings rose by 2 per
cent.
The strongest growth, said the company, came from cars, metals and minerals
and grain.
Union Pacific shares rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 on the news.

SULZER Brothers, the Swiss engineering group, reported a 2 per cent
improvement in orders to SFr3.3bn (Dollars 2.5bn) for the first half and
forecast a recovery of profits for the full year to the level achieved in
1990.
Order intake at Sulzer Ruti, the textile machinery subsidiary whose severe
losses dragged down group profits last year, has grown 25 per cent mainly
due to demand from the Middle East and China.
Sulzer Infra, the plant and building services subsidiary, reported a 9 per
cent rise in orders, two thirds of which were due to acquisitions. Demand
for Sulzermedica orthopaedic and cardiovascular implants grew by 16 per
cent.
The Escher Wyss business had a 6 per cent rise in orders as bookings for
hydroelectric plant, pumps and thermal turbo-machinery more than offset
declining demand for papermaking machinery.
The 28 per cent decline in orders at the Wintherthur group came after record
orders last year for locomotives.
Sulzer said it expected the overall positive order trend to continue in the
second half. It was confident the reduction of losses at Ruti and the
progress at other divisions would enable the group to regain the profit
level achieved in 1990.
Last year's net consolidated income fell 23 per cent to SFr119m from SFr155m
in 1990.

HOESCH, the German steel and engineering company soon to be absorbed by the
Krupp group, yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in profits for the
first half of 1992.
The company, which gave no further details, also confirmed that Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, chairman, is to resign at the end of this month.
The improvement suggests the steel market is enjoying at least a partial
recovery from the price slump which was the main cause of a 66 per cent drop
in profits in the first six months of 1991.
The announcement indicates earnings of around DM196m (Dollars 132.4m) for
the first six months of 1992, against DM140m in the comparable part of 1991
and DM412m in 1990.
Further information is expected at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on
July 27, when final formalities of the takeover by Krupp will be approved.
The assembly follows the regular annual meeting last month which overturned
a voting rights limit, introduced into the group's constitution supposedly
to protect Hoesch from predators, but which proved ineffective against
Krupp's determined assault.
Mr Neukirchen, who took charge at Hoesch in August 1991, first threatened to
resign last October when Krupp announced it had bought 24.9 per cent of
Hoesch's stock.
Mr Neukirchen, who had been negotiating over possible 'collaboration' with
Krupp, unaware of the buying operation, said he would quit if Hoesch lost
its independence. Krupp has since enlarged its stake to 62 per cent.
The merger of the two businesses, which is to be backdated to January 1,
will be effectively complete after next week's meeting. The new group, to be
called Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch Krupp, will have annual sales of around DM30bn
and employ almost 100,000.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Balancing the steps taken to restore
profits - The recent gloomy results of West Midlands industrial groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERSON International will this week write its own epitaph on a gloomy
reporting season for industrial groups based in the West Midlands -
traditionally the geographical heart of British manufacturing.
Doubtless there will be promises of future profitability after
reorganisation and report of a first half loss. To some extent, therefore,
Verson will be typical.
This month, nine other small and medium-sized quoted industrial groups -
Brasway, Bromsgrove Industries, Hampson Industries, Newman Tonks, Transfer
Technology, Triplex Lloyd, Victoria Carpet, Wheway and Wyko - have published
figures.
They represent a cross-section of industry with activities running from
carpets and architectural hardware to environmental engineering and foundry
products.
However, all except Brasway and Transfer Technology reported falls in their
pre-tax profits and Wheway sank into losses.
In different and limited ways Brasway and Transfer Technology offer a guide
to the future. Brasway came, as Mr Mark Swaby, chairman, noted, from a very
low base point: its tube operations saw the downward spiral earlier than
most industrial groups.
'We had the pain earlier, we took earlier action,' he said.
For its part, Transfer Technology is dependent on export markets and thus
shielded to a degree from the UK recession.
But while this former Maxwell company may gather strength from its diversity
of markets, its 1992 shape is different from its first half 1991 structure,
making growth comparisons difficult.
Against the background of receding profits, it is not surprising that the
market has turned a jaundiced eye on engineering companies.
All of the recently reporting companies, except Transfer Technology, had
been trading at or near to the bottom of their 1992 range even before more
general uncertainty swept the Stock Exchange at the end of last week.
Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based broker, says p/e ratios of engineering
companies are high 'because of low profitability. But relative dividend
yields are, by historic standards, low. This coupled with the failure of the
UK economy to 'follow through' after the general election, has caused the
sector to have something of a relapse over the last two months'.
Sensitive to the market, however, all the recently reporting companies -
despite their cost and trading problems - have maintained or increased their
dividends, sometimes dipping into reserves to do so.
Yet the market is now forced to make a fine calculation. It has to balance
the steps which the companies have been taking to restore profitability
against an estimate of how far, if at all, trading conditions are likely to
improve.
Although Mr John Bettinson, chairman of Victoria Carpet, could claim this
week that 'to a large extent we have avoided redundancies,' this is not the
case with other recently reporting West Midlands-based groups.
Seven of the nine have disposed of businesses or closed capacity or taken
job losses, or, indeed, done all three.
Cost-cutting in an effort to raise productivity and ward off margin pressure
has been endemic. At the same time, all the companies with the exception of
Triplex Lloyd have either kept gearing static or reduced it.
'Although interest rates have fallen, there is little sign of them coming
down further, and, with the widening of the margins of the banks, nobody
wants to be extended on borrowing,' observed Mr Chris Clayton, finance
director of Hampson Industries.
Triplex Lloyd, however, where borrowing is linked to expansion, feels
comfortable with gearing raised over its last financial year from 38 per
cent to 45 per cent.
There is some evidence that the cost-cutting, where it has been allied to
investment, has put companies in the position where they can increase
profitability even if trading conditions do not improve. It has already been
the case at Brasway. It is likely to be the case at Wyko, for example, which
has rationalised its components distribution branch network. Triplex Lloyd
reported significant margin improvement in both its automotive and power
divisions.
In stock market terms this phenomenon is more encouraging than the trading
prospects. It is now clear that, across the board, the rise in UK demand
during the second quarter and particularly in April simply faded away.
'There is noticeably less optimism generally than was the case during the
late spring,' Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the Engineering
Employers Federation West Midlands, said yesterday.
Although, last week, the West Midlands regional council of the Confederation
of British Industry reported that export demand was holding up, the
international scene remains problematic.
All of the nine have international interests, reflecting the now accepted
nostrum that, to survive, Midlands industrial groups cannot depend on the UK
market.
But Wheway, the environmental engineer, reported that although demand had
been good in the US and Scandinavia it had been poor in Australia. Newman
Tonks, the architectural hardware group, found its European sales profits
had been dropping. Bromsgrove Industries has found lower European demand. On
the other hand Transfer Technology found that sales were holding up well in
south-east Asia.
Given the trading uncertainties, industrial activity will probably remain at
a low level.
Midlands Electricity, as good an indicator as most, is predicting a 0.5 per
cent rise in industrial sales of electricity this year. This points also to
further cost-cutting and the reduction of capacity for large and smaller
groups alike.
Indeed, in recent weeks British Steel, Chubb, the Racal locks subsidiary,
Glynwed, the engineering group, Grasshopper, the privately-owned babywear
group, and United Engineering Steels have all announced further job losses
in their West Midlands operations.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Rubicon moves into black with Pounds
822,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW management of Rubicon Group, the shopfitter formerly known as
Courtney Pope, yesterday reported an Pounds 822,000 move back into the black
at the pre-tax level for the year to May 31.
The shares responded with a 28p rise to 131p before settling at 125p.
The 1990-91 deficit amounted to Pounds 8.9m and included an exceptional
provision of Pounds 6.87m for losses and closure costs of discontinued
activities.
Turnover totalled Pounds 15m (Pounds 47m) and earnings per share of 30.4p
compared with previous losses of 568.2p.
The company underwent a capital restructure in April and ended 1991-92 with
a 'strong balance sheet and a positive cash position.'
Shareholders' funds of Pounds 2.4m compared with a previous deficit of
Pounds 4.2m and net current assets of Pounds 1.3m compared with liabilities
of Pounds 6.5m.
Future prospects were described as 'encouraging'. The company's strong
capital base had put it 'in a position to benefit from growth
opportunities'.
The directors have approved payment of the preference dividend, together
with arrears.
Subject to 'satisfactory trading results in the forthcoming year' they
expected to resume ordinary dividend payments at the interim stage.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Border shows 40% advance to Pounds 1.22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 40 per cent advance in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 866,000 to Pounds
1.22m, was announced by Border Television, the USM-quoted regional operator
based in Cumbria, for the year to April 30.
The result was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 11.8m -
principally due to reduced programme sales of Pounds 732,000(Pounds 1.55m)
following ITV network changes. Advertising sales, however, improved by 1.5
per cent, a 'creditable performance in depressed conditions,' the company
said.
The outcome reflected cost controls and an emphasis on conserving cash
resources. The cost reduction programme would continue, the company said.
Earnings per share improved to 7.6p (6p) and the proposed final dividend of
1.6p lifts the total to 2.7p (2.1p).
For the remainder of 1992 advertising revenues were expected to achieve at
best marginal growth, directors said. They were confident, however, that
their arrangement in the north for Granada to market and sell its airtime
would be beneficial.
Border has holdings in Radio Borders and South-West Sound in Scotland and
has recently acquired a 30 per cent holding in Morecambe Bay Radio. It is
also part of a consortium bidding for the Carlisle radio franchise.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Doeflex rises 51% and seeks Pounds 1.3m for
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DOEFLEX, a supplier of thermoplastic materials, yesterday unveiled a 51 per
cent rise in interim profits, a Pounds 1.6m cash acquisition and a share
placing and open offer to fund the purchase.
For the six months to June 30 profits rose from Pounds 580,000 to Pounds
876,000 pre-tax from turnover 39 per cent higher at Pounds 12.9m.
The directors said the growth in sales reflected in part the inclusion of
Horizon Industries for the first time. Organic growth was about 11 per cent.
They added that profits have yet to benefit from the inclusion of Horizon -
Doeflex took a 60 per cent stake in the Belgian-based group towards the end
of 1991.
Earnings worked through 53 per cent ahead at 7p (4.57p) and the interim
dividend is lifted from 1.32p to 1.6p.
The acquisition is that of the Iridon technical sheet division of Lawson
Mardon Group UK, primarily funded via a placing of 1.5m ordinary shares with
institutions at 98p apiece to raise Pounds 1.33m net. The balance will be
financed from existing banking facilities.
Ordinary shareholders can apply for the new shares on the basis of one new
share at 98p for every 5.67358 shares held.
Doeflex shares closed 5p higher at 112p.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Menvier-Swain rises to Pounds 6m and cuts
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Menvier-Swain Group, the emergency lighting and fire alarms company,
yesterday reported a 20 per cent profit rise despite continuing recession in
its markets.
Pre-tax profits in the year to end-April rose from Pounds 5.02m to Pounds
6.02m on sales down 11 per cent to Pounds 42.3m. The previous year's figures
included businesses now discontinued.
Earnings per share increased by 24 per cent to 29.2p and a recommended final
dividend of 6.3p gives a total of 9p, up 23 per cent.
The group said it had successfully continued its policy of expanding in
Europe with the most recent acquisition in Greece.
Despite the recession in the UK construction industry the manufacturing
companies had nevertheless managed to maintain profit margins and cut costs
so that pre-tax profits were close to the previous year's levels.
Net debt was reduced from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 2.5m, leading to a 28 per
cent fall in the financing charge to Pounds 660,000.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Expamet shares fall on pay-out cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPAMET International, the building products and security group, yesterday
announced that it will halve its interim 1992 dividend and will probably
'substantially' cut the final distribution.
Mr Jeremy Beasley, chairman, has also brought forward his retirement from
December and is replaced with immediate effect by Mr John Roberts, a
non-executive director.
The announcement was greeted by a 14p fall in the share price to 71p, some
83p below the level prior to the profits warning in June after the discovery
that managers of Brema-Air, the Dutch subsidiary, had inflated profit
figures.
Mr Alex Orr, managing director, said gearing had leapt from 45 per cent to
140 per cent due to a Pounds 4m cash loss and similar reduction in
shareholders' funds resulting from the recent sale of Brema-Air.
The group's bankers have confirmed their support, but have extracted a
commitment that debt will be reduced below Pounds 12m. The banks have
secured their overdraft facilities with charges over Expamet's UK assets.
Expamet said that, the ducting business apart, trading in the rest of the
group remained 'reasonable.' The interim results are due in August and the
board expects pre-tax profits - before the extraordinary loss relating to
Brema-Air - to beat last year's figure.
In addition to the Pounds 4m cash loss, Expamet will also have to show a
Pounds 3.8m write back of goodwill written off the balance sheet when
Brema-Air was acquired in 1988.
Expamet's debt now stands at Pounds 23m, on shareholders' funds of Pounds
16m. Before the Dutch problem, debt was budgeted to rise to Pounds 19m in
June, before declining to Pounds 12m by the year-end.
At the last full-year period, Expamet reported a 43 per cent fall in profits
to Pounds 7.3m on sales of Pounds 141m.
Nevertheless, it maintained its dividend by digging into reserves,
justifying the payment on the grounds that the board believed that the
recession would soon end.
'The extent and the depth of the recession continues to surprise,' Mr Orr
said yesterday. 'We all know we must not go into recession with heavy debt.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Restructured AIM shows 36% rise to Pounds
3.11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIM Group, the maker of aircraft interiors, yesterday reported a 36 per cent
increase in profits as the benefit of orders placed some years ago showed
through.
Pre-tax profits in the year to April 30 rose from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds
3.11m on sales up 9.6 per cent to Pounds 58m. Earnings per share rose 25 per
cent to 13.7p and a recommended final dividend of 5p brings the total to
6.5p, a rise of 18 per cent.
With the sale of its air conditioning contracting division in May, the group
has now returned to its core business of design and manufacture of aircraft
interiors.
The restored fortunes of the group follow last year's debt rescheduling
relating to property loans. Some Pounds 6m now bears no interest charge and
must be repaid only in 1994.
The aviation division increased operating profits by 33 per cent to Pounds
4.43m on sales up 17 per cent at Pounds 43.7m. Mr Jeff Smith, chairman and
chief executive, said the recent high investment in the Derby and Wallisdown
sites had been completed.
Mr Smith said that in spite of the strengths of the group and the results
which were 'bang on target', AIM was dogged by the poor state of aircraft
sales and the mood in the industry. 'Every time they talk of the European
Fighter Aircraft, where we have absolutely no involvement, our share price
goes down 5p,' he said.
Results from contracting were 'disappointing'. Sales fell from Pounds 15.6m
to Pounds 15m but erosion of margins led to a fall from profits of Pounds
383,000 to break even at the operating level. Eastern Electricity bought the
contracting division for Pounds 1.5m more than net book value after the
balance sheet date.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Steady growth seen at BAA airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASSENGER traffic at airports run by BAA is showing a steady recovery from
the depressed levels of 1991, said Mr Brian Smith, chairman, seen above left
talking to Sir John Egan, chief executive, at yesterday's annual meeting.
BAA's passenger traffic should grow between 5 and 8 per cent in the year to
March 1993, representing a 2 per cent improvement on 1990, he said. Over the
longer term, the growth rate should settle down at 4 per cent.
BAA shares rose after the annual meeting, but closed 7p lower at 644p in a
falling stock market.
These figures concealed a 'very depressed' market for UK domestic traffic,
dominated by business travellers, said Mr Smith.
The brightest spot was in long haul travel, where passenger numbers were 8
to 10 per cent higher than two years ago.
Recent deregulation at Heathrow had led to a growing number of airlines that
wanted to use the airport, said Mr Smith. 'Passenger numbers (at Heathrow)
actually grew by 2 per cent in the year ending March 1992.'
On future projects, Mr Smith said that consultations with contractors had
begun on the Pounds 800m fifth terminal at Heathrow, while the preliminary
work had started on the Paddington Station to Heathrow rail link. The rail
service should open in 1997, he said.

FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Warrants offered in Wellcome sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH NEW Court, the securities house, yesterday launched an issue of up to
10m warrants intended for investors buying shares in the Wellcome sale.
The tender offer of shares in the drugs group, which closes tomorrow, is
expected to raise about Pounds 2.6bn for Wellcome Trust, the medical charity
which is reducing its stake in the company from 73.5 per cent to about 35
per cent.
The warrants are designed to protect holders from a sharp underperformance
in Wellcome's shares compared to the FT-SE 100 index in the three months
following the sale.
Last week, in another move to help demand for the Wellcome tender, Barclays
de Zoete Wedd Securites' offered to buy shares in companies to provide
liquidity for potential investors.
Yesterday the book building exercise was thought to be going well, in spite
of the fall in the UK stock market. Wellcome's share price declined by 5p to
829p.
The Smith New Court warrants are priced at 33.6p - roughly 4 per cent of the
Wellcome share price.
They give holders the right to sell Wellcome shares at a 5 per cent discount
to the price Wellcome shares would be if they had moved in line with the
index.
The base price for the Wellcome performance is the issue price, which is
expected to be a few percentage points below the market price.
Thus, if the shares underperform the index by more than 9 per cent from the
issue price, the warrants will have value. Holders can exercise the warrants
at any time during the three-month period up to October 27.
They can either use the warrants to sell the shares, in which case there
will also be a 0.5 per cent charge to cover stamp duty, or take a cash
settlement.
Mr Lenny Barshack, director of derivatives at Smith New Court, said the
warrants would appeal to investors who believed that Wellcome's shares
provided good value but wanted protection against further underperformance.
They could buy Wellcome shares and match them with warrants to minimise the
downside risk.
Wellcome shares have underperformed the FT-SE 100 index by more than 20 per
cent since the sale was announced in early March, partly pushed down by
short sellers. Had the warrants been in issue since June 1989, buyers would
have made money in 8 of the following 35 rolling three-month periods.
The warrants will be listed on the Luxembourg stock exchange and Smith New
Court will make a market in them.

FT  23 JUL 92 / US raises pressure on Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday stepped up pressure on Iraq by warning that it could not
rule out the use of military force if Baghdad continued to defy a team of
United Nations weapons inspectors.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said the US was 'increasingly
concerned' by Iraq's continuing defiance of the UN, and said Baghdad must be
held accountable for 'stonewalling UN inspectors who are trying to identify
and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction'.
US officials have grown increasingly frustrated at President Saddam
Hussein's testing of the UN's determination to enforce the Gulf war
ceasefire resolutions.
The US and its allies have repeatedly threatened military action in the
past, usually forcing Iraq to back down at the last minute. Mr Fitzwater
acknowledged that the US had issued similar warnings, but said the current
stand-off was 'about as serious as any we've faced'.
The warning came as the UN team, which has been barred from entering the
ministry of agriculture in Baghdad, decided to end a 17-day vigil in front
of the building because of fears for its safety.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special commission into Iraq's weapons
programmes, said there were 'fears of violence - either imminent or
unfolding' against the UN team following several days in which it had been
harassed by Iraqi demonstrators.
UN officials insisted that the UN inspectors had not abandoned their demand
to enter the building, but Mr Ekeus admitted that their monitoring had been
'severely weakened'.
He said Iraq had refused to allow a UN helicopter to survey the building,
believed to contain chemical, biological and nuclear-related weapons
materials.
The latest confrontation, which follows a series of attacks on UN troops and
offices in northern Iraq, is encouraging the view among the Gulf war allies
that Mr Saddam has moved beyond the pattern they characterise as 'cheat and
retreat'.
While limited military action against Iraq would be unlikely to attract any
serious domestic US opposition, it would carry political risks by
reinforcing doubts over President George Bush's handling of relations with
Iraq.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spot the odd one out among the following: Booker, Laporte, William Morrison
and British Aerospace. The answer is of course BAe: the others all have a
market value of more than Pounds 800m. The continued plunge of the BAe share
price doubtless owes much to the general shakiness of market sentiment. In
addition, the company is suffering from a hiatus of news in the period of
enforced silence ahead of its interim results. In particular, there is no
word about the sale of the regional aircraft business, while the UK car
market is approaching a supposedly disastrous August.
More fundamentally, the stage is being reached where the market is either
wholly wrong about the stock or the company's continuance in its present
form is open to question. One aspect of the market's worry is self-evident.
At the start of last month, the historic yield was 9.4 per cent. It is now
15.9 per cent. If the market's sums are right, BAe looks set to join that
exclusive band of companies - otherwise mostly in the construction industry
 -to have raised cash from shareholders and blown it before it could be paid
back in the form of dividends the following year.
To justify such a blunder, BAe must argue for a sharp rebound in earnings in
the reasonably foreseeable future. This may require the sale not just of
regional aircraft but of Rover, plus compelling evidence that the defence
business after the EFA still has an attractive future. More fundamentally
again, BAe must convince investors that whatever form it ends up with
possesses industrial logic, rather than representing a job lot of assets
from the privatising days of the 1980s. Come the interims in September, the
new chairman Mr John Cahill will have his work cut out.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While yesterday's further slump in UK equities confirmed that the
post-election rally has been wholly reversed, it was also a reminder that
the market's preoccupations are not primarily domestic at all. Throughout
most of the day the UK market followed the European average, scarcely
pausing to acknowledge that the UK trade and retail sales figures were just
as expected. Yesterday's worst-hit UK stocks were generally those with high
borrowings. But while the UK money market continues to discount a quarter
point rise in interest rates, it is striking that there is no immediate
pressure on sterling within the ERM. The worry is rather that the system's
members are still under general pressure to raise rates in line with
Germany.
More parochially, there is still pressure on UK institutional cash flow from
government funding. But this would not matter if the institutions did not
perceive gilts as inherently more attractive than equities. At the margin,
it would help a lot if the dollar were to revive further and Tokyo were to
stop hitting fresh lows. But it will take more than that for equities to
return to fashion.

The secondary market in bank loans is all well and good when it is confined
to the debt of distant countries such as Argentina and Peru. It is a
different matter when it comes to quoted UK companies. The revelation that a
small amount of Eurotunnel debt has changed hands at a discount of about 30
per cent to its face value may have a significance out of proportion to the
size of the actual deals concerned. Quite apart from the questions it must
raise about the value of the company's shares, banks must also begin to
wonder about the value of the Pounds 4bn or so of loans that the company has
already drawn.
Of course, the secondary market in sovereign loans has never been a perfect
measure of value. In its early stages, particularly, prices fluctuated more
in relation to regulatory factors affecting banks' ability to trade the debt
than to real changes in the creditworthiness of the borrowers. The secondary
market in corporate debt is also beset with technical factors which may make
prices unrepresentative. One could easily imagine, for example, that
Eurotunnel's debt price has fallen victim to a Japanese bank decision to run
down its overseas loan book.
That may provide an excuse for other lenders to relax at this stage. But
Eurotunnel has had to negotiate a waiver on its banking covenants, and the
fact that some of its debt has changed hands at such a large discount adds
to the impression of risk inherent in the project. The textbook conclusion
would be that if the bankers are under water they are already standing on
shareholders' shoulders. There appears even less chance now of lenders
providing additional finance beyond that which is already committed, except
on terms which would be detrimental to the interests of existing equity
investors.

FT  23 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: A gamble on spending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been clear for a while that the foreign exchange and gilts markets
would eventually need reassuring on the trend in government borrowing. The
cabinet duly promised yesterday that previous spending limits for 1993-94
would not be exceeded. Mr Lamont must now be hoping that the autumn spending
round can proceed in an atmosphere of calm.
Whether such hope will prove more tangible than his green shoots of recovery
is another matter. The government does not have much of a record for keeping
to its targets. The task during the next financial year will be all the
harder because growth will be much lower than the 3 per cent originally
expected. Unemployment and other benefits will thus considerably exceed
expectations and some serious cuts in discretionary spending will be needed
if the target is to be met.
The risk to the equity market is that this will be perceived as yet another
blow to recovery prospects. Yesterday's announcement does not undo the
fiscal stimulus implicit in last November's spending plans for the current
year and in the government's various pre-election pledges. But from now on
nervous consumers will be much more aware of the tightness of government
purse strings. If that delays the recovery much longer, spending curbs
designed to support sterling could have the opposite effect as Mr Lamont
comes under yet more pressure to cut short term interest rates.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Financial talking classes lack
credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever a real chance appears of regaining price stability, so-called
opinion formers lose heart and ask: what is wrong with a little inflation?
The worst offenders are the financial talking classes, and it is they rather
than the government that display the main credibility gap.
Most human endeavours fail; but that is no reason for gloating at the
prospect of defeat when there is the best chance of success in more than a
generation. Shakespeare's Henry V said before Agincourt: 'He which hath no
stomach to this fight, let him depart.' If it were a financial battlefield
in Britain, it would be deserted before a shot had been fired.
Saying why inflation is bad is a thankless task: not because the arguments
are weak, but because they are stronger than any one person is able to call
to mind at any one time. They resemble the case for honesty or sanctity of
contract in that they embody far more accumulated human wisdom than any one
person can hope to command. For practical purposes, however, we need only
recall the remark of Eugene Black, an early head of the World Bank, that a
little inflation is like a little pregnancy; it is liable to increase.
Tim Congdon has in the July Gerrard and National Economic Review made a
valiant attempt to give some specific instances of the harm done by
inflation continuing to hover around 2 or 3 per cent per annum. The first is
in the labour market, where the whole iniquitous institution of the annual
pay round is based on the assumption of permanent inflation. The practice
takes up scarce management time and is the most important reason for union
activities.
He also points to the key importance of the interest rate assumption in any
long-term contract. Unpredictable oscillations in inflation between zero and
5 per cent 'would remain a costly nuisance to savers and investors and to
companies and their banks'. High and volatile inflation is not the only
reason for the state of the world banking system - credit sprees followed by
painful contractions occurred under the Gold Standard - but it has made a
powerful contribution.
To my mind, the clinching argument is that there is no long-term trade-off -
in plain English, no true choice - between inflation and unemployment. If
so, we might as well enjoy the benefits of stable prices without an endless
debate on what they are.
Few would deny that there is a transitional cost of reducing inflation in
terms of recession and high unemployment - monetarists, moreover, betray
their most cherished principles when they speak as if the cost could be
avoided by leaving the ERM. There is, however, plenty of casual evidence
that the effort to reduce inflation hits a resistance barrier when any
government tries to go below the creeping rate to which we have become used
even in the better periods since the second world war.
One conspicuous example is the perversity of commercial landlords who insist
on fierce rent increases for small businesses when contracts are
renegotiated because their universe is bounded by the assumption of
continuing substantial inflation.
The desire not to prolong the transitional agony longer than necessary is
one reason for wanting to know when the goal of stable prices has been
achieved. We are not very well served by the Consumer Price Indices, the
British version of which is known as the Retail Prices Index. How ambiguous
the message is from such indicators is shown in the chart.
The headline measure saw an apparent trebling of the inflation rate from 3.3
per cent at the beginning of 1988 to 10.9 per cent in the autumn of 1990,
followed by a collapse to 3.9 per cent this June. If we take off transitory
knock-on influences such as mortgage interest rate changes, the poll tax,
VAT increases and the Gulf-induced fluctuations in petrol prices, we get a
much smoother picture of inflation.
There are other problems today. On a 12-month basis, the underlying rate is
still well above the headline one; on the basis of more recent evidence it
is below it.
The British problem with the RPI is far from unprecedented. Professor Robert
Gordon reminds us of a much worse problem that the US had before 1983.* The
country's Consumer Price Index then made the fatal error of treating
home-owners as if they were all paying an adjustable-rate mortgage.
The distortion reached a maximum in the first quarter of 1980 when the CPI
registered an annual rate of increase close to 18 per cent at a time when
the GNP deflator never exceeded 9.3 per cent. The bad CPI news 'led a
panicked Carter administration to impose temporary credit controls, which in
turn caused a sharp V-shaped recession'. By contrast the Fed, under Paul
Volcker, maintained a steadfast policy throughout 1979-82 that ignored
temporary shifts in the CPI and instead went by the underlying measures.
This episode not only led to a complete revision of the treatment of housing
in the US CPI, but to greater emphasis on alternative measures including a
'core' inflation rate. Gordon says that the surest recipe for transition to
Brazilian-type inflation is an unholy quartet of monetary accommodation,
supply shocks, full indexation of public sector wages and transfer payments,
and 'incorrect inflation measures that allow higher nominal interest rates
and indirect taxes to feed into measured inflation, fuelling the spiral of
higher wages, benefits and prices'. The author recommends an alternative CPI
for policymakers in every country 'that excludes interest rates, indirect
taxes and, optionally, food and energy costs'.
There are, however, even more important long-term problems. Most consumer
price indices try to adjust for quality improvement, but with incomplete
success. The author believes that US consumer durables have been improving
in quality by roughly 1.5 per cent per annum over and above anything
reflected in the CPI. The rate of American inflation is also overstated by
what he calls 'outlet substitution bias', for example a shift in US
retailing to discount chains and other new outlets which is wrongly
perceived as a move down-market. He disputes the frequently expressed view
that there has been no increase in US real wages for 20 years, by
attributing this stagnation to an upward bias in the price index.
For policy purposes we need more up-to-date and better publicised versions
of the underlying inflation indicators, which CPI and RPI measures rarely
are. But as far as the long-term goal is concerned, I doubt if we can do
better than follow the Alan Greenspan test of regarding stable prices as a
state of affairs where inflation no longer plays a significant role in
business calculations. This avoids prejudging the question of exactly which
particular rate needs to be established in which particular index. We shall
know all right when the Greenspan conditions have been established. We still
have a long way to go.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Letter: Psychology and City fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From NIGEL N GRAHAM MAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader, 'From fraud to farce' (July 17), you say, with
reference to the Roskill report's recommendation of trying City fraud cases
before a judge and expert lay assessors (rather than a traditional jury),
that expert assessors, namely 'lawyers, accountants and City practitioners
of one kind or another . . . ' would be less than human if they did not
'identify more closely with City people in the dock than a jury would be
inclined to do'.
I suggest, with respect, that this statement reveals a fundamental
misunderstanding of human psychology.
Expert assessors would, I am convinced, approach this task with a healthy
wish to see the City's reputation upheld and enhanced, tempered (on breaches
of a technical nature) by feelings of 'there for the grace of God . . .'
Their judgment would not be confused by a plethora of facts and issues (to
which they would be no strangers) nor by irrelevancies or special pleading.
They would know what was right and what was wrong, identifying more closely
with what was objectively right than with personalities.
Test the issue this way: if you were a defendant in a City fraud case, would
you (if given the choice) elect for trial by judge and traditional jury or
by judge and expert assessors?
Justice, speed, efficiency and cost-saving dictate that the latter should be
imposed.
I end as you did: 'The government should put the job in hand.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / Letter: Benefits of performance-related pay undermined by
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL ROWLINSON and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The impression given by Michael Smith 'You pays your money . . .' (July
20) is that if they are introduced properly, following his handy check-list,
then individual performance-related pay schemes can overcome the problems
they have encountered up until now. Like so much prescriptive management
literature this assumes that all problems and contradictions can be avoided
by management foresight. Our research in manufacturing companies raises
issues which tend to undermine this view.
First, PRP schemes have run into difficulties because of the recession and
the need for companies to limit pay rises due to profit constraints. This
has exposed the problem for PRP schemes of relating individual objectives to
overall company performance. Individuals may achieve all of their
objectives, show strong commitment and get outstanding performance
appraisals, but due to economic circumstances beyond their control find
their company is in no position to reward such 'good' employees.
Second, in common with many of the culture change programmes put forward by
management consultants, PRP probably requires the type of culture it is
intended to promote to be already in place in order for it to be accepted.
For example, blue collar workers may not be used to the intimacy with their
managers needed between appraisers and appraisees. Many disinterested
commentators doubt whether corporate culture can be managed, but it is least
likely to be changed by anything so prosaic as a payment scheme.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Letter: Dangerous to believe no justification for UK to
leave ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK DENNIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's belief ('Don't look for gurus', July 20) that with
nominal national incomes rising by 5 per cent and earnings by 6.5 per cent
there is no justification to leaving the ERM is wrong and dangerous. Yes,
there is still a big labour market problem in Britain in the sense that
earnings growth should be reduced further, leading to falling real wages
rather than sharply rising unemployment. However, this is a problem that
should largely be attended to directly (ie at the micro level) rather than
via the mechanism of the ERM, especially under current economic conditions.
The twin impact of high real interest rates, which are heading for 7 per
cent as inflation expectations are falling, and massive personal and
corporate debt which is not being reduced with such low inflation, means
that remaining in the ERM could result in irreparable damage to the supply
side of the economy. Potentially, mistakes of the 1930s could be repeated of
deflating in a depression. Low inflation will not guarantee a recovery and
the aim of zero inflation should not be sought.
There are advantages and disadvantages of fixed exchange rate systems and
which are more important depends on the particular economic (as well as
political) situation. For the UK, devaluation and, therefore, in effect
leaving the ERM, is unlikely to be considered before things get much worse -
unless the French referendum is negative - because of the domestic political
implications for Mr Major and Mr Lamont on the UK's consequent isolationism
on Europe and damage to its anti-inflation credibility. Next year, though,
could see the UK economy suffer new problems with growing difficulties over
the financial system and this may result in the UK leaving the ERM
unilaterally, if the failure of Maastricht has not already destroyed the
ERM.
Finally, I agree with Mr Brittan that France should feel more aggrieved than
the UK about the impact of Bundesbank policy on French real interest rates
given its superior inflation performance, but this is hardly the point. The
greater damage to the UK economy means it is crying out for lower interest
rates.

FOR WHOM THE BELLTOLLS: the lessons of Lloyd's of London
By Jonathan Mantle
Sinclair Stevenson, Pounds 18
NIGHTMARE ON LIMESTREET: whatever happened to Lloyd's of London
By Cathy Gunn
Smith Gryphon, Pounds 15.99
Lloyd's of London, Britain's insurance market, faces a crisis of historic
proportions. Record losses have been made, hundreds of Names - the
individuals who stake their personal fortunes on its fortunes - face
financial disaster, and hundreds more are opting to leave the market,
threatening a long-term erosion of the capital base.
The depth of the crisis (and repeated warnings from angry Names that the
market is poised on the brink of meltdown) has attracted media attention.
Jonathan Mantle and Cathy Gunn have written the first two of what promises
to be a steady stream of books on Lloyd's. Neither For Whom The Bell Tolls
nor Nightmare On Lime Street are without their merits.
Gunn's somewhat breathless account has clearly been written at speed. But it
does contain a good assessment of the damage done to Lloyd's by American
asbestos claims, pollution and lawyers, as well as detailed accounts of such
matters as the use of new technology at the Lloyd's market.
Mantle's early pages provide an entertaining history of the Lloyd's market,
full of telling details: the way, for example, that at the end of the second
world war, underwriters 'made a fortune' by selling 'buzz bomb' policies
covering Londoners against death or loss of limb - 'death and spare parts' -
from V1 and V2 rocket bomb attacks. Mantle weaves the history of Lloyd's by
telling the stories of loss-making Names. This is an effective narrative
device, and lends shape and coherence to the account.
But both books contain serious weaknesses. Both have been overtaken by
recent events. Two independent reports into regulation and management at
Lloyd's, which will decisively influence the market's shape, were published
days after Nightmare On Lime Street and For Whom The Bell Tolls appeared in
bookshops.
Though the authors can scarcely be blamed for this, both books have other
shortcomings. For Whom the Bell Tolls is littered with minor factual errors.
At the beginning of the book, Mantle claims that John Julius Angerstein
became chairman of Lloyd's in the 1720s, not the correct year of 1795, and
again, erroneously, that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake produced cargo
rather than fire claims.
Mantle also seems to be unaware of the existence of specialist commercial
insurance and reinsurance companies, repeatedly implying that Lloyd's and
the London market are one and the same thing.
His purportedly 'exclusive' account of the Piper Alpha disaster in July 1988
and the operation of the spiral - the mechanism by which Lloyd's syndicates
and companies reinsured each other's exposure to catastrophe losses - fails
to mention the significant participation - and losses - of reinsurance
companies.
Neither author gets to grips with the central business problems faced by
Lloyd's. Mantle's failure is particularly conspicuous because he tells the
story of Lloyd's problems purely from the vantage point of the worst hit and
most vociferous Names.
While the views of outside Names are accepted on face value and quoted at
length, there is little evidence that Mantle has talked to anybody who works
at Lloyd's. Of the 86 sources listed at the beginning of his book, few, if
any, are active underwriters or brokers.
Not surprisingly, Mantle fails to describe adequately, or to analyse, the
peculiar business structure of the market, in which the relationship between
the Name and the agent is probably a unique form of capitalist association.
Instead he lumps agents, the market, syndicates, and the corporation
together in a catch-all category of the establishment. This elite of greedy
and morally bankrupt insiders collectively conspires to the detriment of
thousands of gullible and defenceless investors, Mantle indicates.
To criticise this approach is not to suggest that the working Names do not,
on average, do better than outsiders, or that all in the Lloyd's garden is
rosy. As a report by a committee headed by Sir David Walker, the outgoing
chairman of the Securities and Investment Board, made clear earlier this
month, insiders 'tended overall to fare better than external Names', though
not 'in general and in most years, on an immodest scale given (their)
inevitably superior market knowledge'.
Sir David's report also contains trenchant criticisms of the way Lloyd's has
conducted its business - poor management by agencies, poor underwriting by
underwriters and inadequate regulation.
But Mantle's obsession with conspiracy blinds him to these serious issues
and lets those responsible off the hook.

THE PRESS Complaints Commission has again failed to cover itself in glory. A
few weeks ago this voluntary body for the self-regulation of the British
press met in haste. It decided in accordance with what it regarded as the
prevailing winds that it had to issue a statement about intrusion into the
private affairs of Princess Diana. A bit of wrist-slapping followed.
Yesterday it met again, this time to talk, so it was said, about privacy -
but not, heaven forfend, about the past few days of media reports and
allegations about Mr David Mellor's private life.
It seems that the prevailing winds have changed. The commission decided that
'in the case of politicians, the public has a right to be informed about
private behaviour which affects or may affect the conduct of public
business.' It thus provided an afternoon delight for the editors of
Britain's tabloids, a quick piece of work that amended clause 4 of the code
of conduct that the commission exists to uphold. A strict reading of the
clause suggests that what has been written about the 'minister for fun' is
outside the code. This presented no difficulty to a commission sorely afraid
of its press-appointed members. It has simply excluded politicians from the
protection of the code.
The remedy for this is to demonstrate that not every quarry falls to the
popular pack. Mr Mellor should stay in office, difficult though this may be
in the light of the daily revelations about his private life and that of his
family. There remains, however, another issue, for which a different remedy
must apply. This is the accusation made by Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of
The Sun, that during the election campaign a cabinet minister telephoned in
a list of names of women with whom, it was falsely alleged, Mr Paddy Ashdown
was involved. This story of an attempted smear is an extremely serious
charge. If Mr MacKenzie has made a sustainable case he should name the
guilty minister - or shut up.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Water market flows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever their misgivings about the way yesterday's decision was reached,
Nestle and BSN have reason to cheer the outcome. For both companies,
approval of the deal opens the way to further expansion in a growing and
immensely profitable business.
Mineral waters have long been popular in much of continental Europe. But in
the past decade, the habit spread rapidly to other countries including the
US, Britain and Japan.
Though recession has dampened growth rates, which were running as high as 15
per cent a year in the late 1980s, industry experts believe consumers'
concerns with health and the quality of tap water still provide plenty of
longer-term potential.
Nestle first entered the market in 1969 by buying a share of the French
Vittel company, of which it acquired full control two years ago. But though
Nestle is the world's biggest producer of chocolate, dairy products and
soluble coffee, it has remained until now a marginal player in mineral
water.
The business requires heavy investments in marketing, making it cheaper and
quicker to grow by acquiring existing brands than by launching new ones.
When Perrier became available earlier this year, it offered Nestle a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to achieve world leadership.
Perrier owns some of the strongest brands in the business. But its
performance has been depressed since a benzene scare savaged its profits two
years ago, while the company has struggled for several years to make a go of
the string of bottled water companies which it acquired in the US.
Under Nestle's ownership, results are expected to recover sharply. There are
substantial savings to be made by combining distribution of water from the
Vittel and Contrexeville springs in eastern France, while Nestle's powerful
marketing and distribution clout should boost Perrier's sales and profits,
particularly in the US.
The scope for improvement is indicated by the operating margins of 20 per
cent or more which BSN has long earned on mineral water. However, Mr Sylvain
Massot, drinks analyst with Morgan Stanley, points out that BSN's impressive
performance masks a problem.
Profits in mineral water depend heavily on being able to keep bottling
plants fully loaded, and BSN's results have been so good partly because
several of its springs are operating close to capacity.
Output of its Badoit water can no longer be increased without risking damage
to the spring, while Evian, BSN's biggest brand, is also expected to hit
production constraints in a few years.
BSN's planned acquisition of Volvic from Nestle will relieve some of the
pressure. Not only is Volvic a firmly established brand, with about 11 per
cent of the French market, but its spring is still operating well below
capacity.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Fiscal struggle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is desperately trying to regain the control over public
finances that it lost in the run-up to the election. That is the most
important point to draw from yesterday's announcement, which confirms last
year's target for the planning total for 1993-94; sets nominal increases of
only around 3 per cent for the following two years; imposes a new top-down
planning procedure; and establishes a committee chaired by the chancellor to
oversee the whole process of expenditure control.
Confirmation of last autumn's target of Pounds 244.5bn for the planning
total for 1993-94 would, if successfully carried through in the forthcoming
expenditure round, at least end the period when successive upward
adjustments had become normal. But without an early and strong economic
recovery, it will not be enough.
Nor, given the 4 per cent real increase between 1992-93 and 1993-94 already
built in to the figures, is it quite as tough as it looks. The new cabinet
committee will have much hard bargaining this year, but that will only be
the start of its problems. Meeting the targets for 1994-95 and 1995-96 will
be still more difficult.
Last year's spending round was a soggy, election-buying affair, which
allowed an increase of Pounds 5.6bn in the government's planning total for
1992-93 and of Pounds 13bn in that for 1993-94. These upward adjustments
were only partly cyclical. Taking a longer perspective, the latest OECD
Economic Outlook argues that there was a structural deterioration of almost
2 percentage points of GDP in the UK's overall fiscal position between 1989
and 1992.
This would have had to stop, in any case. But with the public sector
borrowing requirement likely to exceed 5 per cent of gross domestic product
this year and to be still larger in 1993-94, it has had to stop sooner
rather than later. The most important problem is the lack of economic
growth. Only four months ago the chancellor forecast real GDP growth at 2
per cent between 1991-92 and 1992-93 and 3 1/4 per cent in the following
year. Now there may be no growth this financial year and little next year
too. GDP could thus be considerably smaller than the chancellor hoped, which
would make earlier spending plans correspondingly untenable. In the long run
public spending cannot be allowed to rise faster than GDP.
This is a government which has its back against the fiscal wall and knows
it. It is starting to fight back. But the battle will be very hard and
everything still depends on that elusive recovery.

Both Nestle and Brussels can claim victory from the European Commission's
approval yesterday of the Swiss food company's FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.58bn)
acquisition of Perrier, France's biggest mineral water group. But while
Nestle has cleared an immediate obstacle to one particular deal, Brussels

will have a broad and enduring impact on Europe's industrial landscape.
Although the decision obliges Nestle to sell some of Perrier's businesses,
it can keep those it most wants. As well as Perrier's well-known sparkling
water, they include big brands such as Contrexeville and the French group's
extensive mineral-water interests in the US, which are at least as valuable.
Equally important, Nestle's politically sensitive relationship with BSN,
France's largest food group, remains intact. Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's
chairman, played a pivotal role in helping Nestle defeat a rival bid for
Perrier by the Italian Agnelli family earlier this year. In return, Mr
Helmut Maucher, Nestle's chairman, agreed to sell Volvic, Perrier's
second-largest brand, to BSN.
However, that agreement threatened to scupper the deal, which was challenged
by Brussels on the grounds that it would give Nestle and BSN a duopoly of
the French mineral-water market. Had the Commission's merger watchdogs
insisted that Nestle cancel the Volvic sale, that could have jeopardised the
economics of the takeover and unleashed a political fracas in France.
Indeed, Brussels may be accused of yielding to political expediency by
letting Nestle and BSN off lightly, so as not to rock the boat ahead of
France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September. Even after the
planned disposals, the two companies will together control more than
two-thirds of current French mineral water production.
However, for the Commission, the case sets an important long-term precedent.
For the first time, Brussels has explicitly made clear its intention to
challenge mergers on the grounds that they would create not just a simple
monopoly or dominant position, but an oligopoly, in which several producers
jointly dominate a market.
Competition policy experts agree that this is a landmark development, which
should in theory enable Brussels to apply the two-year-old EC merger
regulation to large cross-border deals in any industry where the number of
competitors is limited. Furthermore, such mergers may be challenged if they
threaten competition in only one country, not the whole EC market.
Some companies believe the result will be heightened regulatory uncertainty,
and at worst severe restrictions on their future expansion.
'I think there will be some very major implications for industries like
oil,' says Mr Stephen Walzer, British Petroleum's manager of international
legal affairs. 'It effectively means that continued expansion by acquisition
is out.'
Mr Derek Ridyard of Nera, an economic consultancy, says the impact will be
felt in any business where high capital costs limit competitive entry. It is
also likely to affect airas food, where many product categories are
dominated by three or four big brands.
Many experts question the legal basis of the Commission's new approach,
pointing out that the EC merger regulation nowhere refers to joint dominance
or oligopoly. 'This is another example of Brussels pushing the boundaries
further than anyone had anticipated from reading the text,' says Mr David
Hall, a partner in Linklaters &amp; Paines, a leading British law firm. Nestle
has angrily accused the Commission of changing the rules in the middle of
the game.
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, insists the approach is
consistent with the merger regulation, and that he is simply bringing EC
policy into line with the practice in countries such as Britain, France,
Germany and the US. In all these countries, he says, regulators can
challenge oligopolies, although only in Germany does legislation explicitly
give them the right to do so.
While this view is widely shared by Sir Leon's colleagues, some are
concerned by his insistence that Brussels approve the buyer of the Perrier
brands which Nestle must sell. In their eyes, this smacks of excessive
interventionism.
What is clear from the growing debate, both within and outside the
Commission, is that EC merger policy is advancing into uncharted territory,
where the guidelines may be defined largely by the success of Brussels'
efforts to test the limits of its powers.
That prospect disturbs competition lawyers. However, many are torn over how
loudly to protest. In practice, they admit that the special Commission task
force responsible for enforcing the merger regulation has so far behaved
with exemplary fairness and pragmatism.
'You may not always get the results you want, but the system is quick, it's
usually definitive and you can talk to the people involved,' says one
lawyer, who contrasts the task force's attitude favourably with the rigid
and doctrinaire approach of EC officials dealing with other aspects of
competition policy.
Indeed, since the regulation took effect, the Commission has so far
investigated in depth only eight of the roughly 100 deals notified to it -
and blocked only one. This was the takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian
aircraft manufacturer, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy.
However, much depends on the attitudes of the individuals in charge of
policy. Sir Leon's current term as competition commissioner expires at the
end of this year, and Mr Colin Overbury is due to retire as head of the
merger task force in the next 12 months. There is no guarantee that their
successors will follow the same line.
Many experts believe these uncertainties increase the need for an objective
review of EC merger policy, to make it more transparent, predictable and
accountable. Under the EC system, that responsibility lies with the European
Court of Justice.
However, the Court's past decisions offer only sketchy guidance on the
oligopoly question, and it has yet to rule on the Commission's
interpretation of the merger regulation.
That is because the Court can only act on specific cases presented to it,
and none of the mergers Brussels has vetted so far has given rise to such a
challenge.
Because Court proceedings are lengthy and expensive, the Commission's powers
may not be clarified until a frustrated acquirer decides formally to contest
them. For the growing number of companies and lawyers who are worried that
EC merger policy is in danger of becoming an unguided weapon, that day
cannot come too soon.

ONE of the best productions I have seen in the past few weeks is The Heiress
at the Richmond Theatre. The stage adaptation of Henry James's masterpiece
of a novel Washington Square, it has an excellent plot and is beautifully
staged. I look forward to seeing it in the West End.
Meanwhile, in Holland Park, Oracle Productions is playing Wycherley's The
Country Wife until the end of next week. This restoration comedy has never
seemed quite as outrageously bawdy as is sometimes claimed, but it has some
very good scenes. On Tuesday, director Peter Benedict was obliged to step in
and play the key part of Pinchwife himself in the absence of Darryle
Forbes-Dawson. He has a wonderfully disgusting leer. Mrs Pinchwife is played
by Nicola Duffet who gets steadily better as the play goes on.
The Holland Park season has grown in stature over the years. Something there
 -whether opera or play - ought to be caught before the season ends on
August 22.
At the Young Vic there is a reminder that Guys and Dolls must be among the
half dozen or so best musicals of all time. It has dialogue, plot and wit as
well as tunes. Precisely because it is so good, it is extremely difficult to
do well and is therefore a little over-ambitious for the Youth Theatre.
Nevertheless, this is a game attempt and worth seeing. There is a fine Sky
Masterson in Ben Caplan. The production, directed by Karen Stephens and
Chris White, runs until August 1.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCHING Irek Mukhamedov on Tuesday night in his debut as a Royal Ballet
Romeo, we could see rather different qualities from those that had made his
reading of the character so memorable with the Bolshoy.
A consummate dance actor, he gave an emotional precision to the sweep of
Grigorovich's dances, when the choreographic vision seemed to me somewhat
generalised. With Kenneth MacMillan's creation, dramatic detail is part of
the fabric of the role, and in exploring this very different approach,
Mukhamedov was no less convincing, and moving. So, in the ball-room, we
first see him still youthfully caught up in his infatuation for Rosaline
(and Mukhamedov asserts, more clearly than any other Romeo I recall in
MacMillan's opening scene, that it is an infatuation).
But his attention turns towards Juliet as she embarks upon her solo, and we
know the flare of his feelings. He is intrigued, then held by her beauty -
he tells Mercutio of his fascination - and when at last the two young people
gaze at each other, we see the lightning strike.
The later progress of the scene, where MacMillan sets the interplay of a new
love amid the social graces and social tensions of the ball, suggests the
blaze (and the subterfuges) of illicit passion, which will explain all that
follows. Mukhamedov plays this superbly well. Moments that have, with other
interpreters, been lightly sketched, achieve a poignant intensity which
reaches the heart of the character. The reading is ardent in everything, and
ardently done.
The action is fired throughout by Mukhamedov. He is not yet at ease with
some of the dance: the lighter accents, the way the choreography makes fluid
phrases, sit somewhat at odds with his heroic and physically dense manner.
But he is everywhere Romeo, from the laughing youth of the first scene to
the agonised man in the tomb whose handling of Juliet's body has a chilling
verismo - we sense the weight of the supposed corpse, and the near hysteria
of this Romeo's feelings for it.
Yet it was in some ways a performance played in isolation. There seemed too
little rapport between Mukhamedov and his Juliet, Viviana Durante. Miss
Durante made an impressive debut in the role two years ago, but on this
occasion her portrayal looked self-contained.
That both artists can flame with mutual passion we know from Manon. On
Tuesday, it was as if Miss Durante were applying brakes to Juliet's headlong
race towards a great love, were holding herself back from Romeo. And
impeccable as was the dancing, a Juliet who does not sweep us along on the
inevitability of her love, is less than Juliet.
There was a sound performance from the company, with Stephen Jefferies a
tremendous Mercutio. He and Mukhamedov are cut, as artists, from the same
cloth: there is no artifice to their playing, only drama vividly felt,
vividly shown.
The Royal Ballet season continues at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden,
until 8 August, with Romeo and Juliet alternating with La Bayadere

NOISES OFF (15) Odeon Haymarket
BEETHOVEN (U) Plaza
UNIVERSAL SOLDIER (18) Odeon Leicester Square
FACT one: stage farces are unfilmable. Fact two: Peter Bogdanovich's
effective directing career ended 20 years ago with Paper Moon. (A pale
shadow of Mr B has since directed things like Mask and Texasville). Fact
three: no film with a cast of Americans affecting British accents can be sat
through without pain.
Fact four: all facts are re-negotiable. Especially in the world of cinema.
Bogdanovich's film of Michael Frayn's play Noises Off is a triumph of
single-minded panache over the awful warnings of those who said it could not
be done.
You cannot, claimed the Jeremiahs, translate to the movie screen a stage
romp about an acting company whose offstage problems - drink, sexual
jealousy, professional rivalry - sabotage the crisp clockwork of the new
farce they are performing on a provincial tour. Called Nothing On, this play
is a precision piece about dropped trousers, French windows and mistaken
identity. But with its cast nightly rending itself apart in the wings, how
can an on-stage comedy of errors survive the offstage one?
Equally, how can any play about play-acting survive the ventilating
processes of film? Yet cinema, as we know, has confounded expectation ever
since the first filmgoer screamed at the sight of a seemingly real
approaching train. Noises Off continues the grand tradition.
It begins as a distant rumble, with stage director Michael Caine puffing
clouds of sotto voce sarcasm through the technical rehearsal: all sticking
doors, misplaced plates of sardines and a drunken Denholm Elliott missing
his cue as the burglar.
The train comes closer in 'Act Two', with a backstage glimpse of rival
thespians Christopher Reeve and John Ritter fighting over the faded favours
of prima attrice Carol Burnett. And it snorts deafeningly into the station
in 'Act Three', as we become the stage audience watching the finished
shambles from the front of stalls.
If I say I laughed till I cried, I have a dreadful fear the words will be
ripped out and stuck on the poster. But I did. Not having seen Frayn's play
on stage, I had been told that it crackled merrily for two acts before
fizzling out in the third.
But on film the third act is the funniest of all. The text of the
play-within-a-play - at this point in the film we know it by heart - is
remodelled by the desperate ad libs of a cast who know the sardines will
never be where they should be, that the burglar will drop his trousers
instead of the lover, that Ritter and Reeve will go on trying to murder each
other on stage, and that Miss Burnett will succeed in murdering the English
language with her portrayal of a cockney maid.
Bogdanovich could have 'opened out' the play - phrase of doom - and included
scenes set in cafes, parks or cheap hotels. Instead he whirls his
camera-crane around the theatre's confined space, magically concentrating
our and the cast's attention.
To prepare the film, he rehearsed them in a real stage production of Noises
Off, which he then exposed to author Frayn. What fine-tuning followed
produced this perfect-pitch movie. Every slammed door is in tune with every
slammed ego, and every cast member is a thing of beauty and a joy forever.
* * * How not to direct slapstick is demonstrated by Beethoven. Hollywood
today believes that the comedy writer's best friend is a dog: see K-9,
Turner And Hooch and company. The theme and variations in each case are the
same. Every time our punctual, smartly dressed hero prepares to do something
which might advance his career or his family's well-being, he encounters a
scirocco of hair, muddy paws and slobbering jaws.
The eponymous St Bernard in Beethoven terrorises air-freshener tycoon
Charles Grodin and his identikit middle-American family. The dog is a large
and 'lovable' nuisance who has escaped from a military experiment
laboratory, where it was meant to provide target practice for a new type of
super-destructive shell. Instead, chez Grodin, the dog becomes a destructive
weapon itself. Farewell the master bedroom; adieu the wall-to-wall
carpeting; and how do you expunge muddy pawprints from a Dollars 360 Gucci
blazer?
Laugh? We wait like locked-in dogs whose noses are pressed to the window for
the first sign of life or human interest coming up the driveway. Wit we have
already despaired of in reel one.
Edmond Dantes and Amy Holden Jones wrote the script, which when not
recycling the same joke about doggy destruction, limps into sub-Disney
sentimental whimsy. Brian Levant directs.
Dogs are part of today's cinematic vogue for anarchic inarticulacy. Reacting
against the yuppie Eighties, with its celebration of chattering
self-advancement, modern movies favour the grunt of the primal animal. Not
just dogs but Dolph Lundgren, hulk extraordinaire. Not just Beethoven the St
Bernard but actor-kickboxer Jean-Claude Van Damme, known as the 'Muscles
from Brussels.'
These two co-star in Universal Soldier, a mentally retarded action thriller
brought to you by the same zeitgeist that created Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Stretchered out of Vietnam after a near-fatal grudge fight, Lundgren and Van
Damme are to be found in present-day Nevada, where they have been
re-stitched as semi-robot commandos and work for what appears to be a
delinquent subsection of the UN.
They go into international crises with all computer systems bleeping and
they can survive knives, grenades and bullets.
One day Mr Van Damme has a twitch of remembered humanity and decides to
escape with a gorgeous TV reporter (Ally Walker). In hot pursuit is Mr
Lundgren, hi-jacking his outfit's hi-tech command tank and destroying as
much of America as he can before passing Go.
This film never even reaches Go. Carolco, the company that gave us 90
million dollars' worth of stunt work in Terminator 2, give us a similar
crash diet here.
Cars and trucks senselessly collide; service stations suspenselessly
explode; and one stomping hulk with a foreign accent is twinned with another
in a duel of guttural grunts.
What price Mr Lundgren's hobby of making necklaces from his enemies' severed
ears? Evolution will soon phase out the human sense of hearing completely if
it has nought to feed on but crashes, bangs and lines like: 'He is a little
mixed up, give him ze serum.'
Revival corner this week is devoted to Peter Pan (U, Odeon West End) and The
Thief Of Baghdad (U, Barbican). Perfect for the summer hols.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Arts: Henze's Montepulciano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER since Hans Werner Henze founded the Montepulciano Cantiere
Internazionale d'Arte in 1976, he has been fighting strenuously to keep
people from calling it a festival.
It is an uphill battle, not least because cantiere resists translation,
though the awkward work-site comes closest. Henze is right. In Montepulciano
there exists a special, fruitful relationship between town and Cantiere. The
audience has little of the glitter of, say, Spoleto. Although there are
sponsors (BMW notably), there are no signs of commercialisation. The youth
of the performers, the presence of students, establishes a campus,
summer-school atmosphere.
And yet, the townspeople and visitors who continue to call this a Festival
are right, too, if by festival is meant special place and time for special
cultural events.
This year's opening work was Paisiello's Re Teodoro in Venezia in a version
devised by Henze himself, scored for a small orchestra made up of students
from the Royal Northern College of Music and a group of young Germans mostly
from Munich.
Paisiello's comic opera is a work of great charm, and Henze's revision
retains all of the comedy, enhances Paisiello's affecting vocal writing, and
adds a good deal of fun on its own.
Henze has allowed himself total freedom, in particular, with the
recitatives, in which the piano plays a preeminent role. The director
Lorenzo Mariani worked closely with Henze, so music and production were
ideally blended.
At the Burgtheater in Vienna, Paisiello must have had a superlative cast for
the premiere of Re Teodoro; true to its tradition, Montepulciano used young
and virtually unknown singers, but what they lacked in vocal expertise they
made up for in verve. Actually,the soprano Patrizia Ciofi, who has only
recently made her debut, is a genuine find: the voice is agile and true, but
not icy. She also possesses a confident stage presence.
The mezzo-soprano, Paola Roman, got up as Marilyn Monroe (or as Madonna got
up as MM), acted with bravado, but her singing was unexciting. The same
could be said of Piero Guarnera, the Teodoro, though he made something
positive of his part. Despite occasionally unintelligible enunciation,
Alessando Svab, as Taddeo, the buffo innkeeper, displayed an appealing voice
and a welcome sense of humour.
The young conductor Giuseppe Mega, a Montepulciano regular, kept stage and
pit together, and his little orchestra played with great style. Mariani's
final gag - a shower of fake money - had the older members of the audience
applauding heartily while the children scrambled around collecting the
banknotes.
For Henze and the performers it may have been a work-site, but for everyone
else it was a festa.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW works are distributed unevenly through this year's Proms. There are nine
premieres promised altogether, and after just five days there have been
first performances of works by James Dillon and Simon Holt, while the next
week or so offers four more, from Tavener, Casken, Bennett and Goehr.
It promises to be a highly varied clutch of novelties, and certainly
expectations were bountifully rewarded on Tuesday, when Holt's viola
concerto was introduced by the indefatigable Nobuko Imai, with the BBC
Philharmonic conducted by Yan Pascal Tortelier.
Borrowing its title from an artwork by Richard Long, walking with the
river's roar takes Holt's development forward in a giant stride. It contains
music of great power and expressive range within a consistently inventive
and highly charged 20-minute span.
The work has had a protracted history; it began life as a piano concerto,
settled down as a piece for viola and orchestra but even then was discarded
and begun again. Along the way it was transmuted into a memorial work, a
tribute to Holt's father who died while he was a teenager, and coloured also
by the death three years ago of Michael Vyner, artistic director of the
London Sinfonietta and one of Holt's most fervent champions.
That sense of loss permeates the score, though never in an explicitly
elegiac way. It emerges more as a scarcely controlled rage in the writing
for the solo viola, whose lines are full of fierce multiple stops and harsh
repetitions, and in the dark, threatening sonorities that cluster about it
from an orchestra which contains no violins or bassoons, as if to leave a
space around the viola.
As the solo sonority teeters on the brink of extinction, threading its way
through the hostile musical landscape, the 'river's roar' perhaps of the
title, it creates a powerful central image, with other figures and details
flitting in and out of focus through the work.
Attention is held unwaveringly by the lines of force between all these
elements and by the sharp originality of Holt's inventions. On first
acquaintance, walking with the river's roar seems a richly endowed work,
which asks searching musical questions of itself, yet answers them all
triumphantly.
On Monday, the premiere of Dillon's ignis noster had been wedged between the
First Symphony of Sibelius and Strauss's Four Last Songs in the BBC Symphony
Orchestra's programme, conducted by Alexander Lazarev. Dillon's title is an
alchemical one, and the idea of transmutation by fire seems to provide the
20-minute piece with its principal, Skryabin-like metaphor, if not with any
detailed programme. The musical argument is essentially abstract, dense and
many-layered, full of accumulations of fierce, rhetorical gestures.
There are few moments of respite, though towards the close the textures
tended to congeal in larger-scale events; ideas are hurled out at a
formidable rate, and tended towards a congested effect, far from the lucid
planning of some of Dillon's most recent instrumental pieces. Whether a less
excitable performance might uncover a clearer structural scheme remains to
be heard.

Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman and chief executive of the Post Office, is to
be the next chairman of Varity Holdings, the UK maker of Massey Ferguson
tractors and Perkins diesel engines. He takes up his new post in January and
will also join the board of Varity Corporation, the US parent.
Sir Bryan, 60, will fill a post which has been vacant since Michael Bird,
Varity's long-serving UK chairman, died last year. Sir Bryan had announced
some time ago that he intended to step down as a full-time chairman and
chief executive of the Post Office when his contract expires in October.
He has already agreed to take on the chairmanship of BUPA, the UK's leading
independent health care organisation, but he had indicated that he would
stay on as a part-time chairman of the Post Office until March 1993. His
decision to take the Varity job will put further pressure on the government
to pick a successor. There is growing speculation that the authorities will
use the opportunity to split the job of chairman and chief executive of the
Post Office, Britain's biggest nationalised industry.
Before joining the PO in 1987, Sir Bryan had been chairman of the Manpower
Services Commission for three years. However, he has spent the bulk of his
career in international business, having started as a Unilever management
trainee in 1955.

Dennis Grove, chairman of North West Water, the former regional water
authority which has had to implement the biggest programme of improvements
in the privatised industry, is to retire next spring; he reaches 65 this
month. He will be succeeded by Sir Desmond Pitcher, the current NWW deputy
chairman who has recently announced his intention to step down as group
chief executive of the Littlewoods pools and retailing group.
Grove, chairman and chief executive of Sonoco Europe and a vice president of
Sonoco International before he became chairman of NWW in 1985, says that the
company will soon be half way through its massive Pounds 5bn capital
spending programme, and that it is a good time to hand the challenge on to
someone who could take it through to completion.
'Sir Desmond is widely experienced in the north west, nationally and
internationally, and is ideally qualified for the job; his business
background has given him the closest practical knowledge of new technology.
As an added bonus he has an intimate knowledge of and commitment to the
north west of England,' Grove says.
Sir Desmond, who will become non-executive vice chairman of Littlewoods when
he ceases to be chief executive next March after 10 years in the job, said
it was time for him to take a different role. 'What could be a more natural
move than to an organisation which is doing more than any other to improve
the environment of north west England?'

ARAB MONETARY FUND v
HASHIM AND OTHERS
Chancery Division: Mr Justice
Hoffmann:
July 14 1992
AN ANTI-suit order restraining a defendant from proceeding in a foreign
country against a witness will not be granted by the English court if it is
unnecessary for the purpose of protecting the court's jurisdiction or
enabling justice to be done in the UK.
Mr Justice Hoffmann so held when refusing an application by the plaintiff,
the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF), for an interlocutory injunction to restrain
the defendants, Dr Jawar Mahmoud Hashim, and his wife and son Jafar, from
prosecuting an action in California against Mr Salah al Hafidh, a former
employee of the AMF.
HIS LORDSHIP said Dr Hashim was director general of the AMF between 1977 and
1982.
The AMF alleged that he defrauded it of more than Dollars 50m. It also
claimed against other defendants including Mrs Hashim and Jafar, on the
grounds that they knowingly assisted Dr Hashim or knowingly received some of
the money.
The writ was issued on December 5 1988. On the same day, the AMF applied for
a world-wide Mareva injunction against Dr Hashim.
The application was supported by a lengthy affirmation by Mr al Hafidh.
Mr al Hafidh was a chartered accountant employed by the AMF as chief
internal auditor, after Dr Hashim had left.
He described in his affirmation how he had found apparent irregularities in
the accounts. Large sums had been paid into accounts controlled by Dr Hashim
in AMF's name. The money had been transferred to Swiss accounts in the name
of Dr Hashim and his wife.
The AMF had requested an independent investigation by Ernst &amp; Whinney, for
whom Mr al Hafidh had worked before joining the AMF.
Their report concluded that there was prima facie evidence of fraud by Dr
Hashim. Together with a report by Swiss experts on what had happened to the
money in the Swiss accounts it formed the basis of the Mareva application.
Similar relief was granted against Mrs Hashim and Jafar.
The trial had been fixed for January 1993.
Mr al Hafidh resigned from the AMF in 1989 and emigrated to California.
In October 1991, Dr and Mrs Hashim and Jafar commenced proceedings against
him in the Los Angeles County Superior Court.
The essence of the complaint was that Mr al Hafidh's affirmation was a false
and malicious invention and part of a conspiracy between him, Ernst &amp;
Whinney and the AMF, to ruin Dr Hashim and his family.
The bedrock of those allegations was the question whether the AMF was right
in saying Dr Hashim stole its money.
If that turned out to be true, the case against Mr al Hafidh would collapse.
That was the question which would be investigated in the English
proceedings.
If the AMF's case failed, the English court would not be concerned to
enquire whether Mr al Hafidh acted in good faith or with malice. He was not
a party to the English action and not subject to the court's jurisdiction.
In those circumstances, the AMF applied for an injunction to restrain Mr
Hashim, his wife and Jafar from prosecuting the Californian action until
after the English trial.
There was no doubt that the court had jurisdiction to grant such an
injunction. The order was not directed to the Californian court but operated
in personam against the respondents as persons subject to the jurisdiction
of the English court. Dr and Mrs Hashim were resident in the UK and Jafar,
though resident in Canada, had submitted to the jurisdiction.
It was well established in the UK, as in the US, that an injunction to
restrain proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction (an 'anti-suit' injunction)
should be granted only in very narrowly restricted circumstances. Generally
speaking, the foreign judge was in the best position to decide whether it
was just and equitable that proceedings in his own court should be stayed or
allowed to proceed.
Such an order would be granted only if prosecution of the foreign
proceedings appeared to be 'vexatious or oppressive'.
Cases in which anti-suit injunctions had been granted or refused showed that
'vexatious or oppressive' had been given a very restrictive interpretation.
They showed that it was not sufficient that the action should be vexatious
or oppressive in the ordinary domestic sense in which such actions might be
struck out. That was a decision which ought properly be left to the court
before which the proceedings were pending.
There had to be some good reason why the decision had to be made here rather
than there.
It might be because there was a conflict of national policy between the UK
and the foreign tribunal. The injunction might be needed to protect the
jurisdiction to prevent a litigant from evading important public policies.
When the question was simply one of justice between litigants, uninfluenced
by differences of national policy, the normal assumption was that the
English court had no superiority over a foreign tribunal in knowing what
justice required.
And there might be cases in which, although there was no overt clash of
national policy, the realities of litigation before the foreign tribunal
might be such as to satisfy the court that justice could be achieved only by
enjoining the foreign suit.
Assuming for the purpose of the application that the AMF action might be
part of a conspiracy to ruin Dr Hashim, and that its case failed and was
shown to be have been a malicious plot to which Mr al Hafidh was party, it
would obviously be unjust to prevent Dr Hashim from afterwards pursuing Mr
al Hafidh in California.
On the other hand if the AMF succeeded in proving its case, it would be an
abuse of the process of the court for Dr Hashim to attempt to relitigate
that question against Mr al Hafidh.
In such a case the court would restrain a collateral attack on its
jurisdiction by the commencement of such proceedings abroad.
At present however, there had been no determination of the merits in the UK
or US.
The AMF claimed that pending trial here the court should grant an injunction
to prevent interference with the jurisdiction by intimidation of a potential
witness.
The question was whether the injunction was necessary to enable justice to
be done here or to safeguard the general jurisdiction of the court.
On that question the following matters were relevant:
First, Mr al Hafidh was not a witness of primary fact. He came on the scene
after Dr Hashim had left, and could only depose as to the result of his
investigations.
Second, when the present proceedings were commenced the AMF was not
intending to call Mr al Hafidh as a witness. He had said he did not want to
come. It was as a result of the Californian action, and possibly financial
assistance, that he changed his mind.
Third, there was nothing to suggest that Dr and Mrs Hashim commenced the
Californian action to dissuade Mr al Hafidh from giving evidence in the UK.
They did not think he would be giving evidence here.
The object seemed to have been to have the opportunity to examine him on
discovery or at trial in Los Angeles.
That might or might not be an abuse of process in California, but did not
constitute an interference with the English proceedings.
The court was not satisfied this fell within the exceptional class of cases
in which an anti-suit injunction was needed to protect the jurisdiction of
the English court.
Whether the Californian proceedings should be stayed or proceed did not
raise any question which could not equally well and more appropriately be
decided in California.
The motion was dismissed.
For the AMF: Charles Flint (Freshfields).
For Mr Hashim: Hugo Page (Landau and Scanlan).

FT  23 JUL 92 / People: Ashcroft answers the call from Betacom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's corporate finance director, has left the board as
part of the company's restructuring.
Ashcroft, 57, explained yesterday that he had resigned in order to pursue
other business interests - in particular as non-executive chairman of
Betacom, the telephone equipment distributor which is 71.3 per cent owned by
Amstrad.
He replaces Roger Rowland who also resigned yesterday; he became chairman
last year following the resignation of the founder, Dennis Baylin.
Amstrad became the majority shareholder in Betacom - which has recently
experienced deteriorating trading conditions, lower sales and higher
customer returns - last week after less than a third of Betacom's recent
Pounds 8.4m rights issue was taken up by other shareholders. The issue was
underwritten by Amstrad, which received Takeover Panel approval to take
control without making a bid.
Ashcroft has considerable experience in the consumer and consumer
electronics industries. He joined Amstrad from Dixons and had previously
worked for Philips, Ford and Ideal Standard.
As Amstrad's corporate finance director he was in charge of the group's City
and banking relations, and acted as troubleshooter in cost control and
inventories. He said yesterday that as chairman of Betacom's independent
board his first task would be to 'steer the company back into profitability
in the UK market'.
Ashcroft, whose departure from the Amstrad board appears to have been
amicable, added that he had decided to leave the Amstrad board and 'try
something else' earlier this year, before the Betacom opportunity opened up.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A slender new look -
The design industry has recut its cloth for leaner times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE WORST is probably over,' says Mark Landini. 'It would be an
exaggeration to say that the design industry is already recovering from the
recession, but there are signs that life is getting easier.'
RSCG:Conran, the retail design consultancy where Landini is joint managing
director, has, like the rest of the UK design industry, undergone a painful
rationalisation over the past two years. Every area of marketing services
has suffered during the recession, but few have been as badly affected as
design.
The design market is still in the doldrums. There is fierce pressure on fees
and intense competition for new business. But the cuts and company closures
seem to be abating. Some consultancies, such as RSCG:Conran, now detect a
slight improvement in prospects. Where does the design industry go from
here? What is the long-term legacy of the recession? And how will it
influence the future of the industry?
The most obvious change is the industry's size. The design business
flourished in the 1980s when companies were able, and willing, to spend
heavily on new corporate logos or lavish retail schemes. But when the
economy weakened, design was one of the first budgets to be cut. The number
of designers employed by the 100 largest consultancies has halved in the
past two years, to 3,800 in 1991, according to Design Week magazine.
The recession has also affected the industry's culture. In the 1980s, design
consultancies seemed bent on imitating advertising agencies, by adopting the
same pyramidical structures and introducing similar functions such as
account management and new business development. Most have since returned to
the old model whereby they are run like architectural practices, with
designers dealing directly with clients, rather than through intermediaries
such as account managers.
Fitch, one of the most marketing-oriented groups in the 1980s, has cut its
staff from 300 to 150 over the past two years with most of the cuts coming
from administrative areas. Two years ago RSCG:Conran employed 150, half of
whom were designers. It now operates as a single-floor studio with 50
employees, including 35 designers who are responsible for new business and
for managing their own projects. This team is augmented by up to 40
freelances at busy periods.
The most resilient companies in the recession have been those that eschewed
the excesses of the 1980s. Pentagram emerged unscathed by maintaining its
original structure, devised in 1972, whereby the eight partners each run
their own design studios but share central overheads. 'A few years ago when
everyone else was expanding we were accused of being dowdy,' says John
McConnell, partner. 'Now we feel vindicated.'
Pentagram is now cited as a role model by younger consultancies such as
Cartlidge Levene, a graphic design company run as a co-operative by five
designers in their late 20s and early 30s. 'We all worked for big groups in
the 1980s and watched them unravel,' says Adam Levene, director. 'Design
isn't suited to a large scale. We've stuck to our guns and kept the company
small so we can be more selective about our work.'
The industry may have shrunk, but the nature of its work is becoming more
complex. Some sectors of the UK market, notably retail design and corporate
identity, are maturing. This means there are not only fewer new projects,
but that the type of work is different.
There is less demand from retailers for new design schemes and store
concepts, but growing interest in merchandising and product development.
Similarly, there are fewer new corporate identity programmes, given that so
many UK groups have already done them, and designers are being hired on a
consultancy basis to implement and adapt existing schemes.
'We need to recruit people with expertise in our new areas and to retrain
existing staff,' says Wally Olins, chairman of Wolff Olins, a leading
identity consultancy. 'The problem is that it has come at a time when we
can't really afford it.'
But these changes should benefit the industry by nurturing longer-term
relationships with clients. One of the problems has been the ad hoc nature
of design projects, which makes consultancies vulnerable to budget cuts when
times get tough.
Another important change is the role of technology. Advances in Cad-Cam,
computer-aided design, have had a dramatic effect on graphic design, where
consultancies can use computers to improve efficiency, but also to fulfil
functions, such as typesetting, which used to be done externally.
Most design companies are investing heavily in technology. Pentagram has
spent Pounds 250,000 since 1990 and Wolff Olins around Pounds 750,000. These
are substantial sums for an industry which has traditionally required very
little capital investment. But the financial benefits are already apparent.
Wolff Olins has been able to dispense with its old pool of up to 30
freelance designers because of Cad-Cam.
Eventually technology could also help to strengthen client relationships.
Wolff Olins and Fitch already have direct computer links to their clients.
At the same time it should accelerate the industry's development in that
only large consultancies can afford the really sophisticated systems needed
for big projects. This may eventually make them less vulnerable to cut-price
competition from small design firms with lower overheads.
This polarisation should be accentuated by the industry's international
expansion. During the recession the large consultancies have found big
projects in other countries, to compensate for the UK downturn. 'Our
international work has kept us alive,' says Rodney Fitch, chairman of Fitch,
which now makes two thirds of its income overseas. 'I hate to think what
would have happened without it.'
International projects are not a panacea. There are logistical problems in
servicing clients in other countries. Even the biggest design groups cannot
afford to maintain large networks of overseas offices. Most prefer to work
from London, sometimes supported by small local operations, although this
involves investment in recruitment and retraining.
Another problem is renumeration. The profitability of international projects
tends to be lower than for domestic work, particularly in continental
Europe. It is also difficult to recoup additional costs such as travel.
'We're still learning how to operate in other countries,' says Wally Olins.
'Most design companies have made a mess of it in the past and it's still not
easy. But we're getting better. We have to. It's essential for the
industry's future.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cheers for the
producers - Cider is breaking away from its rustic image. Now it is aimed at
everyone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S cider industry has kept its sparkle through a recession in which
brewers and distillers have encountered their toughest trading conditions
for decades.
Bulmer, the UK's leading cider maker with a 45 per cent market share, last
week reported a 19 per cent increase in 1991 profits.
Dealing begins today in shares of Taunton Cider, its main rival, with most
analysts forecasting steadily improving profits despite the
less-than-expected splash of its flotation.
Since 1988, cider production has risen nearly 25 per cent. It has poured out
of the niche position it once occupied to become one of the most buoyant
sectors of the UK drinks market.
While beer consumption declined 3.6 per cent last year, cider volumes rose
3.1 per cent to a record 76.8m gallons, worth Pounds 600m in retail sales.
The single most important factor driving this progress is marketing. Cider
sales grew strongly in the late 1970s and early 1980s when it became widely
available on draught in the country's pubs. This distribution-led growth
came to an abrupt end in 1984 when the government increased the rate of
excise duty by 47 per cent.
The first general response of the industry to declining sales was to reduce
advertising. Between 1983 and 1985, cider advertising was cut by a third.
The result was further falls in volume and the growth of own-label ciders.
Recovery began with a marked switch in advertising strategies and the
development of products targeted on specific groups.
For years, most cider advertising focused on traditional rustic images, and
virtually the only product differentiation was between sweet and dry cider.
In 1988, Bulmer increased its marketing expenditure by 70 per cent to Pounds
10m and launched a series of campaigns to revitalise its mainstream brands,
Strongbow and Woodpecker, by giving them a more contemporary lifestyle
image.
Taunton started to push for growth through the development of new products.
The successful introduction of Diamond White, a packaged premium cider, was
followed by Diamond Blush, aimed at women. Red Rock, 'a different kind of
cider' was produced to compete with mainstream lagers. It was less gassy
than normal cider and was quirkily promoted. Taunton's most recent brand,
Brody, is aimed at drinkers of premium lagers.
Gaymers Group (then Showerings) introduced Copperhead, a draught cider, with
advertising that gave it an urban image. It also launched K, a strong
premium brand, to compete with bottled lagers. Merrydown, in contrast,
continued to concentrate on the traditional premium sector it had created
with advertising that concentrated on quality.
Each new move stimulated the industry to further efforts. Taunton responded
to Bulmer's increased advertising by intensifying the promotion of its
best-selling Dry Blackthorn. The company claimed last year to have accounted
for 57 per cent of the industry's total advertising, well ahead of its 33
per cent market share.
Bulmer brought in new products, such as Scrumpy Jack, to compete with
Taunton's new premium products; and it mounted a drive to secure greater
distribution in free trade pubs.
Advertising expenditure by the cider makers last year exceeded that of the
brewers on a pounds per gallon basis.
As a result, the industry has made 'major advances in destroying the image
that it primarily caters to scrumpy swilling bumpkins', says Jean-Marc
Garzon, analyst at Panmure Gordon.
Recent market research by Bulmer confirms the change in consumer perceptions
of cider. It is seen as a more 'natural' drink than beer, more up-to-date
than bitter or stout. Consumers rate mainstream cider brands above rival
lagers on quality; premium ciders compare with premium lagers in the
fashions stakes.
Cider's rapid growth in the last three or four years has been helped by hot
summers, but the survey suggests it no longer depends heavily on favourable
weather.
It has benefited from lower excise duties than beer and the recent defeat of
European Community proposals to link the tax on cider to that on wine was
greeted with relief by the industry. 'But the moves towards a more brand
dominated structure have made cider less price sensitive,' says Jonathan
Goble, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Premium cider brands now sell at around twice the price of standard products
and form the most dynamic sector of the market.
Some scepticism remains about the durability of fashion brands; and the
declining numbers of young drinkers may have its impact.
However, the industry's performance during the past difficult year has
brought optimism.
'Cider is very much in tune with contemporary interest and needs; it appeals
to both men and women across all age groups,' says John Rudgard, Bulmer's
chief executive. 'If we continue to invest in the imaginative marketing of
both mainstream and new brands, there is an opportunity to make another
substantial leap forward. Cider has the credentials to become the drink of
the 1990s.'

FT  23 JUL 92 / Technology: High hopes in the venture stakes - Louise Kehoe
introduces a rare breed of risk takers whose 'can do' attitude is paying off
handsomely / British entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'I JUST love building businesses,' Michael Skok declares. At 'almost 31' he
is a veteran entrepreneur with two successful computer software enterprises
to his name and ambitions to exploit the 'almost limitless opportunities of
the European software market'.
Skok's latest venture is European Software Publishing (ESP), based in
Maidenhead, Berkshire. Formed in 1988, the company licenses personal
computer software products, mostly from US publishers, and markets them in
Europe.
'We recognised a problem and set about building a solution,' says Skok. The
'problem' is the difficulty that many US software companies face when trying
to enter the European market. 'They see the opportunities in Europe, but
they do not have the resources to do it right,' says Skok.
He formed ESP to provide marketing, distribution and customer support
services for selected software products, initially in the UK and now also in
France and Germany. By taking on several software products ESP can achieve
economies of scale that elude most individual software publishers.
'It is a simple idea,' Skok acknowledges, but one that has proven lucrative.
At the end of last year, ESP had monthly retail revenues of Pounds 2m.
Among the first products taken on by ESP were those of Symantec, a
California software house best known for its 'Norton's Utilities' programs.
Having increased Symantec's UK monthly sales 50-fold over a period of three
years, in April ESP sold UK publishing rights for the products back to
Symantec for Pounds 15m in shares.
This year, ESP has signed exclusive UK marketing agreements with two other
US software companies: ON Technology, the company formed in 1987 by Mitch
Kapor, founder of Lotus Development, which specialises in communications
tools for the Apple Macintosh; and Beyond, which publishes an advance
electronic mail system.
Skok describes ESP as a software nursery: 'We provide the environment that
allows good personal computer products to take root and flourish in Europe,'
he says.
An unusual aspect of ESP's strategy is its reliance upon international
alliances. Too many British companies fail to 'think globally' in the early
stages, Skok maintains.
He is also convinced that to be successful software companies need to prove
their products in the US market to establish credibility.
Skok speaks from experience with his first software venture, Skok Systems,
based in Boston, which he co-founded with his brother David. They developed
a computer-aided design and manufacturing system designed to run on
Hewlett-Packard minicomputers and earned the business annual revenues of
Dollars 15m before licensing the program to HP.
He went on to spend two years at Invent, a British venture capital group,
before forming ESP four years ago. While he recognises the opportunities of
the US market, Skok is intent upon building up his British-based company.
'We are combining US software expertise with UK management,' he says.
Yet the UK business environment and culture do not favour entrepreneurial
ventures, he feels. The biggest cultural barrier is a fear of failure. 'The
British school system is highly competitive, but it does not allow for
failure,' he says.
'You have got to be able to take risks, knowing that some of them won't pay
off and that you will learn from things that go wrong,' he adds.
Also lacking in the UK, he suggests, is a 'Can do attitude', a degree of
confidence and enthusiasm for solving problems that is the hallmark of US
entrepreneurs.
However, the European software market is complex, he acknowledges. Attitudes
to software purchases vary widely in different countries. 'The Germans test
every minute feature of a program. In France the user interface is very
important so programs have to look pretty. The UK buyer combines a bit of
both approaches.'
Unlike the US, where corporate software purchases are frequently influenced
by end users who badger their data processing departments into acquiring new
technology, the European market is 'corporate driven', Skok notes. 'The
individual influence isn't there. We don't have technology junkies]'
More seriously, he notes that too few business people 'see it as part of
their job to understand computing'. On the reluctance of senior managers in
Europe to make use of PCs, Skok is unequivocal. 'It is disgraceful. Surely
they must recognise that technology is going to have a big impact on their
businesses in the next five years. How can any senior manager not include it
on the agenda?'
His vision of the potential of computing is, however, tempered with
down-to-earth pragmatism. New software must work with existing systems and
provide a tangible business advantage, he says. IT investments must also be
cost-justified. 'We cannot afford a software revolution, we are not looking
for wizzy products, we are looking for business tools.'
The series will continue next week.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Fears on welfare cost dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that thousands of European Community citizens living outside Britain
will add millions to the bill for UK welfare benefits are groundless, the
British government said yesterday.
The scare arose after a ruling in the European Court of Justice that the UK
government was wrong to deny family credit, which is designed to supplement
low incomes, to the wife of a civil servant who worked in Northern Ireland
but lived in the Irish Republic.
The court held that the UK's arguments would impede freedom of movement for
workers - a right that is one of the EC's principal long-term goals.
The ruling means that people who travel to work in Britain leaving
dependants behind in their home states will be able to claim family credit
on behalf of their families. The ruling is believed not to apply to other
benefits.
'We are not expecting a flood of successful claims costing the Treasury
millions,' The Department of Social Security said.
'You have to be on a low income to qualify for it, and most EC workers
either bring their families with them or are single people with no
dependants.'
The maximum permitted income for a successful claim is at present Pounds
11,180. That would rule out most people from other EC states who work in the
UK. A family on that income with one child aged between 16 and 17 would be
entitled to Pounds 1.47 a week.
Nevertheless, the DSS said it shared the concerns of the German government,
which is worried about additional pressure on already tight social security
budgets.
The DSS said it believed UK nationals working in other member states would
not enjoy reciprocal benefits.

TRAINING and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) were urged yesterday by the
government to form a new umbrella body to deal with national providers of
training.
The 82 Tecs in England and Wales negotiate individually with their training
providers, including large high street retailers and organisations such as
the Construction Industry Training Body.
Before Tecs were set up two years ago, those large-scale providers
contracted with a single organisation called the National Providers Unit
(NPU).
A number of such providers have stopped providing training places,
particularly for Youth Training, because of the administrative difficulties
of dealing with several Tecs. The NPU, which is now being run down, has
tried to ease negotiations between them.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the employment minister, urged Tecs to create jointly
a managing agency to give central support to contracting between them and
large providers.

<TEXT>
MR PABLO Escobar, chief of Colombia's Medelln cocaine cartel, was reported
to be entrenched in a tunnel in his jail yesterday after resisting attempts
to transfer him. The army is battling to take control of the prison.
Mr Escobar and 13 fellow-prisoners used weapons taken from guards to seize
hostages - including Mr Eduardo Mendoza, deputy justice minister, and
Colonel Hernando Navas, director-general of prisons - on Tuesday night.
Troops were sent in and the hostages released after a shoot-out.
Reports say at least two people have been killed and several injured.
President Cesar Gaviria called an all-night national security council
session late on Tuesday and postponed his trip to the Ibero-American summit
in Madrid.
A local radio station reported that Mr Escobar had said on tape he was
prepared to resist to the last, rather than be transferred. His nephew
confirmed that Mr Escobar and others were in a tunnel under the jail with
enough food to survive for some time.
The government decided to transfer Mr Escobar following a series of
kidnappings and deaths of people linked to the Medelln cartel after they had
visited him in jail. The killings were widely attributed to Mr Escobar's
desire to consolidate his power over cartel business.
A government communique said that 'recognised criminals' had been into the
jail and that Mr Escobar continued 'to be involved in committing crimes
directly and personally from inside the jail,' with the complicity of prison
guards.
Mr Escobar's refusal to leave the jail coincides with rumours that competing
trafficking gangs were planning an attack on him. He paid for the luxurious
jail's construction before surrendering to the government just over a year
ago, in exchange for leniency.
AP adds from Bogota: Mr Escobar was the architect of what became the world's
largest cocaine cartel; Forbes magazine once listed him as one of the
world's wealthiest men.
He and his lieutenants have not been tried, as Colombia's justice system
works slowly, but the government has accused Mr Escobar of masterminding
hundreds of terrorist acts, including the 1986 assassination of Mr Guillermo
Cano, publisher of a Colombian newspaper that campaigned against the drugs
trade.

MEXICO'S current account deficit climbed to Dollars 4.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in
the first quarter, the highest in 20 years and 143 per cent more than in the
same period last year, according to the Bank of Mexico.
Unless import growth falls sharply over the year the government will miss
its official target of Dollars 13bn for 1992 by some way. Mr Rogelio Ramirez
de la O, of the consultancy Ecanal, believes the deficit for the year will
be Dollars 20bn, or 6.4 per cent of estimated GDP.
The trade deficit during the first quarter was Dollars 4bn, 127 per cent
higher than in the same period in 1991, reflecting a growth of just 0.6 per
cent in exports and a 27.7 per cent increase in imports. However,
manufacturing exports grew by 16.8 per cent, an indication of the continued
strength of the industrial sector.
Most of the increase in imports was due to capital goods purchased by
Mexican companies, which the government has explained as part of the
necessary restructuring of the Mexican economy.
There are signs that the rate of increase in the current account deficit is
slowing. The deficit in the first quarter was 5.3 per cent higher than that
in the final period of 1991.
This year's first-quarter deficit was easily covered by a surplus in the
capital account of Dollars 5.157m, of which 27.5 per cent was direct
physical investment and the remainder portfolio investment.

PERU'S Sendero Luminoso guerrilla group enforced a strike call yesterday
with a wave of bomb attacks, injuring at least six children at a Lima school
and blasting a television station, Reuter reports from Lima.
For the seventh consecutive day the capital was rocked by explosions.
Heavily armed troops patrolled the streets to protect people going to work.
But large queues formed on the outskirts of the capital as buses stayed off
the roads for fear of reprisals by the Shining Path guerrilla force.
The guerrillas called a general strike for yesterday and today against
President Alberto Fujimori's government.

FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Iranian banks delay trade payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRANIAN banks, which usually have an exemplary payments record, have been
delaying payments on letters of credit for the past three weeks.
The delays come at a bad time for Iran, as the UK Export Credits Guarantee
Department continues negotiations with the Iranian government aimed at
establishing medium-term cover for Iran.
The delays result from the loosening of controls by the Bank Markazi, the
central bank, which wants to remove itself from the commercial arena. Bank
Markazi used to open all letters of credit but it has now transferred this
to commercial banks.
'Since Bank Markazi distanced itself from the commercial banks, they have
not handled their foreign exchange allocations and cash flows as well as
they might,' said a British banker, whose bank undertakes Iranian risk. He
said Bank Markazi had clamped down on the numbers of letters of credit being
issued.
Some of the Iranian banks have taken out interbank loans to ease the problem
and Bank Markazi is said to have injected Dollars 400m into the banking
system about 10 days ago.
Both Iranian and British banks have put the delays down to temporary cash
flow problems. One Iranian banker claimed the Iranian commercial banks,
which are government-owned and include Bank Melli, Bank Tedjarat and Bank
Saderat, had made incorrect income calculations.
He said funds had been used to discount one year usance letters of credit
without keeping back enough foreign exchange for letters of credit falling
due from a year ago.
'These are technical delays which will exist for a few weeks but it is a
temporary situation and business is as usual,' said another British bank.
Iranian banks are paying interest to letters of credit claimants for the
delay.
The banks have also come under pressure because Bank Markazi restricted the
supply of hard currency in mid-May, leaving the banks to settle outstanding
debt by going to the open market. The shortage of foreign exchange stems in
part from over-estimates of oil income. The price of oil was expected to
remain high after the Gulf war. This year for example, Iran may find itself
earning only Dollars 14bn in oil revenues instead of an estimated Dollars
16.6bn.
Downpayments on projects drawn up in the five-year development plan have
increased the strain on resources. The government is to submit a report soon
to the majlis (parliament) when it hopes to say that significant progress
has been made on projects in the plan.
The weakness of the US dollar and the fact that Iran's main trading partners
are Japan and Germany rather than the US have made the import bill more
expensive. In addition, Iran has increased its defence expenditure for which
it will have had to use hard currency rather than any form of oil barter
arrangement.
Western banks undertaking Iranian risk have been told the delays will be
over by the end of August.

FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Kiev gripped in Russian stranglehold -
Ukraine's economy will pay a heavy price for defying Moscow
</HEADLINE>

   TRADE between Ukraine and Russia,
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
72 per cent of trade within the old Soviet Union - is grinding to a halt as
the political link which sustained it breaks down.
For troubled Ukrainian enterprise directors, the tale told by Mr Viktor
Antonov, Ukrainian minister for conversion and the defence industry, is
distressingly familiar. He was asked this spring to produce 10 T-8 tanks for
the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence but found that Ukraine's mighty military
industrial complex, which Khrushchev once bragged was capable of 'churning
out rockets like sausages,' was unable to fill the modest order because
Russian enterprises would not supply the necessary parts. This was in spite
of the formal co-operation agreement signed in April by Mr Antonov and his
Russian counterpart.
The situation is likely to get worse. Like the Comecon countries which
shared Ukraine's dependence on heavily-subsidised Russian oil, Ukraine could
pay a heavy economic price for its determination to break out of the Russian
orbit.
According to Mr Evhen Baramikov, chief of the inter-republican trade
department in the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy, Russian experts have warned
Ukraine that the moment Ukraine introduces a separate currency Russia will
demand world prices for oil. This threat underscores Ukraine's structural
vulnerability in its trade with Russia. 'They can last a year without our
food, but Russia can halt Ukrainian industry in a day,' says Mr Baramikov.
'We will eat our sugar while freezing in the dark.'
Mr Baramikov said Ukraine was paying Rbs2,840 per tonne for Russian crude
supplied according to inter-governmental agreements. If Ukraine remained in
the rouble zone, Russia had offered to continue selling crude at between
Rbs2,820 and Rbs3,500 per tonne, well below the world rate.
However, that enticement to remain in the Russian economic sphere is less
attractive than it might seem because even today Russian oil sold to Ukraine
at the subsidised rate covers barely half of the requirements of Ukrainian
enterprises. Ukraine traditionally purchased 52m tonnes of oil from Russia
each year. This year that has been cut to 40m tonnes and in the first
quarter of 1992 Russia supplied Ukraine with only 7.4m tonnes at subsidised
rates.
Ukraine is suffering even more extreme shortages of the coal, gasoline and
lumber normally supplied by Russia. In the first three months of 1992,
Ukraine received only 14.7 per cent of the lumber and 19.8 per cent of the
coking coal Russia had pledged to deliver. The shortage of Russian fuel has
a knock-on effect: in the first quarter of this year, Ukraine supplied
Russia with only 13.8 per cent of the black metal and 35.4 per cent of the
tubing it had agreed to provide.
The mounting political hostility between Ukraine and Russia is one
explanation for the collapse in trade. Mr Baramikov describes negotiations
with Russia as acrimonious and emotional encounters in which 'the Russians
try to turn the thumb-screws on us'.
But trade is also jeopardised by the economic limbo in which the former
Soviet Union is trapped. 'The old system no longer works,' Mr Baramikov
says, 'but there is no new mechanism yet.'
Enterprises were responsible under the old system to central planners, not
to each other. The planners provided raw material, dictated how much they
should produce and disposed of their products. Today, the planners still set
guidelines - they are the men who draft the huge inter-state trade deals -
but, as the non-fulfilment of the agreements demonstrates, their word is no
longer law.
The hybrid system in operation today has bred some costly distortions. For
example, some Ukrainian enterprises have fulfilled or over-fulfilled their
obligations to Russian customers without being paid because they know their
national bank will make up any shortfall. Hence Ukrainian factories' shipped
2 1/2 times the eggs and twice the processed foods which Kiev had agreed to
supply to Russia.
The Ukrainian national bank hopes to put a stop to this costly practice by
abolishing the old payments system, but Ukrainian experts claim that
Ukrainian enterprises have amassed debt of up to a thousand billion roubles
owed by Russian enterprises which seem unlikely to repay it.
To avoid these sorts of loopholes Mr Baramikov thinks that 'we should open
our borders and not block our enterprises from trading directly.' But he is
worried that 'over 70 years Ukraine and Russia have created a structure of
mutual dependency. Neither we nor they are ready to immediately switch to
the market.'

Nine Japanese clothing makers, including Toray Industries have filed
objections to Japan's Patent Office against a claim by Ohio-based Richman
Brothers for a patent on computer-aided clothing-making methods, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
The application by Richman Brothers, owned by Woolworth Corp covers
computer-aided measure-taking for the manufacture of clothing. Toray said
the contents of the application were so wide they would damage the Japanese
clothing industry.
The manufacturing methods mentioned in the application had been widely used
in Japan for more than 10 years, Toray said.

South Korean steel makers have agreed to voluntary restraints on exports of
nine steel items to the US for one year from April 1, 1992, the Korea Steel
Manufacturers Association said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. - The
items include coated sheets, pipe and tubes, nails and stainless products.
The move follows complaints by US steel makers against Korean steel
exporters for selling below 'fair' prices in the US, and is seen as an
attempt to stave off dumping charges. Six other Korean steel products are
under dumping investigation in the US.

Nike International, the US sporting clothes and footwear group, yesterday
lost a race to have a ban on the sale and marketing of its clothing in Spain
lifted before the start of the Olympic Games in Barcelona on Saturday,
writes Peter Bruce in Madrid.
Spain's constitutional court rejected a second appeal by Nike in favour of
claims by a Catalan company that it owns the Nike trademark in Spain. The
decision sets the stage for a potentially embarrassing inaugural ceremony as
it means the Spanish claimant could ask police to stop the US athletic team,
sponsored by Nike, entering the Olympic stadium wearing the Nike (US) logo.

FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Japan to import Mexican Nissans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN's Mexican subsidiary is to export cars to Japan from July next year
from a new assembly plant in the central state of Aguascalientes. Initially
Nissan Mexicana will send 6,000 to 8,000 units a year of its low-cost Tsuru
model but intends to increase this to 40,000 a year before the end of the
decade. The export plan forms part of a three-year investment programme by
Nissan in Mexico totalling nearly Dollars 1.2bn.
Nissan Mexicana is owned 97.8 per cent by Nissan, with the remainder held by
Marubeni Corporation.
Its announcement comes amid rapid expansion of both Mexico's car market and
production. According to Dr Rolf Schlettwein, executive vice-president of
the Mexican Investment Board, the market has been growing at 20 per cent
plus a year over the past five years and is expected to grow by a further 12
to 15 per cent in each of the next six years. The country is producing about
1m vehicles a year and is projecting that by 2000 this will have more than
doubled, with about one third being exported to the US.
The Nissan investment forms part of an ambitious expansion programme in
Mexico by several vehicle makers which totals more than Dollars 5bn. Mexican
inward investment officials are touring Europe seeking to generate interest
among Europe's vehicle component makers in setting up operations in Mexico,
or expanding existing activities there.
The new Nissan plant is to go on stream in November and is expected to reach
full capacity of between 100,000 and 120,000 units before the end of 1994.
