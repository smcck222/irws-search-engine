FT  16 JUL 92 / Bundesbank knows its credibility is at stake / Preview of
today's council meeting. The outcome is awaited eagerly at home and abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<TEXT>
CREDIBILITY is a fragile thing. That uncomfortable thought will be in the
minds of the Bundesbank's council members when they sit down today for a
meeting whose result will be awaited apprehensively in Germany and abroad.
With the money supply growing well beyond the target for 1992, the
Bundesbank's credibility is clearly at stake - both in the financial
community and among Germany's stability-conscious citizens. Inflation is
still above 4 per cent a year and recent wage settlements have been higher
than the Bundesbank would like.
But drastic action by the central bank would have severe consequences for
other European countries. Nor does the Bonn government, struggling to put
its finances in order under the weight of the high cost of unification, want
to see the German economy hit by another interest rate blast.
Economists' opinions on what the Bundesbank will do vary widely. The
consensus is that it will take some action to show concern over monetary
developments, but be careful not to go too far. After all the advance
speculation, a decision to do nothing could harm credibility.
'They've got to do something,' says Mr Jurgen Pfister, economist at
Commerzbank. 'But they will want to keep its effects limited. Thus it will
be largely a symbolic move to show that they are worried and want others to
take the problem seriously, but they also want to avoid any disruptions in
the European Monetary System or harm to other economies.'
So he and others reckon a further half-point rise in the discount rate to
8.5 per cent is most likely. This would narrow the gap with the more
important Lombard rate (now 9.75 per cent), which would be left alone. It
could be combined with technical measures to limit commercial banks' access
to central bank funds.
'Jacking up the Lombard doesn't seem to be on the cards,' believes Mr
Richard Reid, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew's Frankfurt office. 'Most
attention is focused on the discount rate or access to Lombard credits.'
Action on these fronts would, he says, 'have a signalling effect without a
disruptive effect'.
Apart from not wanting to overbalance the EMS, the Bundesbank is also aware
that the monetary data are far from clear. Much of the pressure behind the 9
per cent annualised growth in M3 this year has come from high lending to
finance east Germany's economic reconstruction; investment subsidies make a
large part of this insensitive to interest rates.
Uncertainty over the government's caused funds to pile up in high-yielding
short-term deposits. Moreover, M3 has been swollen by large holdings of the
D-Mark in eastern Europe. Bank lending, up by an annualised 12 per cent this
year, has also financed property purchases.
According to Mr Martin Hufner, economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, 'the
high credit expansion is less threatening than it looks at first sight. The
restrictive policies are working.'
The problem, however, recognised by Bundesbank president Mr Helmut
Schlesinger and his colleagues, is that its target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per
cent for M3 growth in 1992 looks embarrassing in view of this year's
monetary pace.
It is unlikely that the target will be changed. That would damage
credibility further. But meeting it is also virtually impossible now.
Moreover, changes in monetary policy take at least a year to have an impact.
So the real concentration is on ensuring the right conditions for slower M3
growth in 1993.
But that does not mean the Bundesbank's council members have to act now,
some argue. 'It would be best if they sit on their hands, bite their lips,
and say they will wait until M3 comes down,' says Mr Nigel Rendell,
economist with stockbrokers James Capel in London. Mr Paul Brunker of Robert
Fleming also opposes any in-between measures. 'The logical alternatives are
to raise the Lombard or do nothing.'
The dilemma for the Bundesbank is how to balance the need to be effective
with the desire not to be disruptive. Thus what the Bundesbank says today
about the confused monetary scene could be just as important as what it
decides. Despite international concern, it will regard its main audience as
the politicians in Bonn and citizens throughout Germany.

German monetary policy is thrashed out round a big oval table at
the Bundesbank's forbidding headquarters in Frankfurt.  Eighteen
men have a vote (never disclosed): the Bundesbank's seven permanent
directors and the heads of 11 regional central banks.  Bonn's
economics minister can drop in for the council meetings but cannot
vote.  Decisions emerge from a complex interplay of financial
juggling and political sensitivity, influenced by the widely
differing regional and personal backgrounds of the players and their
personal characteristics.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission plans to liberalise basic telephone services will not be
published until the end of September because of French sensitivity over the
issue.
France is due to hold its referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September,
and the state-owned telecommunications company is one of the most vociferous
opponents of further liberalisation.
The Commission yesterday approved directives which would lay the groundwork
for greater competition, by harmonising technical and quality standards, and
granting third parties access to telephone networks. Brussels also published
a paper criticising the excessive cost of cross-border calls.
But the Commission withdrew a policy paper laying out how it would open up
cross-border calls to competition. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the research
and telecommunications commissioner said thereview would be delayed until
September 30.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Carrington sees no progress on Bosnia: London Peace Talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEACE TALKS on Bosnia-Hercegovina made no progress in London yesterday but
negotiators will attempt to resume their efforts today.
Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community-sponsored talks, said
last night the only significant aspect of the negotiations on the first day
was that leaders of the three ethnic groups turned up.
He said some constitutional settlement would have to be agreed between the
Moslem, Serb and Croat communities in Bosnia before any ceasefire could have
any meaning. 'The best way to get a ceasefire is to come to a constitutional
agreement which will render a ceasefire possible,' he said.
Yesterday there appeared little prospect that all three sides would sit at
the same table. After each had a separate meeting with Lord Carrington,
leaders of the three groups held separate talks with Portugal's Jose
Cutileiro, an EC mediator who chaired earlier Bosnian talks in Lisbon.
The Bosnian government representative urged the EC to place all heavy
weapons in Bosnia-Hercegovena under international supervision as a step
towards stopping the fighting. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign
minister, said ceasefires were meaningless unless steps were taken to disarm
the Serbs.
'How can we continue this peace conference when thousands of people are
being killed or deported, and regions are being ethnically cleansed by the
Serbs?' asked Mr Silajdzic.
He said the Bosnian government would reject the 'cantonisation' plan drawn
up by the EC last March. The plan was supported by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head
of the Bosnian Serbs, and Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats, because it
would eventually lead to the ethnic division of Bosnia between Croatia and
Serbia and leave the Moslems without a homeland.
Mr Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs and the Serb irregular forces, called
for a ceasefire and creation of a land corridor from the Adriatic port of
Split in Croatia to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, which is still under
siege by Serb irregulars.
Meanwhile, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, left for a four-day
tour of the Balkans. After talks in Paris with Mr Roland Dumas, his French
counterpart, he was due to visit Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo (if conditions
permit), Belgrade, Skopje and Tirana.
Mr Hurd is anxious to use the British presidency of the EC to boost efforts
to find a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis.

FT  16 JUL 92 / EC considers ways to trim UK's rebate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE REFUND Britain gets on its net EC budget contributions could be trimmed
under two options put to the European Commission yesterday.
But, because of technical complexities involved in the UK budget rebate
issue, the Commission decided not to deliver its final report before its
next executive board session on July 22.
One option is for Britain's payments to the planned 'cohesion' fund for
Mediterranean countries to be taken off Brussels' calculation of the UK net
contribution to EC financing. This would slightly reduce the contributions,
and thus the UK rebate. Another option is further to excuse Germany from
paying towards the UK rebate. Because Germany gets no direct rebate on what
is the biggest EC contribution, Bonn already gets a third off its share of
the UK rebate. That raises the question of whether the other 10 countries
would pick up Germany's previous share of the refund.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday ordered a destroyer and three reconnaissance
aircraft to join allied warships monitoring the UN trade embargo of Serbia
and Montenegro. Nato and Western European Union ships will begin monitoring
the coast of the former Yugoslavia today.
It is only the second time since the founding of the Federal Republic of
Germany that Bonn has ordered troops to a possible conflict area. The first
was during the Gulf war, when a squadron of German aircraft was sent to
Turkey to help protect it against Iraq. Bonn avoided an embarrassing summons
to the constitutional court by strictly limiting its armed forces' role in
the Adriatic to observation and intelligence gathering.
The German destroyer Bayern will not be allowed to stop suspect cargo
vessels or use force, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, and Mr Volker Ruhe,
defence minister, stressed yesterday. It will also have to stay in
international waters. The German force's task was information-gathering on
behalf of the UN, not armed intervention. 'The object is to smother the war
in Yugoslavia,' added Mr Ruhe.
The cabinet decision, made in the face of opposition threats to challenge
the deployment in the constitutional court, marks an important step in the
government's plan to play a fuller role in international affairs. Both
ministers made clear the constitution, which in effect prevents German
troops from taking part in combat missions outside Nato territory, must be
altered as soon as possible.
The German move came as Serb forces stepped up attacks on the last Moslem
stronghold in eastern Bosnia, despite a pledge by the new Yugoslav premier,
Mr Milan Panic, to end the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Moslem fighters in
Gorazde broadcast an appeal for help as Serb forces continued to shell the
town, cut off for three months. 'Gorazde will cease to exist without
immediate help from outside,' the fighters said.
The bombardment of Gorazde appeared to put paid to chances that Mr Radovan
Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, and a close ally of Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic, would support a ceasefire.
HINA, the Croatian news agency, said 31 people were killed and 61 wounded in
the attack on the town.
Some 50,000 people have sought refuge in Gorazde, normally a town of 20,000.
The siege has seen all phone and road links to the outside severed.
Across the border in Croatia 11 people were killed in a mortar attack on a
sports stadium housing refugees in Slavonski Brod.
At least 7,500 people have died in four months of fighting since Bosnia
gained independence, and some 1.2m people have fled their homes.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, yesterday called an
international conference on refugees as the exodus from Bosnia-Hercegovina
looked set to grow. Hungary and Austria, each with 50,000 refugees from the
former Yugoslavia, are to seek international backing for a security zone
within the former Yugoslav republics to protect victims of the conflict.
The two countries plan to put the proposal, whose idea is borrowed from the
operation to save the Kurds from the Iraqi regime, before the Hexagonale
group of central European countries this weekend. Hungary and Austria will
press the issue at the UN Security Council, where they are both members.
The International Red Cross has announced a central regional base in Hungary
for supplying refugee camps. Mr Peter Tjittes, regional head, said the
supply centre in southern Hungary would make costly deliveries of emergency
relief unnecessary.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Italian PM plans to cut state's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Giuliano Amato, Italy's new Socialist prime minister, yesterday
pledged to 'change the rules' in Italy, committing himself to a fundamental
reform of the country's state dominated economic and financial system.
In his first interview with a foreign newspaper he underlined his desire to
convince the international community of the seriousness of his reformist
intentions.
On the key issue of privatisation, he said: 'You begin by saying you are in
the year zero and you should reduce the role of the state as much as you
can.'
Referring to last week's move turning into joint stock companies Italy's
four principal state entities - IRI, the holding company, ENI, the national
oil concern, Enel,the electricity authority and INA, the insurance institute
 -he said: 'I am creating a machine that will be forced towards
privatisation.'
He poured scorn on previous attempts at privatisation. 'One of the first
cases was in the banking sector, IMI-Cariplo - a public bank (Cariplo) paid
for with money from IMI (another state financial institution).' He said his
cabinet was attempting to create a new market system where the state was no
longer the source of funding and instead companies were obliged to look to
the markets, not least the international markets.
Prof Amato said his emergency budget, seeking to raise L30,000bn (Pounds
13.6bn) in extra revenues and spending cuts, broke new ground by addressing
structural reforms. 'This budget is different from previous ones since they
did not touch such areas as reform of public health, pensions, state
employment . . . This time we are going to change the rules . . . we have to
tackle the fundamental (items) on which expenditures are flowing away.'
He said he expected both the budget decree and the accompanying decrees to
reform public health, pensions, civil service employment, greater financial
autonomy for local authorities and privatisation to be approved within 90
days by parliament. If the 16 seat majority of his four party coalition
failed in parliament he suggested he would seek a vote of confidence.
On Italy's position over the Eurofighter project, he indicated he would
still like it to prosper albeit in cheaper form. But he added elliptically:
'Does it make sense without Germany; will Germany be willing to to remain a
partner if a cheaper plane will result as being feasible? The technical
answer to this has not arrived as yet. But we are hoping for a positive
solution.'

FT  16 JUL 92 / Germany faces pressure not to raise rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK came under pressure yesterday to avoid tightening German
monetary policy at its council meeting today. A series of warnings from both
home and abroad reflect concern that higher interest rates would prompt a
wave of increases across Europe.
The D-Mark registered fresh gains against the dollar and European currencies
as foreign exchange dealers anticipated a decision to raise the German
discount rate at today's Bundesbank council meeting.
An increase in the discount rate from 8 per cent would take the Bundesbank's
benchmark rate for lending to banks to the highest since September 1 1931 -
three weeks before Britain left the gold standard.
Mr Heinrich Weiss, president of the Federation of German Industry, issued a
call for Bundesbank restraint, saying he believed German interest rates were
already high enough to ensure inflation was brought down.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said UK interest rates were higher than needed to achieve the country's
domestic inflation targets.
The German co-operative banking association warned that attempts to damp
monetary growth 'by force' could have fatal consequences.
European finance ministers have for several days been urging Germany against
drastic tightening. Bonn has also made clear it does not want monetary
policy to be tightened. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, will attend
the meeting of the 18-strong council, although he has no influence on the
vote.
Mr Neil Kinnock, outgoing Labour leader, in a letter to the Financial Times
today, urges the government to take 'a real lead' in pressing for an
immediate growth, rising at double its 1992 target.
Partly as a means of mollifying opinion at home and abroad, the Bundesbank
is expected to maintain unchanged its 9.75 per cent Lombard rate, which has
a greater practical impact on the money market than the discount rate.
Mr Richard Reid, Frankfurt-based economist with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said:
'They are likely to take the milder rather than the stronger option.'
Dealers believe, however, that the central bank could accompany a discount
rate increase of  1/2 point with more technical measures to limit banks'
access to central bank funds.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Abu Dhabi blamed over BCCI: Draft Bingham report says vital
facts withheld from Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABU DHABI, the majority shareholder in the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, has been criticised in the draft Bingham report for
withholding from the Bank of England vital information on the scale of the
fraud at the collapsed bank.
Lord Justice Bingham's inquiry into the collapse of BCCI highlights a
nine-month delay in communicating details of the huge losses and fraud -
including the theft of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.15bn) of Abu Dhabi's funds -
as a serious omission.
The criticism of the Gulf emirate's actions, in draft excerpts seen by the
Financial Times, forms one of the main conclusions of the 11-month
investigation by Lord Justice Bingham, which also assesses the roles of the
Bank of England and of Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor.
Abu Dhabi and its advisers are understood to be unhappy at what they see as
this slur on the emirate's reputation, and reject it. The Bank is also
braced for criticism of its role as supervisor of BCCI's UK operations.
Unless key passages of the preliminary report are revised or excluded from
publication, a row between Abu Dhabi and the UK government is expected to
follow the report's publication, which is not expected for several weeks.
In his draft, Lord Justice Bingham highlights an interview between Mr Swaleh
Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive, and Abu Dhabi's representatives in
April 1990 - 15 months before the bank was shut down.
Lord Justice Bingham concludes that, had the contents of the interview been
communicated to the Bank of England by the emirate, a more detailed
investigation of BCCI and a more urgent programme for reconstructing the
bank might have been triggered. Alternatively BCCI could have collapsed or
been closed.
In the event, the Bank did not learn of the Dollars 2.2bn theft until the
end of February 1991.
But Abu Dhabi and its solicitors, Simmons &amp; Simmons, have argued to Lord
Justice Bingham that there is no evidence that the Bank would have behaved
any differently if it had received details of the Naqvi interview. The final
date for submissions to Bingham was last Friday.
One emirates' representative present at the controversial interview with Mr
Naqvi was Mr Ghanem al-Mazrui, head of Abu Dhabi's Department of Private
Affairs, which handles the personal finances of Sheikh Zayed, Abu Dhabi's
ruler.
In the conversation, Mr Naqvi gave the Abu Dhabi representatives details of
hitherto undisclosed losses at BCCI and said that Dollars 2.2bn of funds
belonging to Sheikh Zayed, had been stolen by ICIC Group, a Cayman Islands
offshoot of BCCI.
However, the Abu Dhabi representatives say the confession was confusing and
that they did not trust Mr Naqvi. They also believed ICIC was unrelated to
BCCI's core activities.
They were given no evidence to back up his assertions, though they
eventually received a three page hand written summary from Mr Naqvi of his
allegations, which they decided to investigate before communicating them to
outside authorities. It is not known whether they communicated details of
the confession to Sheikh Zayed.
No notes were taken of the conversation at the time. Lord Justice Bingham is
understood to have relied to a large extent on written evidence relating to
the discussion provided by Price Waterhouse which has passed on notes it
made during its investigation into BCCI under section 41 of the Banking Act.
However, Lord Justice Bingham is convinced that Abu Dhabi was not as
uncomprehending as it now says it was. His draft says that the Abu Dhabi
representatives were not financial innocents.
Bingham's report falls into three parts. The first contains the evidence and
is unlikely to be published. The second, of more than 300 pages, is a
narrative. The final section, which is still being prepared, contains Lord
Justice Bingham's conclusions.
The Bank of England and the Treasury, which commissioned the report, have
received the bulk of it already. The Government will then decide, in
consultation with the Treasury's solicitors, which parts to publish. The
Government has said that any parts likely to prejudice possible criminal
prosecutions will be excluded.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Network SouthEast is target for Sea Containers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based shipping group headed by Mr James
Sherwood, has put in a bid to operate a large proportion of British Rail's
Network SouthEast services as soon as they come up for privatisation.
The company revealed yesterday it had approached the government with
proposals to take over all services on the network between London and the
south coast towns of Weymouth, Portsmouth, Brighton and Eastbourne,
including branch line and suburban services in between.
If successful, the company plans to introduce double-decker trains to the
main routes so that larger numbers of commuters could be carried in more
comfort than is now possible.
Mr Sherwood is also considering the idea of running 'jam-buster' car shuttle
trains that would carry motorists and their vehicles through heavily
congested parts of south-east England.
His proposals go far beyond those of other companies that have so far
expressed an interest in taking advantage of the government's rail
privatisation proposals set out in a white paper on Tuesday.
Companies such as Virgin Atlantic, the airline, and Stagecoach, the bus
operator, have focused on the idea of operating a small number of trains on
InterCity routes where BR will continue to be the main operator.
Sea Containers, however, aims to be one of the first companies to bid for a
franchise to take over an entire tranche of BR services.
The group's claim to credibility as a train operator rests on its position
as one of Britain's larger transport companies. Its operations include
Wightlink, the Isle of Wight ferry operator; Hoverspeed, the cross-Channel
hovercraft and catamaran service; and the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.
As proprietor of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, which runs between
London and Folkestone en route to the continent, it is also the only private
sector operator of regularly-scheduled trains on BR tracks.
Mr Sherwood's plan is to take on BR's rolling stock initially but to replace
it gradually with his own. He would be looking for a 60-year franchise,
terminable by the government at 10-year intervals.
BR staff would also be taken on, but costs would be cut by issuing them with
new contracts of employment requiring much greater flexibility.
Steep fare increases would be necessary to make the services pay, Mr
Sherwood said. Part of the deal would have to be an agreement by the
government that commuter fares would be allowable against tax.

<TEXT>
FEARS that the Bundesbank would announce a tightening in German monetary
policy today led to a cautious mood in stock index futures, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The firm overnight performance on Wall Street led to a confident opening of
the September contract on the FT-SE, at 2,525. This, however, proved to be
the high of the session, for September soon went into retreat as nerves
about the outcome of the Bundesbank meeting took hold.
By 11.30am the contract had fallen to 2,496, the low of the day, and was now
trading at a discount to fair value, with sentiment further weakened by the
poor performance in the gilts and sterling markets.
Sporadic buying in the afternoon on the back of a higher opening in New York
helped September claw back some of the earlier losses. It finished at 2,502,
down 7 from the previous session and just below its fair value premium to
cash of about 18. Turnover was a poor 5,299 contracts.
In traded options, turnover reached 36,602 contracts, with trading in the
FT-SE 100 option particularly busy. It had a total of 15,048 lots dealt,
with the July 2,500 calls active. British Steel was the busiest stock option
with 1,860 contracts traded.

FT  16 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stays ahead
despite late fall in bonds
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE A late fall in bond prices prompted afternoon selling, the Nikkei
managed to stay ahead on foreign and institutional buying, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index gained a net 52.29 at 17,116.92. It opened at the day's low of
17,092.13, and registered a high of 17,274.49 in the afternoon on the back
of a higher futures market.
Volume rose to 240m shares from 208m. Gains led declines by 533 to 347, with
215 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section shares put
on 4.69 to 1,298.84. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.86 to
1,026.43.
Most traders have been heartened by the Nikkei's reluctance to fall below
17,000. Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities said: 'One feature of the market
is that it does not feel as if it wants to go down.' He added that foreign
demand for leading blue chips and buying orders by domestic institutions at
lower levels was providing underlying support.
However, in the next few months traders do fear a spate of downward
revisions for earnings forecasts for the first six months of the fiscal
year.
Meiji Milk Products was the day's most active issue, climbing Y22 to Y995.
KOA, in electronics, advanced Y9 to Y933 on hopes of a rise in demand on the
back of a US recovery. Other electronic parts makers also gained ground on
the US recovery theme, with TEAC adding Y30 at Y991 and Advantest Y110 at
Y2,490.
Horiba, the leading maker of automotive emission analysers, surged Y260 to
Y2,300 on reports that the US government intended to implement tighter rules
on car emissions. Horiba has a dominant share in auto emission analysers in
Japan and the US.
Nippon Credit Bank receded Y150 to Y5,230. The bank has remained under
small-lot selling pressure due to concern about troubled loans at its
financial affiliates. Nippon Credit Bank denied reports of huge outstanding
debt, and said restructuring of the companies was progressing smoothly.
In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 79.54 to 19,611.35 in volume of 14.6m
shares.
Roundup
FIRMER markets in the US and Japan made a limited impression in the Pacific
Basin region. Bangkok was closed for a holiday.
AUSTRALIA was depressed about prospects for its own economy, and although
golds went up on the higher bullion price, and banks bounced after a weak
morning, the All Ordinaries index ended 2.1 easier at 1,636.7 in turnover of
ADollars 254.3m.
Among banks, ANZ gained 3 cents to ADollars 3.75 after falling to ADollars
3.66 earlier. However, St George slipped 10 cents to ADollars 5.95 on talk
of a rights issue.
One stock affected by expectations of slower earnings growth was Coca-Cola
Amatil, which closed 3 cents down at ADollars 6.97, moving below ADollars 7
for the first time since March 1991.
SINGAPORE saw bank and marine issues fall on poor sentiment and the
liquidation of positions. The only bright spot was the listing of property
company Liang Court Holdings, which finished 10 cents above the offer price
of 70 cents after brisk volume. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 2.63
to 1,481.15 in volume of 70.61m shares, including 30.75m of Liang Court.
KUALA LUMPUR encountered profit-taking and the composite index fell 5.58 to
612.36. Malaysia Public Finance, which was listed yesterday, closed at
MDollars 2.24 against the issue price of MDollars 2. It was the day's most
active stock with 13m shares traded.
SEOUL went into reverse again after Tuesday's gains, with rumours of another
financial scandal persisting. The composite stock index weakened 12.89 to
514.19. Turnover amounted to Won146.37bn.
HONG KONG advanced as funds and retail investors switched to selected
second-liners. The Hang Seng index closed 28.27 up at 6,125.46. Turnover
eased to HKDollars 3.41bn from HKDollars 3.74bn.
China-owned Hai Hong Holdings, which made its debut, closed at HKDollars
4.23 compared with an issue price of HKDollars 1.50.
TAIWAN saw a technical rebound and the index ended 44.82, or 1 per cent,
higher at 4,352.51. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 19.35bn.
BOMBAY brokers resumed trading, ending a month-long boycott in protest
against the seizure of shares in connection with a securities scandal.
Share prices fell broadly, the BSE index finishing 167.62, or 5.5 per cent,
down at 2,912.92. ACC lost Rp100 to Rp4,800.

FT  16 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank casts shadow over
continental equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY's Bundesbank meeting is to be followed by a press conference, which
implies there is something to discuss in Frankfurt. This kept bourses muted
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT slowed to a crawl; a Bundesbank board member repeated the official
exhortation that M3 growth was too high, and the DAX index retreated to
close 0.52 higher at 1,734.62, after a 0.81 rise to 687.13 in the FAZ at
midsession. Turnover fell from DM4.2bn to DM3.9bn.
Retailers improved after a first half increase of 8.7 per cent in sales from
Karstadt, which also said that it saw the first signs of improving consumer
sentiment in June. Karstadt rose DM10.50 to DM645.50, Kaufhof by DM5.50 to
DM515.50 and Douglas by DM25 to DM570.
Mr Adrian Hopkinson at County NatWest said that investors were looking at
higher German consumer spending power in the second half of this year; aware
that the fall in the dollar emphasises this point; and more comfortable with
domestically oriented stocks as the cyclicals, which make up the great bulk
of the German market, come into question.
Among special situations, the tyremaker, Continental, dropped DM8 or 3 per
cent to DM255.80 after a German court of appeals effectively upheld Conti's
5 per cent limit on shareholder voting rights.
PARIS resumed trading after a four-day weekend and followed the bond market
lower in dull trading. The CAC 40 index fell 6.18 to 1,853.26 in turnover of
FFr1.5bn.
Hachette, the debt-laden French media group which plans to merge with the
defence group, Matra, was one of the day's more prominent losers, dropping
FFr8 or 6.8 per cent to FFr109. Dealers attributed the sharp fall to
mounting speculation that the stock will be removed from the CAC 40 index by
the end of the year.
Euro Disney fell FFr2.80 to FFr103 on rumours of disappointing hotel
occupancy.
MILAN recovered some of its opening losses but closed the July trading
account lower as industrials came under selling pressure after Tuesday's
gains. The Comit index fell 2.58 to 445.42 in turnover estimated at more
than Tuesday's L95.4bn.
Fiat dipped L49 to L5,211 and fell to L5,160 after hours. Stocks controlled
by Mr Carlo De Benedetti were also weaker, with Olivetti dropping L55 to
L3,010.
Among telecoms. Stet fell L17 to L1,620 but Italcable remained firm after
the company's upbeat presentation on Monday, adding L50 to L4,660.
ZURICH softened its opinions and hardened its share prices. The SMI index
rose 9.3 to 1,844.4 as expectations receded that the Bundesbank would
tighten its credit policy; and bearers in the temporary employment group,
Adia, under strong pressure recently on a poor view of 1992, topped the
active list as it recovered SFr14 to SFr230. Dealers said that speculators
appeared to be playing the share, making it very volatile.
MADRID tumbled, driven sharply lower by concern over the Spanish economy,
including yesterday's 40.4 per cent increase in the January to June budget
deficit. The general index fell 3.47 to 231.07.
There were continued heavy falls, some of 10 per cent or more in the
construction sector, an obvious victim of budget cuts, but dealers noted
that the losses hit banking, and the traditional safe haven of utilities, as
well.
AMSTERDAM was quietly firmer as the CBS Tendency index added 0.5 to 122.
BRUSSELS ended mostly higher in light trading as investors awaited signals
on European interest rates from the Bundesbank. The Bel-20 index rose 6.67
to 1,171.86 in slim turnover of BFr478m.
More than a quarter of turnover was accounted for by Petrofina, which rose
BFr25 to BFr11,000.
OSLO jumped 2 per cent from a 1992 low, buoyed by foreign buying of Norsk
Hydro and Hafslund Nycomed. The all-share rose 7.69 to 391.99 in turnover of
NKr235m. HELSINKI hit its second consecutive 1992 low, the Hex index falling
6.0 to 729.4.
VIENNA fell to new 1992 lows ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting.
The ATX index fell 3.75 to its second consecutive record closing low of
860.11.
TEL AVIV rose sharply for the second consecutive day in very high turnover.
Declarations that Israel would get US loan guarantees, and the reaction to a
mild 0.1 per cent consumer price index rise in June left the blue chip index
2.61, or 1.7 per cent higher at in turnover of Shk163.

FT  16 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil recovers most of its June
decline / The winners and losers among the world's emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allegations of corruption against President Fernando Collor prompted a 30.7
per cent fall in Brazilian equities in dollar terms last month, but most of
the losses have since been recouped as the passing of some important
economic reforms has lifted investor confidence.
According to emerging markets data provided by the IFC, part of the World
Bank, Brazil was the poorest performer in June, while Turkey came out on top
after several months of decline.
Mr Eduardo Farria, an analyst at Latin American Securities, says the
Brazilian press was 'besotted' with the allegations against the president in
June, and that the Congress's passing of a reform to streamline the
country's ports, and the approval of a complex review of civil servants' pay
by the Senate, had been overlooked by the market.
He adds that since the government pushed through these economic reforms, no
easy task in the midst of a presidential crisis, the market has become
cautiously optimistic that the government's fiscal package could be passed
by Congress. This could set the scene for inflation to come down.
Another stimulus for the market in early July was news that Brazil and its
foreign creditor banks had reached agreement on a Brady-style restructuring
of some Dollars 44bn of commercial bank debt.
This was another feather in the cap for Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the
economy minister, who is increasingly seen as a figure of stability within
the government. Indeed, since the start of July, the Bovespa index in dollar
terms has risen by 1.64, or 28.2 per cent, to 7.46.
Mr Farria warns that share prices could fall back if any evidence
implicating the president is produced. 'But the most likely scenario is that
the president will stay,' he says.
Elsewhere, Turkey's 27.8 per cent rebound in dollar terms last month,
reducing its fall since the start of the year to 39.1 per cent, has fanned
analysts' hopes that a turnround has finally begun.
Investors reacted positively to changes, passed last month, in the capital
market law, permitting institutional investors to invest in the stock
market. Tax breaks have also been offered to mutual funds if they place 25
per cent of their portfolio in equities. The prospect of a big cash
injection has been welcomed by brokers since, in the past, trading in the
stock market has been shallow and influenced by the whims of retail
investors.
A fall in inflation, and the low valuations of Turkish equities compared
with other emerging markets, especially in Latin America, have attracted
foreign investors, comments Ms Nur Agis Pekin at Schroder Securities.
Mr Ben Hakham, at Carnegie International, also attributes the stock market's
rebound in June to seasonal factors, as the arrival of tourists has taken
pressure off the Turkish lira, which in turn has allowed the Treasury to
reduce the yields on its bills.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ to cut holding in PNG gold
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, wants to reduce its
financial exposure to the Dollars 767m Lihir Island gold project in Papua
New Guinea and is negotiating to sell part of its 80 per cent shareholding
in the venture to its partner, Niugini Mining.
Lihir is one of the world's biggest known gold deposits: there are 42.2m
troy ounces of the precious metal in proven and possible reserves.
Production is scheduled to start in 1995 at an annual rate of 620,000 ounces
for the first five years, building to 900,000 ounces in year 12.
The PNG government wants technical negotiations completed before October 31
so RTZ must conclude any deal with Niugini before then. The partners expect
the government to take a 20 per cent stake - in return for paying them for
20 per cent of the Dollars 120m costs so far - which would leave RTZ with 64
per cent and Niugini 16 per cent.
As RTZ wishes to retain control of the project and manage it, the UK group
is unlikely to sell down to below 51 per cent. However, RTZ, while
confirming that negotiations are going on, would yesterday give no precise
details.
Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of Niugini, said in London yesterday that his
company had retained the NM Rothschild bank to ensure that it had finance
available 'for all the shares' RTZ might sell.
If Niugini needed to sell any of its own shares as part of this process,
perhaps via a rights issue, the number would be very small because the
company's biggest shareholder, Battle Mountain Gold of the US, was not ready
to commit more cash to Niugini but did not wish to see its present 60 per
cent shareholding fall below 50 per cent.
Lihir will be one of the lowest-cost gold mines with total costs of Dollars
248.75 an ounce in the early years (including Dollars 163 cash operating
costs), said Mr Loudon. The feasibility study presented to the PNG
government was based on a price of Dollars 350 an ounce.
Mr Loudon said it was still hoped that the project would be expanded to
increase annual gold output to 1.3m ounces by year 12 but this would double
projected capital costs. At present, given the perceived political risks of
operating in PNG, it would be extremely difficult to raise the finance for
the bigger project.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are no wool sales in the primary markets this month and prices are
nominally static. However, currency fluctuations affecting the US dollar and
the closely related Australian dollar have lately tended to cause price
reductions in Europe. Sterling's recent softness within Europe itself may
have been a factor causing a minor revival in business in tops and yarn in
the past couple of weeks, but this is not widespread nor has it been
experienced by major market sectors. A feature of the limited market
recovery for wool in the past eighteen months has been its concentration in
the knitting rather than the woven sector.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans fail to make sale on
bananas with US - 'Mixed signals' cause concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN increasingly desperate battle to hold on to their preferential access
to the European market, Caribbean banana producers have tried, but
apparently failed, to recruit to their cause one pivotal player in
international trade.
In recent weeks the prime ministers of several banana producing countries in
the Caribbean have visited Washington, asking President George Bush and
other key figures in the Administration to throw their weight behind
proposals which would continue protection for Caribbean bananas marketed in
Europe.
After the meetings several were left confused by what they said were 'mixed
signals' from the US administration. 'At one level, the United States
administration is aware of the problems we face with bananas, and is
sympathetic to the fact that we face potentially serious damage from free
trade in the fruit,' said Mr PJ Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'At
another level in the administration, however, there is a move to have
bananas brought under the Gatt and be freely traded.'
The division is between the White House, on the one hand, and the Office of
the Trade Representative and the State Department, on the other. While Mr
Patterson declined to elaborate on which was the 'sympathetic' part of the
administration, Dame Eugenia Charles, the prime minister of Dominica, did
not. 'President Bush is sympathetic, but Mr James Baker, the secretary of
state, is adamant that there should be no exemptions,' Dame Eugenia said.
'The argument is that if there is an exception for bananas, then there will
have to be for rice, for dairy products and all other farm products. The
United States is dead against us on this.'
The African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, which supplies one-fifth of
the bananas consumed in the European Community, had been worried by the
proposals made in the text of the Gatt negotiations that trading conditions
for current export volumes be maintained for all sources until 1999.
Anything above this would be subject to tariffication, with tariffs being
reduced progressively by an average of 36 per cent between 1993 and 1999.
The banana producers are hoping for relief from three sources. One is the
undertaking, 'the legal commitment,' says Mr Patterson, of the EC to ensure
that changes in the marketing of bananas will not leave the ACP states 'in a
less favourable situation than in the past or at present'. The second is the
proposal by the European Commission earlier this year to impose quotas on
fruit from non-ACP sources, mainly the Latin American countries whose fruit
is more competitive than that of the ACP exporters.
The third area of solace for the ACP producers would have been US support
for the use of quotas rather than tariffs. Officials in the Caribbean say
the White House, preoccupied with an election, will hardly be in a position
to redirect those parts of the government that are unwilling to consider
bananas as a special case. Yet, they say, US support is important if there
is to be any success with efforts for a derogation to the rules of
international trade.
'There is also the fact that US companies are heavily involved in banana
production in the Latin American countries,' explained one St Lucian
official. 'It is unlikely that the US position will be one which will ignore
the desires of those companies, and the Latin American governments, to open
up the market.'
Caribbean bananas, which cost about 30 per cent more to produce than do
Latin American fruit, could not compete on an open market. 'The Latin
American producers have virtually declared war on us,' said Mr John Compton,
the prime minister of St Lucia. 'They are trying to drive us out of the
European market.'
Regional diplomats say that some leaders who met President Bush early last
month in Washington to seek his support for the use of quotas rather than
tariffs on bananas, were more than slightly taken aback when the discussion
turned quickly to other matters, mainly developments in Haiti and the
repatriation of Haitians seeking asylum in the US. 'This reflects the
distraction of the White House in an election year,' explained one envoy.
'There is nothing much to be gained by the White House, and perhaps
something to be lost, by publicly agreeing to support the Caribbean requests
and overriding the clear wishes of the companies involved in the Latin
American industry. Haiti is much more politically sensitive.'
'We cannot move the United States on this issue, although they themselves
treat agricultural products as a special case, and they subsidise their own
very heavily,' said Dame Eugenia. 'There appears to be no consideration that
US agriculture is as important to the US economy as bananas are important to
ours.' Dominica's economy is 60 per cent dependent on banana exports.
US officials have refused to comment on claims that the US government has
written to London suggesting that Britain reviews and changes its position
in support of quotas for European banana imports as from next year when a
single European market is created.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador's bonanza threatened by
EC action - At a time of rising production, European sales are at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECUADOR'S BANANA bonanza, which brought in USDollars 715m last year, is
threatened by mounting production and the European Community measures to
limit Latin American access to the European market.
Despite growing competition from countries with lower transport costs, such
as Colombia and, more recently, Venezuela and Mexico, Ecuador more than
doubled exports to Germany last year, but producers are extremely worried
about future European sales.
'These countries sell us free market policies but don't apply this
themselves. We're dismantling our tariffs while they are being
protectionist,' said economist Mr Luis Luna, under-secretary for foreign
trade.
So far, Germany, which has a higher banana consumption level than most other
European countries and also provides a channel to the east European
countries, has not charged levies on banana imports.
Tariffs and quotas to protect more expensive bananas produced in the former
African, Caribbean and Pacific colonies of EC members, would bring 'a
significant reduction in Ecuadorian exports - the price in Germany would
rise and demand would drop. It's not just a question of helping us, the
producer, it's the banana consumers, too,' explained Mr Luna.
Nearly one-third of Ecuador's 2.7m tonnes of banana exports went to Germany,
Belgium, Italy and Greece in 1991. Sales to eastern Europe have declined -
Yugoslavia was an important market - while there is little prospect of
compensating for the drop in earnings from the EC with exports to other
parts of the world.
Apart from the EC issue, Ecuador faces the problems of growing international
supply and overblown domestic production. The increase in world demand in
1990 and 1991 pushed up prices and encouraged new plantations, which are now
coming into production. Although the National Banana Programme (PNB) only
gives new growing permits to producers with export contracts and adequate
technical back-up (including disease control), over 30,000 hectares (75,000
acres) of unauthorised plantations have sprung up in addition to the 105,000
ha registered under the programme.
Even the bigger, more modern plantations are not as productive as Costa
Rica's banana farms. But overall, production costs are lower and Ecuador is
well away from the hurricane zone. Sigatoka disease, which has spread
southwards from Esmeraldas to the main growing areas of Guayas, Los Rios and
El Oro, is a greater threat than climate.
Producers are critical of official efforts to control sigatoka, and this is
one of the main reasons behind the banana lobby's move to privatise the PNB.
As the programme is largely financed by contributions from the producers,
the government has had to listen, if unenthusiastically. The new government,
led by Mr Sixto Duran, due to take over on August 10, is more likely to be
responsive to the private sector's proposal.
Exporters are also pressing for a reduction in the export reference price,
currently set at USDollars 4.50 a 43 lb box. Although demand was strong at
the beginning of the year and sales rose to USDollars 287m in the first four
months, exporting companies are now feeling the foreign competition. Ecuador
sends some 44 per cent of its bananas to the US - other Latin American
producers are also better located for this market. On the other hand,
Ecuador has good access to New Zealand, Korea and Japan which, taken
together, account for over 10 per cent of exports.
The Ecuadorian government has taken the EC quota problem to the Gatt
(although it is not yet a member) and is co-ordinating marketing policy with
other 'dollar area' producers.
Both the trade ministry and president-elect Duran have mentioned the
possibility of retaliatory trade measures if EC countries insist on applying
restrictions from January 1993.

COFFEE prices recovered some of their recent losses at the London Futures
and Options Exchange, but traders said activity remained sluggish in the
absence of fundamental news. The September robustas position's Dollars 13
rise to Dollars 772 was 'on the back of New York', one explained. Dealers
said the potential for further advances was limited because several
producing countries were looking to sell at Dollars 10 to Dollars 20 above
present levels. The COCOA market also reversed its downtrend, with the
September position finishing at Pounds 597 a tonne, up Pounds 3 on the day,
about in the middle of the day's trading range. 'People are cautious at the
moment,' said one dealer, commenting on the low level of turnover. 'We're
waiting for origin news and anything out of the Geneva talks (on the
renegotiation of the moribund International Cocoa Agreement). At the London
Metal Exchange most metals reversed their recent downtrends. The exception
was TIN, which resumed the downward course that was interrupted on Tuesday.
Dealers attributed the Dollars 55 fall that took the cash position below the
Dollars 7,000-a-tonne mark to 'a negative technical outlook'.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper surge takes prices to
18-month highs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
COPPER PRICES yesterday continued to ignore widespread world economic gloom
and surged above Dollars 1.15 a lb (Dollars 2,534 a tonne) on the London
Metal Exchange, the highest levels for 18 months.
Many analysts had not expected to see copper, the most heavily-traded metal,
reach Dollars 1.15 until much later this year. Traders suggested substantial
Asian buying set the trend early yesterday and then some big merchant houses
followed suit. The price was also helped upwards by some short-covering
(hasty buying to cover their positions by organisations that had sold metal
they did not own in the expectation of lower prices in future).
There was some profit-taking later but the price did not dip very far and
copper for delivery in three months closed in London at Dollars 2,545 a
tonne, up Dollars 30 from Tuesday's close.
While some analysts suggested that world economic conditions did not justify
copper's recent price rise - it has jumped from just over Dollars 1 a lb at
the begining of July - Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, pointed out
that copper supply and demand were finely balanced and demand was widely
expected to increase next year.
He said that while copper demand in Japan was reflecting slowing economic
growth there, the Chinese might well buy about 200,000 tonnes this year -
'which would take up all the slack from Japan'.
Mr Arnold said: 'Copper is more likely to go up (in price) than to drop
sharply from now on'. He predicted the price would reach Dollars 1.20 a lb
(Dollars 2,645 a tonne) in the fourth quarter of 1992. However, he dismissed
the idea that copper could reach Dollars 1.50 a lb because such a price was
'crazy'.
Copper demand in Asia will continue to grow in the 1990s, especially in the
newly industrialised economies of South-east Asia, Mr Douglas C. Yearly,
chairman of US producer Phelps Dodge Corporation, told an investment
seminar, reports Reuter from Tokyo.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Timor Gap seismic work past
mid-stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OIL COMPANIES working in the Timor Gap have completed more than half their
seismic programme agreed earlier this year and the first exploration well is
scheduled for December.
Officials of the Australia-Indonesia Joint Authority for the Timor Gap Zone
of Co-operation say over 26,000 km (16,000 miles) of seismic work has been
completed since 11 contract areas were designated between December 1991 and
last February.
The contracts commited companies to six-year exploration programmes worth
Dollars 362m, under which they must complete 52,100 km of seismic work and
drill 45 exploration wells.
The Timor Gap is an offshore area of about 60,000 sq km between Indonesia
and Australia. A dispute between the two countries over rights to the area
was resolved by a treaty of co-operation, which came into effect in February
1991.
The first well is to be drilled by the Australian subsidiary of Marathon
Oil, a US-based company. A Marathon official said on Tuesday that a tender
for a drilling vessel would be placed soon and a further four wells were
scheduled for next year.
Marathon is leading a consortium of Santos and Korea Petroleum in two
contract areas and is commited to a Dollars 76m programme to drill 12 wells
and conduct 10,000 km of seismic work. Other companies holding a stake in
the contract areas include Shell, BP, Phillips and Enterprise Oil.
The acreage agreements provide for production to be shared equally between
the Joint Authority and the contractor, after recovery costs, up to the
first 50,000 barrels. The governments of Indonesia and Australia are equal
partners in the joint authority.
Industry officials say the Timor Gap is a largely unknown territory for oil
exploration. Only one well has previously been drilled in the area, 14 years
ago, which found some gas and indicated the presence of hydrocarbons but not
in commercial quantities.

stock index trading

THE OSAKA Stock Exchange (OSE) may be about to implement further controls on
its Nikkei 225 stock futures, despite signs of a shift in business to
Singapore.
Mr Hiroshi Yamanouchi, president of the OSE, said yesterday that further
restrictions on stock index trading could be imposed if there was evidence
of volatility in the underlying cash market.
Futures and options - an area of trading in which foreign brokers have been
notably successful - have been blamed by the Japanese financial authorities
for distorting the cash market.
Official fingers have also been pointed at arbitrage trading - trading to
take advantage of the price differences between the stock futures and cash
markets - for exaggerating the falls in share prices.
Restrictions on trading in stock index futures, including shorter trading
hours, higher margin requirements and commissions, and limits in price
movements, have been implemented by the OSE six times during the past two
years.
The average daily volume of conventional share trading on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange was 263m for the first six months of 1992. This is 75 per cent down
on the peak levels of 1988.
There is no shortage of Japanese brokers claiming that price fluctuation
created by futures and arbitrage trading on the OSE are scaring investors
away.
One by-product of trading restrictions is that the OSE is beginning to lose
business to the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex), where the
Nikkei 225 futures can also be traded. The tighter regulations have reduced
liquidity and limited price movements on the OSE.
Average trading volume in the Osaka Nikkei 225 futures for the first six
months of this year has fallen 42 per cent to 52,972 contracts. On Simex,
trading has surged 4.8 times to 10,692 contracts.
An OSE official said the moves to regulate futures trading were experiments
to see whether futures trading affected the cash market. 'Since the cash
market has not recovered despite the restrictions, many critics of futures
and options trading seem to be reviewing their arguments,' he said.

FT  16 JUL 92 / International Bonds: BASF launches Dollars 200m issue aimed
at retail investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVOUS conditions in the international bond market ahead of today's
Bundesbank council meeting kept most investors and potential issuers on the
sidelines yesterday.
With most investment institutions waiting to see if the German authorities
will tighten monetary conditions before committing funds, the only new
issues were aimed at retail investors and denominated in North American
currencies.
BASF, the German chemicals and industrial group, launched a Dollars 200m
seven-year deal, lead-managed by Deutsche Bank. The 7 per cent bonds were
re-offered to investors at a fixed price of par.
At this level the yield was 45 basis points more than US Treasury paper.
The pricing was seen as too tight by underwriting firms with a predominantly
institutional client base. However, banks with strong retail placement into
Germany and Switzerland, including the lead manager, reported no problems in
selling the bonds.
BASF does not carry an official credit rating, but has been assigned an
implied AA2 rating by Moody's Investors Service without its permission.
Goldman Sachs raised CDollars 150m five-year funds through a deal which it
lead-managed. The 8 1/2 per cent bonds were also aimed at retail investors
and priced to yield a full 1 per cent more than Canadian government paper.
The yield was seen as generous by participants and the bonds sold quickly.
Comision Federal de Electricidad, Mexico's state-owned electricity
distributor, launched a Dollars 100m five-year issue lead-managed by
Citicorp Investment Bank. Although the issue was the first by this borrower,
the bonds were priced to yield 210 basis points more than US Treasury bonds
 -in line with the secondary market yield of other Mexican state agency
bonds.
Matsushita's Dollars 1bn 10-year global bond issue was priced to yield 41
basis points more than Treasury bonds, at the tighter end of an indicated
41-43 basis point range already considered tight by some bankers.
However, co-managers reported no problems in placing their relatively small
allocations of bonds. Most said demand from Japanese investors was stronger
than anticipated, with European investors showing less appetite for
registered, corporate bonds.
The deal was the first global bond issue by a corporation.
Lehman Brothers, which joint lead-managed the transaction with Credit Suisse
First Boston and therefore underwrote a larger slice of the deal, said it
sold some large blocks of bonds to European institutional investors.

FT  16 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Beijing connection should
prove to be just the ticket - Cathay Pacific's share sale to Chinese
companies underlines a growing trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE purchase by Chinese companies of a further 10 per cent of Cathay Pacific
underlines a growing trend in Hong Kong for owners of business franchises to
seek a mainland partner.
China National Aviation Corporation, a subsidiary of China Aviation
Administration Corporation (CAAC), and China Travel Service each bought a 5
per cent stake in the airline from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for nearly
HKDollars 3.4bn (USDollars 440m).
The deal was not about forging an all-China aviation and travel alliance,
but about Cathay safeguarding its post-1997 future.
Although both companies approached Cathay about purchasing a stake in the
airline, it was more than willing to act as go-between for them and Hongkong
Bank. It was singularly well placed to do so as its chairman sits on the
bank's board.
In spite of the Swire group's generally good relations with Beijing, Cathay
 -in which Swire Pacific owns a 51.8 per cent interest - has had more than
its fair share of problems with CAAC. CAAC resents Cathay's pre-eminent
position in Hong Kong and would dearly love to have aviation rights which
would allow it to operate out of Hong Kong.
CAAC is a very powerful corporation in China, with important contacts in
China's military.
It is believed to be behind the difficulties the British and Hong Kong
governments are having with China over the ratification of air service
agreements with third countries.
However, as one senior Cathay executive noted this week, the company hoped
that CAAC's 5 per cent holding would improve co-operation and communication
between the two. 'We hope that it will help CAAC to accept that a successful
Cathay Pacific is in their interests,' he said.
Cathay's post-1997 future is underwritten by the Joint Declaration on Hong
Kong which the UK and China signed in 1984. It provided for Hong Kong
remaining a 'centre of international and regional aviation' and said that
airlines incorporated in Hong Kong 'may continue to operate'.
The company's fortunes depend, therefore, on the way China manages Hong Kong
after 1997 and the extent to which it observes the letter and spirit of the
Joint Declaration. But Swire does have good connections in China, and Cathay
has forged an alliance with Beijing-controlled Citic Pacific to run
Dragonair - a small carrier plying the profitable China routes, in
competition with CAAC, and now branching out to Thailand, Vietnam, and
southern Japan.
To many of the colony's leading businessmen there is no better way of
safeguarding Hong Kong's future than by China having a direct commercial
stake in the place.
That stake is large, and growing. It has been estimated that the mainland
has invested USDollars 10bn directly in the colony. That figure does not
count its exposure to the stock market which, while unknown, is believed to
be great. Next to US and British investors, mainland interest have been
leading players in taking the Hang Seng index to above the 6,000 level.
In spite of the colony's free-wheeling image, many aspects of its economy
are tightly regulated by the government - a government which in five years'
time will be part of the People's Republic of China.
Keeping on the right side of government has therefore added piquancy in Hong
Kong. Many of the old British companies in the colony are dependent on the
continuing goodwill of the Chinese authorities for their survival.
Ever since Jardine Matheson shocked Hong Kong in 1984 with its decision to
move its domicile to Bermuda, the large and not so large of the colony's
businesses have sought refuge from an uncertain future through various ways,
many involving tie-ups with Beijing-controlled entities.
Part of the reason for the Hongkong Bank's acquisition of Midland Bank was
to diversify its asset base away from Hong Kong. Its headquarters are now in
London and its lead regulator is there. Others have had to make their
accommodations on the ground in Hong Kong.
In early 1990, Cable and Wireless sold 20 per cent of Hongkong
Telecommunications - the colony's monopoly supplier of telecoms - to
Beijing-owned Citic Hong Kong. In 1987, it acquired 12.5 per cent of Cathay
Pacific, which it sold last year to its listed subsidiary, Citic Pacific.
Citic Pacific is run by Mr Larry Yung, the son of Citic's chairman Mr Rong
Yiren - known as China's 'red capitalist'.
Operators of Hong Kong's container terminal have seen it in their interests
to involve mainland partners in their business.
In April, Modern Terminals Limited, arranged for China Merchants to take a
15 per cent interest in the company at a cost of USDollars 175m. In 1989,
Hutchison Whampoa sold China Resources a 10 per cent interest in Hongkong
International Terminals for HKDollars 1.32bn.
Only the electricity and gas industries have been immune from this trend.
Neither Hongkong Electric, which is controlled by Hutchison Whampoa, nor
China Light and Power (CLP), which is controlled by the Kadoorie family,
have felt the need to involve China in a direct equity participation.
However, CLP has given China something it needs: technology transfer.
It was instrumental in building China's first commercial nuclear power plant
with Electricite de France at Daya Bay, north-west of Hong Kong. It also
supplies Guangdong with electricity generated by its thermal power plants.

WORLD International, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir Yue-kong
Pao's listed corporate empire, announced a 5 per cent increase in profits
which totalled HKDollars 976.5m (USDollars 126.3m) after tax and minority
interests for the year to March 1992.
This included only a nine-month contribution from 44 per cent-owned
associate Wharf Holdings, the largest group company, which changed its
accounting year-end from March to December. With an annualised contribution
from Wharf, the parent company would have registered a 24 per cent rise in
profit.
Group earnings were boosted by a strong performance from Hongkong Realty and
Trust, the property development company, which announced its profits had
increased by 104 per cent to HKDollars 586m.
Retailing contributions remained weak, with luxury store operator Lane
Crawford showing only marginal growth, due to the impact of the Gulf war and
to increased competition from Japanese department stores and other luxury
boutiques in Hong Kong.
The outlook for World is positive for the current year. Growth is expected
to come from the sale of its Parc Oasis property development and from an
improving retail environment.
Wharf also is expected to increase substantially its property portfolio, and
it will make a full-year contribution to earnings.
World has focused on the potential for growth of the Pearl River delta.
Mr Peter Woo, chairman, said that the company had purchased a 99,000 sq ft
site in central Guangzhou (Canton) for a joint venture residential and
commercial development.
The company is looking at a number of other property developments across the
Chinese border.
Earnings per share increased to 47.7 cents from 45.3 cents and the directors
recommended a 17 per cent increase in the dividend pay-out to 24.5 cents per
share, up from 21 cents.

ANGLOVAAL, the South African mining company, announced a rise in combined
taxed profits for its four gold mines to R48.6m (Dollars 15.4m) in the
quarter ending June 30, compared with R42.3m in the preceding quarter,
Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
The rise was due to improved tonnages and grades at three of the four mines,
as well as cost-cutting measures.
The group's gold production rose to 10,408 kg from 10,190 kg. Loraine Gold
Mines was the only mine to report a loss, which was the result of
retrenchment costs of R4.8m. Hartebeestfontein was the only mine to pay tax.

<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's petrochemical companies are seeing a contraction of their
profits in spite of expanding capacity and a high level of exports, AP-DJ
reports from Seoul.
The Trade and Industry Ministry said Korean companies exported
petrochemicals worth Dollars 1.1bn in the first five months of this year, a
rise of 82 per cent from Dollars 605m for the same period in 1991. The
ministry hoped petrochemical exports would reach Dollars 2.4bn in 1992.
However, according to a preliminary study by Daewoo Securities, many
companies, including Hanyang Chemicals and Lucky, were expected to report
only small increases or a fall in earnings for the first half of the year,
even though their sales were expected to rise by about 10 per cent. Dongbu
Chemicals was expected to report a loss, said Mr Lee Bong-shik, a manager at
Daewoo Securities.
A supply glut has forced companies to cut prices of some products to half
the previous year's levels.
To compete with low-cost south-east Asian producers, Korean companies have
been shipping products at prices which cover only essential costs.
Korean petrochemical companies ship 80 per cent of their exports to the
south-east Asian region, where many petrochemical plants are under
construction. But other south-east Asian countries are expected to restrain
imports to protect their fledgling industries.

FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Asset sales boost First American

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST AMERICAN Bankshares, the Washington-based bank that, according to the
US Federal Reserve, was secretly and illegally controlled by the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), announced a quarterly
profit for the first time in two years.
The bank, which suffered heavy losses in 1991, said it achieved net profits
of Dollars 8.2m in the three months ended June 30. This compared with a
Dollars 59.3m loss a year ago.
The 1992 second-quarter results were boosted by Dollars 10.1m of gains on
the sale of First American assets in Georgia and Dollars 7.4m of gains on
the sale of securities.
Mr George Davis, named chief executive of First American last January, said
plans for the sale of all the bank's assets were going ahead.
He said the Federal Reserve last Friday approved the bank's capital plan and
its timetable for the asset sale.
Total assets of First American, which in 1991 fell from Dollars 11bn to
Dollars 8.4bn, declined to Dollars 6.5bn in the first six months of 1992.
The decrease was attributed to the Georgia asset disposal, continued weak
demand for loans and a lower level of investments.
The bank's total equity base, which shrank last year from Dollars 711m to
Dollars 422m, declined to Dollars 398.6m by the end of last month. Deposits,
which fell from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 7.1bn, slumped to Dollars 5.6bn in
the first half of 1992.
The bank attributed Dollars 841.4m of the decrease to the sale of Georgia
assets and the balance to the run-off of certificates of deposit.
Non-performing assets were Dollars 585m at the end of the second quarter,
down from Dollars 629m at the end of last year.
The bank's trusteeship plan would implement a March 1991 Fed order that
instructed BCCI to divest itself of shares in First American held by Credit
&amp; Commerce American Holdings NV (CCAH), an offshore holding vehicle that
featured several nominee shareholders described by the Fed last year as
'front men' for BCCI.
Controversy over First American has focused largely on state and federal
investigations of Mr Clark Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, respectively the
former chairman and president of the bank, who resigned last August.
Both have denied having known of BCCI's secret control of First American,
although former BCCI officials have testified in the US Senate to the
contrary. First American itself has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

MOTOROLA, the electronics and semiconductor manufacturer, reported a 23 per
cent rise in second-quarter net income, powered by strong sales increases in
most of its product areas.
The company reported net income of Dollars 146m, or Dollars 1.09 a share,
compared with Dollars 119m, or 90 cents, in the same period of last year.
Sales rose from Dollars 2.8bn to Dollars 3.14bn.
For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 273m, or
Dollars 2.05 a share, compared with Dollars 235m, or Dollars 1.78, on sales
which rose from Dollars 5.56bn to Dollars 6.20bn.
Motorola's semiconductor products sales rose 21 per cent to Dollars 1.08bn
and operating profits from the section increased.
The company said all sales regions saw strong order growth, apart from
Japan.
Orders rose most rapidly in the communications, distribution, personal
computer/workstation and consumer markets. In communications businesses,
sales grew 11 per cent to Dollars 972m and operating profits rose.
General systems sales rose 11 per cent to Dollars 821m, but operating
profits were flat. Information systems saw sales up to Dollars 160m and made
a profit, against a loss a year ago.
The automotive and industrial electronics group lifted sales 8 per cent but
operating profits were lower.
Motorola said it would be adopting during the fourth quarter a new
accounting standard for post retiree health benefits and this was expected
to entail an obligation of Dollars 190m to Dollars 300m, which would be
recognised immediately.

POLAROID, the US photography group, unveiled a 32.5 per cent improvement in
second-quarter net income to Dollars 35.5m from Dollars 26.8m a year
earlier.
Polaroid's 1991 results were distorted by a pre-tax gain of Dollars 11m
which was partly offset by preferred dividend payments of Dollars 10.1m.
The company retired its preferred stock towards the end of 1991, so there
were no preferred dividend payments in the latest quarter.
Polaroid had primary earnings per share of 74 cents in the latest quarter
against 33 cents last year.
Sales advanced 7 per cent to Dollars 557.7m from Dollars 521.4m. US sales
grew 4 per cent to Dollars 300.6m, while international sales rose 11 per
cent to Dollars 257.1m, due partly to a weaker US dollar.
Mr I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's chairman and chief executive, has not
changed the company's earnings projections for the full year.
'We still believe we can meet our 1992 financial goals and deliver a level
of profitability that approximates 1991's operating performance,' he said.
He added that the company was tightly managing expenditures because of the
uncertain and difficult worldwide economy.
Polaroid will incur higher marketing expenses when it launches two new
products later this year.
The company benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the latest quarter
of 34 per cent, compared with 44 per cent the previous year.
Polaroid said shipments of all of its significant product lines increased
during the quarter.
For the first half, Polaroid had net income of Dollars 41.7m, or 86 cents,
against Dollars 43.2m, or 46 cents in the same period of 1991. Sales rose 3
per cent to Dollars 989m.

GENERAL MOTORS said it would eliminate about 4,725 jobs in the

The company said the cuts were part of the 9,000 white collar jobs it had
planned to eliminate by the end of 1992.
It added that the job cuts and other changes were the latest big management
move in the creation of GM's North American Operations (NAO), which now
manages GM's North American vehicle and components operations.
GM plans to reduce its 13,500-employee central corporate by 70 per cent or

CAE Industries of Canada has settled for USDollars 55.9m a USDollars 231m
action filed by the US government against its CAE-Link subsidiary.
CAE-Link will pay USDollars 22.5m. BiCoastal of the US is responsible for
the balance.
CAE Industries, the world's leading commercial flight simulator builder, did
not admit liability in the case. The US Department of Justice claimed
CAE-Link, which specialises in military systems and training, overcharged
the government on contracts carried out between 1983 and 1988, and sought
triple damages.
Link was owned by the former Singer Corp at the time of the alleged
offences. CAE Industries bought Link in August 1988 and, in November 1989,
Singer filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and became BiCoastal.
CAE maintained it did not know of any pending lawsuits when it bought Link.
The Justice Department, as part of the settlement, agreed CAE-Link did not
admit liability, legal fault or responsibility for the alleged offences.
Senior creditors led by the Royal Bank of Canada, and owed about CDollars
1bn (USDollars 800m), have agreed to exchange debt for stock in a new
company emerging from the restructuring of Central Capital, a fast-growing
financial services group.

<TEXT>
MAYTAG, the US household appliance group, yesterday said deteriorating
business in Europe offset improved North American sales and resulted in a
slightly lower operating net for its second quarter, Reuter reports.
The group reported a net profit of Dollars 23.3m, or 22 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 18.8m, or 18 cents, after a charge of Dollars 10m, or
6 cents for a plant closure.
Maytag said results were slightly lower when compared with year-ago net
before the charge. Sales edged down to Dollars 770m from Dollars 778m a year
ago.
The company's North American appliance group had sales of Dollars 567.4m,
against Dollars 566.8m a year ago. But operating income of Dollars 46.3m was
off 10 per cent because of start-up costs for a new dishwasher plant and
several new electric range models, and the cost of discontinuing operations
at its previous dishwasher facility.

DESPITE record shipments, weak aluminium prices continued to depress
earnings at Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group.
The company reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 33.1m, or 56 cents
per share, a 46 per cent drop from last year's Dollars 61.4m, or Dollars
1.04. Revenues in the quarter ended June 30 were Dollars 1.49bn, compared
with Dollars 1.52bn a year ago.
Shipments were a record 393,400 metric tons, up 3.6 per cent from 379,700
last year.
Reynolds' efforts to cut costs helped contribute to earnings in spite of the
poor prices, according to Mr Richard Holder, chairman.
He said demand was up, particularly in the US, and the company and the
industry were seeing strong order rates. However, prices remained weak
because of continued worldwide oversupply due to recession in some
countries, substantial new capacity in the industry, and CIS exports.
Mr Holder said he expected producer inventories to continue to rise
moderately and for prices to remain weak through the summer. However, he
believed prospects should improve in the autumn.
The company's shipments have increased for cans, consumer and packaging
products, residential building materials and international fabricated
products.
In the first half, net income was Dollars 46.4m, or 78 cents per share, on
revenues of Dollars 2.82bn, compared with Dollars 88.9m, or Dollars 1.50, on
revenues of Dollars 2.89 last year. Shipments in the first half were 727,100
metric tons, up from 701,800 a year ago.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which is selling off peripheral
businesses, yesterday reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 65m from
continuing operations, up from Dollars 33m in the same period of last year.
The 1991 figure excluded a Dollars 140m gain from a tax adjustment, which
pushed last year's income figure up to Dollars 173m.
The company sold its Cessna business aircraft operations in the first
quarter of this year, and is in the process of selling other businesses with
combined turnover of some Dollars 2bn.
It recently completed a tender offer in which it will spend Dollars 957m to
buy back shares from investors. The plan involves returning to shareholders
the excess cash being generated by the disposal programme.
The company's results from continuing operations worked through to earnings
of Dollars 1.48 a share, compared with 77 cents in 1991 without the tax
gain, and Dollars 4.06 with the gain. Sales in both periods totalled Dollars
1.6bn.
Earnings from the businesses up for sale, which are not included in
continuing operations, totalled Dollars 21m, compared with Dollars 38m a
year ago. However, the 1991 total included Dollars 17m from the now-sold
Cessna.
The company's tactical military aircraft operations recorded operating
earnings of Dollars 49m, up from Dollars 45m, while nuclear submarines made
Dollars 21m, compared with Dollars 20m; armoured vehicles Dollars 28m,
against Dollars 25m; and space launch systems made a reduced loss of Dollars
7m, compared with Dollars 25m.
The figures were also helped by the first-quarter retirement of Dollars 350m
in debt, with net interest outgoings of Dollars 12m last year becoming a
Dollars 7m inflow this quarter.

FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: US pulp and paper group breaks
even for quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGIA-PACIFIC, the US forest products group, has reported break-even
results for the second quarter, with a sharp drop in pulp and paper profits
partly offset by a big rise in lumber income.
The company announced earlier this month that its results would be 'slightly
better than break-even' . This proved worse than analysts' expectations and
produced a drop in its share price.
The break-even figure, compared with net income of Dollars 29m, or 34 cents
a share, in the second quarter of last year when the company was helped by a
Dollars 29m after-tax gain on the sale of forests. Sales for the latest
quarter, at Dollars 3bn, were unchanged from last year.
The building products side reported operating profits of Dollars 163m, up
from Dollars 132m, while paper and pulp dropped from Dollars 105m to Dollars
42m.
Mr Marshall Hahn, chairman, said although pulp prices and demand had
continued to improve, the company's communication papers, tissue and
bleached board businesses continued to face excess capacity and depressed
prices. Demand remained strong in container board.
For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 5m, or 6
cents a share, on sales of Dollars 5.88bn, against a net loss of Dollars
44m, or 51 cents, last year on sales of Dollars 5.76bn.

DUN &amp; BRADSTREET, a leading US business information group, yesterday posted
second-quarter net income of Dollars 128.8m, or 72 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 119.1m, or 67 cents, a year ago.
The company has restated its 1991 results to reflect new accounting
standards and the recognition of revenue for software services.
Revenues eased slightly to Dollars 1.16bn from Dollars 1.17bn, reflecting
the divestiture of the communications unit of the company's IMS
International division.
Revenue growth for Dun &amp; Bradstreet's current portfolio of businesses rose
about 3 per cent in the quarter.
For the first six months, the company had net income of Dollars 227m, or
Dollars 1.27, against Dollars 217.5m, or Dollars 1.22 a year earlier.
Operating revenue slipped to Dollars 2.27bn from Dollars 2.29bn.
The company said it texpected growth for the year to exceed that of 1991,
but did not expect to 'get all the way to Dun &amp; Bradstreet's long-term
goals'. It also expects second-half earnings per share to be stronger than
in the first half in spite of the uncertain worldwide economic outlook.

AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical group, yesterday turned in
second-quarter net income of Dollars 296.1m, or 94 cents a share, up 12 per
cent from the previous year's earnings of Dollars 265.2m, or 84 cents.
Sales in the three months to June 30 rose 8 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from
1.62bn.
Although sales and earnings hit record second-quarter levels, the rate of
growth slowed from the first quarter, and Wall Street was disappointed with
the results.
At mid-session, shares in American Home Products were Dollars 1 7/8 lower at
Dollars 73 in active trading.
For the first half of 1992, the company's net income rose 14 per cent to
Dollars 702.4m, or Dollars 2.23, from Dollars 617.7m, or Dollars 1.96. Sales
grew 11 per cent to Dollars 3.75bn from 3.38bn.
Sales growth was led by the company's pharmaceuticals operations, which saw
second-quarter sales rise 12 per cent to Dollars 1.04bn.
Consumer healthcare sales advanced 7 per cent to Dollars 314.8m, while
medical supplies and diagnostic products recorded sales of Dollars 195.9m,
up 2 per cent in the quarter.

<TEXT>
SPRINT, the third-largest US long-distance telephone company, yesterday
reported a 6 per cent increase in second-quarter net income. The improvement
came despite a sharp drop in profits from its long-distance business because
of new product marketing.
The company reported net income of Dollars 94m, or 43 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 2.28bn, compared with income of Dollars 89m, or 41
cents, on sales of Dollars 2.21bn, in the same period of last year
However, its long-distance income totalled Dollars 45m on revenues of
Dollars 1.38bn, down from Dollars 73m on revenues of Dollars 1.36bn last
year. Long-distance time bought increased by 3.3 per cent.
Mr William Esrey, chairman, blamed the profits decline on increased sales,
marketing, and advertising expenses in the launch of three new products,
aimed mainly at the residential and small business markets.
Those products, in turn, reflect the intense competition for market share
between Sprint and its larger long-distance rivals, AT&amp;T and MCI.
Sprint's local telephone operations, which are shielded from full
competition, reported a 7 per cent increase in operating income, from
Dollars 166m to Dollars 178m, on revenues up from Dollars 696m to Dollars
743m. The company said access lines had grown at an annual rate of 3.5 per
cent during 1992.
The company's other businesses produced operating income of Dollars 16m on
revenues of Dollars 219m, up from Dollars 15m on revenues of Dollars 217m.
For the first half, Sprint reported net income of Dollars 230m, or Dollars
1.05 a share, up from Dollars 173m, or 79 cents, in the first half of last
year.
The 1992 figure was helped by an accounting change worth 17 cents a share.
Excluding that, net income was up 12 per cent. Revenues totalled Dollars
4.49bn, against Dollars 4.37bn.

stake

   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotels group, has topped bids by rival hotel
groups Intercontinental and Ramada to win control of the Duna
Intercontinental, one of Hungary's leading hotels.
Marriott will pay more than Dollars 20m for the state shareholding in the
hotel, a price which was influenced by the shortage of hotel space and prime
sites for development in Budapest.
The Duna Intercontinental went to Marriott after three rounds of bidding
described by the State Property Agency, the Hungarian privatisation
authority, as a close battle.
The SPA admitted it would have been easier to sell the hotel to the
Intercontinental group, whose bid was a close second. It already held a
franchise agreement with Hungarhotels, the Hungarian state hotel chain which
operated the Duna Intercontinental.
But the agency said it had not managed to come to terms with
Intercontinental on a valuation of the franchise contract. Moreover, the SPA
feels that its decision dispels scepticism about its commitment to
competitive bidding in substance as well as form.
The transaction is the first belated result of Hungary's two-year drive to
privatise Hungarhotels, Danubius and Pannonia, the three state-owned hotel
chains.
With the revenues from the disposals of individual hotels, the authorities
are trying to reduce the hotel groups' debts and make the pared-down chains
more attractive candidates for privatisation.
The government plans this autumn to float Danubius and Pick Szeged, the meat
and salami producer. These will be sold off through the stock market,
reviving this form of privatisation.
Preference will be given to small domestic investors in both privatisation
issues, whose planned structure bears strong parallels to the British model.
Under consideration, at least for the Pick public offering, are price
discounts of about 10 per cent, deferred payment or bonus shares.
Nevertheless, the agency said there would be plenty of shares left for
international investors.
James Capel, the UK investment bank advising on both transactions, said that
Danubius would seek a listing on SEAQ International in London. The advisers
said they would try to place privately about 40 per cent of Pick, mainly in
the US.
Danubius and Pick will be among the largest privatisation issues so far in
eastern Europe.
James Capel executives said that the Danubius issue, for about 50 per cent
of the company, would be worth more than Dollars 100m. The advisers hope
that the Pick offering, for about 70 per cent, would raise about half that.
Pick is one of Hungary's largest food producers, with sales of Ft10.5bn
(Dollars 135m) last year, on which the company made Ft640m profits pretax.
The announcement marks a change of emphasis for Hungary after two years in
which foreign, mainly multinational investors have dominated privatisation
and the process has lost some public support.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI FURNITURE Group's public offer of shares attracted 16,654 applications
in total covering 60.3m shares - 44 per cent of the 137m shares available.
The rest will be taken up by sub-underwriters.
However, sub-underwriters to the issue applied for 39.6m of the 60.3m
shares, leaving retail applications covering 20.7m shares, worth Pounds
23.8m at the 115p offer price. There were 379 applications from employees
for a total of 432,000 shares.
Of the shares applied for by sub-underwriters, 26.2m can be offset against
underwriting commitments and another 13.4m shares were in excess of their
sub-underwriting commitments.
Sub-underwriters still receive their commissions when they offset shares
applied for against their commitments.
The numbers underline the recent trend of retail investors shunning public
offers.
The institutions who bought stock through the placing of 410.2m shares also
sub-underwrote the public offer in the same proportions.
Bankers said sub-underwriters would have known, given market conditions,
that the offer would not be fully subscribed and so were sure of getting a
proportion of their underwriting commitments.
They said that by applying for shares under the offset arrangements they
showed a desire to be sure of getting stock. Those which applied for
additional shares may have felt it would be difficult to buy a large number
when dealings start on Friday, given that a fairly high proportion of the
shares are in firm hands.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUPITER Tyndall Merlin, the fund management group, yesterday announced it
was in discussions with an investment trust over the possibility of an offer
being made for Pacific Horizon Investment Trust.
The announcement provoked another round of controversy in the long-running
attempt to restructure the trust.
Last month, Jupiter Tyndall blocked a bid by Martin Currie Pacific Trust for
Pacific Horizon, whose funds it manages. The directors of Pacific Horizon
had unanimously recommended the Martin Currie bid.
Jupiter Tyndall has also announced plans to restructure Pacific Horizon.
Yesterday it said its discussions with the investment trust involved 'an
offer being made for the whole of the share capital and outstanding warrants
in Pacific Horizon on terms which would be significantly better than those
which were available under the offer from Martin Currie Pacific.'
The announcement provoked an angry response from the board of Pacific
Horizon, which said it was extremely concerned that, 'a proposal of this
kind should be notified to it by way of public announcement and that the
Jupiter Group did not notify the board of its discussions in advance'.
It said it was not aware of the proposals' terms or of the identity of the
offerer.
The directors also invited the offerer to come forward and make itself known
to them.
Jupiter Tyndall is requisitioning an extraordinary meeting of Pacific
Horizon to appoint new directors and consider restructuring proposals.
Pacific Horizon directors said they had written to Jupiter Tyndall
requesting it to withdraw its requisition until it was clear whether an
offer had been made.
They said that it would be a 'flagrant waste of Pacific Horizon's funds' to
convene and hold a meeting while the possibility of a new offer existed.

include a maximum of 150,000 ordinary shares, with the balance in cash.
Cogehalles produced turnover of FFr113m in 1991, and its net assets were
FFr3.5m.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Purchase helps Wyko contain downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WYKO, the West Midlands-based distributor and manufacturer of bearings and
power transmission components, saw pre-tax profits drop by nearly 10 per
cent and acknowledged the fall would have been sharper but for the
acquisition of EW Bearings.
Performance improved in the second half, enabling the group to announce
profits of Pounds 1.38m for the year ended March 31 1992, compared with
Pounds 1.52m. Turnover rose from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 55.5m.
Earnings per share, on capital enlarged by the share issue to finance last
October's purchase of EW Bearings, were 2.37p, against 4.2p.
However, the dividend, with a final of 1.4p, is maintained at 2.8p after
taking Pounds 238,000 from reserves.
Mr Philip White, chairman and chief executive, justified the maintenance of
the dividend as a reflection of future trading prospects, and on the grounds
that the balance sheet was strong - gearing fell over the year from 59 per
cent to 24 per cent.
The acquisition of EW Bearings led to both expansion and rationalisation of
Wyko's UK distribution network, which increased its operating profit while
that of the UK manufacturing and international divisions declined. Group
operating profit of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 1.53m) would have been less than
Pounds 950,000 without EW Bearings.
This year Wyko expected further benefits from the rationalisation of the UK
distribution network although Mr White said 'demand is patchy' and that
'there are ebbs and flows in the recovery process.'
Although he was 'a little more optimistic than pessimistic' about the
immediate prospects, he noted that 'it is probably more realistic to accept
that prevailing business circumstances were unlikely to improve
significantly during 1992.'

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Anglia Homes losses exceed Pounds 5m - Net
borrowings remain at three times shareholders' funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD NEWS continues to surface from Britain's highly depressed housing
sector.
Yesterday, Anglia Secure Homes, the retirement homes specialist, revealed
that pre-tax losses had risen to Pounds 5.08m during the six months to
end-March.
That compared with a loss of Pounds 4.22m last time. Turnover in the first
half dropped from Pounds 11m to Pounds 6.57m.
That meant the group lost 77p for every Pounds 1 of sales. Losses per share
rose from 12.8p to 15.4p.
Mr Peter Edmondson, chairman, said that in the light of continuing losses
the group would not be paying an interim dividend.
Anglia last paid a dividend in respect of the 12 months to September 1989.
It has been hit hard by the collapse in demand for housing and particularly
for retirement homes. Mr Edmondson said yesterday that the market remained
appallingly weak.
Commercial Union, the insurance group, rescued Anglia in April 1990 when it
took a 12 per cent stake as part of a financial restructuring.
It also owns a 49 per cent stake in Haven Services - Anglia has the other 51
per cent - which provides management services for retirement homes for
Anglia and other companies.
Anglia, which had seen its share price tumble from a peak of 458p in March
1989 to 6 1/2 p at yesterday's close - down 5 1/2 p on the day - had been
selling its stock of completed homes in a bid to reduce debts.
These fell from Pounds 74.8m in early 1989 to Pounds 30.1m at the end of
March. Net borrowings, however, remained almost three times shareholders
funds of Pounds 10.8m.
The stock of unsold homes was reduced from more than 700 to 360 at the end
of March.
The group had reached the point where it needed to start building again  -
on just three sites - for the first time since the beginning of 1990.
Half year losses were struck after interest of Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.3m)
including Pounds 700,000 from write-off capitalised interest.
There was also an exceptional write-down against stock of Pounds 1m.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLARKE HOOPER, the troubled USM-traded sales promotion company, yesterday
announced a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.45m for 1991-92 as trading losses
due to the recession were compounded by exceptional losses from
rationalisation.
The loss for the year to end-April compared with a Pounds 2.05m profit last
time. Turnover fell 11 per cent to Pounds 44.5m as clients cut marketing
budgets. Pressure on margins resulted in swing from operating profits of
Pounds 2.18m to losses of Pounds 880,000.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 315,000 (Pounds 131,000) as net
borrowings rose to Pounds 3.97m (Pounds 2.66m). The company's bankers,
Robert Fleming and NatWest, commissioned a review of working capital
requirements and have renewed Clarke Hooper's facilities until June 1993.
The rationalisation programme led to exceptional items of Pounds 2.26m. The
workforce has fallen from 381 to 209. Ms Sue Archer, group finance director,
said no further cuts were planned.
Losses per share emerged at 12.9p (earnings 8.4p). No dividend is proposed -
a 4.4p total was paid previously.
The sale in May of Schmidt-Cannon International, a US marketing company, for
Dollars 2m (Pounds 1m) led to an extraordinary loss of Pounds 3.37m for
goodwill previously written off.
Retained losses for the year totalled Pounds 6.05m (profit Pounds 601,000).

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Proudfoot value drops 17.5% as shares
change hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET value of Alexander Proudfoot, the US-based but UK-listed
management consultant, dropped 17.5 per cent yesterday after a large block
of shares changed hands below the market price and amid continuing
uncertainty following a management shake-up.
The shares dropped 41p to 194p, their lowest since 1987, after 1.2m went
through the market at 200p early yesterday. Collins Stewart, the company's
joint broker, was believed to have handled the transaction.
Analysts have marked down profit forecasts for this year following a
cautious trading statement issued late on Monday, when the company also
announced the resignation of Mr Thomas Huhn, chief executive officer.
Mr Huhn sold nearly all his shares last year and at April 7 held only 50,000
shares via a family trust.
Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, yesterday held a series of meetings with
institutions. The company has been criticised for not telling the market
sooner that trading was tough.
'I've been assuring institutions that while things have not improved in our
markets, the company remains strongly cash positive,' he said.
The company held net cash of Pounds 21m at the end of last year, enough to
pay out nearly two years of dividends. But following yesterday's price fall,
the shares are yielding over 12 per cent.
The shares have fallen ever since the preliminary results were announced,
when they stood at 369p. Since then, former majority shareholder Invesco MIM
sold its remaining stake.
Mr Huhn's sudden departure has added to the market's confusion. An internal
review of the company's strategy was completed late last week and made no
mention of senior executive changes. Following a private meeting on Monday
with Lord Stevens, chairman of Proudfoot and Invesco MIM, Mr Huhn resigned
without warning.
He is being replaced by a management committee of Mr Hamilton and three
others, all based in the US.
Mr Hamilton said the new structure is similar to that used when the company
was private, before it reversed into City and Foreign Holdings in 1987.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Nuclear in the black with Pounds
13.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned company that operates Scotland's two
nuclear power stations, moved into the black for the first time in 1992 with
a net profit of Pounds 13.7m.
This compared with a loss of Pounds 32.5m in 1991 and was achieved in a year
of increased output, tight cost control and lower inflation.
Turnover, representing sales from the Hunterston B power station in Ayrshire
and Torness in East Lothian, rose 13 per cent to Pounds 477m.
Mr James Hann, chairman, said: 'So far, so good; but the company has a long
way to go and many issues to be resolved before we can be satisfied with our
financial performance.'
Mr Hann is engaged in a long-term campaign to improve the performance of the
company, which was carved out of the former South of Scotland Electricity
Board in 1989, and to rehabilitate the image of nuclear power in the UK.
He said the cost of SNL's electricity was beginning to compare favourably
with oil and coal-generated power.
Company executives make no secret of their desire to see SNL privatised. Mr
Hann said: 'I do believe that we are heading towards a position where under
certain circumstances the company will be privatised, but there are many
issues still to be addressed.'
SNL made an operating profit of Pounds 68.7m (Pounds 52.2m) but had to allow
Pounds 50.6m (Pounds 75.4m) to maintain the value of its Pounds 2bn
provisions for de-commissioning the advanced gas-cooled reactor stations.
Operating cost per unit of electricity was 3.21p before accounting for
historic liabilities. SNL does not benefit from the non-fossil fuel levy
which is paid by electricity users in England and Wales.
SNL supplies about 40 per cent of Scotland's electricity through its sales
to Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric. The load factor at Hunterston
B declined from 79.1 per cent in 1990-91 to 66.4 per cent, partly because of
mid-life maintenance work on one reactor. Torness's load factor rose from
38.6 per cent to 55.1 per cent because of improvements to its refuelling
system.
In January SNL reached agreement in principle with British Nuclear Fuels on
fixed-price fuel supply and reprocessing contracts worth Pounds 2.7bn over
the next 15 years. It is also applying to build dry stores for spent fuel at
Torness and Hunterston B which would save Pounds 45m on fuel cycle costs,
cutting 0.3p per unit from the cost of generating electricity.

shares
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Templeton Galbraith and Hansberger, the Bermuda-based
international fund management company, rose 20p to 309p yesterday following
confirmation that it had been approached by various financial managers
interested in 'a business combination.'
The company provided no details of the talks or of the suitors. However, it
is understood that two US financial services companies are engaged in
serious talks. Templeton's senior management, who control over 82 per cent
of the voting shares, are said to be concerned about protecting the
independence of its investment strategy.
A statement from the company said: 'All of these (talks) contemplate a
continuation of independent operations by the Templeton group with normal
service for clients and funds and the same investment personnel, policies
and methods.'
Templeton is also said to be interested in forming a partnership with a
larger firm which could give it access to greater distribution outlets. Sir
John Templeton, the founder and chairman, will be 80 in the autumn and is
said to be in good health.
Templeton manages roughly Dollars 19bn (Pounds 9.9bn) of funds, of which
Dollars 12bn is in the form of US-style mutual funds. An additional Dollars
4.6bn are pension fund assets while closed end investment trusts account for
Dollars 2.4bn of assets. Its investment style has been to seek international
equities with long-term growth prospects.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cray Electronics set to take Dowty arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRAY Electronics, the high technology group, is expected to emerge tomorrow
as the successful bidder for the information technology interests of Dowty
Group, now part of TI.
The Berkshire-based company, which is set to publish full-term figures
tomorrow, confirmed yesterday that it would be making an important
announcement at the same time.
TI said only that the company was still talking to prospective purchasers
but that one set of negotiations was 'going particularly well'.
It is understood, however, that the deal has been essentially sealed at a
purchase price of Pounds 50m-Pounds 55m.
TI acquired Dowty last month for Pounds 485m and made it clear it was
anxious to sell the information technology division quickly.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, chairman of TI, believes that Dowty's move into
that business, chiefly through the purchase of Case Communications, was a
costly error. The division last year made sales of Pounds 172m but failed to
produce a profit.
Cray, a small company specialising in software, telecommunications and
instrumentation, has returned to profitability under the guidance of new
management led by Sir Peter Michaels, who has made it clear he intends to
expand the company rapidly by acquisition.
Last year it made an initial bid for SD-Scicon, the UK software house
eventually acquired by EDS of the US.
Case Communications, which specialises in computer networking, was a rising
star in UK electronics until it struck problems in the US and was acquired
by Dowty in 1988 for about Pounds 80m.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bulmer up 19% in buoyant cider market -
Growth attributed to concentration on mainstream brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HP BULMER Holdings yesterday reported a 19 per cent increase in annual
profits as cider continued to grow despite the decline in the UK drinks
market as a whole.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to April 24 rose from Pounds 14.4m to
Pounds 17.1m on sales up 5 per cent to Pounds 221.9m.
The results, coming on the day that the share offer for Taunton Cider
closed, confirmed that the cider market is the one area of the UK drinks
market that is still growing despite recession.
Mr John Rudgard, Bulmer's chief executive, said he welcomed the arrival of
another quoted company and the amount that Taunton was contributing to the
growth of the market.
Bulmer's earnings per share expanded by 23 per cent to 19.96p and the final
dividend is increased to 5.55p, giving a total of 9p, up 8 per cent.
The record profits and earnings were, however, a reflection of its strategy
of focusing on Strongbow and Woodpecker, its mainstream cider brands which
compete mainly with Taunton's Blackthorn and Autumn Gold brands for more
than 85 per cent of the market.
'Taunton's strategy is very much about new brands,' Mr Rudgard said. 'Ours
is very much to do with existing brands and bringing in new brands.'
During the year Bulmer spent Pounds 13m on capital expenditure, compared
with a depreciation charge of Pounds 5m. The company has spent Pounds 49m
capital on capital expenditure over the last four years.
In particular, Mr Rudgard said, Bulmer had invested heavily in kegs and keg
equipment to widen the availability of cider.
Bulmer claims a 33 per cent market share for Strongbow, which it said had
grown 13 per cent over the last two years, and a 23 per cent market share
for Woodpecker which it said was growing at 16 per cent.
By comparison, Bulmer said sales of Blackthorn and Autumn Gold were both
falling.
Mr Rudgard said that its premium Scrumpy Jack brand was also growing, albeit
from a lower level than Diamond White, Taunton's mainstay.
The contribution to sales from Pectin fell due to the worldwide recession
with profits of Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 2.64m) on sales down 12 per cent at
Pounds 14.5m.
Profits in Australia rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 1.79m, enjoying the only
significant part of that country's drinks market to show growth.

strategy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Banque Bruxelles Lambert yesterday urged investors to find a
quick solution to the strategic questions that threaten to undermine the
Belgian bank's shareholder structure.
But the board failed to indicate whether the bank would be better off
forging commercial links with an international or a domestic partner.
The group's shareholders are split over strategy. BBL is under pressure from
Internationale Nederlanden (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group, to
enter into a form of collaboration. At the same time, influential Belgian
investors - notably Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the holding company - would
like BBL to link up with Credit Communal, the publicly-owned Belgian credit
institution.
ING announced on Tuesday that it had increased its stake in the Belgian bank
to just over 10 per cent. At yesterday's board meeting, BBL directors 'took
note' of ING's wishes, and said they wanted to position the bank 'favourably
for its further development'.
They urged shareholders 'to find a rapid solution in order to ensure the
stability of its shareholding'. Another board meeting is fixed for September
17, but a BBL spokesman said: 'The discussion is not really in the boardroom
any more - it's rather a debate between investors.'
A report to the bank's executive committee by Credit Suisse First Boston has
indicated that an international strategy would offer more advantages to BBL
than a domestic move. BBL managers have also indicated they would prefer an
international link-up.
BBL's complex shareholder structure is dominated by GBL, which controls
24.16 per cent of the bank directly and through subsidiaries. The holding
company is headed by Mr Albert Frere, who is believed to favour keeping BBL
Belgian. Last week he and his subsidiaries sold a 5.7 per cent stake in BBL
to Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, which has Credit Communal as its
principal shareholder.
GBL also heads a long-standing syndicate of BBL's main shareholders, which
must offer their shares to GBL first if they decide to sell. The
first-refusal clause in the syndicate agreement expires at the end of this
year.

FT  16 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian's first day trading discount of 3 per cent puts it somewhere in the
middle of the latest crop of new issues: less of a disappointment than the
13 per cent scored by The Telegraph, but trailing Kenwood's 1 per cent
premium. Whether the relationships will stay that way is another matter.
Research from the City University Business School into new issues between
1980 and 1988 suggests first day trading is an unreliable indicator of
future performance. Though the average initial premium was 14 per cent, the
collective underperformance thereafter against the FT-Actuaries All-Share
index was 4 per cent over three years. The outstanding performance of Body
Shop apart, shares with the highest initial premium tended to perform worst.
Unfortunately for The Telegraph, shares opening at a discount were the
second worst performing group. The best started with a premium between 6 and
12 per cent. A modest degree of underpricing may yet be the best recipe for
getting an issue away.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine the City of London's reaction if several hundred of the Midland
Bank's branch managers had openly expressed their preference for the
Hongkong Bank, while Midland's directors had adamantly refused to choose
between Hongkong and Lloyds. That is roughly what seems to be happening at
Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL). Senior employees have voiced their support
for a cross-border alliance with Internationale Nederlanden (ING), rather
than a local solution involving the state-owned credit institution Credit
Communal. Yet after yesterday's extraordinary meeting on the subject the
bank had nothing to say.
BBL is torn between the commercial logic of throwing its lot in with ING and
the messier political option of linking with Credit Communal. For the moment
it looks like a classic Belgian stand-off. Local sensitivities were ruffled
by the French takeover of Societe Generale de Belgique in 1988, and there is
eagerness in the Belgian political and financial establishment to ensure
that another foreigner does not now walk off with BBL, one of the country's
big three banks. Never mind that Suez, La Generale's majority shareholder,
weakly allowed the Belgians to delay the much-needed restructuring of the
sprawling holding company which is now under way.
Given the 10-15 per cent speculative premium in BBL's share price, minority
investors are playing a risky game. Admittedly ING looks to be moving on to
the offensive by raising its stake to over 10 per cent, but the strategy of
BBL's near-30 per cent shareholder Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) is far
from clear. GBL can probably deliver effective control to one side or the
other. But what if it does so without extracting a full bid as part of the
price?

Yesterday's further 17 per cent slump in the shares of the management
consultant Alexander Proudfoot makes one suspect that a trend is emerging in
the London market. Proudfoot is one of a clutch of medium-sized stocks -
others include BM Group and MTM - to have collapsed suddenly in recent
months. Most have suffered sudden changes in top management. All were at
their peak relative to the market when they came to grief. The reaction has
in each case been savage. Proudfoot's shares are down 45 per cent since late
May. BM and MTM are down 79 per cent and 88 per cent from their peaks in
June and February respectively.
The last time the market was this jumpy was in October 1990, immediately
after the collapse of Polly Peck. That time, the targets were companies with
heavy borrowings. This time it is companies with doubtful earnings. It is
worth recalling that in 1990 the market made some shrewd choices of victims,
such as Maxwell Communication and Brent Walker. It is perhaps also worth
recalling that the worst of the price collapses coincided with the bottom of
the market, when the FT-SE index bounced off the 2,000 mark.
The complicating factor this time is the lack of warning. Investors in
Maxwell or Brent Walker knew them to be heavily indebted and were taking a
calculated risk. The problem now is pressure from the real economy, which is
harder to assess. But all the companies mentioned - the list could be
extended to include Albert Fisher - were essentially creatures of the 1980s.
Perhaps, in markets like these, one criterion for stock-picking is companies
which were kicked around in the recession of 1980-81 and managed to survive.

FT  16 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: In for the long haul
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is too early to tell whether the US discount rate cut at the start of
this month will succeed in injecting vigour into the domestic recovery. But
the early July drop in new car sales hardly bodes well, while yesterday's
figures on June industrial production and May business inventories confirm
the weak backdrop against which the rate cut decision was taken. A decline
in industrial output was inevitable after the June unemployment figures.
Only a small portion of the latest 0.3 per cent drop can be put down to the
effect of last month's rail strike on coal supplies. The disturbing aspect
is the heavy fall in output of cyclically sensitive goods like motor
vehicles and construction equipment.
Nor do the inventory statistics point to a rapid recovery in output.
Inventories are at their highest level since March last year. May's 0.1 per
cent rise was accompanied by a 0.2 per cent drop in business sales, while
stocks are particularly high in the flagging retail sector.
There is not much in these figures to steer market speculation away from the
possibility of another rate cut later in the summer. That would leave the
dollar under continuing pressure, though yesterday's fall was more a
reflection of worries about a possible Bundesbank tightening today.
Moreover, if the latest rate cut does fail to do the trick, there must be
some doubts about the ability of the US economy to respond to short term
rate cuts at all. A sharper fall in long rates may be needed to rekindle
activity in the residential mortgage market. But that is harder to
orchestrate when the budget deficit is ballooning, the currency is weak and
the appetite of Japanese investors has waned.

   From Mr IVO FUCHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It seems untenable that the UK government insists on holding the value
of the pound against the D-Mark in the ERM, even if other governments forced
a realignment. The only country in the ERM that is worried about inflation
and high monetary growth is Germany, and the classic way to deal with the
former is to revalue the currency. If Germany adopted this attitude and
revalued unilaterally against all the other members of the ERM by a
meaningful amount, then the current foreign holders of the D-Mark would
readily accept lower interest rates having made a substantial profit by
holding the D-Mark. This would not only help to relieve the recess-ionary
tendencies we are all suffering from, but would also help Germany in its
fight against inflation. Inflationary effects of its revaluation would only
have a negligible effect within the UK.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL KINNOCK MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, This morning I can write without having my words treated as formal
Labour Party policy.
I do so to urge that the government takes a real lead amongst the ERM
countries in pressing for an immediate revaluation of the D-Mark. If the
prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer have urged this step in
their frequent meetings with their German counterparts in the last month, it
has remained a rather better kept secret than usual. In any case, if they
have been rebuffed they should - they must - keep on trying.
A D-Mark revaluation would reduce inflationary pressures in Germany - with
complementary benefits in lower German interest rates, enhance the flow of
capital into Germany required for reconstruction in the east and thereby,
via higher German imports, contribute to higher output and employment
throughout Europe. It would also allow other ERM countries, Britain in
particular, to avoid the heavy costs which loss of credibility would impose
on any unilateral devaluation.
If there are some ERM members - France might be an example - whose
governments are against a D-Mark revaluation, the British government should
exercise maximum influence and point out that they, too, should benefit from
a revaluation as an alternative to the interest rate pressures which will
inevitably persist given the combination of current exchange rates and
inflationary pressures in Germany.
There are some who might argue that it would be unbecoming for the British
government to try to persuade the Germans to aid the British economy and the
rest of the Community by revaluation. But such an approach would be a great
deal more elegant than Norman Lamont's plea to the Bundesbank not to
increase interest rates. Much more important, it would be part of the
package of measures which are required to lead the European Community away
from stagnation, and provide Britain with an alternative to the devastating
high real interest rate policy being pursued by the government.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Since the late 1970s German governments have sought to re-establish the
German aero-industry, but have found difficulty in obtaining finance to
develop civil aircraft.
While German withdrawal from the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) could
release the necessary finance to strengthen a German presence in civil
aircraft manufacture, it could fatally wound the European aero-industry as a
whole.
The US aero-industry is in a towering commercial position with public
finance for aeronautical research and development at 10 times that provided
by west European governments together.
The lesson of the Boeing 747, an aircraft with a monopoly in its market
sector, ought not to be lost on policymakers thinking of leaving US industry
with the world's last high-performance fighter aircraft. The estimated
profit on each Boeing 747 is Dollars 50m] The unit price of EFA might be
Dollars 18m. How much would a US fighter aircraft cost the European taxpayer
in the absence of a competitive machine?

FT  16 JUL 92 / Letter: A catechism offered in defence of economic
unorthordoxy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, How refreshing to find that attacks on economic orthodoxy can sometimes
actually produce articulated outrage and not only the usual dismissive
silence. But may I briefly reply to Messrs Thomsen and Wood (Letters, 13
July)?
For Mr Thomsen, a catechism. Does he really believe that:
Nissan is 'no better' than the British car manufacturers which it has
displaced in Britain's domestic and export markets?
if Britain's car and TV industries had also received what he considers was
the salutary punishment for inefficiency meted out to the British motor-bike
industry - namely extinction - we would rapidly have found other ways of
earning enough foreign exchange to import as many cars and TVs as we now
enjoy? How might our friend the invisible hand have done it? Banking
services? Tweeds and whisky?
the North American Free Trade Area and the European Single Market are so
small that Japanese investors have to forego available economies of scale?
Japanese neo-mercantilist planners were mistaken in the 1950s when they
decided to protect, invest in, and build future world competitiveness in
industries which (a) had higher value-added per employee, and (b) had
greater world-income elasticity of demand, and (c) kept them closer to the
world frontiers of technological development, than those in which they
currently had comparative advantage?
in so doing they reduced world economic welfare?
For Prof Wood: may I lend him a recent paper by a current guru, Jagdish
Bagwati, chief economic adviser to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. He quite explicitly bewails the failure of theory to demonstrate that
when two countries' prices differ trade always brings mutual advantages, no
matter why they differ.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The dubious case for Mark revaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank has long argued that if other countries do not like the
effects of German interest rate policies, they can always realign against
the German D-Mark - or for that matter float downwards. For neither the ERM,
nor the projected Emu, is a Bundesbank creation. But both have been - the
Bundesbank protests a little too much - foisted upon it by the politicians.
Indeed, at various times in the last few years, the Bundesbank has actually
offered the French authorities a realignment, which the latter have
adamantly refused.
The reasons why a general ERM realignment would not enable the UK to escape
from present interest rate constraints have been explained dozens of times,
most recently and cogently by the chancellor, Norman Lamont. These reasons
apply to nearly all the hard core of Community countries, with the possible
exception of Italy.
In brief it is that a devaluation would simply add to the risk premium that
the market would demand for holding the non-German currencies. The extreme
alternative of setting interest rates and ignoring the exchange rate - which
is an exaggerated description even of Fed behaviour - would be a recipe for
inflationary crisis for an ordinary European country.
Could there, however, be a unilateral German revaluation, which did not look
like a devaluation by other countries, and which looked final enough for the
markets not to expect further upward moves, and therefore not to increase
the interest rate premia on non-German currencies?
If, say, Italy and the UK both realigned downwards without France, it would
clearly be a devaluation by both the former countries. We know that this
will not happen in the case of the UK so long as John Major and Norman
Lamont both remain at their present posts.
The essential condition that would make a realignment into a genuine German
revaluation would be one in which France participated and in which most
important countries outside Germany remained linked by present parities. It
is more difficult to say whether a genuine revaluation would have also to be
against Germany's smaller neighbours, such as the Benelux countries,
Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden. But the more of these countries
that stayed with France and did not move up with the D-Mark, the more the
move would look like a genuine D-Mark revaluation.
Leaving aside the practicality, is the case for D-Mark revaluation as strong
as the Bundesbank and mainstream economists suppose? I have always needed to
be convinced and never quite have been.
Normally high-inflation countries devalue and low-inflation countries
revalue. The very fact that Germany has been losing its inflation advantage
to France makes the case for revaluation a strange one. Even Britain has
very much improved its competitive position against Germany in the last
decade - admittedly starting from a position when sterling was much
overvalued.
The conventional case for revaluation is that because of reunification,
Germany has to move resources out of the export sector and into
reconstruction efforts in the eastern provinces. After his recent Ditchley
lecture, Dr Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister of Saxony, said that Germany
would have to devote about 5 per cent of its GDP to reconstruction in the
east.
In fact, however, Germany has largely done so, thanks to the running-down of
its former balance of payments surplus. It is too often forgotten that as
recently as 1989 the old Federal Republic had a payments surplus of 4.8 per
cent of GDP, larger than that of Japan, and received endless lectures from
the US administration for its pains. By 1991, the German current balance of
payments had moved to a deficit of 1.2 per cent of GDP, and the OECD expects
the deficit to remain in 1992 and 1993.
This swing of resources is a practical demonstration of the savings and
investment approach to the balance of payments, which suggests that there
will be a surplus if domestic investment opportunities fall short of local
savings, but a deficit when such investment opportunities - in this case
defined broadly to include all special expenditures in the east - run ahead
of local savings.
The case for a revaluation from a German point of view is simply that it
would represent a tightening of German monetary policy for any given level
of interest rates - just as the upward overshooting of, first, sterling and
then the dollar represented a tightening of policy for the UK and the US in
the early 1980s. A revaluation would help Germany to reduce inflationary
pressures more quickly. But how would other countries benefit?
The short answer is that they would only benefit if the Bundesbank regarded
the appreciation of the D-Mark as a sufficient reason for maintaining a
level of interest rates a couple of percentage points or more below what
would otherwise be the case. The UK Treasury in the late 1980s played with
the rule by which each 4 per cent appreciation of sterling was equivalent to
a 1 per cent rise in base rates.
In the absence of a similar sort of rule being followed by the Bundesbank,
Germany's partners would have little to gain from a revaluation. But unless
all the conditions, outlined earlier in the article, were rigidly observed,
they would risk losing their hard-won counter-inflationary credibility with
nothing in return.
It is in no one's interest that Germany should lose its reputation for low
inflation. But that should not mean a mechanistic pursuit of broad money
targets for M3. The OECD attitude, if one attempts to translate its annual
report on Germany out of OECD-speak, is that the Bundesbank is right to
maintain high interest rates, but should not raise them further and should
not take too seriously the overshooting of the official money target.
The OECD lists three plausible reasons why above-target rate of German
monetary growth can be misleading.
First, reunification may have changed at least the short-run relationship
between the broad version of the money supply known as M3 and the national
income. Second, the canvassed introduction of a withholding tax on interest
incomes may also have affected this relationship. Third, and most
interesting of all, 'there is evidence of increased D-Mark hoarding and the
use of the Mark as a parallel currency in east European countries'.
These complications are reminiscent of Britain in the early 1980s when
broadly defined money also became a treacherous guide to economic
conditions. The similarity extends to the argument that an interest rate
increase might worsen broad money growth in the short run, as the inverted
yield curve encourages investors to place long-term funds on deposit at the
banks.
Later in the 1980s the UK relationship between broad money and spending
improved, just as broad money targets were abandoned - giving an interesting
new twist to Goodhart's Law. What is probably required in Germany is a
temporary above-target rate of monetary growth, which should then be steered
back to a lower rate before a British-type credit boom can prevail. The
first part of this course will be followed anyway, whatever decision the
Bundesbank Council makes today, as it is far too late in the year to get
German money supply growth back on track.

<TEXT>
TRUMAN By David McCullough Simon &amp; Schuster, Dollars 30
Publishing magnate Henry Luce once described President Harry Truman as the
reductio ad absurdum of the common man. Fellow snobs among the east coast
establishment shared Luce's disdain for the one-time haberdasher from
Independence, Missouri, dismissing him as a blunderer doomed to remain in
the shadow of his towering predecessor, Franklin D Roosevelt.
Truman never quite silenced the critics. Even his upset victory over Thomas
Dewey in the 1948 presidential election, when he defied the collective
wisdom of the press, Wall Street and many in his own Democratic party,
failed to re-move doubts about his ability and judgment.
The end of the cold war, however, has induced much nostalgia in the US for
the Truman years. The Marshall plan, the Nato alliance, the Berlin airlift
and the Truman doctrine of 'containing' Soviet power are now viewed as
historic achievements. Advisers such as George Marshall, Dean Acheson and
Clark Clifford now merit the status of 'wise men'. Truman himself appears
bold, decisive and far-sighted.
David McCullough's biography, 10 years in writing, is the latest book to
discover hidden virtues in plain-spoken, 'give 'em hell' Harry. The
president is portrayed as a courageous leader willing to take up unpopular
causes: he sent the first civil rights message to Congress, desegregated the
armed forces and led the world in rec-ognising the state of Israel. It was
Truman who ordered the atomic bomb dropped on Japan, who developed the
H-bomb and who fired General Douglas MacArthur, a national hero, for
insubordination in the Korean war, upholding the principle of civilian
control over the military.
McCullough is at his best when describing Truman's Midwest roots, the
Missouri of Mark Twain and Jesse James. A one-time bankrupt, Truman spent
years struggling with debt. His family's financial troubles deprived him of
a full education and forced him back on the farm. It was only after several
disastrous business ventures that Truman concluded his future lay in
politics, signing up with the powerful Pendergast machine which ruled Kansas
City and later sent him, aged 50, to the US Senate. McCullough captures the
man's stubborn confidence in his own ability, but also his sense of awe when
he became president.
The book's chief weakness is that McCullough does not draw out the important
lessons of the Truman years. Under President Truman, the US became a world
power. The decline of Britain no doubt hastened America's assumption of
world leadership; but it was by no means a foregone conclusion that the
American public would support the activist role in foreign policy which they
had earlier spurned. How Truman overcame these difficulties is a model of
presidential leadership in action and a sober commentary on the drift and
inaction in present day Washington.
In 1946-47, when the Soviet Union consolidated its hold over eastern Europe,
Truman was still viewed as a caretaker president. In the November 1946
election, the Republicans captured majorities in the House and Senate,
seemingly promising a stalemate between the executive and legislature. The
political debate turned not on a prospective world leadership role for the
US, but whether the new Congress would roll back the New Deal, slash
military spending and foreign aid, and go back to the isolationism of the
1920s.
A lesser man would have looked at the polls and packed his bags. But Truman
elected to stand for what he thought was right for the country, rather than
what he thought was politically expedient. He fought for foreign aid to
Greece and Turkey in the spring of 1947 and won. Months later, his
administration produced the Marshall plan, which dispersed billions of
dollars to aid the economic recovery in western Europe.
The Marshall plan was based not only on American largesse, but also on a
hard-headed calculation that the recovery of Germany and Japan served vital
US interests. Far from being an example of American imperialism, the
Marshall plan grasped an essential truth: that the strongest alliances are
based not on subordination (pace Moscow's relationship with its east
European satellites) but on common democratic values and economic
interdependence. This was the historic accomplishment of the Truman
administration which underpins American power today, even though some of the
institutions which supported the postwar liberal order such as Nato now
require an overhaul.
Truman's other legacy is that he showed it was possible to be president and
remain a human being. He was the warts 'n' all president who won the
affection of the masses because he never lost touch with them. Today, the
American public craves this authenticity. This year's presidential
candidates, including Ross Perot, the rich man's version of Harry Truman,
are desperately seeking to respond. Each could do a lot worse than read this
book to understand what it takes to be the genuine article.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH WHAT must seem to the victims unpardonable slowness, the international
community is beginning to recognise the nature of the conflict in
Bosnia-Hercegovina. A state, recognised by most other states and admitted to
numerous international bodies, is being dismembered. Frontiers are being
redrawn by war. Large numbers of people are being forcibly driven from their
homes, with widespread killing.
Such actions would be 'intolerable' at any time or place, but in many times
and places they have been tolerated. A particularly clear precedent was set
in Cyprus in 1974. There too a neighbouring state (Turkey) intervened to
protect a minority, and used military force to secure an area for that
minority's exclusive use, expelling from it all members of the majority
community. There too the international community - including Britain, which
had guaranteed Cyprus's territorial integrity - failed to take any effective
action to halt or reverse the process. There too not everyone agreed who was
aggressor and who was victim; no one was sure how to solve the problem;
above all, no one wanted to get hurt.
Turkey at least waited 14 years after Cyprus's independence, until a moment
when the Cyprus government had been overthrown by a coup stage-managed from
Greece, before resorting to such extreme measures. The Serbs did not wait to
find out what an independent Bosnia-Hercegovina would be like. They resorted
to force straight away. Also, not having such an overwhelming military
superiority as Turkey had, they are taking longer to achieve their aims.
That has given the rest of the world more time to react. Sanctions have been
imposed, if so far very ineffectively enforced.
General disorder
Turkey was a large, strategically important country in the midst of the cold
war. No one wanted to alienate it. Serbia is a small country and there is no
longer a cold war. Instead there is a new security order in Europe which
shows every sign of degenerating into general disorder, precisely because of
conflicts over frontiers and minorities. If the Serbs get away with what
they are doing, there are plenty of other nations, including most ominously
the Russians, who may be tempted to use the same methods to assert their
claim to territory held by other states, and to 'cleanse' that territory of
other ethnic groups.
The instinctive aims of the international community are: to bring relief, as
far as possible, to the civilian victims; to prevent the conflict from
spreading; and to stop the fighting as soon as possible. Those aims are
right. Something has to be done, as a matter of urgency, about the refugee
problem; and western powers, notably the EC, must focus on the need to
prevent the fighting spreading to Kosovo, Macedonia or Voivodina and to
ensure that even if it does, neighbouring countries - Albania, Greece,
Bulgaria, Hungary - stay out.
Ethnic cleansing
But 'stopping the fighting' is not enough if it turns out to mean, as in
Cyprus, consolidating a ceasefire only after the aggressor has secured his
objectives, and then being content to urge the virtue of negotiations and
concessions equally on both sides. Something more is needed to drum home the
message that violence and ethnic cleansing are not an acceptable way to
protect minority rights. And it is getting ever harder to avoid the
conclusion that this something has to be an injection of force in some form
on the side of the victims.
Outside powers are rightly reluctant to deploy ground troops, which could
easily get bogged down. But naval force is already being deployed in the
Adriatic - to 'monitor' but not to enforce the sanctions. At the very least
this force should be empowered to stop and search, and Bulgaria and Romania
(through whose territory most supplies are reaching Serbia) must be put
under greater pressure to co-operate. It is time to consider the use of air
power as well, if only to neutralise the unjust monopoly of air power
currently enjoyed by the Serbs. It would be feasible for Nato, if so
mandated by the UN Security Council, to forbid the use of Bosnian airspace
to the former Yugoslav armed forces.
These are not easy decisions to take. But if they are not taken soon there
may be many even more difficult ones lying in wait.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Arts: The Dybbuk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN the wars, Solomon Anski's play was a staple of Yiddish theatre
everywhere. Anski (1863-1920) was Byelorussian, a political radical and a
devoted ethnographer of Ukrainian Jewry.
The Dybbuk is an extraordinary play, and Katie Mitchell's production for the
Royal Shakespeare Company gives it the works - in the best, most serious
sense, and also in a long-sighted new way.
The bare bones of the Chassidic tale Anski used as his basis might seem only
a superstitious folk-legend, with a sentimental-mystical twist.
There is far more in his overflowing play, and it founds the sense of the
story far deeper - but the details are densely, opaquely ethnic: a modern
director, even in Yiddish theatre, might scarcely know what to do with it.
Miss Mitchell has known exactly what to do with it. She has induced a fine
translator (Mira Rafalowicz) to make her fourth adaptation of the text; she
has taken a scholarly team to do fieldwork among Jews in the Ukraine.
She recreates a whole, devout community in The Pit, with the right songs and
dances and a cast fervently drilled in their bursts of Yiddish and Hebrew
(justified by their rhetorical force, incantatory or commanding or
folk-pithy).
Above all, she plants the central lovers' mystical rebellion against Torah
law firmly within that tradition and that community, and allows neither side
to 'win'.
A Dybbuk is the soul of one whose life has been cut off prematurely and
incomplete, and seeks a temporising refuge in the body of another.
Here, a poor Yeshiva scholar (Charles Daish) who loves Leye, a rich man's
daughter, is rejected by her father in favour of a wealthier husband;
unhinged, he falls to cabbalistic fancies and starves himself to death.
At the moment of Leye's eventual wedding, she becomes possessed by him as a
Dybbuk. The rest of the play is concerned with her ritual exorcism by the
great 'Reb' (Rabbi) Azriel - incarnated with huge gusto by John Shrapnel -
and its outcome.
Superstition has nothing to do with it. The burning theme of the play is how
the dead interpenetrate the world of the living (as of course they do among
us all, most comprehensively), at every level from spiritual to quotidian
and pragmatic.
Among the people whom Anski depicts with such faithful insight, that is
poignantly understood; the message emerges from their culture with special
clarity. It emerges in this production with humane power. Timely, too - but
you can draw your own morals.
As shy, obedient Leye, Joanne Pearce is faultless; and later, we cannot
doubt while the play proceeds that she is possessed by the Dybbuk. It is a
wrenching performance, and superb, though one cannot help but fear for her
health over the five-month run.
Among all the excellent players, Peter Needham lends the father dignity and
subtlety, and Rob Edwards creates a lofty, uncanny presence for the
Messenger, a vital go-between for matters of the highest import.
Altogether the play transmits a kind of wisdom; nothing in it that seems
quaint or picturesque is mere surface, but subserves its real, sober vision.

television weather maps. Swirling across the Atlantic is an airborne army of
thunderclouds, lightning forks and jiggling white arrows, signalling that
the full force of Hollywood's sequel season will soon reach the UK.
Meanwhile, like a smaller army of Ian McCaskills, British film critics pipe
out warnings as the weather and TV graphics run riot.
Britain is a sitting target for this treatment. Each summer its cinema
exhibition business curls up into a catatonic ball, convinced that most
filmgoers not on holiday abroad will be attached to their Wimbledon/test
cricket audiovisual drip feeds. What price a fair-to-good film at their
local cinema?
Ergo: summer audiences must be given either rescued-from-the-shelf rubbish
which would not make money even in a good film-going season, or overblown
American sequels that cannot be resisted, at least by addicts, even in a bad
film-going season.
The logic is impeccable; the situation is nightmarish. And not just for a
British film industry rejoicing in two meagre openings this month: one a
cartoon about a frog working for British Intelligence (sic), the other a
two-year-old arthouse misfire (see below). No, we are in nightmare territory
because the conclusion has been reached by the film world's marketing brains
that in adverse circumstances you cannot woo the public, you can only mug
it.
Movies large of spectacle and empty of content are the most potent weapon.
They are light enough to lift up in the air, yet hard enough to concuss the
audience when brought down on its head.
Sequelitis is an essential component of this campaign. In high summer, few
filmgoers have the energy to meet new characters or adjust to new plot
ideas. They yearn only for the ritualistic and ongoing, cinema's equivalent
of Wimbledon or test cricket. Hence the umpteenth return of the caped
crusader, of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in lethal harness, of Sigourney
Weaver in space battling Old Saliva Jaws.
It would be an act of Canute-like futility to sit on the shores of Britain
ordering Hollywood's sequel-hurricanes to go home. Better to welcome them in
and allow them to flood cinemas up to the expected box-office high water
mark; then we may drain off what conclusions we can at summer's end.
The most likely conclusions - I have already prepared two in anticipation -
are as follows.
The first is in three parts and has been formulated for those who believe in
government intervention in cinema. A swingeing tax should be placed on all
imported feature films, especially from America, so that the extra revenue
can be ploughed into British film production. All summer holidays abroad
should be cancelled or 'earned' in advance by a visit to 10 British cinemas
in the week before departure. And major TV sport-watching should be hived
off, as it soon will be anyway, to the satellite channels, where it will be
watched only by the small if growing minority of persons willing to attach
large saucers to their houses. This will free the remaining population to go
to the movies.
On the other hand, there are those like me who do not believe in government
intervention. Our conclusion, also in three parts, is as follows. The
British cinema should start to make good films again. The British cinema
should stop sitting around waiting for the government and other bodies to
pick it up off the floor. And the British cinema should remember that it
once could - yes, it really could - make originals and sequel sagas all its
own that struck gold at the box office.
Remember the Bonds? The Carry Ons? The Hammer horrors? If we are going to be
mugged by the movie business every summer - that now seems unavoidable - let
us at least return to being mugged by our own movies. Who knows: in such
profitable assaults on audiences whose resistance is lowered by the heat and
holiday season might lie, at last, our industry's commercial salvation.
In My Cousin Vinny, half an idea for a film is searching earnestly for the
other half. The half already in place concerns a fledgling Italian-American
lawyer (Joe Pesci) who is summoned from Brooklyn to the Deep South to rescue
a young cousin (Ralph Macchio) from an erroneous murder charge.
Pesci sports a black wig and what I judge to be an emergency face-lift. His
upper cheeks are pulled back so far that he resembles something out of The
Mikado. When he opens his mouth, we are astonished that he does not say
things like 'Ah so, murder charge, velly mistaken.' Instead Pesci talks like
someone out of Goodfellas, which of course he is, and brings a touch of Cosa
Nostra to the land of cotton.
There are long passages of the film when even this limited joke runs out.
During these, we must make do with minor pleasures like the scenery, the
Southern accents and Fred Gwynne's mournfully cantankerous old judge, who
seems to have stepped out of a Charles Addams cartoon and then found himself
wishing he could step back in.
But the bits and pieces never quite add up. Somewhere during this film's
making I suspect that half the script was mysteriously lost down a street
grating, leaving British director Jonathan Lynn, late of Nuns On The Run, to
vamp like hell somewhere south-west of Savannah.
Nick Ward's Dakota Road is funnier than My Cousin Vinny, though it is not
meant to be. Since it is a low-budget British film co-funded by Channel
Four, it has been treated with inordinate respect by magazines like Time Out
('painterly eye. . . sympathetic performances. . . subtle body language')
and was even sat through with undue politeness by my colleagues at the Press
show.
This is as bad a film as I have ever seen. If Ingmar Bergman had been hired
to script The Archers using only a Swedish-English phrasebook, he might have
produced this crackpot pastoral about life, death, sex, God and pollution
somewhere in the fenlands. Alan Howard creases a pained face as the local
squire, while a supporting cast of unknowns wrestle with the portentous
script.
As if the dead fishes surveyed by the disillusioned local priest were not
enough (fishes? Christian symbol? get it?), we have the sexually distraught
young signalman manfully erecting his signal, the shame-ridden farmer's wife
polishing her tile floors like a Lady Macbeth of the fens, and the
incestuous, daughter-fancying, suicidally inclined farmer himself, who is
forever polishing his shoes. No doubt he is hoping to go on a long, long
journey.
In the work of Luis Bunuel, symbolism is seldom allowed to lie around
crudely exposed. It is either whisked on and off like a conjuror's rabbit or
is elevated into fetishism. See Belle De Jour, made in 1967 and revived this
week. Surgeon's wife Catherine Deneuve embarks on her own brand of adult
education course when she signs on for day work at a chic brothel.
Soon it is open season for sexual fantasy - her own and her clients - and
Bunuel adds to the subversiveness by filming the surreal as if it is real.
Seeing human nature turned inside out as coolly as this is as shocking as
discovering your favourite maiden aunt shooting up with heroin. See, learn,
gasp and wonder.

THE Australian Ballet's third programme is a triple bill which pays debts
and makes an investment for the future. Two of the pieces - Ninette de
Valois' Checkmate and Antony Tudor's Gala Performance - tell of formative
influences behind the company itself.
The national ballet which Dame Ninette established in Britain is the example
that guided the making of Australia's troupe (which this season, more than
ever before, speaks with an independent and assured voice).
Peggy van Praagh, the founder of the Australian Ballet, was one of the group
of 'Tudor dancers' which sustained that subtle creator in his London years,
and it was she who first played the role of the French ballerina in his acid
commentary upon stellar temperament.
The third piece, Of Blessed Memory, is the work of a new talent arisen
within the troupe - Stanton Welch, in his early twenties and son of two
former stars of the company, Marilyn Jones and Garth Welch.
Of Blessed Memory reveals an eager gift for movement. It concerns the
child's debt to its mother, couched in plotless but emotionally specific
terms.
At the ballet's centre Mr Welch has cast his mother, radiant as we recall
her from her days as the company's leading ballerina, and now discreetly and
lovingly shown as life-giver and watchful presence. Around her the
choreography surges along the melodic paths of Canteloube's Chants
d'Auvergne (excellently sung by Joanna Cole).
It is music that can be cloyingly sweet, and sweetly coy, and Mr Welch, for
all his bright skill, cannot surmount every pitfall of his score. Because he
is musically alert, he tends at moments to 'mickey-mouse' in matching step
for note, and the most wincingly roguish song leads him into the shallows of
cuteness - the number could with advantage be cut.
But he writes fluently; steps and ideas pouring from him (many of them
good), so that we know the sincerity of his inspiration and of his creative
drive.
He is rewarded with excellent performances from a large cast - notably from
Miranda Coney, Steven Heathcote, Justine Summers, Nicole Rhodes, Campbell
Mackenzie. There is handsome design - evocative of the outback - from
Kristian Frederikson.
The staging of Checkmate is scrupulous. The McKnight Kauffer designs have
lost nothing of their theatrical power (or their Art Deco distinction). The
choreography has been carefully set, and with what emotional clarity does
the drama unfold: after all the years, all the performances, the
inevitability of the black pieces' triumph still grips.
The Australian cast was admirable in intention, and technically fine - Greg
Horsman the Red Knight; Lisa Pavane the Black Queen - but oddly light in
physical tone. De Valois' choreography needs weight - there is an earthy,
folk-dance directness to some of the steps - and slightly less brisk tempi,
that will allow movement and gesture to be more fully realised.
About Gala Performance there are two schools of thought: Antony Tudor's, who
conceived the piece as a satire, but not as a romp, and that of most
interpreters, who see the piece as on occasion for unbridled romping with
the satiric bite of Carry On Dancing.
Three ballerinas (from Moscow, Milan and Paris) battle for precedence and
applause at a gala. The more implacable their manoeuvres, the better the
interpretation, and the truer to life: the annals of ballet gossip are rich
in incidents no wilder or egomaniacal than those in this display of sacred
monsters.
The Australian production (with a set unnecessarily garish) has caught
something of the right style. Lisa Pavane stalked the stage in icy majesty
as the Milanese divinity, and Justine Miles was oh-so-deliciously Parisian,
but Sian Stokes' Muscovite was a knock-about grotesque - and comedy is too
serious a business to be made fun of.
Gala Performance inevitably suffers in a large theatre - it was made for an
intimate stage with intimate by-play. A sea-change into opera-house farce
denies its humour, though it would be fun to see it danced by some of
today's more awful stars, whose mannerisms are no less ludicrous than those
Tudor first sent up in 1938.
The Australian Ballet continues at the London Coliseum (071) 836 3161 with
varied programming until July 18. Sponsors include Australian National Line
and Qantas.

FT  16 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Deposits are protected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPOSITORS' PROTECTION FUND v DALIA AND ANOTHER Chancery Division: Sir
Donald Nicholls, Vice-Chancellor: July 3 1992
AN ASSIGNMENT of whole or part of a deposit in an authorised bank, made
before presentation of a petition for its winding-up or before July 30 1991,
entitles the assignee to be treated as the depositor of the assigned sum for
the purpose of claiming compensation under the statutory deposit protection
scheme.
The Vice-Chancellor so held when giving judgment for the defendants on a
claim for a declaration by the Depositors Protection Fund, against Mrs
Varsha Dalia representing the assignees of deposits in the Bank of Credit
and Commerce SA (BCCI), and Barclays Bank plc representing the authorised
institutions who contributed to the fund.
THE VICE-CHANCELLOR said that to alleviate hardship when a bank became
insolvent the Banking Act 1979 set up the deposit protection fund.
Money from the fund was payable to depositors on the insolvency of a
recognised bank or institution. A depositor was paid three-quarters of his
deposit, limited to Pounds 10,000.
The fund was continued under the Banking Act 1987. The maximum amount of a
protected deposit was increased to Pounds 20,000.
BCCI was an authorised institution. On July 5 1991 the Bank of England
presented a petition that it be wound up on the ground inter alia that it
was insolvent. Provisional liquidators were appointed and BCCI ceased
trading in the UK.
A firm of accountants wrote to BCCI depositors telling them of a scheme by
which a depositor should assign part of his deposit to family members or
close friends who could be trusted. Each assignee could look to the fund for
maximum compensation payable.
Depositors were urged to hurry 'for you only have until July 29'. That was
because the winding-up petition was due to come before the court again on
July 30.
Some 50 depositors or more signed transfers in July in respect of sums
totalling several million pounds. There were over 200 assignees.
The scheme was quickly stopped in its tracks.
On July 30 the Banking Act 1987 (Meaning of Deposit) Order 1991 was made.
It provided that in future the definition of 'deposit' in the Act excluded a
sum to which a person became entitled otherwise than by operation of law,
after presentation of a winding-up petition.
The question was whether the assignments had their intended effect for
compensation purposes.
The deposit protection scheme was regulated by Part 2 of the 1987 Act.
Section 58 of the Act provided for payment of compensation. Subsection (1)
provided that if an authorised institution became insolvent, or was subject
to an administration order, the fund should pay 'each depositor who had a
protected deposit . . . three-quarters of his protected deposit'.
The Act contained no definition of 'depositor'. It naturally read as meaning
the person who made the deposit. To qualify for compensation the deposit
made by him must be a 'protected deposit'.
Section 59 defined when a company became insolvent for the purposes of
section 58. Under 59(1)(a) the relevant event in a winding-up case was the
making of the winding-up order, not presentation of the petition.
Section 60 defined 'protected deposit' as referring to the institution's
total liability to the depositor 'immediately before' it became insolvent or
the administration order was made, limited to Pounds 20,000.
The assumption made by the section 60 wording was that the depositor who
made the deposit would be the same person as the depositor to whom a
compensation payment was to be made.
Section 61 addressed the problem of trusts by modifying sections 58 and 60
in certain cases.
Two important points were discernible in its provisions.
First, one thread running through them was that where A was the person who
made the deposit but B was the person beneficially entitled to the deposit,
B was the material person for the purposes of the protection scheme.
Second, section 61 was concerned with the beneficial interests existing when
a payment fell to be made. There was nothing in the section to suggest that
the trust provisions applied only if the trust existed at the time the
deposit was made.
Where A assigned the whole of his interest to B in a deposit, in writing and
with written notice to the bank under section 136 of the Law of Property Act
1925, he made a statutory assignment and the person to whom compensation was
payable under section 58 was B. The expression 'depositor' was apt to
embrace him as A's assignee, and the 'protected deposit' was the bank's
liability to him in respect of the UK deposit to which he was entitled.
To confine 'depositor' in all circumstances to the person who made the
deposit would be inconsistent with the object of section 61.
The natural meaning must give way to the extent necessary to enable the
Act's underlying purpose to be achieved.
It was inconceivable that Parliament intended that an assignee of the whole
deposit under a statutory assignment should be in a worse position than the
beneficiary under a declaration of trust. In each case the entire beneficial
interest in the deposit belonged to B to the exclusion of A who made the
deposit.
The essential purpose was to pay compensation to those entitled to deposits
in an insolvent bank.
If the original depositor had assigned his interest, achievement of the
legislative purpose required the assignee to be the person entitled to
compensation.
That was necessarily implicit in the legislative scheme, and section 58 must
be so read and understood.
Where part only of a deposit had been assigned it could not be a statutory
assignment, but was equitable only.
For compensation purposes the position was the same as with regard to a
statutory assignee. There was no reason in principle why, for the purposes
of the deposit protection scheme, an assignee of part of a deposit should be
treated any differently from an assignee of the whole.
In the present case the assignors had declared themselves trustees of the
assigned parts of the deposits if BCCI was unable to designate separate
deposit accounts in assignee's names.
There was no reason why equitable assignments with that fall-back
declaration of trust should be treated differently for compensation purposes
than if, in place of assignments, there had been simple declarations of
trusts.
The 1991 Order provided that 'deposit' excluded any sum to which a person
became entitled 'after a petition is presented for the winding-up of the
institution, or in the case of an institution in respect of which such a
petition has been presented before  .. this Order comes into force, July 30
1991'.
The Order excluded an entitlement arising otherwise than by operation of
law, after presentation of a winding-up petition.
It deliberately left untouched a deposit to which a person became entitled
pre-presentation of a winding-up petition.
The inevitable conclusion was that pre-petition assignments were not
intended to be outlawed. The Order was content that pre-petition assignees
should still qualify for compensation.
The Order applied to interests arising under assignments and under trusts.
Both were stuck down if entitlement arose after presentation of a winding-up
petition.
In both cases they were left untouched for compensation purposes if
entitlement arose pre-petition.
For the purposes of Part 2 of the 1987 Act an assignee of part of a deposit
was to be treated as entitled to the assigned part and as having made a
deposit equal to that part.
For the fund: John Jarvis QC and Jonathan Nash (Clifford Chance).
For Mrs Dalia: Philip Sales (Ashurst Morris Crisp).
For Barclays Bank: Michael Brindle QC and Bankim Thanki (Lovell White
Durrant).

FT  16 JUL 92 / Technology: Driven back to basics - As Japanese car makers
strive to cut costs, priorities on the production line have changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan Motor's new president, has a straightforward message
to his staff: build it simple.
Tsuji wants to cut down by half the multiple varieties of parts - such as
optional steering wheels - that can go into a Nissan car. He wants to use
more common parts among different car models, and is even looking to bring
down costs by sourcing major components jointly with rival car makers.
If the 1980s was the decade when the Japanese automobile companies dazzled
the world with rapid expansion and a seemingly endless proliferation of new
models, the 1990s is forcing the industry back to its engineering basics in
an effort to improve profits.
Following last year's dismal financial performance, the industry has come
under real pressure for the first time since 1986, when the rapid
appreciation of the yen forced the companies into a round of severe cost
cutting. Operating margins at Nissan Motor's parent company in Japan last
year fell to 0.8 per cent, while Mazda was at 0.9 per cent and Honda at 1.8
per cent. Toyota has yet to report for the year ending in June, but is
unlikely to match Honda.
The cause of poor profitability is not inefficient manufacturing per se.
Indeed Japan's car makers are probably the most efficient in the world. Yet
the weak state of automobile markets leaves the companies with little choice
but to cut costs, and some companies believe that considerable scope for
improvement remains.
'Efficiency was number two or three in our priorities, after reducing lead
times and improving quality,' says Ryuichi Tsukamoto, executive vice
president at Honda Engineering, Honda's production engineering subsidiary.
'Now we cannot deny the importance of efficiency, because the business is
facing tough times.'
An engineering solution to the car makers' problems, however, is a tall
order because the companies face conflicting pressures that suggest opposite
solutions. The Japanese industry must cope, for example, with a severe
labour shortage, which suggests automation may be the answer. Yet automation
is expensive. And increased use of industrial robots reduces flexibility on
production lines at a time when rapidly changing consumer tastes require
increased flexibility.
In an attempt to resolve these conflicting pressures, the companies are
focusing on two related areas of the manufacturing process: final assembly
and design.
The most recent trend in final assembly technology dates to a small-scale,
experimental factory that Honda ran for two years at its 1980s. At the plant
Honda introduced what it called General Assembly Trucks (Gat) to replace the
traditional assembly line.
In the traditional conveyor line, pioneered by Henry Ford, vehicle chassis
rode on a platform of fixed height. The platforms were spaced evenly and
were linked together and pulled along by a chain. The line moved at a
uniform speed, ideally never stopping, while workers installed parts and
components as the vehicle moved slowly by.
Yet the old-fashioned conveyor has proved too inflexible. Cars move along at
the same speed, spaced evenly regardless of how difficult they are to
assemble. If one car has to be stopped because of a problem, they all stop,
bringing work to a halt on the whole line. Because planned stops for the
cars are impractical, automation using stationery robots is impossible.
Honda's innovation was to dispense with the link between the platforms.
Instead of being pulled along by a noisy chain, Honda put the chassis on a
dolly which moves under the power of its own electric motor. The motor draws
power by induction from a cable beneath the floor and can also raise and
lower the vehicle chassis so that workers never have to bend to install
parts.
Honda's Gat also supplies a key that opens the door automation: the dollies
can move at different speeds, stop precisely to allow robot installation of
components, and accelerate and decelerate quickly to keep an expensive robot
used to the maximum. And the entire process can be controlled by central
computer, which monitors progress of each vehicle by means of an electronic
sensor system on the dolly and tells the robots what is coming.
The result is a production line much more pleasant to work on and one which
is much more amenable to automation. Honda concluded it was technically
possible to raise the automation rate on final assembly to 30 per cent,
compared with 5 per cent standard in the industry.
Honda installed the technology on one line at the Suzuka plant, on lines at
East Liberty in Ohio, and will open a plant later this year in Swindon using
an advanced version of the system. Honda Engineering also licensed the basic
technology to Daifuku, the Japanese specialist in factory equipment. Daifuku
has sold the system to both Toyota and Nissan, which have opened separate
plants in the past year.
The lines are beautiful to watch, when compared with the traditional noisy
and disorderly line. Nissan believes it will result in smoother operation on
the final assembly line, since cars that are complex to assemble can be
spaced further apart. And if a problem arises, only one car need be stopped,
allowing it to catch up later.
Yet whether the technology offers a true solution for the industry's
problems is another question. For one, the line costs between two and three
times as much to install as a traditional conveyor system, yet by itself
does not contribute anything to raising productivity.
The improvement in productivity only comes after additional spending on
robots. When Honda installed its Suzuka line in 1989, it lifted the level of
automation to 18 per cent. Tsukamoto says this raised labour productivity on
the line by between 15 to 17 per cent. But Honda has shelved a plan to
install more robots on the line to raise the automation ratio to 30 per
cent. It is too expensive.
Tsukamoto says that to replace one worker with machinery can cost between
Y10m (Pounds 42,000) and Y80m, depending on the process. Honda is willing to
spend the money when it relieves a particularly onerous manual task, or when
the investment results in a large improvement in quality.
One area where Honda has not skimped is on machinery for automated,
simultaneous installation of car suspension and engines. By mounting and
fastening all bolts simultaneously, Tsukamoto says, a more precise fit is
obtained, allowing for improved handling and ride. Simultaneous bolt
fastening prevents the accumulation of minor alignment errors.
The robots also provide rapid feedback. If a single bolt hole is misaligned,
the machines quit. On a traditional line, a slightly misaligned bolt hole
will rarely slow down a worker, who will put the thing together anyway. The
worker will still have to intervene on Honda's automated line when holes do
not match, but because the robots detect quality problems instantly, the
source can be traced immediately and corrected.
Honda's Gat system offers the potential to save labour, improve quality and
increase flexibility. Whether this potential can be exploited to the
financial benefit of the car makers, however, depends very much on other
links in the engineering chain.
A further article on engineering for flexibility will appear shortly.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Technology: Mainframes keep up the pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Downsizing - the shift from proprietary mainframe computers to client-server
distributed systems - has become de rigueur in the computer world. The
trend, driven by the development of high-performance desktop computers and
the growing popularity of 'open systems' software, is used to justify dire
predictions of the 'death of the mainframe' and the impending downfall of
International Business Machines.
Putting the downsizing trend in perspective, a report published this week by
ECsoft, a European software and services group, suggests that downsizing,
although widespread, is not the overwhelming trend that many had believed.
Some 35 per cent of IBM mainframe computer users in the UK surveyed by
ECsoft have already downsized or plan to do so. Another 41 per cent said,
however, that they have no plans to downsize.
The survey also confirms the shift away from proprietary systems, towards
so-called 'open systems' which theoretically give users the option of
purchasing compatible hardware from several different suppliers. Again,
however, the trend is more moderate than advocates of open systems have
claimed.
Neither does downsizing necessarily mean that mainframe computers are
replaced. In most cases the old mainframe is incorporated in new distributed
systems.
Mainframes still have several advantages compared with minicomputers,
workstations or personal computer networks. 'The commercial robustness isn't
there,' in open systems, Steve Coussins, UK managing director of ECsoft,
suggests. Also inhibiting the open systems trend is the shortage of data
processing managers experienced in the use of open systems.
Still the lower prices of open systems are a big draw. Asked to explain
their decisions to downsize or move to open systems, most respondents cited
changes within their organisation - mergers, acquisitions or the arrival of
a new manager - that triggered a review of existing information systems.
'There has also been a shift of power in information technology from the
data processing centre manager to the end user community. Departmental
managers now have their own IT budget,' says Coussins.
The new holders of the IT purse strings have no loyalties to IBM or other
established computer suppliers and are more likely to explore alternatives,
he explains.
Among survey respondents who said they have or will downsize, one third are
planning to use open systems, another third have downsized to IBM's
mid-range AS400 computers, while a surprising 13 per cent switched to other
proprietary systems.
The researchers talked to more than 200 or approximately 20 per cent, of IBM
mainframe computer users in the UK. The sample was deliberately focussed
upon users of IBM's older but still widely used VSE operating system, which
has traditionally been geared towards smaller mainframe systems.
These VSE mainframe users face a dilemma when they come to upgrade or expand
their computer systems. They must either undertake a costly conversion to a
new operating system or make a break from the traditional mainframe and
become part of the 'downsizing' trend.
Not surprisingly, the rate of downsizing among these users is higher than
average. Indeed, the survey reveals that users of VSE are twice as likely to
switch to new types of systems as users of newer IBM mainframe operating
systems.
The survey results are hardly good news for IBM since they confirm that a
substantial number of its traditionally loyal customers are turning to
competitors' equipment. However, those who have labeled the mainframe an
endangered species clearly have a long time to wait for its extinction.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Pasta and
promotional sources - Nestle is abandoning conventional ads for a subtler
approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In every recent recession, jeremiahs have warned that advertising spending
would never regain the levels of the good old days - only to be proved wrong
once economic recovery arrived.
But listening to Peter Brabeck, Nestle's chief marketing strategist and head
of its food products business - source of more than half the Swiss company's
SFr50.5bn (Pounds 19.3bn) sales last year - you begin to wonder whether this
time, the jeremiahs could be right.
Nestle is one of the world's biggest advertising spenders, with a SFr2bn
annual budget. Unlike many US competitors, it has refused to bow to
recession by sacrificing long-term brand support in favour of 'below the
line' activities such as retail price promotions, intended to boost
short-term sales.
Yet Brabeck is deeply sceptical about relying on mass-media advertising as
the main method of influencing consumer behaviour. 'For me it is very clear.
Advertising is out, credible communication with the consumer is in. And
these are two different things,' he says.
In his view, Nestle is increasingly threatened by isolation from the market,
and its brands imprisoned in a 'ghetto' from which advertising provides no
escape. The only way to break out is by finding more effective ways of
forging relationships with consumers and building brand loyalty.
Brabeck's gloomy diagnosis is based on three broad developments. The first
is the growing concentration of the formerly fragmented food retailing trade
into fewer, bigger supermarket chains, many of which actively promote their
own 'private label' products in competition with manufacturers' brands.
This trend, which is particularly pronounced in Europe, has increasingly
placed control over the supply chain in the hands of the retailers and
enabled them to dictate terms even to their biggest suppliers. 'We have been
blocked out from the consumer by the trade,' says Brabeck.
Secondly, the growth of new media such as satellite television is
splintering the mass audience, while consumers are also becoming more
resistant to advertisers' messages.
'There is no mass consumer any more, and people today don't act just because
someone tells them something,' says Brabeck.
'They can look at advertising and say 'this is very interesting, I like it'
or 'I don't like it', but they are mentally switched off. You can treble
advertising spending, but if you can't establish a credible communication
link with consumers, they won't act.'
Third, food manufacturers have sent the wrong signals by basing their
marketing and brand strategies too narrowly on product and process
technologies, such as frozen foods.
'But people today do not think in terms of frozen foods, they think in terms
of concepts like Lean Cuisine, Weight Watchers and Healthy Options,' says
Brabeck.
'Frozen food is not important to them. Twenty years ago, it stood for
technological advance, for freshness, for premium products. Today, at worst,
it means something which is old and stale.'
That is not to dismiss the importance of technology. As Nestle points out,
regular updating of the Nescafe formula has helped keep it the world's
best-selling instant coffee and the company's most profitable product.
However, consumers are not interested in how food is processed, but chiefly
in taste, aroma, texture and convenience.
That message, Brabeck concedes, is only gradually being absorbed by Nestle,
where attitudes remain heavily influenced by the company's traditional
preoccupation with product management and its faith in technology as a prime
source of competitive advantage.
In such a large and decentralised company, change cannot simply be imposed
from the centre. To speed things up, Brabeck plans to use Buitoni, the
Italian pasta maker acquired by Nestle in 1988, as a testbed for marketing
innovations.
Buitoni was chosen because it was unambiguously not a 'technological' brand,
he says.
Rather, the name of the game is creating instant heritage. At Brabeck's
suggestion, Nestle has bought the Buitoni family villa in Tuscany, which
will serve both as the Italian company's development centre and as the
central theme of its future brand image.
Buitoni's packaging is being re-designed to carry a 'seal of quality',
featuring a painting of the villa. Once the villa is inaugurated in October,
Nestle will invite consumers to enter competitions, for which the prizes
will be a week's cooking course there and a chance to participate in
Buitoni's product development.
Brabeck is also creating a Buitoni 'club' with its own magazine, which will
carry features about Italian wine, food and holidays. 'If I communicate with
you about something you are interested in, my products become more part of a
full package. The people I am really talking to are those who are interested
in Italy,' he says.
These efforts to build consumer loyalty will be buttressed with experiments
with distribution channels, independent of the supermarket trade. Nestle has
already developed a prototype vending machine, designed to serve portions of
hot pasta to consumers on the move.
Other innovations will include selling Buitoni products at special shopping
mall boutiques and street market stalls, and promoting the brand with
travelling road shows which will stage performances, designed to appeal
particularly to children.
Further ahead, advances in electronic point-of-sale technology may offer
fresh opportunities to forge closer links with consumers. One would be a
system which would enable purchasers of Nestle products to earn 'points' and
qualify for special offers by punching electronic cards into terminals
installed in shops.
Nestle concedes that all these ideas face difficult hurdles. Setting up
alternatives to supermarket distribution is a costly proposition, and even
if it succeeded, the company would still require the supermarkets'
co-operation to achieve its ambitions.
'We want to make Buitoni a leading worldwide brand,' says Brabeck. 'The
problem is that I don't think the trade is very interested in having a new
brand created. If you look in a supermarket, you find that we are forced to
concentrate more and more on very few brands. We simply have no choice.'
Nonetheless, he remains convinced that in the longer term, advertising
spending should decline sharply in favour of increased emphasis on
point-of-sale promotion and other forms of marketing support.
'Today, the advertising-promotion split at Buitoni is perhaps 80-20,' he
says. 'For me, it should be 50-50.'

FT  16 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Tea for C2s on an
outing to the shopping mall - Consumers are happy to stop for a bite, so
long as the theme is right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Flips Diner, a 1950s pastiche in chrome and apple green with Chevrolet
advertisements on the walls, a gaggle of teenage schoolgirls are drinking
Coke and coffee.
Born in the late 1970s, they find the diner glamorous and its cosy booth
seating ideal for discussing boys. 'They all go to diners in the films,'
says 15-year-old Jenni Evans.
On the other side of Monument Mall, Newcastle upon Tyne's newest retail
development, Wilf Gray and his wife are drinking coffee in the Choux Shop,
sitting on dark wood chairs beneath a reproduction Victorian light fitting.
Tynesiders in their late 50s, they are reminiscing about Tilley's tea-rooms,
an oak-panelled, now-defunct local institution.
'Tilleys had more atmosphere but this is very nice,' says Margaret Gray. Her
husband agrees but frowns as they pass the Perfect Pizza bar and the Manchu
Wok Chinese eaterie, also on the Mall's top floor. 'Those don't appeal to me
at all,' he says.
Britain's 1980s boom in huge out-of-town shopping complexes and glitzy city
centre malls has changed not only retailing but also the catering offered to
footsore shoppers.
Old style queueing at long self-service counters, where strings of customers
wanting only a cup of tea would wait inertly behind a family ordering
fry-ups, has given way in many locations to food courts like Monument
Mall's, offering different types of food and service in various themed
units.
Assessing potential demand, designing the eating areas and operating them
has become a speciality niche for Courtlands, which describes itself as the
largest independent food court operator in England.
But the recession poses an acute marketing problem; how does a fast-growing
company, operating solely in post-1985 shopping developments and frankly
describing itself as 'parasitic on retailers', defend its market share and
profit margins when retailing is in the doldrums?
For Courtlands, born six years ago at the inception of the MetroCentre in
Gateshead and now running more than 60 units in 13 city centre and
out-of-town locations from Southampton to Newcastle, the key is demographic
and market research: always important, it has become vital in a recession.
Mostly, says managing director Jonathan Gillespie, his clientele are the C1s
and C2s - the lower middle and skilled working classes; they are the people
who like to linger in malls and enjoy spending money, rewarding themselves
with food and drink en route. They are receptive to the message: 'Treat
yourself'.
As and Bs - the middle and upper middle classes - have more money but they
are a difficult audience; educated, selective, not keen on spending and
'semi-moralistic'. They tend not to stay long in malls, he says, preferring
to discover the cheapest prices and then go home to beat down their local
shopkeeper, whom they then feel good about supporting.
However where As and Bs are a big enough catchment, his company slides
upmarket.
At Hedge End, a Southampton superstore development with Marks and Spencer
and Sainsbury, Courtlands' sandwiches become filled baguettes and it sells
espresso and cappuccino to weary husbands at a little Cafe Express unit: 'a
lifestyle concept', enthuses Gillespie.
Pensioners - category E - are a difficult market too; on coach trips to
out-of-town shopping centres, they consume little. This is bad news for
Gillespie, who sees his job description as increasing shareholder value.
In the current market, he says, units are working at only 60 per cent
effectiveness; he needs to attain 70 per cent or even 80 per cent.
An admirer of the Americans' grazing approach to food consumption, he wishes
the British would eat meals at off-peak times; he is now working on a
campaign to offer OAPs reduced price mid-afternoon fish and chips.
But mostly, although conscious of a Pounds 3 a head barrier among his
customers, he shies away from price cutting; his units' pitch is quality of
environment, food and service, not cheapness.
Instead he is trying to maintain spend by offering extras as special
promotions, like a baked potato plus strawberries and cream for Pounds
2.75p, or children's meals for 99p: the child sprat catches the adult
mackerel.
Name signs too are vital in the fight for market share. 'The more obvious
you make the name over the door, the easier it is for people to make
purchasing decisions,' says Gillespie. And decor matters; he believes people
are becoming socially lazy, wanting to be entertained by their surroundings.
He is also experimenting with seating; empty expanses deter potential
customers and may unnerve those who do consume, undermining attempts to
build brand loyalty.
Monument Mall is the first Courtlands food court where all seating is unit
specific.
Compared with traditional cafeterias, Courtlands' range of food looks wide;
but coffee, cakes and sandwiches are still the big sellers. Innovation can
be risky; one customer who ordered an espresso complained, loudly, that it
had come in a small cup without milk.
'Sometimes,' sighs Gillespie, 'you do things ahead of their aspirations.'

FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell probe to broaden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE members of the House of Lords are expected to be asked to give
evidence to the Commons' cross-party social security committee as it reopens
and broadens its inquiry into the disappearance of Maxwell company pension
funds.
Lord Walker, who was briefly a director of Maxwell Communication
Corporation, and Lord Donoughue and Lord Williams of Elvel, who were
directors of Maxwell investment companies, are likely to be invited to
attend the committee as the renewed investigation is stepped up in the
autumn.
The committee is also planning to hold a special session in September -
during the parliamentary recess - to take evidence from the liquidators and
administrators of the Maxwell companies.
Meeting yesterday for the first time since the general election, the
committee also re-elected Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, as
chairman.
The renewal of its investigation into the plight of the Maxwell pensioners
is likely to focus on three areas: the liquidators and administrators; the
key companies, including London and Bishopsgate International Investment
Management, and Bishopsgate Investment Management; and the role of the
banks, including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.
Separately, the Treasury and Civil service select committee decided to
consider resuming investigations into the collapse of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
A final decision will depend on Treasury and Bank of England responses to
the committee's earlier report on BCCI and on the official inquiry under
Lord Justice Bingham.
Mr John Watts, the Tory MP for Slough who two years ago declined to endorse
UK membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, has been elected
chairman of the Treasury committee.
MPs on the Treasury committee are to invite Mr Anthony Nelson, economic
secretary, to give evidence in the autumn on his new responsibilities for
City regulation. A wider investigation into City regulation may follow.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, is also expected to be
called to discuss the Citizen's Charter.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Bank offers money transfer service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIPA-NET, a low-cost method of transferring money between European
countries, is being introduced by Co-operative Bank in the UK and a number
of other European co-operative banks.
The service comes in response to calls from Sir Leon Brittan, the European
Community competition commissioner, and the European Commission for cheaper
and easier methods of cross-border payment.
Customers will pay Pounds 5 per transaction to have funds sent to France,
Belgium, Germany, and Italy within four to seven working days. Canada is
also included in the service which guarantees customers that currency
conversions will be made at reasonable rates.
Business customers will be able to transfer money through Tipa-Net at
negotiated bulk rates well below the Pounds 5 charge. Co-operative Bank said
yesterday that it expected the service to be used by insurance and pension
companies, mail order businesses and publishers.
Mr Gordon Younger, executive director of Co-operative Bank, said: 'From now
on, everyone will know exactly how long it will take to make a cross-border
payment and there will be one up-front payment of Pounds 5.'
Co-operative Bank says that before introducing the service it experimented
by sending payments of Pounds 100 from the seven largest UK clearing banks
to accounts in Paris and Brussels. Charges made in the UK on the transfer to
Paris ranged from Pounds 23.34, made by NatWest, to Pounds 5 from TSB and
Pounds 8 from the Bank of Scotland, with most banks charging between Pounds
11 and Pounds 16.

FT  16 JUL 92 / UK 'still attracts most EC inward investment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN continues to attract the lion's share of inward investment into the
European Community, in spite of a fall in the number of new projects because
of the continuing international recession.
Figures released yesterday by the Invest in Britain Bureau show that
overseas companies are still investing more in the UK than in any other EC
country. With the approaching single market, it is thought that the UK could
be accounting for around a third of all incoming EC investment.
According to the bureau, part of the Department of Trade and Industry,
overseas companies endorsed 332 investment projects in the UK during the 12
months to the end of March 1992. There were 350 in the previous year.
US and Japanese companies are channelling nearly 40 per cent of EC direct
investment into the UK. Germany and France are also investing heavily in the
UK.
Mr Malcolm Day, director of the bureau, said the single market remained the
driving force behind the inflow of investment, which was holding up well.
Mr Day said a fall from the peak number of investments recorded in 1990-91
was understandable, given the state of the world economy and the fact that
many of the largest international companies were already established in
Britain. Current inquiries from overseas were showing another increase, he
added.
Britain's promotional efforts to attract a continuing flow of corporate
investment would have to be maintained, he said. Particular emphasis will be
placed on medium to smaller-sized businesses, and Malaysia, Indonesia,
Singapore and Hong Kong will be targeted in the next 18 months.
Over the last three years inward investors have bought, on average, more
than half of all their capital equipment within the UK. The DTI says that
companies establishing themselves are moving rapidly to increase local
sourcing and to build long-term relationships with suppliers.
About half the proposed new investment in the UK is by foreign companies
that are already established in the UK. Japanese companies are extending
their investment beyond manufacturing to include research and development
facilities. Many of the incoming companies are, according to the DTI,
spending more on training than their British competitors.
The investment projects given the go-ahead in the year to March are expected
to create nearly 23,000 new jobs and to safeguard nearly 29,000 more.
Wales was particularly successful in securing new investment - attracting 71
projects - although Scotland and Northern Ireland were also chosen by a
significant number of companies as suitable investment locations.
The bureau provides no estimate of the value of recorded inward investment.
Among the largest projects in 1991-92, however, was a decision by Sony, the
electronics group, to invest Pounds 144m in expanding in Wales, and Kimberly
Clark, the US consumer products company, to spend Pounds 100m in south
Humberside.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Industrial upturn reported in north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES and orders rose significantly in the second quarter of this year for
companies in the north of England, boosting confidence in business prospects
and pointing the way out of recession, according to the latest Business
Survey North issued yesterday.
The second-quarter improvement in most indicators suggests that companies in
north-east England and Cumbria are recovering 'slowly but steadily' from
recession, says the report. In contrast to the previous survey,
manufacturers performed better than service companies.
The survey, carried out by the Northern Development Company and Tyne and
Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce, was based on responses from 756
companies in the region.
It shows 33.5 per cent of companies predicting an improvement in business
conditions in the third quarter and just 9 per cent a decline; 59.8 per cent
of companies expected increased turnover in the next 12 months and 53.5 per
cent higher profits.
UK sales in the second quarter rose substantially and export sales, although
remaining below last year's average, rallied from their first quarter
setback.
Investment in plant, machinery and buildings remained 'modest', says the
report.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS people in several sectors in Scotland are becoming slightly more
confident about their prospects and there are signs of a modest rise in
demand.
This is shown in the latest quarterly Scottish business survey conducted by
chambers of commerce and analysed by the Fraser of Allander Institute of
Strathclyde University, Glasgow.
The survey disclosed a slight increase in business optimism in manufacturing
and an appreciable rise in confidence in the retailing sector. The tourism
and leisure industries also reported improved confidence.
There was a sharp fall in optimism about prospects in the construction
industry compared both with three months ago and a year ago. There was no
evidence of a general upturn in demand for labour.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Lecs payments faulted: Watchdog qualifies Scottish
Enterprise's first annual accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, has qualified
the first annual accounts of Scottish Enterprise, the body that replaced the
Scottish Development Agency last year, saying there is 'a risk of error
which could be material'.
The qualification in the statement on the accounts from Sir John Bourn,
comptroller and auditor-general, relates to payments made by Scottish
Enterprise to the 13 Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) under its control
which they passed on to training providers. Lecs are the Scottish equivalent
of the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales.
Sir John says that at five of the Lecs, financial appraisal and monitoring
systems for the disbursal of training funds were not in place for the whole
of the 1991-92 financial year. One did not implement them until last
November.
He says that the appraisal and monitoring systems at one Lec were 'giving
Scottish Enterprise concern at the end of the financial year' and that 11
Lecs had not arranged for an internal audit to be carried out in the form
required by the rules.
The qualified NAO statement is a source of deep embarrassment to Scottish
Enterprise after it indicated its satisfaction at the progress made so far
by the network of Lecs. Scottish Enterprise is likely to be called to give
evidence to the Commons public accounts committee.
Sir David Nickson, Scottish Enterprise chairman, said yesterday: 'I think
any qualification has to be taken seriously. It's an extremely mild
qualification.'
He said there had been 'no suggestion whatever that there has been any
misuse or misallocation of funds at all and none has been found'.
Last year Scottish Enterprise handed out Pounds 329m of its Pounds 446m
budget to the Lecs. Of this about Pounds 200m went on training programmes.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Boost to innovation urged by Nedo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK BUSINESSES are diverting cash that should be spent on research and
development into dividend payments for shareholders, according the National
Economic Development Office (Nedo).
Companies are also inhibited from exploiting innovations by rules on insider
trading which prevent close collaboration between scientists and financiers,
says Mr Colin Mayer, Price Waterhouse professor of corporate finance at City
University Business School. His comments come in a book published today by
Nedo.
Nedo argues that the UK's poor industrial performance could be improved
through innovation. This would use resources more effectively, cut costs and
improve cashflows, says Mr Walter Eltis, Nedo's director-general, in the
book.
Almost two thirds of UK growth between 1913 and 1984 has resulted from
innovation. But over 20 years the UK has fallen from second to fifth place
among the six biggest industrialised countries in terms of the proportion of
gross domestic product spent on R&amp;D. This has had a disproportionate effect
on the economic health of the nation, says Nedo.
Comparing the UK with Germany, Mr Mayer notes that the main difference
between the two is seen as smaller companies grow. 'In the UK they typically
seek a stock market quotation; in Germany they are funded by their banks',
which, he says, are prepared 'to forego dividends during periods of
financial distress'.
But Mr Eltis rejects the interventionist policies of the 1940s to 1970s. He
gives examples of Britain's nuclear programme and Concorde, the supersonic
passenger aircraft, as cases where government investment failed to meet
market needs.
Nedo makes a series of policy recommendations for both corporate management
and the government. These include encouraging joint ventures and
collaboration, both across frontiers and with suppliers and customers.
It says that heavy spending on defence R&amp;D is inefficient, adding: 'Projects
become enmeshed in a public purchasing programme which is both bureaucratic
and inflexible.'
It argues that any government incentives to innovation through subsidy 'must
be balanced by the maintenance of vigorous competition'.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Parcelforce faces imminent privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARCELFORCE, the loss-making parcel delivery arm of the Post Office, is to
be privatised as soon as possible, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, said yesterday
Announcing the plans, Mr Heseltine emphasised there would continue to be a
universal parcel service at a uniform and affordable tariff.
'That is not negotiable,' he told MPs, indicating that the tariff would
remain a matter that ministers decided.
The government has yet to decide how privatisation is to be achieved, though
Mr Heseltine indicated that financial support would be made available so
that management and employees could make a bid.
Other potential bidders might include rivals United Parcels Service, TNT,
and Securicor.
Parcelforce has the leading 34 per cent share of ordinary parcel deliveries
but only 2 per cent of the premium 'next day' market.
Its turnover for 1991-92 was Pounds 508m and it sustained a loss of Pounds
24m.
Parcelforce management points to a profitable second half of the year and an
improvement from the losses of Pounds 131m in 1990-91.
Mr Heseltine said Parcelforce was the only part of the Post Office that
would be affected, but the decision prompted speculation that it would be
followed by moves to privatise the Royal Mail. The election manifesto said
only that the government was committed to maintaining a nationwide letter
service with delivery to every address in the UK with a uniform price
structure, and a national network of post offices.
Most post offices are already privately run.
Reaction from trade unions representing Parcelforce's 12,500 employees was
hostile, although Mr Terry Deegan, general secretary of the Communication
Managers' Association, said a management buyout 'might well be the least
undesirable privatisation option'.
The Union of Communication Workers, which represents the bulk of Parcelforce
workers, called for assurances on protection of the pension fund, job
security and continued union recognition. It also raised fears about the
future of rural parcel deliveries.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, the chairman of the Post Office, said his board
supported the government's view that privatisation would 'provide the
commercial framework and access to capital that Parcelforce needs'.
The operation would need 'continued significant investment' to secure a
strong future, he said.
Labour accused the government of indulging in 'privatisation for
privatisation's sake', and warned that the move threatened to undermine more
than 100 years of a universal parcel service.

VIRGIN Atlantic Airways yesterday cancelled the launch of its
London-to-Johannesburg service from Heathrow airport, blaming a lack of
landing slots available at the airport.
But Mr Tim Walden, chairman of the Heathrow scheduling committee, said
Virgin's claim 'is wholly misleading and inaccurate'.
Cabin crew at British Airways yesterday voted to strike over changes to pay

<TEXT>
MR Jimmy Carter, a defeated Democrat welcomed by his party, attacked his
Republican successors late on Tuesday for fostering poverty at home and
bloodshed in Latin America. He expressed doubts about the need to make war
on President Saddam Hussein in Iraq last year, agencies report from New
York.
'The world cries out for peaceful resolution of conflict,' the former
president told the Democratic party convention in New York, 'but our country
is seen as more warlike than peace-loving. Our country should seek greatness
in peace, not war.'
He portrayed the US government, since his tenure in 1977-81, as driven by
expediency and impatience with negotiation, as well as being indifferent to
poverty and callous toward the environment.
'This has got to change,' Mr Carter said. He did not mention ex-President
Ronald Reagan or President George Bush by name, but his targets were clear.
Earlier, in an interview, the Democratic senior statesman said he believed
Mr Ross Perot, the independent billionaire preparing a tilt at the
presidency this year, would be a big factor in the election and could ensure
the election of Governor Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate,
or throw the race to a decision by the House of Representatives.
Mr Carter said the Democratic party this year was 'coming back to a more
moderate position', similar to the one he had advocated. He said he would
have a 'limited role' in the campaign.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US industrial production fell 0.3 per cent in June, the first decline in
five months, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday.
Although most of the fall was attributed to a two-day rail strike which led
to a drop in coal mining, other key sectors were also lagging.
The output of consumer goods fell 0.4 per cent with cuts in car and truck
assemblies accounting for about half the total loss.
Production of appliances and furniture continued to improve - a sign of the
boost given to housing with lower interest rates - but the output of many
non-durables, including food and clothing, also declined.
The Industrial Production Index had been rising about 0.5 per cent for each
of the preceding four months.
Although analysts had been expecting a June decline in industrial
production, the fall underlined the frailty of the economy and bolstered
fears that the recovery might stall or fall into a 'triple-dip' recession.
Unemployment, now at 7.8 per cent, is unlikely to show much early
improvement, with large numbers of projected lay-offs being announced by the
week.
Industrial capacity utilisation in June fell 0.4 percentage points to 78.5
per cent.
Other reports have indicated similarly lacklustre economic performance,
despite sharp reductions in interest rates. On Tuesday, the Commerce
Department said retail sales went up just 0.5 per cent in June after a 0.4
per cent gain in May.
For the second quarter as a whole, production grew at an annual rate of 4.5
per cent, in contrast to the opening period when it shrank by 2.9 per cent.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Business-union accord close in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH African business and labour leaders are near agreement on a 'charter
for peace and economic reconstruction' which includes a call for elections
for a transitional parliament within six months.
If successful, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), would
agree to call off a general strike scheduled to begin on August 3. It was
planned to last two or three days, followed during the rest of the week by
activities designed to disrupt business life, including sit-ins and
encouraging black taxi drivers to create traffic jams.
Instead, employers and unions would co-operate in organising public meetings
calling for 'peace democracy and reconstruction'. Normal economic activity
would be suspended for the day.
Talks with Cosatu are being conducted by the South African Co-ordinating
Committee on Labour (Sacola), which represents the country's biggest
employers. Earlier this week a Sacola spokesman played down speculation that
agreement was imminent, but negotiators said yesterday that a draft document
being considered could be approved at the weekend.
The charter will be put to a convention of business leaders for endorsement
before the end of July. It would signal the start of a more wide-ranging
business involvement in national affairs, fuelled partly by impatience and
frustration over the government's performance in recent months.
Businessmen and business-backed institutions such as the Urban Foundation
have contributed to housing and education programmes in the past. However,
the charter could mark a remarkable new alliance between business and
labour, based on a shared objective of a rapid transition to a democratic
government.
The charter calls on employers to assist in the creation of community 'peace
committees', effective monitoring of the security forces, job creation
programmes, drought relief, and technical training. The South African
Defence Force said yesterday it was 'investigating the background' of an
SADF member who allegedly took part in a plot to kill Mr Dirk Coetzee, a
former South African policeman living in London. Mr Coetzee says he was once
in a police 'death squad'. The plot was prevented by British intelligence.
Responding to reports in London's Independent newspaper, a spokesman said
two SADF members went to London in April to look into alleged Irish
Republican Army-ANC links. 'During the visit, one member, acting without the
sanction or knowledge of the defence force, or any other government
authority, allegedly decided to arrange for the monitoring of Mr Dirk
Coetzee, the former fugitive South African police captain.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S mainstream manufacturing and service industries saw a sharp rise in
bankruptcies during June in a reflection of the broad slowdown of the
Japanese economy, the Teikoku Data Bank reported yesterday.
The total debt of bankrupt companies, at Y375.2bn (Pounds 1.6bn), was none
the less the smallest figure this year, owing to the absence of large
property-related collapses. The number of property-related bankruptcies fell
from 104 a year ago to 86, registering the first year-on-year decline in
nearly two years.
Property companies were first to be in distress last year when a period of
high interest rates led to a sharp decline in asset prices. Last month's
figures, however, show that corporate difficulties have now spread broadly
through the economy.
The total number of corporate bankruptcies during June rose to 1,171, the
highest in nearly seven years.
Bankruptcies in construction rose year-on-year by 33 per cent to 236 cases;
in manufacturing by 36 per cent to 155; in wholesaling by 36.5 per cent to
284 cases. Similar increases were reported in retailing, transportation and
communications, and in other service industries. Teikoku said that the high
rate of bankruptcies was expected to continue in the months ahead.
Private sector machinery orders in May plunged by 23 per cent from a year
ago, the Economic Planning Agency said, making it the seventh consecutive
month of year-on-year declines. The agency said that orders from big users
in the automobile, chemical and machinery industries have yet to show signs
of recovery.
Public sector orders increased by 11 per cent, and are expected to
accelerate later in the year.

THE Hong Kong government has significantly softened its negotiating stance
with China over plans to finance the colony's HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds
11.9bn) airport and related projects.
At a meeting of the joint Sino-British airport committee today the
government is expected to propose to China that it approve the financial
package for the airport and leave resolution of China's concerns about the
airport railway to future negotiations. Previously the Hong Kong government
had sought approval for the whole financing for the project.
The decision came on Tuesday at the first meeting of the colony's cabinet,
chaired by Governor Chris Patten, and might indicate a more pragmatic
attitude in dealing with Beijing.
At the same time, the government released details of Hong Kong's foreign
reserves - hitherto a secret known only to a few officials and never
revealed in detail to Beijing - a move seen to ease China's concerns about
the robustness of the colony's finances. It said Hong Kong's foreign
reserves were USDollars 29bn at the end of 1991, 12th largest in the world.
China's reserves are put at Dollars 43.6bn. The government said knowledge of
the figure would help lenders to its infrastructure programmes realistically
to assess the colony's financial health.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Miyazawa works hard to rally faithful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was no doubt yesterday about the voting intention of the 77-year-old
with the black string tie: 'Of course I support Mr Nakasone. How could I not
support him? I went to the same primary school as his father.'
A little Japanese flag resting in his lap, the Liberal Democratic Party
supporter had come to listen to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who
reassured the local faithful that their man, Mr Hirofumi Nakasone, was
worthy of a vote in elections on July 26.
The vote, for half the seats in the upper house of parliament, is seen as a
test of voter confidence in the ruling party which has been tainted by
scandal, troubled by internal divisions and faced with opposition to
legislation allowing military personnel to join overseas peacekeeping
missions.
But for all the anguished debate this year over Japan's international role,
the issues that yesterday most troubled the people of Gunma Prefecture,
north of Tokyo, were bridges, motorways and other public works projects of
the pork-barrel variety.
As the well-meaning Mr Miyazawa gave a mostly elderly audience a rundown of
his experiences at the Group of Seven summit last week and of his concerns
about Russian inflation and Cambodia, a few of the little Japanese flags
slipped from freckled hands and eyes gently closed.
What stirs the locals was better understood by Mr Nakasone, 46, son of
Yasuhiro Nakasone, the former prime minister, who began his speech with a
polite reference to his respected father and gave a commitment to the
eradication of traffic jams in Gunma.
The candidacy of Mr Nakasone is itself a sign of the small-town nature of
Japanese politics. There are 13 sons of politicians competing for seats and
the people of Gunma who have supported Yasuhiro are inclined to support
Hirofumi in his campaign for re-election.
Japan's electoral system works against politicians who neglect the small
town. Mr Nakasone is one of four candidates competing for two seats
representing the Gunma district, and his main competition is coming from a
local member of his own party, Mr Kosei Ueno. The two other candidates are
from the Japan Communist Party and Rengo, the trade union party, and are
also supported by the Social Democratic Party and the middle-of-the-road
Democratic Socialist Party.
LDP officials hope to retain both seats, but one may go to the Rengo
representative, Mr Yoshiro Akane, vice-president of the Gunma Sailing
Association. With that outcome in mind, the two LDP candidates are running
separate campaigns with separate headquarters, forcing Mr Miyazawa to give
two separate Gunma speeches.
Meanwhile, Mr Miyazawa will continue his course around the country over the
next week, attempting to convince his polite if unmoved audiences that
Russia really matters and that Cambodia does count, and remaining slightly
irrelevant to the electoral process.

AN Algerian court sentenced Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) leaders Abassi
Madani and Ali Benhadj to 12 years in prison yesterday, Reuter reports from
Algiers. They were charged with conspiracy against the state, which carries
the death penalty.
The military prosecutor had asked for life imprisonment for both men whose
now outlawed party was blamed for plunging Algeria into 13 months of
violence and political turmoil.
The military court president, passing sentence at the trial which was closed
to foreign journalists, said the court took into account 'extenuating
circumstances'. Another FIS official, Kamel Guemazi, former mayor of
Algiers, was given six years. The prosecutor had asked for 20 years. Four
other men received four-year terms.
All of those accused refused to attend the court which was also boycotted by
their lawyers. The defence said earlier they would appeal to the supreme
court whatever the sentences.

TRADERS yesterday resumed dealing on the Bombay stock exchange after a
month-long absence as a result of the arrest of two top brokers and the
attachment of their property in the Rs35bn (Pounds 650m) securities market
scandal.
Share values fell, and the 30-share index was down 177 points to 2,912, with
trading restricted to some 250 issues against the normal 1,500. The index
was down 35 per cent from a peak 4,467 on April 22.
The brokers had sought freedom to trade in all shares, including those dealt
by the disgraced brokers, Mr Harshad Mehta and Mr Bhupen Dalal. But the
custodian appointed by the government said each lot traded by the two
brokers had to be checked and approved for trading. Under a compromise,
traders have agreed to deal provisionally in shares that do not attract
attachment by the custodian.
Unit Trust of India, the main mutual fund, which has been objecting to
taking delivery of shares brokered by Mr Mehta, was the main buyer
yesterday. The exchange set daily limits on the amounts of shares each
broker could sell.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, said his government would never
allow destruction of a mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya so that Hindus
could build a temple on the site. Mr Rao made his statement to parliament in
a debate on an opposition no-confidence motion the government expects to
win.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE pro-market reforms in Russia have vastly increased wages for workers and
managers in the state-owned, heavy industrial sector - while pushing many
private businesses under and cutting wages in the private sector.
In a further sign of the enrichment of managers who run the state
enterprises, Russia's oil producers have earned an estimated Dollars 5bn
(Pounds 2.6bn) this year, none of which has been invested in the industry.
The implication is that much of it has been diverted to enterprise or
personal bank accounts.
Professor Yevgenny Yasin, the government's plenipotentiary for relations
with the parliament and head of research at the Russian Union of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, told an international economists'
conference yesterday these processes, 'happening as they do on the eve of
large-scale privatisation, are taking on a dangerous character'.
Prof Yasin said the directors of big enterprises were pushing up product
prices and wages in the expectation of being able fully to control the
enterprises, in association with the workforce, once they are transformed
into joint stock companies as the government intends later this year.
'This is especially true in those industries most requiring restructuring,
where production is dropping - for example in ferrous metallurgy, where
production has dropped by 50 per cent over the year.'
At the same time, some 50 per cent of the co-operatives had gone bankrupt.
While there are now other legal forms of private business, Prof Yasin said:
'Certainly, the private sector has suffered while the state sector was able
to get benefits from the government.'

prices, says IEA
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE should reduce its dependence on nuclear energy and bring its low
electricity prices more in line with production costs, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) said yesterday in its first report on the country.
France's nuclear programme, the biggest in western Europe, is highly
efficient and has helped reduce the country's dependence on imported energy,
says the IEA, an influential advisory and co-ordination body which groups
most members of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD).
Since the 1973 oil price shock, France has halved its dependence on energy
imports but still buys nearly all its oil from abroad, says the IEA in a
report to mark France's entry to the organisation. France refused to join
the IEA on its formation in 1974 because it feared this would diminish its
energy policy independence, but changed its mind during the Gulf war, in
view of the organisation's success in co-ordinating the west's oil stocks.
The IEA praises France's low carbon dioxide pollution, a side effect of its
nuclear dependence. Emissions of carbon dioxide there have fallen by a
quarter over the past 12 years to 1.9 tonnes per head, among the lowest in
the IEA.
Yet the organisation warns that France should now do more to diversify away
from nuclear energy, which accounts for 75-80 per cent of electricity and 37
per cent of total energy use. 'This is a concern from the point of view of
the flexibility of the system,' said Mrs Helga Steeg, IEA executive
director.
The report stresses that France should maintain and modernise its nuclear
programme, but suggests it should consider supplementing this with more
natural gas and clean coal technology. It also disapproves of exports of
nuclear electricity, a significant source of income for Electricite de
France, which Mrs Steeg argued was 'not a solid policy' for importing
countries. Last year Britain was France's largest export customer, followed
by Switzerland and Italy.
French electricity prices do not always reflect costs, especially in home
central heating, adds the report. Improvement is needed here to encourage
energy saving and to give a fairer chance to other kinds of energy. It does
not question the usefulness of the monopolies held by France's state-owned
electricity and gas utilities, but urges France to promote more competition
in energy supply.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Bosnia seeks removal of all heavy weapons: London peace
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnian government yesterday asked the European Community to place all
heavy weapons under international supervision as the first step towards
stopping the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, who took part in bilateral
talks with Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on
Yugoslavia, in London said ceasefires were meaningless if the international
community failed to take steps to disarm the Serbs.
'How can we continue this peace conference when thousands of people are
being killed or deported, and regions are being ethnically cleansed by the
Serbs?' asked Mr Silajdzic.
He said the Bosnian government would reject the 'cantonisation' plan drawn
up by the EC last March. The plan was supported by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head
of the Bosnian Serbs, and Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats, because it
would eventually lead to the ethnic division of Bosnia between Croatia and
Serbia and leave the Moslems without a homeland.
Mr Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs and the Serb irregular forces, who
also met Lord Carrington, called for a ceasefire and the creation of a land
corridor from the Adriatic port of Split in Croatia to the Bosnian capital
of Sarajevo, which is still under siege by the Serb irregulars.
Mr Karadzic said the ceasefire 'should last longer to give us a breather to
finish our talks on the conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
But it appeared unlikely that he would adhere to any ceasefire until the
Serbs had consolidated their hold over eastern Bosnia.
Meanwhile, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who left for a
four-day tour of former Yugoslavia, was due to stop in Paris last night for
talks with his French opposite number, Mr Roland Dumas.
Mr Hurd, who is due to visit Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo (if conditions
permit), Belgrade, Skopje and Tirana, is anxious to use the British
presidency of the European Community to boost efforts to find a peaceful
solution to the Yugoslav crisis.
Mr Hurd and Mr Dumas were expected to discuss the possibility of opening
land corridors to Sarajevo through which aid would be transported in trucks,
which would have to be protected both by military aircraft and ground
troops.
Britain has firmly ruled out the use of British troops for such a purpose.

EUROPE'S national airlines yesterday called for 'a quick political solution'
to the growing problem of congestion in the skies.
Mr Giovanni Bisignani, chairman of the Association of European Airlines
(AEA) and chief executive of Alitalia, attacked Europe's failure to
establish a single harmonised system of air traffic control.
Europe's 54 air traffic control centres use 31 different technical systems,
none compatible with the others. The computer hardware for the systems comes
from 18 different manufacturers and employs 70 different programming
languages. At an AEA forum in Brussels, Mr Bisignani said the fragmented
system of national jurisdiction over European airspace had doubled delays
over the last six years.
Overloading of the European air traffic control (ATC) network has already
meant that dozens of flights have been delayed or cancelled this summer.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) and Eurocontrol, the
Brussels-based government backed air traffic control centre, are developing
an improved ATC scheme for Europe. But the new system will not be ready
until 1995 at the earliest and Iata warned last month that a serious failure
of Europe's ATC might occur this summer, leaving hundreds of aircraft and
crews stranded at the wrong airports.
Mr Bisignani yesterday launched a pan-European information campaign aimed at
shifting the blame for flight delays and cancellations to the national and
European authorities.
Transport ministers from the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) met
in March to consider ways of improving the air traffic control system. But
the AEA says ECAC's harmonisation programme will still lead to 'a
complicated and very inefficient managerial structure' because it will try
to preserve national authorities' sovereignty over their airspace.

EUROPEAN industry would get 10 years to increase the proportion of waste
packaging it recovers from around 18 per cent now to 90 per cent, under a
plan proposed by the Brussels Commission yesterday.
The EC produces some 50m tonnes of waste packaging a year. Yesterday's draft
directive, which must win approval from EC governments, aims to cut the
large share of this which gets pushed untreated into landfills, and the
growing number of purely national curbs on packaging that threaten to create
barriers to trade in the single EC market.
Unveiling the long-awaited plan, Mr Karel Van Miert, recently made
responsible for the environment in the EC Commission, said that, if the
draft directive were adopted, most change would be needed in the south of
Europe where public sensitivity to the environment is less. In the north,
Denmark would have to drop its ban on aluminium drink cans and let them be
recycled.
The Commission was still examining last year's German law making
manufacturers and retailers responsible for getting rid of waste packaging,
Mr Van Miert said. But he believed that Germany might drop restrictions on
the burning of packaging, which would be partially permitted under the EC
proposal. 'We don't want to put spokes in the wheels of those countries such
as Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands which are in the vanguard of dealing
with waste packaging.'
Sensitive at possible charges of Brussels' interference, particularly while
the Maastricht union treaty remains unratified, Mr Van Miert stressed member
states would be left free on how to meet the targets that would only become
legally binding after a decade.
The European Recovery and Recycling Association (ERRA), a grouping of 31
major companies involved in packaging materials, consumer products and
retailing, yesterday welcomed the draft directive 'as a first step to avoid
packaging restrictions being used by countries, or even regions, to wreak
havoc with the single market'.
As at present drafted, the EC plan would require that 90 per cent of total
packaging waste, half of which is produced by households and the rest by
business and industry, would have to be disposed of by recycling, composting
or burning. At least 60 per cent of the total would have to be recycled into
fresh packaging or other materials.
ERRA warned that the plastics industry would find it hard to meet this
latter target. Plastic wrapping and film had now been reduced to very fine
proportions, helping reduce packaging weight. Collecting and cleaning this
up for recycling would be difficult and costly. One element in the plan
would be to harmonise the labelling of packaging for the benefit of
consumers, waste collectors and recyclers throughout the Community.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Brussels puts telephones plan on hold
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission plans to liberalise basic telephone services will not be
published until the end of September because of French sensitivity over the
issue.
France is due to hold its referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September,
and the state-owned telecommunications company France Telecom is one of the
most vociferous opponents of further liberalisation.
The Commission yesterday approved directives which would lay the groundwork
for greater competition, by harmonising technical and quality standards, and
granting third parties access to telephone networks. Brussels also published
a paper criticising the excessive cost of cross-border telephone calls.
But the Commission withdrew a policy paper laying out how it would open up
cross-border calls to competition. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the research
and telecommunications commissioner, said: 'We have evaluated all the
circumstances and we have decided to delay it (the review) until September
30.'
The Commission is proposing supplementary funding of Ecu1.6bn (Pounds
1.13bn) to bridge the financial gap between its 1990-94 research and
development programme and the programme for the next five years.
At the same time, Mr Pandolfi said yesterday that the Commission was to
rationalise the structure of its two research and technology directorates.

FT  16 JUL 92 / Germany plans Pounds 170bn transport revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday set aside its money worries and committed
itself to a DM493bn (Pounds 170bn) plan to reform and partially privatise
the national transport system.
Only weeks after accepting a finance ministry proposal for a clamp on public
spending, the cabinet agreed to build 2,400km of roads and 2,200km of
railway by 2010.
Centrepiece of the reform, presented by Mr Gunter Krause, transport
minister, is the privatisation of the railways.
Starting in 1994, the western Bundesbahn and the Reichsbahn in the east will
be bundled together in a shareholding group, Deutsche Bahnen AG (DBAG).
Operations will be split into three independent companies under the DBAG
umbrella, responsible for passenger traffic, freight and track management.
DBAG itself is to be dissolved after five years and its three components
left to run their own affairs.
On incorporation, the government will take over the railway's debt mountain,
which is expected to reach DM55bn this year. However, no decisions have yet
been made on the financing of the reforms, nor the nature and extent of the
government's plans for privatisation. Mr Krause claimed the scheme would
have a 'neutral' impact on the federal budget.
Mr Krause said one objective was to switch 10 per cent of road traffic back
to the railways.
Although Mr Krause's initiative was widely welcomed, the lack of detail on
financing drew fire from business and industrial organisations, while the
road-building schemes were attacked by environmentalists as 'dead-end'
policies.
One potential source of funds is road tolls. Germany was Europe's leading
transit route, Mr Krause said, and foreign road users should share the
costs. Further cash would come from the sale of railway property.
Five of the new road projects, including a tunnel under the Elbe in Hamburg,
are to be undertaken by private groups. They will quote for and construct
the roads, and the government will pay by instalments. A further 23 projects
are being considered for similar treatment.
Including stretches in need of rebuilding and widening, and 1,000 by-passes
in eastern Germany, the development plan involves 11,600km of concrete and
asphalt and a total cost of DM191bn.
Improvements to the railways, which include completion of a 3,200km
high-speed network, will cost around DM194bn.
The cabinet also gave provisional blessing to track for the newly-developed
'magnet' hovertrain between Hamburg and Berlin and possibly to Bonn, Bremen
and Cologne.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL auction house Christie's yesterday became the backdrop for the
latest efforts to negotiate peace for the embattled republic of Bosnia as
talks shifted to London.
Putting the press in the picture last night, Lord Carrington, chairman of
the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia and also chairman of
Christies International, did not hide the problems negotiators faced.
'I think the best thing that has happened today is that all three sides
turned up. I don't think that would have happened 10 days ago,' he said.
Moslem, Serbian and Croatian representatives met separately with Lord
Carrington after he conceded it was unlikely all three factions could be
brought to the same negotiating table.

FT  15 JUL 92 / OECD takes heat off Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN money supply, the supposed hot potato to be juggled at the Bundesbank
council meeting in Frankfurt tomorrow, seems not so hot after all now that
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest economic
survey of Germany has handled it with cool detachment.
'The currently rapid money and credit growth has given rise to concern that,
if it continues, it may impair the credibility of the monetary authorities
by allowing inflationary pressure and expectations to remain strong,' the
report says. However, it explains, there are special factors behind the
runaway expansion of the broad M3 measure - 9 per cent annualised in May
compared with the Bundesbank's 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent target range.
To paraphrase the report's delicate language, it says that, since
reconstruction of the wrecked eastern economy has increased calls on every
conceivable west German resource, it is hardly surprising that money is in
demand.
There is also evidence of D-Mark hoarding and demand from neighbouring
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, where the hardest currency in Europe is
widely preferred to the softer local alternatives.
The Paris-based organisation believes accordingly: 'A temporary above-target
monetary expansion would not seem to call for further tightening of monetary
conditions'.
Meanwhile, it adds, the interest rates screw must be held down until
inflation rates respond. Making no mention of the impact of the maintenance
of existing high rates on Germany's partners in the European Monetary System
 -Bundesbank policy has been under persistent fire as the main dampening
influence on attempts to break out of recession - the report focuses solely
on domestic challenges.
The OECD notes that the speed at which policy decisions had to be made and
implemented has introduced inefficiencies and distortions, particularly in
the labour market. It suggests that transfers to the east, equivalent to 25
per cent of western GNP, may be in danger of 'generating negative incentive
effects.
'Expenditure on income support that does not produce real investment in
human or physical capital will tend to weaken economic incentives and
discourage initiative in the new states,' it warns.
Job-creation schemes, for example, which are funded by the labour office and
pay relatively high wages, are often involved in clean-up and industrial
renovation work which could be carried out by private enterprise.
Meanwhile, other workers are being paid too much, the study says. Wage deals
in 1990 and 1991, in which many eastern German employees were promised pay
parity by 1994, took no account of the labour situation in the eastern
Lander. Last year's deals should now be renegotiated, the report says.
Running a substantial budget deficit - at least for a time - is also
acceptable to the OECD's economists as an exceptional response to
extraordinary times. A deficit of 2.75 per cent of GNP in 1991, and rising
this year, is 'not a sign of over-spending or weakness of the tax system'.
It will correct itself as the east catches up, the report claims.
However, the rise in government spending in 1990 and 1991 has wiped out
virtually all the consolidation gains obtained in the years 1982-1989.
Meanwhile, increased taxes and social security contributions have brought
the overall tax burden in the west back to the level before the tax reform
programme which started in 1986.
The government is committed to re-setting the budgetary balance, cutting
subsidies and capping public spending with nominal 2.5 per cent and 3 per
cent annual increases in federal and state budgets respectively, but the
report warns that state and local authority spending is likely to remain
'vigorous'.

FT  15 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally leaves share prices firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLIMMERS of returning confidence brightened the UK stock market yesterday
when share prices rallied to close higher in spite of a background of
continuing gloom on both the economic and corporate fronts. Trading volume
remained unexciting but increased towards the close on selective buying from
both UK and US investment sources.
The London market remained tense as it waited to hear if tomorrow's meeting
of the Bundesbank council will take action to tighten credit policies in
Germany, a move which would inevitably apply upward pressures on UK base
rates. Concern over the recession in the UK was fuelled yesterday by news of
a 1 per cent fall in May's industrial production figures - substantially
greater than expected. The stock market also had to face a heavy batch of
profits downgrades on leading UK companies by brokerage analysts.
Early deals saw the FT-SE Index fall by 16 points, led downwards by a
setback in the September futures contract on the index. The market steadied
at 2,461, however, lending substance to the view of some analysts that the
2,500 area is a resistance base. Shares then traded steadily until early
afternoon, helped by a steadier performance from the stock index futures
contract.
A stronger rally developed in the late afternoon and the Footsie regained
its losses and moved into positive territory. US buyers appeared for British
Petroleum, Cadbury-Schweppes, Reuters and Cable and Wireless, although Wall
Street made a slow start to its session, with the Dow Average easing one
point in UK hours.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,484.0, with a gain of 5.7 on
the session. Traders eschewed enthusiasm, pointing out that the day's Seaq
total of 374.1m shares was still unimpressive. Monday's volume of 349.4m
represented retail, or customer, business worth only Pounds 883.8m.
Traders of a superstitious nature remembered that tomorrow is the fifth
anniversary of the stock market peak ahead of the crash suffered in October
1987; the Footsie reached 2,443.4 on July 16 of that year, so only the
nimble-footed would seem to have made money out of UK equities over the past
five years.
The problems of the new issue sector continued to overhang equities. Share
issues in MFI Furniture and Anglian Group, neither a great success at the
underwriting stage, enter the market this week.
A steadier performance by the US dollar helped a large number of London's
overseas earning stocks, many of which earn profits in the US currency. The
Footsie was boosted by a sharp upturn in British Petroleum, which closed
substantially higher on the day after US buyers returned.
Domestic stocks, however, continued to suffer from downgrading operations by
brokerage firms, which turned their attentions to the retail sector, where
several well-known names attracted adverse comments. But the weight of
negative views was lightened by more favourable assessments of the property
sector, which has suffered a prolonged setback.

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Oils lead late surge on rise
in crude prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER trading in a narrow range for most of the day, a surge of late buying,
linked to higher crude oil prices, lifted US equities across the board,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was ahead 21.08 at 3,358.39.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.81 at 417.68, while the American SE
composite put on 2.94 to 386.08 and the Nasdaq composite added 4.99 at
575.21.
Turnover on the New York SE was a fairly substantial 195.6m shares, while
advancing issues outpaced declines by 1,094 to 633.
The morning's economic figures provided no surprises, a source of relief to
the market, which had suffered from statistical shocks in recent economic
reports. The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent in June, confirming that
inflationary pressures remained dormant in the economy, while retail sales
increased by 0.5 per cent last month, slightly below forecasts and
indicative of the sluggish state of consumer demand.
Stock market sentiment had earlier been troubled by a rise in long-term bond
yields which, if sustained, could threaten to negate some of the positive
effect of the recent discount rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Share prices
bounced in late trading, however, after oil issues took off in the wake of
higher crude oil prices.
Leading the late surge were Chevron, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 70, Texaco,
Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 64 7/8 , BP, Dollars 2 1/8 stronger at Dollars
49 1/4 , and Occidental, Dollars  1/4 ahead at Dollars 20 1/8 .
Financial shares were also in demand following some good quarterly earnings
reports. Merrill Lynch appreciated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 on news of
second-quarter profits of Dollars 227.7m, PaineWebber put on Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 22 3/8 on earnings of Dollars 45.7m and Primerica, parent of broking
house Smith Barney, added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 40 7/8 after the group
reported net income of Dollars 150.5m for the April-June period.
Coca-Cola receded Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 1/2 in turnover of 1.8m shares,
although the soft drinks group reported second-quarter net income of 44
cents a share, up from 36 cents a share a year ago and in line with
expectations. The selling was attributed to profit-taking by investors and
dealers who had bought the stock in anticipation of good quarterly figures.
Honeywell eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 after announcing net income
of Dollars 85m for the second quarter, up 10 per cent from a year ago but
boosted by one-off litigation settlement gains.
Constar moved forward Dollars 1 to Dollars 21 7/8 on news that broking house
Bear Stearns had upgraded its 1992 earnings forecast by 10 cents to Dollars
1.60 a share and for 1993 by a similar amount to Dollars 1.85 a share.
Fabri-Centers dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 12 7/8 after the company
warned that it would incur a loss of about 85 cents a share in the second
quarter. The company immediately reported plans to reduce its workforce and
cut some salaries.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended higher after fairly busy trading. The TSE 300
index gained 13.9 at 3,463.2, while rises outnumbered declines by 304 to 256
after volume of 30.1m shares valued at CDollars 352m.
Today's volume was boosted by a 5m-share block of Telus Corp crossed just at
the close.
The transportation group fell 4.18 per cent as the sub-group's most heavily
weighted components, Laidlaw 'A' and 'B' shares, each fell CDollars  3/4 to
CDollars 11 7/8 and CDollars 11 3/4 respectively. Laidlaw said it was not
aware of any corporate developments that would account for the decline in
the share prices.
Overall, 11 of the 14 sectors closed higher. The gold shares index moved up
2.32 per cent as the New York spot gold price rose USDollars 1.80 to
USDollars 351.05 an ounce.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Gains for yen and US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN and dollar recorded gains yesterday against other major currencies,
as foreign exchange markets paused for breath ahead of tomorrow's meeting of
the Bundesbank council, writes Peter Marsh.
The D-Mark ended an edgy but quiet day in European trading narrowly down
against both currencies. Sterling continued its recent descent against the
D-Mark but at a slower pace, as buying support began to pick up around the
DM2.85 level.
Talk of an increase in German rates after the Bundesbank meeting continued
to dominate the markets. However, some traders speculated that the central
bank might confine itself to action short of a rate rise, a measure which
would have a relatively mild effect on the currency markets.
Such theories bolstered the previously sagging dollar, and supported the
pound. Mr Mark Brett, a Barclays de Zoete Wedd currency specialist, said:
'Few people in the currency markets are prepared to push off into new
territory ahead of the Bundesbank meeting.'
The yen, which has been a prime beneficiary of the weaker dollar, gained
against the D-Mark after a Bank of Japan official was quoted as saying the
yen was too weak against the German unit. At the close of London trading,
the D-Mark was quoted at DM11.91 per Y1,000, against DM11.83 at the previous
close.
The German currency lost ground against the dollar to end at DM1.4900,
compared with DM1.4780 on Monday night. Against the yen, the dollar edged
forward to Y125.00 from a previous finish of Y124.95. Later in New York the
US unit finished at DM1.4855 and Y125.20.
The dollar also gained against the pound, which continued its recent soggy
performance. At the close, sterling was quoted at Dollars 1.913, as against
Dollars 1.9295, while in terms of the D-Mark the pound lost 1/4 pfennig,
closing at DM2.85 after at one stage hitting a low of DM2.8464.
Some dealers took the view that the worst for sterling might be over and
that, at yesterday's levels, the currency looked cheap. However, news of a
0.6 per cent reduction in UK manufacturing output in May, compared with
April, did little to increase the confidence of the markets that a
significant economic recovery was about to start.
By the close of European trading, sterling was securely pinned as the
weakest member of the exchange rate mechanism, with a divergence to its
central Ecu rate of 56 per cent.
Meanwhile, sterling may have received support from comments by Mr John
Major, the UK prime minister, that his government will support the pound at
its current DM2.95 central rate, even if it means UK interest rates going
up. Mr Major made his approach clear in meetings yesterday with other
ministers.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Heavy futures trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures contracts again traded in a wide range, reflecting fears
that UK interest rates might be increased in the wake of tomorrow's
Bundesbank council meeting.
However, activity in the cash markets was more subdued. Many traders failed
to alter their positions on the future direction of changes in UK borrowing
costs, and cash rates were mostly unchanged from the previous night's close.
With more than 45,000 lots changing hands, trading in the September short
sterling contract was heavy for the second day running. From an opening
price of 89.83, the contract was pushed down at one stage to 89.80. That
reflected the sentiment in the market that an increase in UK base rates, now
10 per cent, was likely over the next two months.
Towards the close of trading, dealers took a more circumspect view of the
outcome from the Bundesbank meeting. Many believe that it will tighten
conditions under which German banks can borrow from the central bank,
dampening inflationary pressures caused by unification. Such an action would
be in place of a move to raise German interest rates, and would have fewer
international repercussions.
As a result, the sterling contract picked up in the afternoon, ending at
89.89, the same level as its Monday close.
In the cash market, the three-month interbank rate, which reflects
perceptions about the likely shift in UK base rates, closed unchanged at 10
1/8 per cent. Overnight money was quoted at 10 1/16 per cent. Most other
cash rates ended at the previous night's close of 10 1/8 per cent.
As for operations by the Bank of England to meet the estimated Pounds 650m
liquidity shortage, the discount houses refrained from active participation
in the market until relatively late yesterday. This fitted the pattern of
recent weeks.
In the morning, faced with lack of enthusiasm by the houses to part with
their paper, the Bank bought just Pounds 10m of Band 2 bills at the
established rate of 9 7/8 per cent. Later the Bank bought Pounds 8m of Band
1 Treasury bills, Pounds 71m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 50m of Band 2
Treasury bills and Pounds 105m of Band 2 bank bills, all at 9 7/8 per cent.
It provided late assistance of around Pounds 230m.

<TEXT>
POLISH MINERS at five coal pits yesterday staged work stoppages amid a coal
glut which is forcing management to introduce temporary lay offs and cut
miners' incomes.
The stoppages at the Zabrze Bielszowice mine and four others in the Katowice
area come in the wake of a continuing two-week-old sit-in by radical
unionists from the Solidarity 80 movement at the State Coal Agency
headquarters in the city. The protesters are demanding wage increases for
miners, as well as cuts in taxes levied on pits and forgiveness of mounting
mine debts.
Leaders of the other mining unions met yesterday to decide whether to call
an industry-wide token stoppage, while Mr Waclaw Niewiarowski, the new
industry minister, is to see the unions today in Warsaw.
The government ended subsidies to coal mining at the end of March and the
industry has gone into debt as coal prices have failed to rise in the face
of low demand, following a mild winter and the continuing industrial
recession.
Pit-head stocks have now reached some 6m tonnes - equivalent to two weeks
output by the country's 71 pits. Poland produced 59.4m tonnes of coal in the
first five months of the year, matching output in the same period last year.
Sales outside Poland by Weglokoks, the state-owned coal trader which
continues to dominate the export market, reached 6.6m tonnes in the first
five months.

Bulgaria is to close dozens of unprofitable copper, zinc and lead mines over
the next few years, sharply reducing output of the metals, reports Reuter
from Sofia.
'The zinc, lead and copper mines, or parts of them, will be closed by stages
within three years,' said Mr Politimi Paunova, a senior industry ministry
official.
The industry ministry said that in recent years annual production of copper
concentrate in Bulgaria had averaged 150,000 tonnes, lead concentrate 80,000
tonnes and zinc concentrate 70,000 tonnes. However figures were much lower
last year.
The closures are likely to result in output of copper falling to 50,000
tonnes a year, lead to 30,000 tonnes and zinc to 25,000 tonnes, a mining
industry official said.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Siberian copper deposit to be
opened to west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the largest copper deposits in the world - in Siberia - is to be
opened up to international tender by the Russian government in the next few
weeks.
The project is expected to show a different approach by the Russian
government to large international tenders. The government will favour those
foreign companies which will join in a consortium with Russian corporations
and financial groups and will insist that both equipment and labour is
sourced in Russia.
The deposit, at Udocan in the Chita region of Siberia, has been estimated to
be capable of producing 500,000 tonnes of copper concentrate a year when
fully exploited. It contains around 1.3bn tonnes of concentrate containing
1.5 per cent of copper.
The site was known to the former, Soviet, government for the past 25 years,
but was considered impractical to exploit until the BAM railway, which
passes within 90 km (56 miles) of the site, was completed. However, once BAM
was finished in the second part of the 1980s, the Soviet government lacked
the vast technical and financial resources needed to develop the project.
It is now seen by the Russian government as a future flagship project, which
will both prove its ability to tender on a grand scale and give Russian
companies and managers experience of a world class project.
Mr Alexander Rubtsov, managing director of Ernst and Young Vneshconsuklt
group, which has been retained by the Chita regional authority to advise on
the project, said yesterday that the investment required would be between
Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn. Initial calculations show that some 2,000
workers would be directly employed at the site, with a further 20,000 in
various service functions.
Various methods of exploiting the reserves are expected to be proposed,
ranging from simple mining and exporting of the ore, through the
construction of smelters on site, to the creation of a range of downstream
industries to use the copper.
The international companies expected to bid for the project include the UK
group RTZ, the US companies Fluor Daniel and Phelps Dodge and the Australian
company Broken Hill Proprietary. Japanese companies like Mitsubishi,
increasingly active in mineral resources, may also be part of future
consortia.
Mr Robin Bhar, an independent mineral consultant, said yesterday: 'This is
one of the most promising projects in the world now. It should get some very
much needed foreign investment and it would have a big impact on world
production.'
Mr Rubtsov, a member of the council of business advisers to Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, said that Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar,
the acting prime minister, had agreed that the tender should lay down that
Russian labour and equipment must be used in order to provide experience and
to give work to the hard-pressed engineering sector.
Mr Rubtsov said: 'If we don't begin to do this in international tenders, it
will mean that foreign companies get everything and Russians only a fee.
There are now companies in Russia which are ready and willing to act as
partners in a consortium and have the resources or can get the resources to
work on the international scale.
'There are a lot of businessmen in Russia now who are ready to move from
trading, where they made a lot of money, into capital investment in Russia
itself. They should now be included as members of international consortia -
and Mr Yeltsin and Mr Gaidar agree with this approach.' The head of Russia's
gold industry has announced his resignation, warning of a sharp fall in
output by 1993 and 1994, the Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper said, reports
Reuter from Moscow.
It quoted Mr Valery Rudakov, head of the state monopoly for precious metals
and diamonds, Rosalmazzoloto, as telling a meeting of the industry's senior
figures that he was resigning because the industry had become unmanageable.
He said shortcomings in the provision of resources would not send extraction
plummeting this year as most inputs were provided more than a year in
advance. But a sharp drop in production was inevitable by 1993 and 1994. He
gave no figures.
While Russia's new government had given enterprises more freedom than under
Soviet rule, Mr Rudakov said it had been a mistake to keep them under formal
state ownership. No one in his industry knew whose orders to obey any more,
he said.
'I am a splinter of the command administrative system and I cannot work when
there is no accepted hierarchy,' Mr Rudakov said.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: W Australian nickel project
delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMINION MINING has delayed until early next year a decision about possible
development of its Yakabindie nickel deposit in Western Australia, which
could meet up to 3 per cent of annual western world demand for the metal.
However, Dominion said yesterday it already had two offers from potential
joint venture partners to take a share in the ADollars 470m (Pounds 180m)
project.
Marketing plans and a feasibility study had taken longer than expected to
prepare, so the forecast decision date of August this year was now unlikely
to be achieved. 'A decision on full commitment to the project is unlikely
before early 1993,' it said.
Yakabindie would, when fully on stream, produce about 21,000 tonnes of
nickel a year from 6m tonnes of ore. Dominion said the project would be able
to produce a unique sulphide concentrate containing more than 20 per cent
nickel and with minimal impurities. This would eliminate the need for
subsequent costly and complex nickel refining stages in the production of a
saleable nickel feedstock.
Dominion said a nickel iron oxide calcine product from Yakabindie had been
'widely exposed' to the stainless steel industry, where it 'has met with
widespread technical acceptance'.
Most nickel is used in stainless steel production. Sales contracts were
being negotiated with a number of stainless producers, but 'progress has
been slower than expected because of the weakness of the international
nickel and stainless steel markets.'
Dominion previously suggested that it would be willing to see its share in
the project fall below 50 per cent. 'Numerous expressions of interest have
already been made by prospective financiers,' it said yesterday.

</HEADLINE>

A new European Parliament inquiry into European Community farm fraud is to
be headed by Labour Euro MP John Tomlinson.
The probe is going ahead despite assurances from Mr John Gummer, the British
president of the council of EC agriculture ministers, that the problem is
under control.
Mr Tomlinson, MEP for Birmingham West, has been asked by the European
Parliament's budgetary control committee to produce a detailed report on
losses to EC taxpayers - estimated at Pounds 2.5bn a year - from the
community's complex system of grants and subsidies.
Mr Tomlinson yesterday described the EC's farm policy as 'the greatest
incentive to crime in Europe today'.
Earlier, Mr Gummer played down the extent of the problem, insisting that
frauds highlighted by the EC's court of auditors had already been tackled.

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community will not be bullied into making concessions in world
trade talks, Mr John Gummer, the British minister of agriculture and current
president of the council of EC farm ministers, said yesterday, reports
Reuter from Brussels.
'We are still threatened with illegal action,' he said, referring to
Washington's potential retaliation in a long-running dispute with the
community over oilseeds.
Mr Gummer was speaking after EC agriculture ministers heard Mr Ray
MacSharry, the European agriculture commissioner, report on what he saw as
highly unsatisfactory negotiations on the Uruguay Round of world trade talks
at the Group of Seven summit in Munich earlier this month.
Mr Gummer said the US had failed to respond to EC reform concessions
relevant to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. The
ball was now in Washington's court, he added.
Gatt negotiations should have been completed in December 1990, but collapsed
over the issue of trade-distorting subsidies, which still has to be
resolved.
A decision on Italy's demand for a bigger milk quota, the issue that nearly
scuppered negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reforms in May, were
deferred at yesterday's council session.
Italy says it severely underestimated the number of farmers who should have
been counted in when quotas were originally set. It has been overproducing,
and sees a boost in quotas as the solution.
But northern countries that have played by the rules have been aghast at
what they see as Italy being rewarded for breaking them.
Yesterday's session also saw the beginning of discussions on developing
systems for controlling payments to farmers under the reformed CAP.
The European Commission proposed that Ecu115m (Pounds 82m) should be
provided over three years towards the cost of developing such control
systems. Ministers had mixed views on this, ranging from suggestions that
there should be no such funding at all, to calls for a big increase.
Several ministers had doubts as to whether the system could be implemented
on schedule by January 1.
On the definition of land parcels for identification and control purposes,
those tending to favour an EC-wide definition were pitted against those who
supported the right of member states to devise their own systems.
There was widespread backing, however, for a single system of animal
identification for both veterinary purposes and for payments.
Some ministers were opposed to having to make an annual declaration on
production and animal numbers.
All these issues will be followed up at the farm ministers' September
meeting.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts recover modestly as pound improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of a tightening in German monetary policy continued to hang
heavy on European bond markets yesterday as investors dug in for the long
wait until the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow.
UK government bonds, which had slipped on Monday as sterling caught a bad
case of the jitters over Germany, recovered some of their composure, along
with the currency. Prices of longer-dated gilts moved to reflect continued
signs of weakness in the UK economy and falling inflation, despite the
trepidation caused by tough signals from the Bundesbank.
UK manufacturing output figures confirmed the recent trend, with output for
May down 0.6 per cent and a provisional April rise of 0.1 per cent revised
to a fall of 0.2 per cent. Investors preferred to take note of these figures
rather than the latest producer prices, which showed an unexpected jump.
The benchmark 9 per cent gilts due 2008 picked up nearly half a point to 101
17/32 , for a yield of 8.8 per cent, while the yield on partly-paid 9 per
cent gilts due 2012 fell to 8.77 per cent, a price of 37 3/32 .
On Liffe, the short sterling contract ended the day near its Monday close,
having slid on the fears from Germany.
IN Germany, bunds firmed on the day as conditions in the money market
remained tight ahead of the Bundesbank meeting.
In a moderately active day on Liffe, the bund futures contract advanced from
87.62 to 87.76 as traders reacted to the feeling that Monday's sell-off had
been overdone. However, the market remained generally apprehensive - despite
some suggestions that the bund market could actually advance on the back of
any monetary tightening, taking it as an encouraging reaffirmation of the
Bundesbank's determination to beat inflation.
The OECD, in its latest annual report on the German economy, added its voice
to those calling for moderation in Bundesbank policy when it said: 'A
temporary above-target monetary expansion would not seem to call for further
tightening of monetary conditions.'
DESPITE further signs of the Japanese economy weakening - this time a 0.2
per cent fall in wholesale prices in June, in line with market expectations
 -the prime minister repeated yesterday there was no need for a cut in
Japanese interest rates. The benchmark No 129 bond ended a quiet day at a
yield of 5.175 per cent.
IN THE US, the yield curve steepened further yesterday as investors
preferred the safety of short-dated maturities in the currently unsettled
domestic political environment.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  5/32 at
103 17/32 , to yield 7.688 per cent. The two-year note, however, was firmer,
up  5/32 at 101 5/16 to carry a yield of 4.277 per cent.
The yield curve has been steepening lately as investors buy short-dated
paper over the longer-term securities, their demand spurred by faint hopes
that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy again and by concern that
President George Bush could lose the election in November.
At times of political uncertainty, short-term securities are always favoured
as the safe haven of choice.

COCA-COLA, the Atlanta-based soft drinks group, yesterday reported a 20.4
per cent improvement in second-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 581m.
Earnings per share improved by a slightly larger 22.2 per cent, to 44 cents,
compared with 36 cents a year ago.
Sales during the second quarter reached Dollars 3.55bn, up 16.8 per cent
over the same period in 1991.
Coca-Cola said that unit case sales in its domestic market fell by 1 per
cent, and gallon sales of concentrates and syrups by 2.5 per cent, as stocks
were run down. However, in Europe warm weather and heavy marketing lifted
second-quarter unit sales by 14 per cent year-on-year. This included gains
of 25 per cent in France, 17 per cent in Britain and 12 per cent each in
Germany and Italy.
Coca-Cola said worldwide soft drink volume continued to advance in the
second quarter, despite softness in the Brazilian and Mexican markets.
First-half net income advanced to Dollars 964.1m from Dollars 803.3m in the
previous year, on sales up to Dollars 6.3bn from Dollars 5.5bn. Earnings per
share lifted to 73 cents from 60 cents.

POLAROID, the US photography group, yesterday unveiled a 32.5 per cent
improvement in second-quarter net income to Dollars 35.5m from Dollars 26.8m
a year earlier.
Polaroid's 1991 results were distorted by a pre-tax gain of Dollars 11m
which was partly offset by preferred dividend payments of Dollars 10.1m. The
company retired its preferred stock towards the end of 1991, so there were
no preferred dividend payments in the latest quarter.
Polaroid had primary earnings per share of 74 cents in the latest quarter
against 33 cents last year.
Sales advanced 7 per cent to Dollars 557.7m from Dollars 521.4m. US sales
grew 4 per cent to Dollars 300.6m, while international sales rose 11 per
cent to Dollars 257.1m, thanks partly to a weaker US dollar.
On Wall Street, Polaroid's shares added Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 in
reasonably active trading.
Polaroid's chairman and chief executive, Mr I. MacAllister Booth, has not
changed the company's earnings projections for the full year.
'We still believe we can meet our 1992 financial goals and deliver a level
of profitability that approximates 1991's operating performance,' he said.
He added that the company was tightly managing expenditures because of the
uncertain and difficult worldwide economy.
Polaroid will incur higher marketing expenses when it launches two new
products later this year.
The company benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the latest quarter
of 34 per cent compared with 44 per cent the previous year.
Polaroid said shipments of all of its significant product lines increased
during the quarter.
For the first half, Polaroid had net income of Dollars 41.7m, or 86 cents,
against Dollars 43.2m, or 46 cents in the same period of 1991. Sales rose 3
per cent to Dollars 989m.

FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: A corporate marriage made to
last / A look at the durability of the AMD-Fujitsu production venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a minnow marries a whale, one can only wonder how long the whale will
wait before it swallows his mate.
The alliance agreed this week between Fujitsu, Japan's biggest computer
company with Dollars 25.9bn in sales last year, and Advanced Micro Devices
(AMD), ranking only fifth among America's semiconductor makers with sales of
Dollars 1.2bn, raises that question.
However, Mr W. J. Sanders, chairman of AMD, has structured a deal that could
just withstand strains within the partnership and make the marriage last.
Not only have Fujitsu and AMD agreed to jointly build a Dollars 700m factory
to manufacture flash memory devices, one of the hottest products in the
electronics industry, they have also agreed to buy small equity stakes in
each other.
While cross-shareholdings are normal practice in Japan among
closely-associated companies, this is a first in trans-Pacific technology
alliances and represents a tangible commitment to a long-term partnership.
Fujitsu and AMD will establish a 50-50 joint venture company that will build
the factory to make flash memory chips. These retain information, just like
a disc drive or tape recorder, when power is switched off, and can also
perform data processing tasks. Dataquest, the research company, expects the
market for these devices to expand from about Dollars 150m a year to Dollars
1.5bn in 1995. Many in the industry expect a market bigger than Dollars 5bn
by the end of the decade.
AMD and Fujitsu hope to establish a leading position quickly. The factory
will open in late 1994 and have a capacity of 20,000 eight-inch silicon
wafers a month. The two companies hope this will give them more than 20 per
cent of the world market - an ambitious goal that requires a large financial
commitment and close co-operation.
The venture covers only the most advanced devices - using circuitry of 0.5
micron (millionth of a metre) width or smaller. The agreement, however, also
forbids either partner from producing these devices outside the joint
venture, effectively preventing them from competing against each other.
This pact is a conscious attempt by the two companies to avoid the pitfalls
that have struck many US-Japanese technology alliances. US companies have
been accused of providing basic technology on the cheap to Japanese
companies.
While the agreement is the third in a series of cross-border alliances in
flash memory announced this year, it goes further than the others. Intel,
the US company which dominates the world's microprocessor industry and today
has 85 per cent of the world's flash memory market, is providing technology
to Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, which will manufacture advanced
flash chips in Japan. IBM and Toshiba last month agreed to share technology
to develop a proprietary flash technology owned by Toshiba, which invented
the devices in 1984.
Neither of these agreements involves joint manufacturing or equity ties.
AMD will give some of its cash to Fujitsu in return for new shares, and
Fujitsu will give cash back to AMD for some of its shares. Japanese
companies have long felt comfortable owning small chunks of their business
partners. Mr Sanders insisted that this be part of the deal so that Fujitsu
would have an interest in the financial success of AMD.
The share holdings are limited to 5 per cent or less and are still to be
negotiated, but Fujitsu is likely to own a much bigger stake in AMD than
vice-versa.
'This collaboration is based on a spirit of equal partnership and
co-operation,' Mr Hikotaro Masunaga, Fujitsu managing director, said.
Equal or not, the deal is a marriage rich in convenience. AMD has flash
technology, but needs a big partner to shoulder the financial burden and the
large market risks. Fujitsu needs the technology and, with around Dollars
8bn in consolidated net debt at the end of March - after a fiscal year when
it was battered by weak semiconductor markets - it could use a partner to
share the costs.
The two companies also stressed the complementary nature of their
technologies, leaving plenty of scope for further co-operation. Still, it
would be difficult to imagine such a deal being struck until recently.
Mr Sanders cited three reasons why. First, the cost of capital in Japan was
so cheap until recently that Japanese companies did not need partners - now
they are paying world rates or more.
Second, the costs of developing new technology and building plants has also
risen sharply. Third, Japanese companies are paying more attention to
profitability than before, and it is easier to agree on an expected margin
of return. 'This produces an environment in which enlightened companies can
join together for their mutual benefit,' said Mr Sanders.

FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Asset sales push First American
into profit

FIRST AMERICAN Bankshares, the Washington-based bank that, according to the
US Federal Reserve, was secretly and illegally controlled by the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), yesterday announced a
quarterly profit for the first time in two years.
The bank, which suffered heavy losses in 1991, said it achieved net profits
of Dollars 8.2m in the three months ended June 30. This compared with a
Dollars 59.3m loss in the second quarter of last year.
The 1992 second-quarter results were boosted by Dollars 10.1m of gains on
the sale of First American assets in Georgia and Dollars 7.4m of gains on
the sale of securities.
Mr George Davis, who was named chief executive of First American last
January, said plans for the sale of all the bank's assets were going ahead.
He said the Federal Reserve last Friday approved the bank's capital plan
along with its timetable for the asset sale.
The total assets of First American, which in 1991 fell from Dollars 11bn to
Dollars 8.4bn, declined to Dollars 6.5bn in the first six months of 1992.
The decrease was attributed to the Georgia asset disposal, continued weak
demand for loans and a lower level of investments.
The bank's total equity base, which shrank last year from Dollars 711m to
Dollars 422m, declined to Dollars 398.6m by the end of last month. Deposits,
which fell from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 7.1bn, slumped to Dollars 5.6bn in
the first half of 1992. The bank attributed Dollars 841.4m of the decrease
to the sale of Georgia assets and the balance to the run-off of certificates
of deposit.
Non-performing assets were Dollars 585m at the end of the second quarter,
down from Dollars 629m at the end of last year.
The bank's current trusteeship plan would implement a March 1991 Fed order
that instructed BCCI to divest itself of shares in First American held by
Credit &amp; Commerce American Holdings NV (CCAH), an offshore holding vehicle
that featured several nominee shareholders described by the Fed last year as
'front men' for BCCI.
Controversy over First American has focused to a large extent on state and
federal investigations of Mr Clark Clifford and Mr Robert Altman,
respectively the former chairman and president of the bank, who resigned
last August. Both have denied having known of BCCI's secret control of First
American, although former BCCI officials have testified to the contrary.
First American itself has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

MARUDAI FOOD, a Japanese food processing company, said yesterday it would
raise its ratio of cross-shareholdings by encouraging banks and insurance
companies to raise their exposure in return for lifting its own stakes in
some of the financial institutions involved. The move comes at a time when
many Japanese companies are reducing such links.
Japan's cross-shareholding system has been under pressure following the
collapse of stock prices and the slowing of the economy. A fall in bank
share prices in recent months was blamed on a weakening of that system as
troubled industrial companies cashed in long-term hold - ings.
Marudai plans to lift its ratio of stable shareholders from the present 55.3
per cent to around 60 per cent.

MOTOROLA, the electronics and semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday reported
a 23 per cent rise in second-quarter net income, powered by strong sales
increases in most of its product areas.
The company reported net income of Dollars 146m, or Dollars 1.09 a share,
compared with Dollars 119m, or 90 cents, in the same period of last year.
Sales rose from Dollars 2.8bn to Dollars 3.14bn.
For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 273m, or
Dollars 2.05 a share, compared with Dollars 235m, or Dollars 1.78, on sales
which rose from Dollars 5.56bn to Dollars 6.20bn.
Motorola's semiconductor products sales rose 21 per cent to Dollars 1.08bn
and operating profits from the section increased. The company said all sales
regions experienced strong order growth, apart from Japan. Orders rose most
rapidly in the communications, distribution, personal computer/workstation
and consumer markets. In communications businesses, sales grew 11 per cent
to Dollars 972m and operating profits rose.
General systems sales rose 11 per cent to Dollars 821m, but operating
profits were flat. Information systems saw sales up to Dollars 160m and made
a profit, against a loss a year ago.
The automotive and industrial electronics group saw sales 8 per cent higher
but operating profits were lower.
Motorola said it would be adopting during the fourth quarter a new
accounting standard for post retiree health benefits and this was expected
to entail an obligation of Dollars 190m to Dollars 300m, which would be
recognised immediately.

FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sluggish US economy hits paper,
pulp industry earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Paper yesterday reported a marginal increase in second-quarter
earnings per share, while Boise Cascade announced a Dollars 45m loss as the
sluggish US economy continued to depress the earnings of the paper and pulp
industry.
'While some indicators suggest recessionary pressures may be easing, the
pace of recovery is slower than previously anticipated,' said Mr John
Georges, chairman of International Paper.
'If the economy continues to grow at a modest rate, and if we are able to
obtain further modest increases in paper prices, Boise Cascade should return
to profitability during 1993,' said Mr John Fery, the chairman of that
company.
The US paper industry has been suffering from a sharp cyclical downturn for
the past two years but analysts have been forecasting a modest recovery
during 1992.
However, another leading manufacturer, Georgia-Pacific, depressed Wall
Street expectations last week when it announced it would only make a small
second-quarter profit.
International Paper, which has made a strong push into Europe in recent
years, reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 112m on sales of Dollars
3.4bn, up from Dollars 100m on sales of Dollars 3.1bn in the second quarter
of last year.
However, a large share issue early in 1992 meant that the earnings worked
through at just 92 cents a share, compared with 91 cents a year ago.
International Paper said its timber and wood products business remained
strong and the consumer packaging business showed an improvement. Prices for
uncoated printing and writing papers in the US and European markets had
weakened as the quarter progressed, but containerboard demand and operating
rates continued at high levels. Specialty paper earnings were up on a year
ago.
Boise Cascade's second-quarter loss, which worked through at Dollars 1.38 a
share, compared with losses of Dollars 32.6m, or 95 cents a share, in the
same period of last year. Sales totalled Dollars 922m, down from Dollars
978m.
Boise Cascade said the operating performance of its paper and paper products
division in the second quarter continued to be severely affected by weak
paper prices, which were on average modestly below the very low levels
reached in the first quarter.
Results compared unfavourably with a year ago.
Prices for business and printing papers and market pulp strengthened
modestly in the second quarter, relative to the first quarter, but
newsprint, coated and uncoated groundwood paper prices reached new lows in
the cycle.
The group's office products segment, hit by the weak US economy, saw profits
down from a year ago on slightly higher sales volume. The dip was attributed
to a seasonal swing from the first quarter, pressure on margins and the
divestiture of the wholesale office products distribution operations.
Building products saw income modestly stronger than the second quarter of
last year but down on the first quarter of this year. Lumber prices rose to
record levels in the first quarter but have moderated since then.

WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a slight drop
in second-quarter net income as a weak US economy battered many of its
sectors and its troubled financial services operation suffered a substantial
dip in profits.
Westinghouse reported net income of Dollars 122m, or 35 cents a share, on
revenue of Dollars 3.15bn, compared with net income of Dollars 127m, or 41
cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 3.17bn in the same period of last
year.
The financial services operation, Westinghouse Credit Corporation, which is
being sharply reduced after making some disastrous property investments,
reported net income of Dollars 2.1m on revenues of Dollars 172.2m, compared
with profits of Dollars 19.5m on revenues of Dollars 264m in the same period
of last year.
Westinghouse Electric's operating profit for the period was flat at Dollars
252m, with an operating profit margin of 8 per cent, against 7.9 per cent a
year ago.
Interest expense, excluding financial services operations, rose from Dollars
57m to Dollars 67m due to expenses from a new revolving credit facility,
part of Westinghouse's bolstering of its financial position following the
property problems.
Westinghouse said its broadcasting unit produced higher operating profits on
flat revenues, due to cost reductions, while electronic systems produced
flat revenues on lower operating profits due to an unfavourable sales mix.
Environmental revenues and operating profits were down; the industries
segment produced an increase in operating profit on revenues slightly
higher; and power systems saw a dip in operating profit.

<TEXT>
KROGER, the US food retailer which took on a heavy debt load when it
conducted a defensive restructuring in 1988, yesterday reported an after-tax
loss of Dollars 29.4m for the three months to June 13.
This compares with a Dollars 30.6m profit in the same period a year earlier.
Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation - the company's operating
cash-flow - were also down sharply, at Dollars 184.4m, compared with Dollars
235.6m for the same period of 1991. Interest charges fell from Dollars
123.7m to Dollars 110m.
Kroger's poor results are partly due to a strike by clerks and meat-cutters
in the Michigan region. However, the figures also underline the extremely
tough competitive conditions faced by many supermarket groups in the US at
present.
Mr Joseph Pitcher, chairman, said the 67-day stoppage in Michigan explained
virtually all the decline in second-quarter cash-flow.
He added: 'Clearly, the slow pace of economic recovery had not yet restored
the confidence of consumers who continue to watch household spending on
consumable items.'
Total sales in the second quarter were Dollars 5.07bn, down 0.3 per cent on
the same period a year earlier. But, even with the effects of the Michigan
stoppage excluded, same-store sales were flat.
In the first six months of 1992, Kroger has reported an after-tax loss of
Dollars 38.7m, compared with a profit of Dollars 36m a year earlier on sales
of Dollars 10.1bn against Dollars 9.99bn.
The 1992 figure, however, is struck after a Dollars 64.2m extraordinary loss
from the early retirement of debt. Ahead of extraordinary items, profits
would be down from Dollars 71.1m to Dollars 47.7m.

<TEXT>
PRIMERICA, the US financial services group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent
rise in second-quarter profits to Dollars 150.5m, due to a continued strong
performance from its broking and investment banking subsidiary, Smith
Barney.
The recent slowdown in Wall Street business activity, however, meant that
second-quarter earnings for both Primerica and Smith Barney were below the
record levels achieved in the opening three months of the year.
Primerica earned Dollars 220.8m in the first quarter, although almost
one-third of that came from one-off sales of stock in subsidiaries.
Smith Barney earned Dollars 42.4m in the April-June period, up 13 per cent
on a year ago but well below the Dollars 56.1m profit made in the first
quarter. Earnings from retail broking operations and its institutional
investment banking business were strong, but lower than the previous
quarter.
The recent cut in US interest rates, however, is expected to boost Smith
Barney's business as investors switch into stocks from lower-yielding
short-term instruments such as bank certificates of deposit and money market
funds.
At Primerica's consumer finance services operations, earnings were 10 per
cent higher than in 1991 at Dollars 47.5m, but virtually flat compared with
the January-to-March period. Similarly, insurance services were little
changed on the first quarter at Dollars 45.5m but slightly higher than a
year ago.
Primerica's figures were warmly received on the New York Stock Exchange,
where the group's share price rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 in active
trading.
The Federal Reserve Board approved a proposal by BankAmerica Corp of San
Francisco to indirectly acquire HonFed Bank of Honolulu and some of its
non-banking subsidiaries, Reuter reports from Washington.
HF Holdings is the third largest deposit-taking institution in Hawaii.

FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings slide at two US broking
houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST SIGNS of a slowdown in business on Wall Street appeared yesterday when
two of the biggest broking houses, Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber, both
reported second-quarter earnings that were strong but below the record
levels achieved in the first three months of the year.
Merrill posted net income of Dollars 227.7m in the April-June period, up 24
per cent on a year ago, but well below the record Dollars 277.5m of the
first quarter of 1992.
PaineWebber's second-quarter profits were Dollars 45.7m, up on the Dollars
33.7m a year ago but down 38 per cent from the first quarter.
Although the broking industry remains healthy, the inability of companies to
match the record first quarter reflects a decline in equity underwriting
business, especially in initial public offerings (IPOs), and a drop in
trading profits, due mainly to the recent poor performance of domestic and
international stock markets.
Recent sales of stock funds have shrunk compared with record first-quarter
levels as stuttering stock prices have made equities less attractive. The
July 2 cut in interest rates, however, may persuade more investors to switch
to stocks from low-yielding short-term instruments.
At Merrill, investment banking remained the best-performing division, with
revenues rising 27 per cent in the quarter to a record Dollars 399m. Strong
bond underwriting and a substantial pick-up in M&amp;A advisory business helped
offset the slack IPO market.
Revenues from principal trading, particularly of government and municipal
securities, corporate bonds and swaps, were buoyant at Dollars 552m, but
lower than the Dollars 574m earned in the first three months. Asset
management and custodial fees rose slightly to Dollars 217m.
It was a similar picture at PaineWebber. Revenues from broking commissions,
principal trading, investment banking and asset management all remained
strong but below record first-quarter levels.

FIAT has decided to expand its co-operation with Japan's Hitachi and
Sumitomo in the field of earth-moving equipment.
The Turin-based automotive group yesterday signed an agreement to form Fiat
Hitachi Construction Equipment, controlled 80 per cent by Fiat Hitachi
Excavators and 20 per cent by NH Geotec. Fiat Hitachi Excavators is already
controlled 51 per cent by Fiat, 44 per cent by Hitachi and 5 per cent by
Sumitomo.
The venture is to be controlled ultimately 51 per cent by Fiat through
Geotec and based at Lecce in southern Italy. Whereas the previous venture
combined the Italian groups and the two Japanese companies' production and
technology in hydraulic excavators, the new deal extends this to roller
loaders, dozers and construction equipment.
The agreement follows withdrawal by John Deere earlier this year from a
three-pronged venture. The capital for the venture has yet to be decided.

market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC yesterday became the last Australian bank to give up a significant
presence in the London-based Eurobond market, following the departure of the
ANZ group two years ago.
The bank's decision, which resulted in the loss of 20 jobs, also signals the
poor return on capital earned by some banks in the Eurobond market, despite
the high level of bond issuance this year.
The bank's departure leaves the Australian dollar section of the
international bond markets almost entirely in the hands of non-Australian
banks, led by Hambros and Deutsche Bank.
Westpac said the move was part of its strategy of concentrating on domestic
customers. The bank had been active mainly as a trader of Eurobonds, rather
than an underwriter, and so did not consider the operation essential.
Bond trading had been only marginally profitable and did not justify the
ADollars 50m (USDollars 37.3m) of capital tied up in running its trading
positions, the bank said. Instead, it said it will use the capital in
higher-margin areas, such as commodity and equity derivatives and swaps.
In a further move to trim its London operations, Westpac said it would limit
its corporate banking activities in the UK almost exclusively to servicing
Australian clients. The decision is expected to lead to further
redundancies. Westpac also announced the closure of its nine-person Paris
branch.

<TEXT>
AACHENER und Munchener Beteiligungs yesterday followed up the ending of
hostilities with Assurances Generales de France (AGF) by tightening links
with another foreign minority shareholder, Fondiaria of Italy.
Shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting voted Mr Camillo de Benedetti,
the chairman of the Italian insurance concern, on to AMB's supervisory board
together with Mr Michel Albert, the head of AGF, with which the German
company last week reached an accord after a battle over full voting rights.
As expected, Mr Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl is stepping down as AMB's chief
executive after failing to keep the French company at bay. Yesterday's
decisions show that AMB is now on much warmer terms with both AGF, which
owns just over 25 per cent of its shares, and Fondiaria, which has 20 per
cent. Recently, it had been speculated that Fondiara might sell its AMB
holding.
The French and German companies said last week they had reached agreement
over the voting rights attached to AGF's stake. Previously, AMB had refused
to recognise full voting rights on the holding, as it was able to do under
German company law. Now AGF will be able to exercise these rights; in turn,
it has dropped legal action against AMB on the issue and agreed to back the
board at future annual meetings.
Mr Helmut Gies, chairman of AMB's supervisory board, said Mr Baumgartl's
contract had been dissolved by mutual consent. The settlement of this
dispute also paves the way for Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank,
to take a majority stake in BfG , the bank in which AMB bought control five
years ago and which has since proved a financial drain. AMB will keep its
co-operation agreements with Fondiaria and Royal Insurance of the UK.
Mr Baumgartl will be replaced by Mr Wolfgang Kaske, 61, head of the group's
subsidiary, AMB Volksfursorge in Hamburg. Mr Kaske, the brother of Mr
Karlheinz Kaske, who steps down soon as chief executive of the Siemens
concern, was previously on the AMB management board.
Shareholders were also told yesterday by Mr Wilfried Boysen, the finance
director, that AMB's results would at least match those of 1991, when net
profits totalled DM74m (Dollars 46m).

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBERIA, Spain's govern-ment-owned air carrier, is continuing to make heavy
losses despite a capital injection from public funds earlier this year and
the high profile Spain has received as the host of the summer Olympic Games
in Barcelona and of the Seville Expo '92.
According to Madrid newspaper reports, the airline lost up to Pta25bn
(Dollars 265m) in the first six months of the year. Iberia officials said
the company did not release its first-half results but conceded that losses
had been substantial and that the reports were largely accurate.
Iberia admitted losses of Pta35bn over the same period last year and
finished the 12 months Pta52.2bn in the red. The officials said that overall
losses this year were expected to be well down on the 1991 figures but were
nevertheless likely to overshoot the target of a Pta8bn shortfall.
Iberia's disappointing performance so far this year risks raising further
questions at the European Commission's Competition Directorate which is
already investigating a first-quarter Pta120bn capital injection to the
airline provided by INI, Spain's public sector conglomerate.
The directorate could rule that the recapitalisation, purportedly to finance
Iberia's fleet renewal and the airline's expansion in Latin America, had
instead been chiefly allocated to stemming losses.
The officials said there was an outside possibility that Iberia might have
to pay back to INI 10 per cent, Pta12bn, of the funds it had received.
Iberia's losses also indicated that a hoped for influx of foreign visitors
to Spain on account of the 1992 events had failed, so far, to materialise.
The officials said that revenue from the airline's European and
transatlantic traffic had been considerably less than that which had been
initially forecast.
Under an ongoing rationalising plan, designed in part to justify the capital
injection, Iberia has reduced its 28,000 payroll by 1,500 over the past six
months.
These were the first staff cuts in the company's history, and a further
1,500 employees will leave the company before the end of the year under
early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Future of Amps questioned as BET redeems -
Credit rating is key to success of hybrid issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET's decision to redeem its Dollars 500m (Pounds 262m) auction market
preferred stock again raises the question of the role of these US-traded
instruments in companies' financing structures.
The removal will take away about a quarter of the value of issues from UK
borrowers, although the total market is still worth more than Dollars 20bn.
While BET and others, such as English China Clays, Rank Organisation, the
leisure group, and Tarmac, the building materials producer, have decided to
redeem part or all of their Amps, other companies remain enthusiastic about
them. Elf UK, part of Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, which has Dollars 250m
of Amps outstanding is currently issuing another Dollars 250m of stock which
is being privately placed in the US.
BET's concern that it was paying significantly above commercial paper rates
on its Amps, 121 per cent of the levels in recent months, is not a problem
shared by more highly rated credits, although Tarmac admits to paying 150
per cent of commercial paper rates on its remaining Amps. Elf UK, for
example, has a AA rating and achieves far lower interest rates than BET.
Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks group, is more than
happy with its Amps, which can be sold in Canada as well as the US, adding
to the range of potential buyers. Its last two auctions achieved interest
rates of less than 3 per cent, a little more than 80 per cent of commercial
paper rates.
Redland, the building materials group, also pays rates below commercial
paper rates. Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director, points out that Redland's
latest auction produced an interest rate of 3.2 per cent.
Redland's Amps make up 8 per cent of shareholders' funds while BET's Amps
account for 72 per cent.
The interest rate on Amps is reset regularly, typically every 28 days,
through auctions of the stock. BET's stock is divided into four series with
one reseting each week.
Bidders set the rate of interest. If not enough buyers are found the
previous holders continue to own the stock but are paid a fall-back rate of
interest, relating to the company's credit standing. The Amps market is
driven by credit ratings. When a company's rating falls, the interest rate,
as a percentage of commercial paper rates, rises sharply.
In January this year Ratners, the jewellery retailer, saw its credit rating
cut from BBB to B and the next auction of a tranche of its Amps failed. When
Ratners then stopped paying interest on its Amps, and on other preference
shares, the rate was locked at 250 per cent of commercial paper rates and
has been accruing at that level since.
The Ratners experience has proved, though, that Amps behave like equity
rather than debt when a company is in difficulties, a point which was
debated among issuers, their shareholders and auditors for some time.
Eventually the accounting standards board came down in favour of Amps being
treated as a 'non-equity' portion of shareholders funds.
BET also cited declining investor demand as a reason for redeeming. However,
Mr Corbett said Redland had 'not seen any signs of a lessening of investor
interest'.
Market observers note, however, that the sharp fall in US short-term
interest rates has left the dollar yield curve steeply positive. Investors
are therefore looking to longer term investments to pick up a higher
interest rate rather than the 28-day paper.
One investment banker said: 'The size of your audience is crucial to the
health of your transaction.' Those investors still interested in Amps are
wary of all but the best credit risks.
A new market is opening for companies to tap, though. Fixed rate perpetual
preference shares have been used by banks but in December last year they
were opened to industrial companies by General Motors, the vehicle group,
which found such good demand for an issue it was increased from Dollars 300m
to Dollars 1bn.
More recently, Enterprise Oil was the first non-US industrial company to tap
the market with a Dollars 150m issue which paid interest at 10.5 per cent.
Elf UK is planning to make a portion of its Dollars 250m issue, perhaps
Dollars 100m, a fixed rate preference share.
When UK companies own assets in the US they need to match them with dollar
capital, debt or equity. When one market closes they will look for another.
It may be that dollar-denominated perpetual fixed rate preference shares
will plug that gap.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Lord King hands over BA to Sir Colin Marshall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LORD King handed over command of British Airways to his deputy Sir Colin
Marshall yesterday after 11 years at the controls of the formerly
state-owned airline.
He will remain non-executive chairman for another year before becoming the
company's first life president, an honorary position.
Sir Colin will implement an economy drive aimed at cutting another Pounds
150m from the company's costs this year.
He takes charge of one of the few airlines to have increased profits during
1991. Last year saw the first fall in the number of international airline
passengers, and the world's airlines between them lost about Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 780m) last year, Lord King told the company's annual meeting in
London yesterday.
In a farewell speech punctuated by shareholder applause, Lord King said he
had hoped 'to leave some small footprint in the sands of time. I have
decided to reduce my executive role in the company from today,' he said.
'The single most important step I took was to find and recruit Colin
Marshall. When I step down (as non-executive chairman) I shall propose that
I shall be succeeded by Sir Colin.'
There was some aggressive questioning from shareholders on the company's
plans to amend its articles of association to take control of the level of
foreign ownership of shares. That control has been in the hands of the
government since the company was privatised in 1987.
Responses included some characteristic banter between Lord King and Sir
Colin on the stage of the Barbican arts complex in central London. Twice,
Lord King referred shareholder inquiries from the floor to Sir Colin with
the words 'good question'.
The amendment to the articles of association was eventually passed, and the
company now has full control over the level of acceptable foreign ownership
in the company.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS LIFE president of British Airways, Lord King will be joining a select
band of British executives and Third World politicians. But if precedent is
anything to go by, he cannot count on undisturbed enjoyment of his new role.
For politicians such as Dr Hastings Banda of Malawi or Papa Doc Duvalier of
Haiti, the title has not guaranteed popularity. Corporate life presidents
have been caught up in feuds with their successors; some have had to return
to sort things out.
Last year, Sir Laurie Barratt, life president of the house-building company
he founded, returned to the chair after the company suffered in the hands of
new managers.
Mr David Ogilvy, life president of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, was so distressed by the
bid for his advertising agency by Mr Martin Sorrell that he called the WPP
chief executive 'an odious little jerk'. Mr Ogilvy went on to serve as WPP
chairman.
Lord Kissin, life president of Guinness Peat, had a series of rows with Mr
Alastair Morton, whom he left in charge. Lord Kissin won, and Mr Morton
moved on to Eurotunnel.
A warning for Lord King came from Mr Alec Horsley, 89, life president of
Northern Foods. He said: 'I founded the firm. So many people knew me that I
couldn't really have been ignored. I don't think there will be quite the
same goodwill with Lord King.'
Other life presidents include Lord Bernstein of Granada, Sir Reo Stakis and
Lord Forte of the eponymous hotel chains, Lord Laing of United Biscuits and
Mr Richard Branson, life president of Virgin Music, now part of Thorn-EMI.
Mr Branson - whose other company, Virgin Atlantic, is suing BA - said
yesterday: 'It's probably sub judice to say it, but I wish Lord King well in
his retirement.'

FT  15 JUL 92 / BET to raise Pounds 200m to redeem Amps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services group, is to raise Pounds 200.7m in a rights
issue to redeem auction market preferred stock (Amps), joining the growing
list of UK companies disenchanted with the hybrid form of debt and equity.
The company is to repay Dollars 380m of its Dollars 500m (Pounds 262m) of
Amps by means of a one-for-four rights issue underwritten by Baring Brothers
at 110p, 19p below BET's closing price yesterday.
Mr John Clark, BET chief executive, said the repayment was part of a
financial restructuring of the group.
The cost of financing BET's Amps has risen from slightly below US commercial
paper rates in 1991 to a 21 per cent premium this year, removing the benefit
of what should have been a cheaper form of financing. BET's Amps issue also
accounts for about 25 per cent of all the issues by non-US companies, which
Mr Clark said was reducing the marketability of the instruments.
US institutions tend to want to invest in the Amps of triple-A rated
companies, such as Coca-Cola, and have extracted a higher dividend to
compensate for the lack of liquidity and additional risk connected with
BET's preference shares. The dividend rates on Amps are set at auction every
month, generally in relation to interest rates prevailing on US commercial
paper.
Following the exceptional and extraordinary charges that BET announced with
its final results last month, shareholders' funds fell almost 40 per cent to
Pounds 113.8m. As a result, the preference shares made up 72 per cent of
shareholders' capital and reserves, which BET directors said was too high.
The Dollars 120m balance of the Amps will be repaid out of the company's own
resources, either from disposals or from cash internally generated.
Because BET considers its Amps to be a mezzanine form of equity and not
debt, the repayment will not substantially alter the reported gearing ratio
of about 25 per cent. However, if - as many analysts believe - the Amps are
really debt, gearing after the repayment can be considered to have fallen
from about 280 per cent to 45 per cent.
Mr Clark said the redemption of the preference shares was the latest of a
series of actions designed to return BET to a growth path.

FT  15 JUL 92 / KIO chief summoned for talks: Kuwait seeks to clarify role
in threatened collapse of Spanish company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE London-based president of the Kuwait Investment Office has been summoned
for an urgent meeting with the Kuwaiti government today after mounting
criticism of the KIO's role in the threatened collapse of Ercros, Spain's
biggest chemicals company.
Mr Ali Rashid Al-Bader is to meet Crown Prince Sheik Saad Abdullah al-Sabah,
prime minister, the Kuwaiti finance ministry said in a statement reported by
news agencies yesterday.
The report said he had been asked to explain why the KIO, which manages
Kuwait's overseas investments and which owns at least 39 per cent of Ercros,
had forced the holding company and one of its affiliates to seek protection
from creditors two weeks ago.
Ercros owes Dollars 2.15bn (Pounds 1.12bn) to creditors. The KIO has refused
to make new funds available without a broader agreement on assistance from
creditor banks and the Spanish government.
A spokeswoman for the KIO in London would neither confirm nor deny that Mr
Al-Bader had been recalled. 'My only comment is no comment,' she said.
It is understood that Mr Al-Bader is already in the emirate and that he will
meet Mr Nasr al-Rowdan, the finance minister, today. He is expected to
return to London tonight.
The position adopted by the KIO, which surrounds its affairs with the utmost
secrecy, has been harshly criticised in public by Spanish ministers and
bankers. The Ercros crisis has also led to calls from the political
opposition in Kuwait for an investigation into KIO's investments in Spain.
At Ercros, it is the holding company and its fertiliser divisions which have
been forced to suspend payments. Its smaller mining, chemicals and
explosives divisions have been operating normally, but Spanish banks have
demanded early payment from some of them in the past few days of loans worth
more than Dollars 20m. Late last week, a small Ercros road transport
affiliate filed separately to suspend payments to its creditors.
Many small suppliers face ruin if they are not paid by Ercros, which itself
employs 10,500 people. The company fears that some of its fertiliser plants
may close this month if KIO or the Spanish government do not provide funds.
Madrid says European Community subsidy rules prevent it from making new
funds available to Ercros.
The KIO has also been subject to intense criticism within the emirate, with
both the local press and opposition members of the National Assembly
alleging that bad management had led to large losses. The value of the KIO's
investment holdings is believed to have shrunk from about Dollars 65bn to
about Dollars 35bn.
KIO disposals include heavy selling in Japan. It also sold most of its 10.3
per cent stake in the Midland bank in the UK shortly before Midland shares
were boosted by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Final approach to be made to Germany over fighter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN, Spain and Italy, three of the four nations in the troubled European
Fighter Aircraft programme, agreed yesterday to make a last-ditch attempt to
bring Germany, the fourth member, back into the project.
However, there appeared to be differences between defence ministers over how
the project should proceed. Spain has apparently taken the side of Germany
in demanding at least a 30 per cent cut in the price of each aircraft.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, and his counterparts, Mr Salvo
Ando from Italy, and Mr Julian Garcia Vargas from Spain, called in a joint
statement after a London meeting for more talks with Germany.
Later Mr Rifkind met Mr Pierre Joxe, the French defence minister, although
he would not say in advance what would be discussed.
Last week Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said the
participation of France, which is building the Rafale advanced fighter
aircraft, might solve the problems with the EFA project.
After their meeting yesterday, the three ministers proposed that officials
and industry 'should study possible ways of (continuing with the project)
within a lower ceiling price'. Germany, which said this month that it did
not intend to participate in production of the aircraft, says the EFA is too
expensive.
But disagreements emerged between the three defence ministers over what to
do if Germany reaffirmed its decision to pull out of EFA. Mr Rifkind said if
this happened 'we all go to the three-nation project', but Mr Ando said the
remaining three countries would only decide what to do after any German
reaffirmation.
All three ministers agreed, however, that the next step was for Germany to
decide whether it was prepared to hold more talks with its EFA partners. Mr
Rifkind said he expected to hear from Mr Ruhe 'within a few days'.
These talks could then be held 'in weeks rather than months'.
Mr Garcia Vargas said that if Germany did pull out, a new partner should be
found, not necessarily from Europe. He said Spain would remain in the
project if each aircraft cost 30 per cent less than is currently projected.
This is in line with German proposals. Last week, Mr Ruhe said he wanted an
aircraft that was 30-40 per cent cheaper than EFA, for which estimated
prices vary between Pounds 25m and Pounds 45m, depending on whether running
costs and inflation are included.
The three ministers said that 'to have a European aircraft programme
continues to be an important objective both to provide a cost-effective
military capability and to keep European industries in the forefront of
aerospace technology'.
They emphasised the importance of maintaining 'the original four-nation
collaborative structure of the common air fighter whilst welcoming any other
Western European Union nation which might wish to join'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the family owns the merchant bank the chairman should be allowed to pay
himself what he likes. Even so there are bound to be raised eyebrows at the
way Sir Evelyn de Rothschild's salary has recently gone up.
Over three years, he has moved from being one of the City's lowest paid
merchant bank chairmen to one of its highest paid. In 1989 he received
Pounds 261,000 and in the year to March 1992 Pounds 852,000 (including an
unspecified one-off bonus). Leaving aside Warburg's Sir David Scholey, who
more than doubled his Pounds 511,000 salary with a Pounds 687,000 long-term
performance bonus last year, Sir Evelyn seems to have earned far more than
any of his rival chairmen.
Schroders' George Mallinckrodt got a 35 per cent rise to Pounds 590,000,
while Peter Baring's salary was virtually unchanged at Pounds 511,000.
Meanwhile, poor old David Peake at Kleinwort Benson had to make do with just
Pounds 251,000 last year.
The traditional rationale for the City's fat salaries is that they're the
price necessary to stop top talent defecting overseas. But in Sir Evelyn's
case it is hard to imagine him deserting the family firm. Given that he is
over 60, and there was a bonus payment, the jump in his salary may have
something to do with his future retirement plans.
Rothschild's bank says the payment was vetted by its renumeration committee
chaired by former Whitehall mandarin Sir Frank Cooper. Even so it must seem
a bit steep to present top civil servants like Sir Robin Butler who is paid
a paltry Pounds 109,000 for heading a workforce many hundred times larger
than Sir Evelyn's.

Are Japanese researchers putting the cart before the horse - or even the
cow? British cows, at any rate, have an inbuilt body-clock which tells them
when it is time to gather for milking or feeding.
But it seems that Japanese farmers - suffering from both a shortage of
herdsmen and a blind faith in technology - are resorting to playing music to
announce bovine tea-time.
Last year, scientists at an experimental farm relayed music across the
fields by loudspeaker and then put out feed for the animals. However,
because loudspeakers have only a limited range, the researchers decided
instead to play the sounds over bleepers in the cows' ears.
So far, apparently, the tests are promising, but more research is needed to
discover the cows' preferred taste in music. The current favourite is a
piano version of Spring Stream, a Japanese folk song. But perhaps Moo River
may be more to their liking?

Lord King's well-trailed decision to call it a day at British Airways and
hand over the control stick to Sir Colin Marshall raises the question of how
much longer that other entrepreneurial 74-year-old - Lonrho's Tiny Rowland -
is going to hang on.
It is nearly 20 years ago since the late Sir Basil Smallpeice tried, and
spectacularly failed, to unseat Tiny Rowland. Smallpeice, along with two
Conservative MPs - Duncan Sandys and Edward du Cann - had been one of three
non-executives appointed to the Lonrho board following growing City disquiet
about its financial affairs. However, Sandys and du Cann soon sided with
Rowland and although Smallpeice commanded a majority of Lonrho's directors -
the so-called straight eight - he and his supporters were booted out at the
next meeting.
If the battle were to be fought again, Rowland could have a fight on his
hands. Lonrho has cut its dividend and is selling UK assets to make ends
meet. The other big difference now is that unlike British Airways, Lonrho
does not have a sizeable cadre of non-executives to whom the chief executive
can turn for advice.

'Daddy, the markets have had a really bad day, but don't worry. Your gilts

This week Ganesh, now a mature 13, became Britain's youngest first class

abstract heights of the subject must remain to be seen, but he does seem
able to put his figuring skills to practical use.
His father Arjuna Sittampalam, himself a maths PhD, is managing director of
Sanwa International, the London fund management arm of Sanwa Bank. He was
responsible last September for the daring venture of launching 10 authorised
unit trusts at one go.
There are strong signs that Ganesh may follow in his father's footsteps.
According to Sittampalam pere: 'He was quite an avid follower of the market.
I gave him a nominal Pounds 50 to speculate on the Dow. For the next month
he was buying and selling, and after a month he had made about Pounds 1

to compose:
'This Beautifully Painted
And Bloody Awful Train
By everything that's holy
I will not take again.
I'll sell my season ticket
And buy a private hearse.
It may not travel faster,
It cannot travel worse.
And you, Sir Herbert Walker,
When all men's patience fails
Take up your true vocation
Of cultivating Snails.'
(In a footnote he says that Sir Herbert Walker was the then general manager
LSWR).
So it seems that things have not changed much in 67 years, which may give Mr
McEvoy food for thought as he next waits at the signal.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Scottish sword-play: John Smith combines charm with menace,
but can he persuade voters to support the Labour party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be more a coronation than an election. Shortly after 2.30pm on
Saturday, Mr John Smith will win the Labour party leadership by such a large
margin of votes that the necessity for a three-month-long contest has
already been called into question.
Nonetheless, what has long been seen as a fait accompli will bestow upon the
new leader a formidable measure of authority. That said, the mood in
London's gloomy Royal Horticultural Hall is likely to be more sober than
ecstatic.
Though many of Mr Smith's supporters privately believe that it was he, not
Mr Neil Kinnock, who should have led Labour into April's general election,
some feel that, at 53, he may not be the perfect choice for the next
election in 1996-97.
Further, although Labour MPs agree that there is no alternative for now,
doubts remain as to whether a cautious Scottish lawyer can persuade the
electorate to abandon Mr John Major's leadership for his own.
'It will be our bank manager versus their bank manager,' one cynical Labour
frontbencher muttered recently. 'The question I ask is: how do we persuade
the public to risk moving their accounts?'
That is the pessimists' view, born out of Labour's still unrelieved
depression and a lacklustre leadership campaign that signally failed to
function as an effective post-mortem on the election defeat.
There are others, however, who believe that Mr Smith's accession may be
unexpectedly timely. His age and natural authority, they claim, will
contrast usefully with that of a still inexperienced prime minister, lending
Labour a gravitas essential to complete the long march back to electability.
The flamboyant Kinnock era of platform oratory, behind-the-scenes fixing and
head-on confrontation with the Trotskyite left has purged the party of its
early 1980s extremism in a way that would have been more difficult for a
leader from the right wing of the party.
Now, just three months after the election, the economy and Europe have left
the government again looking divided - ripe for the forensic skills of a
heavyweight Edinburgh advocate whose despatch box credentials are already
proven.
Mr Smith, his enthusiastic supporters claim, is ideally suited to a new era
in British politics - one not of grand ideological clashes, but the
close-quarters cut and thrust of two versions of pragmatism, vying for the
centre ground.
Talking in his Westminster office this month, Smith made clear that his two
prime personal objectives remain down to earth: to address Britain's
industrial failures and to use education and training as the tool to
'liberate' the lives of the less well-off.
It is a manager's vision that assumes a collaborative instinct in society
and quarrels with the notion that Conservatism runs with the self-interested
grain of human nat-ure. 'We are only fulfilled properly in the community. Of
course we want a good house and a good job . . . but we also want a decent
society that cares for the less well-off.'
Labour's 14th party leader traces such convictions to his Highland roots as
the oldest child of a primary school headmaster in Ardrishaig, an isolated
coastal village situated half way down Argyll's misty Kintyre peninsular.
A cheerful child, his earliest influences stemmed from the presbyterian
socialism of his father Archibald - replenished weekly by the arrival of the
New Statesman - a warm, artistic mother and two admiring younger sisters.
Mr Iain 'Eeny' McGregor, a contemporary, remembers Smith as a child prodigy
who, as young as 10 years old, was already lecturing his schoolmates on the
benefits of the National Health Service and the importance of nationalising
coal.
'We all wanted to play cowboys and Indians, but John was able to hold our
attention although no one really understood what he was on about,' he
recalls.
By the time he reached Glasgow University, he was regarded by the Labour
club's young tyros - like Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary -
as an experienced political operator, if one who combined his politics with
a rumbustious conviviality, Gaelic singing, frequent laughter and generous
helpings of whisky and beer.
The student politician had little time for the Bevan versus Gaitskell schism
dominating Labour at the time. To this day, Smith scorns ideology in favour
of practical solutions to the perennial if pedantic human problems of
poverty and poor education.
'Political activity is above all moral activity,' he said last month. For
Smith, the Good Samaritan is a more appropriate role model than
intellectuals such as Marx, whom he is proud never to have read.
Mr Donald MacCormick, the television journalist and friend from university
days, remembers that unlike other students, Smith was already a figure in
Scottish politics, attending conferences, canvassing in local elections and,
at 23, vigorously contesting the safe Tory seat of East Fyfe in 1961.
'He was by no means the statesmanlike prime minister in waiting, but where
some of us were dilettante, John was already professional,' he observed.
That single-mindedness took Smith to the Scottish bar - an option that
combined security with the chance to hone debating skills. By the time the
31-year-old Smith was elected for Airdrie and Coatbridge (later North
Lanark) in 1970, colleagues at the Scottish bar agreed he was throwing away
a career that would have offered fortune if not fame. Yet within little more
than a year in parliament, he risked jettisoning his political future by
joining the 69 Labour rebels who ignored a three-line whip and backed
Britain's accession to the European Community.
It was his first and only serious confrontation with the party
establishment. Despite his rebellion, promotion came rapidly. After
declining Harold Wilson's offer of a Scot-tish job, he rose swiftly to
minister of state in the energy department under Mr Tony Benn - who, though
often an opponent, still describes him as 'able and charming'.
Under Jim Callaghan's leadership in 1977-78, Smith's barrister's skills were
put to use in the effort to devolve powers to Scottish and Welsh national
assemblies against the formidable unionist obstacles of Mr Tam Dalyell, the
Labour maverick, and Mr Enoch Powell.
His reward - despite defeat in the subsequent referendum - was to be (at 39)
Callaghan's youngest cabinet minister at the Department of Trade, Prices and
Consumer Protection, enough time to introduce legislation against insider
trading before the election defeat of 1979.
In opposition, Smith has built his name on harrying the government. His
merciless attacks on Leon (now Sir Leon) Brittan during the Westland affair
earned him the shadow chancellorship from which he bear-baited Nigel (now
Lord) Lawson in clashes remembered as among the most effective of recent
times.
Despite his heart attack in 1988, there has seldom been any doubt that the
shadow chancellor was Neil Kinnock's natural (if not preferred) successor.
An unflappable television performer whose moral standpoint, sharp wit and
occasional irascibility combine charm with menace, he is understandably the
Labour opponent most Conservatives most fear.
What is more, inside a party criticised for being driven by the whims of
public opinion, his loyalty to an old-fashioned redistributionist Labourism
has won him respect.
'I haven't basically changed my political stance since I was a student,' he
commented. Was that a good thing? 'I don't know . . . but it is slightly
better than all those left-wingers who are now Thatcherite stockbrokers,'
came the reply.
Yet for all this admirable consistency, serious doubts must remain as to
whether the electoral mountain can be conquered. Few believe the seven and a
half percentage points that divided the two main parties in April can be
bridged by integrity and personality alone.
The party leader-to-be has given some clues as to how he means to proceed.
For up to a year, detailed policy issues will be put to one side to allow a
wide-ranging debate on the goals of a modern social democratic party as it
approaches the millennium.
It is clear that the aim is to conquer new ground by remodelling the state
as champion of the individual against entrenched vested interests, whether
of the public sector or privatised industries. Stress will be placed on
government as pro-active 'empowerer' of the community's collective
interests.
The broad thrust of Labour's 1992 manifesto is unlikely to undergo radical
revision. It is the tone and packaging of its proposals for reviving
industrial investment and enhancing education and skills training that will
be given greater prominence. Mr Smith's conviction is that the nitty-gritty
business of making Britain function more efficiently should take precedence.
Nonetheless, the rumbling symbolic battles over the role of the unions, the
party constitution's Clause Four (which advocates state ownership), or
electoral reform, all threaten to set the self-proclaimed 'modernisers'
against party conservatives. Both sides will expect the leader's backing.
His instincts tend to lie closest to opponents of deep-rooted change, but
finding compromises will test his untried skills of party management.
As some of his Kinnockite critics have argued, the canny shadow chancellor
often kept out of the firing line when some of the biggest battles of the
past decade were being fought. He has never been a member of the party's
policy-making national executive committee, of which he will now be primus
inter pares.
Collegiate by instinct, confident by nature, Smith is promising to end the
bunker mentality of the Leader of the Opposition's office and integrate it
with party headquarters in Walworth Road. Yet his strategy for winning the
backing of his party and the electorate at the next election is ultimately
based, in his own ponderously legalistic phrase, on 'analytical reasoning
and persuasive exposition'.
His admirers believe that if he can convey both his own good nature and his
seldom exposed passion to the electorate, Smith could shed some of the
boring bank manager image. He is ready to embrace whatever changes are
necessary, whether they be in policy or the party's internal structures. But
his core values - a very Scottish species of practical Christian socialism -
are not negotiable.
Instead, he is convinced his task now is to persuade the electorate to make
them theirs. It must remain in question whether the south of England will
ever be ready to do so.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: The Wynton Marsalis Septet - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUMPET player Wynton Marsalis was put on a pedestal early. The hot-housed
progeny of a New Orleans jazz nursery headed by father Ellis, young Wynton
had accumulated three Grammy awards for best soloist by the time he was 25.
A precocious student of the Juilliard School of Music in New York and
apprentice to Art Blakey, he has since toured the world with his own small
groups and with symphony orchestras. Now 30, he is generally regarded as the
most complete trumpeter bar none.
But the slow-talking southerner has begun to attract brickbats as well as
acclaim, usually from those who are eager to see a successor to Miles Davis.
Wynton is a perfect technician with honeyed tone and the control of a yogi,
they say, but he hasn't done anything new. He is to the development of jazz,
what the compact disc is to vinyl.
The snappily dressed septet he leads these days is a self-assured and
controlled group which slides through arrangements for suites and set pieces
without a blip.
Where there might be spontaneity, there are quick fire changes and perfect
articulation instead - from flaring trombone to sopranino. Although there
are no blazing hellfire solos, there are simmering exchanges between the
horns and the piano which are turned down by a stern rhythm section lest the
arrangements boil over.
Far from offering a new way with jazz, Marsalis continues to delve into the
past for inspiration in his writing and playing.
On Monday night, we had new charts and deft changes for a standard,
'Indiana', part of a moody original score for a ballet and a grand
Ellingtonian orchestral suite describing life in the city, 'City Room'.
To close, and to show he really can play it all and loud, Marsalis went back
to the beginning invoking the spirit of trumpet legend Buddy Bolden, and the
early marching bands.
From the fragile and muted notes of a cool ballad through to the contrived
study of New Orleans wailing fanned by a bowler, Marsalis's golden sound
hangs by a thread. If he can improve on this with age, who cares if he does
nothing new.
In gloriously contrasting support, the Julian Joseph Quartet stormed through
a selection from their impressive debut album The Language of the Truth
(East West 9031-75122) showing an innocent lack of restraint.
British pianist Joseph does little that is 'new' in his compositions either,
but has a percussive and full handed way with the keyboard that is exciting
and vital.

Hall

FT  15 JUL 92 / Management: The China syndrome - Increasing numbers of Hong
Kong manufacturing companies are leaving the colony in pursuit of cheap land
and labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE USED to enjoy taking people over our factories, but not so much now,'
says William Ho, finance director of Video Technologies (Vtech), a Hong
Kong-based manufacturer of computers, telecommunications and educational
toys. 'They are so empty.'
Ho looks along a line of women assembling and testing 'mother boards' for
the company's latest desktop computer and says: 'We'll be moving this all to
China in the near future. We will then use the space for conference rooms
and places for customers to meet our salesmen.'
At another company, Steven Lam, managing director of Truly Electronics, a
toys, calculators and much else besides manufacturer, is in full flight,
extolling the industry of his fellow Chiu Chow compatriots. 'Working 10
hours in a day is nothing for a Chiu Chow person: 16, 17, 18 hours a day is
more normal; and no holidays,' he says.
In 1984, Lam set up a factory in Shanwei, a town on the south coast of the
Chiu Chow-speaking region of Guangdong which boarders Fujian province. His
family comes from the town and his 72-year-old father, Tam Tak Ming, has
resettled there to oversee a burgeoning family business which today employs
3,500 people.
A quiet business revolution is underway in southern China. In the continuing
search for lower costs and higher productivity, a new division of labour is
being created. Hong Kong's manufacturers are exporting their production
facilities wholesale to Guangdong, the province of China which borders the
colony.
Truly moved all its manufacturing capacity to Shanwei in 1988. Currently
Vtech makes 95 per cent of its toys and educational games in Dongguan,
south-east of Guangzhou (Canton), 50 per cent of its telecommunications
equipment and 30 per cent (soon to be 70 per cent) of its computers there.
These manufacturers, and thousands like them, are taking advantage of the
cheap land and labour in southern China, and the new-found willingness of
the communist Chinese to permit capitalist enterprise in the mainland.
Truly recently acquired a 99-year lease on 2.2m square feet of land adjacent
to its present factory in Shanwei for Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 620,000). 'The
land is virtually free of charge,' says Joe Lok, Truly's finance director.
He points out that in Hong Kong, Truly would spend more than that in rent in
less than two years.
The cost of labour is also a fraction of Hong Kong levels. Vtech employs
6,500 workers at its factories in Dongguan. Many come from other provinces
so it undertakes to house and feed all the people it employs. In addition to
wages, it also pays a per capita management fee to the Dongguan authorities.
The total of all the costs comes to HKDollars 700 (Pounds 47) a worker a
month - just 23 per cent of the wage bill for a similar worker in Hong Kong.
But costs are not the only reason for locating in Guangdong. The local
authorities do not interfere in the running of factories and are less
stringent about health, safety and environmental limits to corporate growth.
'Contractually, Vtech subcontracts the assembly of its products to the
factory which is owned by Dongguan Foreign Investment Development
Corporation,' says Ho. 'Practically, they don't have any people there; it's
all run by us.'
China is seen as a source of cheap labour - which it is - but 'cheap' also
suggests lack of skill. Not so, say Vtech and Truly.
Vtech has hired 70 engineers who have recently graduated from some of
China's top universities. For Alan Wong, Vtech's chairman and founder, 'one
of the biggest resources in China that is overlooked is its large pool of
good engineers.
'Engineers are our biggest need. Product cycles are getting shorter and
shorter and you need a lot of engineers to turn out new products and ideas.
You can't do that in Europe and the US because engineers are so expensive.'
Vtech pays its local engineers Yuan 800 (Pounds 76) a month - three times
what they would earn if employed by one of China's state industries.
Similarly, Truly's factory in Shanwei is managed by local people; only the
top engineers come from abroad. There are 14 Hong Kong engineers and six
Swiss engineers advising on the manufacture of parts for watches which are
then exported to Switzerland.
Truly owns Ernst Borel, a Swiss watch manufacturer, and it is marrying Swiss
engineering to the low costs of southern China. The six Swiss engineers are
in China to teach local engineers the finer points of watch making.
But doing business in China, even for the Chinese, is not always successful.
Vtech first dipped its toe in the water with a HKDollars 10m investment in
Shenzhen, a special economic zone which runs the length of the Hong
Kong-China boarder, but it failed.
'Our partner was a northerner who followed too many rules and red tape,'
says Ho, a southerner who was born and bred in Hong Kong.
'The first moment we talked to the Dongguan authorities we saw that they
were open minded and very business-like. They impressed us from the very
first meeting. They also came to us when the agreements were ready to be
signed; our previous partner had asked us to go to him to sign.'
Relationships, or guangxi, are key to doing business in Guangdong, and China
more generally. Truly has gone as far as to have a dedicated team,
consisting of seven executives - one of whom was a senior communist party
official - who do nothing other that make and cement relationships with
government officials throughout China.
'Everything is relationships; without relationships you can't do anything,'
says Lam. 'If you are not a local person you can't make relationships. If
you want to invest there, you have got to be Chinese. Communication is
easier and city officials prefer to deal with Chinese.
'When we want to develop a city, then we send the team there first. In the
south if you send an official a television set, he will turn up his nose; in
the north they are content with a radio.'

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Manual workers press for new deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 900,000 local authority manual workers, the poor cousins of the
public sector, are seeking a new deal from their employers as a quid pro quo
for providing services of the highest quality.
The two general unions, the TGWU and GMB, who yesterday lodged a joint claim
for Thursday's annual pay negotiations, implicitly recognise that the manual
workers are not going to improve their relative pay position.
The claim thus concentrates on non-pay issues such as harmonisation between
blue and white collar, an equality audit to root out discrimination, and the
claim for five days' training a year.
The two unions also propose 'single-table bargaining' - an idea which has
also been floated by the employers so has a good chance of being
implemented.
In a joint statement the two unions said: 'The 'them and us' culture in
local government has held manual workers back and not served the community
well.'
The manual workers have also asked for a substantial pay rise but are
unlikely to win more than 4 per cent. White-collar workers have settled for
4 to 4.4 per cent.
The electricians section of the AEEU engineering and electrical union will
have to reduce its full-time staff of 350 by between 35 and 50 to save
Pounds 1.3m a year. The savings are required by a continuing reduction in
members, by the ending of a pension 'holiday' and by the probable
requirement of TUC affiliation fees.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Touche seeks BCCI papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH COURT was asked yesterday to order the Serious Fraud Office to
produce documents it has seized relating to the affairs of the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The documents were sought by Touche Ross, liquidators of BCCI, which said
they would speed up its work of winding up the bank.
Mr Edward Bannister QC, for the liquidator, said most of the documents had
been seized either from Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors, or Control
Securities, a company controlled by Mr Nazmu Virani and of which BCCI owned
5.2 per cent of the issued share capital.
Other documents had come from the homes of Mr Agha Abedi and Mr Swaleh
Naqvi, former officers of BCCI; from a safe deposit box in the name of Mr
Zafar Iqbal, another ex-BCCI officer; as well as from the offices of Capcom,
a broker through which BCCI conducted at least part of its operations.
There was evidence that the Iqbal documents would be of very great
importance to the liquidators, while the SFO had indicated that the flight
log of a BCCI jet would be of use to them, Mr Bannister said.
Mr Bannister said the SFO was willing to produce the documents but wanted
the protection of a court order before doing so.
He said it was estimated that there were upwards of 100m unfiled and
unclassified BCCI documents available to the liquidators in 40 locations in
the UK.
So far Touche Ross was not halfway through sifting and collating them.
The liquidators believed that the documents with the SFO would be of immense
assistance, giving it speedier access to information.
A large number of the documents related to work done by Price Waterhouse for
an investigating committee initially set up by the government of Abu Dhabi.
There were grounds for believing the documents contained information about
what were called 'problem loans'.
In particular, information about the relationship of certain companies and
individuals who had dealt with BCCI in connection with problem loans.
The case continues today.
Mr Nazmu Virani, chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, who is
charged with fraud in connection with BCCI, was yesterday further remanded
on Pounds 1.25m bail until December 1 by City of London magistrates.
Payments totalling Pounds 22m have been made by the Deposit Protection Board
to 4,000 depositors of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, disclosed in a written
reply.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Charming words as a reasonable
couple divorces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST ONCE in a while, on rare occasions, the theatrical bear pit that is the
House of the Commons transforms itself into something akin to the real
world.
The natural hyperbole of party politics falls away and a gust of reality
cuts the fuggy atmosphere of stale rhetoric that hangs like a pall of cigar
smoke across the chamber.
There were no clues before prime minister's questions yesterday that this
miracle was about to occur. But the knowledge that this was the last
session, after a run of nine years, at which Mr Neil Kinnock would sit on
Labour's front benches as opposition leader had created an air of
anticipation.
When he rose to a resounding cheer from his own backbenches, Mr Kinnock's
tone was not hectoring but considered. Did the prime minister recall his
election promise that a Tory victory would provide the spark for recovery,
he asked. Where was it?
Mr Major postponed his reply to offer a tribute. Thanking his opponent for
support in times of crisis, he said: 'I am very pleased to have the
opportunity to thank you for that and to do so publicly and with warmth.'
The disarming tone was followed by a calm reiteration of the government's
determination to keep pressure on inflation as its highest priority.
As the house fell silent, Mr Kinnock caught the mood, thanking the prime
minister for his words and stating that it had been a great honour to serve
the country. 'I know that this is a vocation which you share and I hope that
the country generally and the people in it can achieve greater success in
the future.'
Returning to his official duties, Mr Kinnock warned that government economic
strategy had 'all of the features of the slump in the 1930s.'
'For the sake of our country, you should now recognise that to continue with
those same policies will not bring durable or sustainable recovery and
certainly will not bring a country 'at ease with itself'.'
At a volume barely above that of a drawing-room conversation, the prime
minister politely demurred. Sustainable recovery, he said, could only be
based on sustainable growth and low inflation.
Like a reasonable couple involved in a painful divorce, the two agreed to
disagree.
Later, it emerged that Downing Street had privately suggested to Mr
Kinnock's office on Monday that he 'bowl a slow one'. In character to the
last, the leader of the opposition had formally declined - then done so. It
was all too civilised to be true.
In October, normal service will be resumed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night bowed to Tory backbench pressure over plans to
limit fishermen's days at sea, promising parliamentary consultations on
fishing quotas.
The Commons announcement of the concession from Mr David Curry, fisheries
minister, averted a threatened rebellion by Conservative MPs opposed to the
proposals in the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill.
There was cross-party support for an amendment introduced during the report
stage by Mr Neville Trotter (Cons, Tynemouth), demanding that the government
should return annually to parliament for approval of the days-at-sea limits
it intended to set.
But Mr Curry gave MPs an assurance that the Commons and the Lords would be
consulted before any reductions in days at sea were introduced after 1993.
The Bill was later given a third reading by 311 votes to 282, a government
majority of 29.
It now goes to the House of Lords.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour attacks electricity profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITEERING by privatised electricity companies cost each customer Pounds
60 last year, Labour said yesterday.
Urging a new regulatory framework, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary,
said pre-tax profits of the 17 companies in England, Scotland and Wales
totalled Pounds 3.1bn, a 43 per cent increase over the previous year's total
of Pounds 2.2bn.
'In 1987-88, the last year before the electricity industry accounts started
to be 'adjusted' in preparation for privatisation, the total profits of the
industry were Pounds 1.2bn,' Mr Dobson said.
'Compared with that year, the new total of Pounds 3.1bn represents an
increase of no less than 150 per cent. Over the same period inflation was
only 31 per cent.
'If electricity profits had risen at the same rate, last year's profits
would have totalled Pounds 1.6bn, a shortfall of Pounds 1.5bn on what
happened.
'These excess profits of Pounds 1.5bn are equal to Pounds 60 per electricity
customer just in the last year alone.'
Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman and chief executive of Midlands Electricity,
received a near-22 per cent increase last year.
His salary went up from Pounds 181,790 to Pounds 221,399. The basic was
Pounds 182,750, to which was added a performance-related bonus of Pounds
31,981 and benefits in kind. The previous year included a one-off payment on
privatisation.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Britain to work for abolition of
coal levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government is to use its presidency of the European Community to
target the levy on EC coal and steel for early abolition.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has agreed that progress
on phasing out the levy before 2002, when it is due to end anyway, should be
one of the objectives of the meeting of the council of EC industry ministers
in November.
The Department of Trade and Industry has come under pressure from both
British Steel and British Coal to see the end of the tax, which amounts to
about 0.3 per cent of the value of what is produced. The levy dates from the
treaty of Paris in 1952, which set up the European Coal and Steel Community
 -the forerunner of the European Economic Community itself.
At present some Pounds 500m has accumulated in the fund, which is used to
finance tasks such as re-training and job replacement. The distribution of
the money is primarily a matter for the EC Commission.
To some extent those tasks are matched by other schemes set up more
recently: the re-training function, for example, is closely paralleled by
the separate Rechar funds.
Quite apart from the government's political distaste for what one minister
has called an 'iniquitous production tax', ministers are conscious that they
will need to be certain in the run-up to coal privatisation about the future
of the levy.
Even if the government is able to leave the question unresolved during
parliamentary debate on the legislation itself, which is due to be brought
forward in the autumn, potential purchasers of the industry will want to be
clear about how long the levy will continue and whether the industry might
benefit from a share of whatever remains in surplus.
The UK will also be using its presidency to press ahead with work on setting
up an evaluation and monitoring system for the cohesion funds to be
established under the Maastricht agreement. Ministers are anxious that those
countries contributing most can be sure the funds are being properly
directed within the countries that will benefit.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, said yesterday that his
priority at the two research council meetings during the UK presidency would
be to make progress on the future of the Framework Programmes of research.
He made clear that the programmes should concentrate on identifying generic
technologies which had a broad application across industry, and that the
emphasis should be on quality rather than subsidy.

Saleroom

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHALK drawing by Gainsborough, 'A peasant family going to market' (detail
right), sold for Pounds 352,000 at Christie's yesterday to an anonymous
telephone bidder.
The price was plumb in the middle of the saleroom's estimate and is the
second-highest sum paid at auction for a drawing by the 18th century English
artist. A year ago Christie's sold 'A lady walking in a garden' for Pounds
616,000.
Gainsborough made the drawing in Bath in the 1770s. It gives an idealised
view of rural life and owes something to the landscapes of Rubens. It comes
from the estate of the late Lord Clark, of 'Civilisation' fame.
The auction of British drawings and watercolours did well, totalling Pounds
830,863 with only 9 per cent unsold. A watercolour by Turner, 'The Splugen
Pass', was near the top of its estimate, selling for Pounds 242,000.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Guidelines released on auditing at
Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUIDELINES released yesterday on auditing at Lloyd's should help to open it
up to a larger number of accountancy firms, Andrew Jack writes.
The notes, the second set from the Auditing Practices Board, are not
designed to lay down new standards but to spread existing best practice.
They cover the functions and duties of firms auditing brokers, syndicates
and managing agents, and stress that the auditors are responsible above all
to the individual Names. Mr Graeme King, general manager at Lloyd's
regulatory services group, called the notes 'a cartel-breaking document'
that should lift themystique surrounding auditing at Lloyd's and would help
to expand the number of auditing firms recognised by Lloyd's from the
present 15.
The notes stress that it is vital for auditors to examine the strength of
syndicates' internal controls and the statistical techniques used to
calculate reinsurance.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lloyd's suffers setback in battle
with Names
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London has suffered a setback in its legal battle with dissident
Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting at the market.
Judge Morris Lasker in the US District Court for the Southern District of
New York issued a restraining order last week, temporarily preventing
Lloyd's from pursuing lawsuits against two Names. The order will remain in
force until August 19.
Lloyd's has issued the writs to try to force the Names to pay cash calls
needed to pay insurance losses. The Names are among a group of 110
represented by New York-based Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn. The group
alleges that Lloyd's violated US securities laws by inducing its members to
participate in syndicates trading at the insurance market.
Meanwhile, Mr Gordon Pollock QC said in the High Court yesterday that an
effort by dissident Lloyd's Names to seek a judicial review of the insurance
market was 'doomed to failure'.
Mr Pollock, representing Lloyd's, said the market was 'not subject to public
law'.
Lloyd's has applied for leave to set aside a motion from six Names seeking a
judicial review. The Names are members of loss-making Gooda Walker
syndicates and contend that by permitting a series of cash calls, Lloyd's
has not met its obligations to members.
Mr Pollock said that the interests of policyholders must be paramount.
The case continues today.
David Owen writes: Lloyd's will proceed with plans to double the size of its
central guarantee fund through a one-off levy on all Names without awaiting
the results of a ballot on key motions proposed for an extraordinary general
meeting later this month, Mr David Coleridge, chairman, told senior Tory
backbenchers at Westminster last night.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory revolt over MPs' allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT suffered a resounding defeat last night when a full-scale
Conservative backbench rebellion overturned its efforts to limit a rise in
MPs' office expenses to Pounds 4,000.
As Mr John Major, the prime minister, looked on, a crowded chamber stayed up
into the early hours of the morning to vote by a overwhelming majority of
131 to authorise a rise of Pounds 11,000.
The vote came despite the government austerity drive that last week held
down senior civil service increases to 4 per cent instead of a 20 per cent
figure recommended by the Top Salaries Review Baord.
The scale of the government defeat - by 317 votes to 186 - clearly shocked
senior ministers on the Treasury frontbench and party business managers.
It will also severely undermine efforts to set an example to the country at
a time when business is attempting to rein-in wage bills.
Advocates of the higher office expenses insisted during an impassioned
debate that the rise was not a salary increase for MPs, but merely an
overdue rise, needed to ensure their office staff could handle ever-rising
workloads.
Nonetheless, the jubilant reaction to the government's defeat on both sides
of the House constitutes a serious embarrassment at a time when tightened
belts are the official order of the day.
Defending the government's proposal to restrict the rise in allowances to
9.8 per cent, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the House, accepted that
workloads had increased.
But he added: 'Many other individuals are being asked to accept pay
restraint or find it necessary to impose it on themselves.'
A succession of MPs countered, however, that the call for restraint amounted
to efforts by the executive to restrain legislators' abilities to serve
their constituents and keep checks on the government.

FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Politicians send the trains down
yet another track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT may seem an obvious question, but if the private sector is better at
running railways than the state, why were they nationalised in the first
place?
British Rail is a relatively recent creation. From the opening of the
Stockton &amp; Darlington railway in 1825 to nationalisation in 1948, all of
Britain's railways were built and owned by the private sector.
Far superior in speed to canals and horse-drawn transport, railways
flourished in the 19th century. They spread to all corners of the kingdom,
and most paid good dividends to shareholders.
Almost from the start politicians wanted to play trains, too. They
interfered over service levels and fares alike.
While the railways prospered they were able to tolerate a degree of
political interference. But by the turn of the century they were having to
cope not only with increasingly onerous regulation of freight charges, but
with labour unrest and heavy losses of passenger traffic to buses and trams.
When the First World War began in 1914, it put the railways under immense
strain. It also brought them under state control, and many influential
voices argued that they should stay that way when the war ended.
Instead an attempt was made to restore viability by merging the 120 private
companies into four: the Great Western, the London Midland &amp; Scottish, the
London &amp; North Eastern, and the Southern.
Although these companies enjoyed virtual monopolies over large areas, none
of them succeeded in making much money. Competition from motor vehicles was
increasing; labour troubles resumed; the government continued to regulate
passenger fares and freight charges; and the Depression brought a slump in
demand.
During the Second World War the railways came under even greater strain than
during the first - this time suffering physical destruction as well as
increased wartime demands. Again the state took control. By the time the war
ended the railways were in such a poor state that nationalisation was almost
taken for granted. It duly took place in 1948.
After the failure of two post-war efforts to restore prosperity - the 1955
Modernisation Plan and the Beeching rationalisation of the 1960s - it seemed
that the arrival of motor transport had ended the profits potential of
railways for good. That might have marked the end of the private sector's
interest in them were it not for the arrival of the Thatcher government in
1979.
An inveterate privatiser, and notoriously hostile to public transport, Mrs
Thatcher declared as early as 1982 that she wanted to see BR sold off. Given
the size of BR's enduring losses, however, the government had to recognise
that this was impractical in the short-term. Instead it told BR to
concentrate on becoming more efficient and turned its back on BR's pleas for
higher investment, contenting itself in the meantime with the privatisation
of other transport sectors such as road freight, aviation and buses.
What changed matters was the upsurge in demand during the economic boom of
the late 1980s, and the property boom, which left BR awash with development
profits, giving rise to the belief that it could conceivably have a
commercial future after all.
Starting with Mr Paul Channon in 1988, successive transport ministers avowed
their enthusiasm for privatisation. The only question was how to achieve it,
given the precarious nature of BR's profits and the need for massive
investment to compensate for years of underfunding.
Privatising BR in one great lump seemed out of the question. Apart from
anything else, it was almost inconceivable that anyone would want to buy it.
By the time Mr Malcolm Rifkind took over as transport secretary in November
1990, the options had narrowed down to ways of splitting it into attractive
parcels.
Within a year Mr Rifkind had drawn up his master plan. The profitable
InterCity and Railfreight sectors would be sold outright, while the
loss-making Network SouthEast and Regional Railways operations would be
franchised out. He failed, however, to carry his cabinet colleagues with
him. Trade and industry ministers argued that a separate track authority was
necessary to create competition between train operators, while Mr John
Major, the prime minister, was said to hanker for a return to the days of
four regional railway companies.
In the end all the options were undermined as the economy sank deeper into
recession. BR's profits fizzled out and hopes of finding a buyer for any
part of the railway evaporated.
After months of embarrassing delays, a general election and yet another
change of transport secretary, the result was the watered-down version that
emerged yesterday - a long way from the full-blown privatisation that Mrs
Thatcher had dreamed of a decade earlier.

FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Several dozen private groups show
interest - Potential Buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL dozen private-sector companies have expressed interest in the future
of British Rail, with their focus divided between train services, stations
and the freight and parcels businesses.
The bidder with highest profile has been Mr Richard Branson, chairman of
Virgin Atlantic Airways. Within a week Virgin plans to put forward a pilot
scheme for running express trains between London and Edinburgh, stopping
only at Newcastle upon Tyne.
Virgin believes that for similar fares to those charged by BR it could offer
a faster service with free meals and entertainment of airline standard, such
as television screens for every seat. Business travellers would be offered
facilities such as faxes.
Virgin wants to hire trains from BR, refurbish them and pay a track fee. If
the pilot scheme succeeds it envisages offering similar services to four or
five British cities, competing with airlines.
Large numbers of travellers have been lured from rail to air but Virgin
believes many could be won back, not least because of increasing delays at
Heathrow.
Stagecoach, the Scottish bus operator, has already started an economy
service which operates five nights a week between London and Scotland,
leasing two carriages on BR scheduled trains.
The company might also be interested in InterCity services, franchising of
local services and buying stations. However, the Perth-based company is
waiting to study the fine print of the white paper and resulting legislation
 -particularly the still undecided track fees. It said: 'We could be
interested in everything or nothing - it all depends on the terms.'
Other bus operators which may be interested in bidding for services include
Badgerline, which runs bus services in Wales, the Midlands and the south of
England, and Yorkshire Rider.
Apart from Virgin, the name most often linked to the rail sell-off is BAA,
the privatised airports operator which has made a commercial success of
developing retail outlets at airports.
BAA said it was interested in railway stations, but emphasised it would
continue to focus on its airport business.
There are obvious similarities between airports and railway stations, but
BAA pointed out there were also significant differences. Air travellers were
in BAA's terminals for an average of one hour, with all the opportunity for
shopping which that implies. Many rail travellers spend only two or three
minutes in stations.
The spending power of railway passengers also contrasts markedly with that
of air travellers. BAA said 90 per cent of passengers using Heathrow are
from ABC1s.
BAA, which is funding 80 per cent of the Pounds 235m Heathrow-Paddington
link, is talking to other investors such as Virgin and British Airways after
the privatisation process put a question mark over BR's contribution of the
remaining 20 per cent. Virgin would like to run its own trains on both the
Gatwick and Heathrow link, and BAA is also interested in the
Victoria-Gatwick line itself.
The main obstacle to any widespread sale of stations is the property slump.
BR co-operated with several developers in the 1980s boom, getting London and
provincial stations refurbished in exchange for giving space to offices and
shops.
The present oversupply and depressed price of property is likely to prevent
any rapid take-up of BR stations and surplus land, which includes many acres
of goods stations and sidings - often in prime inner-city sites. In the
longer term, however, these sites could prove attractive for hotels,
offices, car parks and distribution centres.
One property analyst said: 'In the bull market, land values were high enough
to justify building over railway tracks. It will be a long time before
people plan to do that again.'
The part of BR that could attract most interest is rail freight, which
already has the highest level of private-sector participation. Nearly 40 per
cent of the fleet is privately-owned wagons.
Tiphook, the container group, is interested in extending its freight wagon
business, and Cargowagon, the German-owned group, also wants to expand.
Other possible entrants are the port companies and shipping groups.
National Power and PowerGen, the privatised generating companies, are
interested in running their own coal trains.
Charterail - a company set up by BR, the engineering group GKN, and
financial institutions Electra and Gartmore - welcomed the white paper. It
said it would increase the proportion of rail freight.
Mr Robin Gisby, Charterail's managing director, said: 'We now look to the
detailed legislation to ensure that costs of access to rail for freight
operators stand comparison with those incurred by road hauliers for access
to the road network.'
BR's parcels business is likely to attract the attention of leading players
in the UK market such as United Parcel Service, TNT and Securicor.

FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Proposals signal more of the same
 -Past Sell-Offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE creeping denationa-lisation heralded by the white paper may sound like
something new, but in many ways it is just more of the same. The
privatisation of British Rail has been going on for more than a decade.
Even before the first Thatcher administration in 1979, BR had started
selling off the station hotels it had inherited from the former private
railway companies. Then privatisation moved up a gear with the 1981
Transport Act, which set the scene for the outright sale of the non-core
businesses.
First to go was Seaspeed, BR's cross-Channel hovercraft business, which was
sold to Hoverlloyd in 1981 to form Hoverspeed. Next came Sealink, the ferry
operation, sold to Sea Containers in 1984.
Several more sales went ahead through management buyouts. British Transport
Advertising was sold to its management in 1987, followed by Travellers Fare,
the station catering business, in 1988. British Rail Engineering, the
rolling stock manufacturing arm, was sold to a management-led consortium in
1989.
In spite of these sales, some non-core businesses remain. The oddest one is
Meldon Quarry, near Okehampton, Devon, from which BR extracts ballast for
its tracks. Others include British Rail Telecommunications, which runs BR's
internal telephone services but has ambitions to provide telecommunications
services to the public. On these, the white paper is silent.
But while these have so far escaped privatisation, BR's involvement with the
private sector has grown in other directions. One is through participation
in joint ventures. For example:
The British Rail Property Board has joined with the private sector on
several large station redevelopment projects, such as Broadgate in the City.
BR's Railfreight Distribution subsidiary has taken equity stakes in
Charterail and Combined Transport, two private companies developing
road-rail distribution businesses.
The private sector has also encroached on to the railways in other ways.
Although InterCity provides the catering on all its trains and some of the
longer-distance Network SouthEast trains, the rest of BR's train
refreshments are provided by private concerns.
There have also been limited inroads into BR's core rail operations. Two
companies - Foster Yeoman and ARC - own their own locomotives, which haul
trainloads of aggregates on BR's lines.
BR also allows access by privately owned passenger trains, though until
recently only in the leisure market.
A new turn for privatisation came in May when Stagecoach, the bus operator,
took over two carriages on the London-Aberdeen sleeper service, repainted
them in its own livery, and started selling tickets under its own name.
Stagecoach and other companies have only gained access to BR's tracks where
it suited BR to permit it - and even then, only with BR staff driving the
trains. The effect of the white paper will be to allow private operators to
make greater inroads into BR's core business by giving them access to its
tracks by right, using their own staff.

FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Tories anxious over quality -
Political Impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE MPs yesterday hailed the opportunity to shake-up British Rail's
management, but many were anxious for assurances about the future quality of
service.
Serving notice that many Tory MPs will judge the success of the proposals
more in terms of service improvements than revenue raised, Mr Tim Renton,
former arts minister and MP for mid-Sussex, warned that without capital
investment by BR, commuter lines near his constituency would prove
unappealing to private operators.
'The infrastructure will not be good enough for franchisees to commit
themselves to run an efficient and punctual service,' Mr Renton said.
The most critical Conservative was Mr Robert Adley, MP for Christchurch, who
said that 'a few more Sock Shops on platforms and a few gaudy carriages'
would be no substitute for the services on which most of BR's passengers
depended.
Sir Geoffrey Johnston-Smith, Tory MP for Wealden, said he 'warmly welcomed'
the white paper but asked for assurances the private operators would not be
'fleeced' by BR. Other Conservatives were anxious about central ticketing,
timetabling, the future of smaller stations and about safety.
Mr Paul Channon, a former transport secretary, wanted to ensure fares in
Network SouthEast would continue to be controlled. Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, said franchises would include price ceilings.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said the proposals were
'irrelevant' for building a modern transport system and described the
long-delayed white paper as 'a cherry picker's charter - ripe for
exploitation'.
The Central Transport Consultative Committee, the passengers' watchdog, said
it accepted that the proposals to inject an element of competition into the
network could lead to an improvement in services. But it insisted the
government must continue to support unprofitable services.
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the move towards
privatisation.
Mr Derrick Fullick, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers' union,
said the proposals would be a catastrophe for Britain's transport system.
'The privatisation fanatics have drawn up a timetable for disaster. Their
plans are a fast-track to serious rail accidents,' he said. Routes would be
axed and vast areas of the country isolated from a direct rail service;
fares would rocket with concession schemes scrapped.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'The
acid test of the government's plans for railways remains whether they will
improve services for all passengers. The proposals set out in the white
paper do not meet this test.'

FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Government abandons full-scale BR
sell-off - Emphasis will be on improving rail services / Franchise authority
will award contracts to private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE white paper on the future of British Rail starts by acknowledging that
the corporation cannot be sold off to the private sector like other public
utilities, whether in one great lump or in parts. Its losses are simply too
big.
So there will be no stock market flotation or trade sale of BR. Instead the
corporation will go on running the railways indefinitely, but attempts will
be made to improve the quality of services by creating more opportunities
for the private sector to operate trains.
The first step will be to split BR into two. One part, to be named
Railtrack, will own the track, signalling and other infrastructure, and
charge for its use. The other part - presumably still called BR - will run
the trains.
The government will then try to get the private sector interested in taking
over train operations. The freight operations will be sold outright, but on
the passenger side the government hopes to contract-out train services
through franchises.
A franchise authority will be created to carry out the franchising on the
government's behalf. The government will decide what grants will be
available for subsidising loss-making services, and will set broad
objectives for service levels, quality and fares. The authority will then
hold open competitions among private companies to see which offers the best
terms for taking the contracts.
Beyond these broad principles, however, the government seems to have little
idea about how the franchises will work in practice. The white paper does
not spell out what franchises will be available, when they will be offered
or how long they will last. Everything, apparently, is negotiable: it all
depends on what the private sector is interested in doing.
The white paper is also hazy about how private companies are to obtain their
trains and drivers. Ideally, it suggests, it would like them to buy or lease
trains, but it recognises that such an obligation could be a barrier to
entry. So it concedes that most franchisees will want to use BR's existing
trains, and these will be available to rent.
InterCity services get a special mention in the white paper. The government
believes that some of these are close enough to profitability to be sold.
But it also recognises that this will not happen in the lifetime of the
present parliament. In the meantime, therefore, these will be franchised on
a so-called 'line-of-route' basis, such as the East Coast Main Line from
London King's Cross to Edinburgh or the Midland Main Line from London St
Pancras to Sheffield.
The passenger-services section of the white paper observes that BR staff are
likely to be keen to bid for franchises as well as the private sector. The
government is not only prepared to accept such bids, but intends to
encourage them by offering help with legal and financial advice.
Also worth noting is that Railtrack will receive no subsidies. It will have
to make a living - and pay for infrastructure investment - out of charges to
train operators. The level of charges is a severe bone of contention with
would-be train operators, but the white paper ducks it.
Instead it is to be the subject of a separate report by Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
the accountants, later this year.
On the freight side, the government's targets are more ambitious. It sets a
goal of getting all the freight and parcels businesses privatised in the
course of the present parliament, but again it is thin on detail. It
suggests that the freight businesses would be more likely to find buyers if
they were split up into their constituent parts. For example, users of the
coal, metals, construction materials and petroleum trainload services might
be interested in buying and running these business. Distribution companies
might be interested in other parts of the business, as might BR's own staff.
The white paper does not address the contentious issue of what will happen
to BR's loss-making freight services. If all rail freight is to be
privatised within the present parliament, the implication is that the
unwanted services will close - hardly an environmental plus for
privatisation.
In addition to the franchising of BR's existing services and the sale of the
freight operations, the government hopes to get new services on to BR's
tracks by opening access to any would-be operators who can meet required
standards. But as the white paper acknowledges, the lack of spare capacity
on BR's busier tracks will limit the scope for this, as will arguments about
how much different types of passenger and freight services should be charged
for using the infrastructure.
Some of these rows will be sorted out by an official regulator, a body to be
set up independently of the franchise authority.
The regulator's job will be to ensure fair play between operators over
rights of access.
The white paper also says the private sector could run stations. Some might
be rented to franchisees, and others sold or leased.
Safety issues, like so much in the white paper, are to be the subject of
further study, though it is stressed that these are of paramount importance.
Closure procedures will remain unchanged, and there is a commitment to
maintaining a single timetable and compatible ticketing. And there is one
item calculated to endear the white paper to BR's staff: 'Concessionary
travel arrangements for employees, and their dependants, and for retired
staff will also be safeguarded.'

FT  15 JUL 92 / Cable technology rules eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABLE television industry is to be freed from regulations which detail a
preferred technology for the construction of cable networks.
The move, announced yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry and
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, is intended to reduce costs and
boost investment in the industry.
It marks a retreat from the government's policy in the early 1980s of using
cable TV to bring high-technology services into people's homes.
The government wanted to encourage operators to build networks using a
technology called 'switched star' architecture by offering 23-year licences
instead of the normal 15 years.
The aims were to back a British technology and to promote advanced services
such as video-conferencing, tele-shopping and telebanking.
But nearly two thirds of the industry opted for the cheaper 'tree and
branch' technology. Moreover, the main customer demand has been for TV and
basic telephone services rather than advanced services.
Yesterday's decision is designed to allow operators to determine for
themselves, on the basis of commercial considerations, the best technology
to use. It brings the cable TV industry into line with the government's
policy of taking a technology-neutral approach to telecommunications.
Oftel is to remove the detailed technical requirements on operators with
23-year licences. The DTI has also decided to increase to 23 years the
licences of operators with 15-year licences to put both types of operator on
the same footing.
Mr Bill Wigglesworth, acting director-general of Oftel, said the move would
boost investment in the already growing telecommunications sector.
Mr Nick Mearing-Smith, executive group director of Nynex UK, one of the main
cable industry players, said it was 'an excellent decision'.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Producer price rise stabilises in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION as measured by prices of manufactured goods at the factory gate
failed to show a decline last month, dashing hopes of a let up in cost
pressures.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the prices of products leaving
factories rose 3.6 per cent in the year to June, the same as in May. This
measure is often used as the underlying 'core' inflation indicator.
Between May and June, the index of producer prices rose 0.1 per cent to
137.4. Year-on-year inflation at the factory gate remained at its lowest
level since April 1987, a reminder of how demand pressures have been
squeezed inthe recession.
But added to evidence of continuing inflation was the 3 per cent price
increase of goods excluding food, drink and tobacco in the 12 months to
June, compared with 2.6 per cent in the previous month.
The year-on-year increase for goods excluding edible items and tobacco - the
prices of which can move erratically due to excise duty changes - was the
biggest since January.
Last month's higher-than-expected figures may have been affected by large
price falls in specific manufactured items in June last year, distorting the
year-on-year comparison.
In June this year the price index of factory goods excluding food, drink and
tobacco also rose 0.1 per cent. Prices of minerals rose 0.4 per cent, while
those of scientific instruments and chemicals increased 0.3 per cent and 0.2
per cent respectively.
The prices of manufacturing raw materials and fuels rose a seasonally

FT  15 JUL 92 / Blue Arrow jury had 'understood the issues'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is no evidence that the length or complexity of the year-long Blue
Arrow fraud trial caused the jury any difficulty, the Court of Appeal was
told yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, who brought the prosecution for the Serious Fraud
Office, told the court that all the available evidence, notably questions
asked by the jury throughout the trial, demonstrated they had understood the
issues involved.
Mr Purnell defended his decision to maintain a large indictment against the
defendants - a move defence lawyers have alleged led to the trial becoming
unmanageably and unfairly large.
Mr Jonathan Cohen, Mr David Reed, Mr Nicholas Wells, all former County
NatWest executives, and Mr Martin Gibbs, a former UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
director, are appealing against their convictions of conspiracy to defraud.
The appeal continues.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Companies expect small rise in sales: Confidence has 'failed
to materialise' - Drop in production adds to recovery doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies expect only a modest increase in sales over the next three
months, with lower orders and profits hit by bad debt, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the
business information group, reported yesterday.
The company said its latest business confidence survey showed few British
companies felt business would improve substantially in the present quarter.
Although the overall picture is stronger than last year, recovery prospects
are weak, with companies worried about low turnover, poor cashflow and
strong competition.
'The expected confidence boost for UK companies from the government's
re-election in April has failed to materialise,' said Mr Philip Mellor, D
&amp;B's marketing manager. 'There is now no certainty of the recovery getting
fully under way before 1993.'
D &amp; B said the retail and construction sectors are hesitant, and singled out
bad debts as a 'brake on the recovery'. Retailers hope for higher sales but
expect lower profits. They are expected to continue destocking and price
discounting.
In the construction sector there is an even balance between companies
expecting higher and lower sales. But expectations of profits, prices and
employment point downwards.
Mr Mellor said there was a 'downward spiral' caused by record business
failures and companies writing off a percentage of their turnover in bad
debt. This was eroding gross profits and the ability of companies to compete
in the recovery.
D &amp; B found that one-in-five companies were suffering from bad debts
equivalent to more than 1 per cent of turnover. 'One per cent may seem a
small fraction,' said Mr Mellor. 'But a firm with a Pounds 3m turnover and a
6 per cent net profit margin that loses 1 per cent of turnover in bad debts
would have to find an extra Pounds 500,000 Pounds 30,000 write off.' D &amp; B
interviewed 1,700 managing directors between June 12 and June 30 in the
first of several business confidence surveys due this month. Its assessments
on the economy are based on balances of positive and negative answers to
questions about expected net sales, net profits, selling prices, employment,
new orders, inventories and exports in the three months from the time of
questioning.
It found that, on balance, 30 per cent of companies expected sales to rise
this quarter, compared with 13 per cent expecting a decline a year ago.
However, a balance of only 10 per cent expected higher profits. Although
this contrasted with the 30 per cent expecting a decline a year ago, it
marked a decline in optimism from the beginning of this year.
D &amp; B found that businesses in the south-west, east and north-east of
Britain were among the most bullish on sales. The east Midlands was the most
pessimistic region, while the west Midlands was probably the most
optimistic, in spite of expecting a sharp rise in unemployment. Pressure on
prices meant that businesses in London and the south-east were less hopeful
about profits than elsewhere.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC will launch a 24-hours-a-day radio news network by early 1994, Sir
Michael Checkland, the BBC director-general promised yesterday.
The new network on Radio 4 long wave will cost Pounds 9m a year and be
funded from efficiency and economy measures.
It would allow, Sir Michael said: 'A broader range of issues and voices to
be covered than is possible in existing bulletins.'
He told the Radio Academy Festival in Birmingham that the money would be
available in the next financial year for the extra staff. From 1995 the
network would be based at the BBC Television Centre, west London, in a news
and current affairs complex for radio and television.
Work on FM transmitters would be brought forward so the Radio 4 audience
would not lose its regular programmes because of the new network.
Sir Michael also announced the setting up of a BBC Education Directorate to
bring together all its educational work into a single multi-media structure.
The BBC also plans to have 10 per cent of radio production made
independently by 1996.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Manufacturing shows surprise fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DROP in the production of cars, chemicals and materials for the building
industry caused a surprise fall in UK manufacturing output in May, adding to
doubts over the prospects for economic recovery.
Contrary to City expectations of unchanged production, the Central
Statistical Office yesterday reported that manufacturing output declined by
0.6 per cent in May compared with April. Output of the energy and water
industries fell by 2.2 per cent in the month, to result in a 0.9 per cent
drop in overall industrial production.
The seasonally-adjusted data for May were further evidence that Mr John
Major's election victory failed to boost economic activity. Figures for the
latest three months, which the government considers a better guide to recent
trends, painted only a marginally better picture. The CSO puts the latest
estimate of trend growth in manufacturing output at 0.5 per cent a year.
Manufacturing output between March and May was 0.6 per cent higher than in
the previous three months, but 0.9 per cent lower than in March to May last
year.
Reflecting the vagaries of North Sea maintenance activity, energy output in
March to May was down 3.1 per cent compared with December to February, but
2.7 per cent up on the year before when the repairs to the Piper Alpha oil
field were being completed.
Overall industrial production was 0.4 per cent lower in the latest three
months compared with December to February, but unchanged compared with March
to May last year.
In manufacturing, yesterday's statistics showed a 0.7 per cent increase in
consumer-goods output between the two latest three-month periods, while
production of investment goods grew 0.2 per cent and output of intermediate
goods dropped by 1.1 per cent.
The metals, engineering and allied industries, textile and clothing and
'other manufacturing' industries, which include paper and publishing,
increased their output by about 1 per cent in the March to May period
compared with December to February. Food output was unchanged while drink
and tobacco production rose by 1.3 per cent.
Chemicals, a strong performer last year, showed a 0.5 per cent drop in
output between the two three-month periods. In spite of a fall in production
in May, car output between March and May was 7.4 per cent higher than over
the previous three months.

FT  15 JUL 92 / ITV's choice for top job turns it down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV network last night again began the search for a chief executive
after the candidate who was offered the job turned it down.
The offer of the most important job in commercial television, managing a
Pounds 500m-a-year budget, went to Mr David Arculus, group managing director
of Emap, the fast-growing magazine, newspaper and exhibitions group.
Mr Arculus, who is 46 and earns about Pounds 160,000 a year, has been in
discussions with ITV for the past few weeks and was formally offered the job
on Friday. He considered the possible move over the weekend and then told
ITV on Monday that he had decided not to leave Emap. ITV executives believed
Mr Arculus was about to accept.
Mr Arculus worked briefly for the BBC World Service but has been at Emap for
the past 20 years and has been a key figure in taking it from being a small
family-owned regional newspaper group to its present capitalisation of more
than Pounds 460m.
The ITV job was worth about Pounds 230,000 not including fringe benefits,
but would also have been one of the highest-profile jobs in British
television.
Mr Arculus was chosen by ITV after more than 70 names had been produced by
head-hunters. He was not offered any more money to stay but decided he could
not bear to leave.
ITV's failure to attract its man is a serious blow. The new commercial
television franchises begin in January with four new broadcasters and
negotiations are already under way with the Office of Fair Trading on the
shape of the future ITV network.
ITV urgently needs a chief executive to run what will be a new centralised
system of commissioning programmes for the ITV network from both ITV
companies and independent producers.
Immediately beneath the chief executive will be a senior
commissioner-scheduler who will have considerable influence on what is shown
on ITV.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Warning over tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POORLY paid and badly trained hotel employees, together with inadequate
public transport, threaten the UK's position as the world's fifth most
popular tourist destination, according to a study by the National Economic
Development Council.
The NEDC study, published yesterday, says the UK has held its own in the
international tourist industry over the past 20 years. Its share of tourists
was 4.2 per cent of the world total in 1990, the same as in 1970. Its share
of world tourist spending has remained about 6 per cent for 20 years,
suggesting Britain has been attracting visitors who spend more than the
average.
The study says, however, that this success masks worrying trends. Skill
levels in UK hotels are lower than in continental Europe. British hotels
also employ more staff than their continental counterparts but pay them
less.
The report says both the private and public sectors should raise the quality
of tourist facilities. The private sector should also improve training and
productivity, which would make the tourist industry more attractive to job
entrants.
The UK has attracted increasing numbers of visitors from the US and Japan,
but has been less successful in northern European markets.
The NEDC, which is due to be abolished at the end of the year, says that UK
tourism should not try to compete on price. 'Comparison of the UK with other
destinations shows that overall it is not particularly expensive; London
falls into the middle range of leading European cities.'
The report urges the tourist industry to create a new representative body to
stress the sector's importance. Tourist spending, including domestic
tourism, accounts for nearly 4 per cent of GDP and employs 1.6m people -
more than the health service.
Surveys carried out for the NEDC list British culture and heritage, the arts
and London as attractions mentioned most often by visitors to the UK. Only
the US, Spain, France and Italy attract more tourists.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Banks report sharp rise in police alerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and other UK financial institutions are alerting the police about an
increasing number of transactions by their depositors, according to figures
released yesterday by the British Bankers Association.
The association said details of an estimated 12,000 suspicious transactions
or depositors would be passed this year to the police National Criminal
Intelligence Service. This compares with the 6,000 last year and 3,000 in
1990.
Mrs Sue Thornhill, assistant secretary of the BBA responsible for security
and fraud, said the growth in the number of reports reflected a heightened
awareness on the part of banks of the need to report any suspicion of
criminal activity.
Detailed guidelines for banks and building societies on reporting suspicions
of money laundering were drawn up by the BBA three years ago after the House
of Commons Home Affairs select committee criticised the Bank of England for
doing too little in advising financial institutions about their
responsibilities under the law.
The guidelines were issued to cover disclosure requirements under the Drug
Trafficking Offences Act 1986, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the
Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1989. The Criminal Justice Act contains
provisions protecting banks from potential breaches in client
confidentiality.
While money laundering is still not in itself an offence the drug
trafficking and terrorism legislation made it illegal to launder or to
assist in the laundering of the proceeds of terrorism and drugs.
Banks formerly reported to the National Drugs Intelligence Unit, which was
absorbed in April into the NCIS, the police group responsible for collating
intelligence on all serious and organised crime.
Direct reporting to the NCIS gives the police access to all suspicious
banking transactions coming through the BBA-organised system.
Mrs Thornhill said counter staff were encouraged under the guidelines to
report unusual or suspicious transactions within their banks. These reports
were filtered through in-house fraud departments or officers and only if
suspicions still remained were they passed on to the police.
The new reporting requirements had brought changes to the banks.
Mrs Thornhill said: 'The banks have never wanted crooks on their books. In
the past when something suspicious has happened they have looked at an
account and closed it down. Now they have to report the account.'
Under existing laws, only individuals can be prosecuted for money laundering
offences but institutions themselves will soon become liable under an EC
directive on money laundering which must be implemented by all member states
by January 1 1993.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Maxwell inquiry order challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMPLOYEE of Lehman, the US finance house, yesterday challenged an order
that he submit to oral examination by the joint liquidators of Bishopsgate
Investment Management, the company from which hundreds of millions of pounds
of Maxwell group pension funds have disappeared.
Mr Mark Haas, a manager in Lehman's fixed income division and an executive
director of Lehman Brothers International, asked the High Court to discharge
or vary the order, made under the Insolvency Act. His examination has been
provisionally fixed for tomorrow.
Mr Charles Aldous QC, for Mr Haas, told Mr Justice Hoffmann that Mr Haas was
not seeking to have the order discharged with a view to withholding
information from the liquidators.
He had not been involved in the introduction of any Maxwell companies to
Lehman, nor in the establishment of a stock lending agreement entered into
with BIM in November 1989. He had not become involved in the agreement until
about August 1990.
The liquidators believed that pension fund assets had been charged under the
agreement as collateral for loans which, although ostensibly for the benefit
of BIM, had in fact gone to other Maxwell companies or interests.
Mr Haas was willing to answer written questions but objected to an
'oppressive' oral examination in which questions could be put ranging over
the whole of the operation of the stock lending agreement.
Mr Aldous suggested that the 'sole or predominant' purpose of the oral
examination was not to get Mr Hass's assistance about the agreement but 'to
seek to establish by admissions a case against a third party or the company
which employs him'.
Lehman had already provided an enormous amount of documents, Mr Aldous said.
It was estimated that since April 1 about 10,000 had been made available.
Mr John Brisby, counsel for the liquidators, said all questions that could
sensibly be dealt with in writing had been dealt with. 'We are now down to
the rump of things we say can only be dealt with by oral examination,' he
said.
The hearing continues today.

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Bush confident on Nafta progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush said yesterday, after a meeting in California with
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, that the US, Mexico and
Canada were in the final phase of negotiations on an agreement to establish
a North American free trade zone.
Speaking at a joint news conference in San Diego, Mr Bush said he and Mr
Salinas had told their trade negotiators to resume negotiations on the free
trade pact (Nafta) on July 25. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney also
planned to send his representative to that meeting, Mr Bush said.
This was by contrast with apparent prospects last week, when chief trade
negotiators of the US, Canada and Mexico held a marathon series of meetings
which ran till Saturday, but progress was slow.
US trade officials were reported to have said talks might last through
August or September.
The US Congress must be given at least 90 days' notice of the president's
intention to enter into a trade agreement. The upbeat tone from Mr Bush
yesterday, after his meeting with Mr Salinas, suggests that the leaders
could stage an attention-getting signature of the accord before the US
presidential election is held on November 3.
The two presidents are being lampooned on 50,000 baseball cards, distributed
by anti-Nafta groups, which show them wearing baseball uniforms with the
slogan: 'Don't let them throw you a curve (ball) - strike out Nafta.'
Mexico has agreed to open its oil sector to 'performance contracts,'
according to a report in the Mexican newspaper El Financiero.
Under such a contract, an independent oil driller is paid a premium if it
strikes oil. At present, Mexico only countenances 'service contracts' where
the driller is paid a flat fee irrespective of the oil found.
Mr George Baker of the University of California described the change in
Mexico's position as the most significant event in the history of Mexican
oil for 50 years.
This concession would be a compromise between the US insistence that the oil
sector be opened on a risk basis - where the successful driller assumes
ownership of part of the oil it finds - and Mexico's view that such an
opening would violate its nationalist constitution.
Many oil companies prefer to operate on a risk, or failing that, performance
basis, which gives them greater control over their operations.
Also on the agenda for the two presidents was a recent and controversial US
Supreme Court ruling, which upheld the kidnapping by US authorities of a
Mexican doctor they wanted to arrest.

<TEXT>
THE beer war between the US and Canada was intensified yesterday when
Washington demanded authorisation from the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade to retaliate against Canada for discriminating against imports of US
beer. The US said it was seeking to recoup damage to US brewers of about
Dollars 80m (Pounds 41.8m) a year.
A US complaint against discriminatory practices by state liquor boards in
Canada was upheld by a Gatt disputes panel last September. In April,
following earlier US threats of retaliation, the two sides said they had
reached agreement on giving US brewers easier access to the Canadian market.
At the meeting of Gatt's governing council yesterday, Washington accused
Canada of deliberately trying to circumvent the panel's findings.
The US is particularly angry about two practices by the province of Ontario
 -a beer pricing system by the monopoly state liquor board, which includes a
handling charge for imported beer, and a tax rise on non-refillable
containers for alcoholic drinks. Washington claims this discriminates
directly against US beer, which is imported mainly in cans, while most
Canadian beer is sold in refillable bottles.
Earlier, the Gatt council approved a six-month extension, till end-June
1993, of Mr Arthur Dunkel's term of office as director-general.

A SCOTTISH Office minister is to visit Taiwan in September to try to
persuade Taiwanese companies to bring inward investment projects to
Scotland, writes James Buxton.
Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish industry minister, will be the first minister
from a UK territorial ministry to visit Taiwan.
Mr Stewart's visit is being described as a private visit in response to a
Taiwanese invitation.
This procedure is used to avoid offending China and because the UK has no
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
No Taiwanese investments have yet been established in Scotland.
In November 1990, Delta Electronics, a manufacturer of power supply
equipment for electronic products, announced it was set up a plant at
Inchinnan near Glasgow which could eventually employ 570 people. However,
the project was subsequently frozen and is thought unlikely to be revived.
Mr Stewart, who is spending five days in Taiwan, said he did not expect his
visit would lead to immediate announcements of new projects.

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Passenger aircraft industry in tailspin /
Examining a rapid decline in values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WORLD glut of passenger aircraft is sending aircraft prices into a tail
spin and threatening the expansion plans of aircraft makers, airlines and
aircraft leasing companies.
Evidence for a slide in aircraft values is mounting. Earlier this year, a
one-year-old Boeing 737 was for sale at an asking price of about Pounds 27m.
The price seemed reasonable, considering it cost Pounds 30m when new. It
sold for less than Pounds 23m. That seller was desperate; most would rather
put their property into storage.
There are about 800 civil airliners parked on desert runways in the
southwestern US, safe from corrosion. They represent about 10 per cent of
the western world's passenger jet fleet, and at new prices, comprise about
Dollars 25bn (Pounds 13bn) of non-performing assets.
This makes bad reading for investors. The industry increasingly depends on
the financial sector to provide capital to buy aircraft. Failure of last
month's equity flotation by GPA Group, the world's largest aircraft leasing
company, was partly due to the soft market for used aircraft. GPA makes more
from selling aircraft it has owned for a few years than from leasing them.
Investors did not have to rely on anecdotal evidence. Apart from storing
aircraft, airlines have been trying to lease them. The result has been a
decline in lease rates.
The monthly payments for leasing a Boeing 737, the world's biggest-selling
passenger aircraft, are up to 22 per cent less than than a year ago,
according to Avmark, an Anglo-US aviation consultancy.
The effect is widespread: 67 of the 69 passenger aircraft types have seen
lease rates fall during the last year by up to 47 per cent.
The fall has steadied in recent weeks, according to the Los Angeles-based
International Lease Financing, the second biggest aircraft leaser after GPA.
'It could just be the summer season,' says Mr John Plueger, a senior
vice-president at the company.
If manufacturers have been under pressure to cut the price of new aircraft
in response to oversupply in the secondhand market, they are not showing it.
They have resisted price cuts on new aircraft, arguing that the apparently
unstoppable growth of air traffic determines pricing policies.
That growth ended last year; the first for decades to show a decline in
passenger numbers. Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell-Douglas, the companies which
dominate passenger aircraft sales, have found ways to help struggling
customers.
They are more accommodating when airlines request deferred delivery dates
and there is talk of special loans or other inducements.
'Aircraft manufacturers may now be forced to cut prices,' says Mr Keith
McMullan, of Avmark. 'Then they would have to concentrate more on production
economies on their current models rather than going for new models.'
The process has begun. Last month McDonnell-Douglas, the third biggest civil
aircraft maker, all but abandoned plans to build the MD-12, a 500-seater
designed to be the first of a new generation of ultra-large aircraft. In the
last few months, Airbus and Boeing have said they will be cutting jobs and
slowing production.
Strong airlines stand to benefit from the over-capacity among manufacturers.
Those in a position to buy will get lower prices and pay lower operating
charges. Weaker airlines may be locked into lease payments at older, higher
prices. They would have to compete with rivals paying less for newer
aircraft.
Weak and small airlines may also suffer from GPA's failed share offering.
They have used the buying power of GPA to cut the cost of aircraft and help
them compete with larger airlines. Without the proceeds from its share sale,
GPA may have to cancel some orders.
Last week, it announced that it had cancelled plans to buy-in its joint
venture companies to avoid bringing Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 640m) of extra
borrowings on to its balance sheet. Cancelled orders are more than simply a

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Trade explosion propels Mercosur towards
reality
</HEADLINE>

POLITICAL and economic instability in Brazil may yet scuttle attempts to
form a common market in South America, or at least delay the January 1 1995
deadline for implanting a single market, to be known as Mercosur and made up
of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
None the less, an explosion in trade, cross-border business links, falling
trade barriers and continuous advance in dull, but vital, regulatory
harmonisation is giving integration a dynamic of its own. Companies ranging
from multinationals to small local companies are assuming sooner or later
Mercosur will become a reality. This perception is in turn accelerating
integration.
Mr Jorge Bustamante, director of Merchant Bankers Asociados, a Buenos Aires
investment bank, says: 'The impact of Mercosur here will be dramatic.
(Brazil) may postpone matters, but people are taking Mercosur into account.'
The car industry began integrating operations in Brazil and Argentina in
1985. It is unlikely that Argentina's car industry could have survived
without access to Brazil's market. All big car and component industries in
the two countries are now integrating operations and sharing capacity.
Integration is becoming a question of life or death for smaller players. In
Argentina's industrial city of Cordoba, most companies have links with
Brazil. Georgalos, a chocolate maker, has linked with Brazil's Lacta to
exchange products and technology. Links between the two countries' service
industry, farmers and financial systems are also growing stronger.
These trends are reflected in the trade figures. In 1985, trade between the
four Mercosur countries added up to Dollars 3.82bn (Pounds 199m). By 1991,
trade was Dollars 10.60bn, accounting for 13 per cent of their total trade,
even though huge obstacles to trade still exist.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Name-dropper who haunts corporate Japan: The head of one of
Tokyo's credit information agencies is enjoying the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE polite words of warning come courtesy of Mr Eiji Tamaki: 'Please read
this letter. If you do not answer, your name will be registered on a
computer, and it will be difficult for you to get a loan, credit or a lease.
If you have already paid, please forgive us.'
Mr Tamaki's credit information and collection business, Consumer Credit
Clearance, is prospering in inverse proportion to the woes of corporate
Japan in these debt-burdened days.
Having built the company by studiously following the advice of a weathered
1959 US manual, Starting and Managing a Small Credit Base and Collection
Service, the effervescent Mr Tamaki has discovered that his time has come in
1990s Japan. New clients have increased by more than 20 per cent over the
past six months and Mr Tamaki smiles genially as he tells, with a blend of
wonderment and satisfaction, that his recent customers have included some of
Japan's better known companies.
'I can't tell you who they are. We have to be discreet in this business. But
I never thought these companies would come to me for help. As a matter of
face, they don't want to admit to these debt problems, but they can't wait
any longer.' Mr Tamaki also smiles broadly when suggesting that his birth in
1929, the year of the crash, destined him to a life in credit research. In
the late 1980s, Japanese banks, consumer credit companies, and department
stores were more intent on finding new clients than on checking
creditworthiness.
Those years of excess have returned to haunt financial institutions. Last
year, personal bankruptcies rose to 23,287 from 11,273 a year earlier, and
the liabilities of failed businesses jumped from Y1,996bn (Pounds 8.35bn) to
Y8,149bn. Banks are under extreme pressure to accept delayed payments from
troubled companies, whose property and securities collateral has evaporated
as magically as it appeared. These are fertile fields for debt collection,
but the mainstream industry's growth has been restricted by a general
awareness that debt collecting in Japan is done by the yakuza, or gangsters,
whose methods are less polite than Mr Tamaki's letters.
A spate of loan-sharking and strong-arm collecting by gangsters a decade ago
prompted the government to introduce the Consumer Lending Act, which
outlined acceptable methods of collection and redefined the boundaries for
Mr Tamaki's credit operations. 'People can see my hands. I have all my
fingers,' said Mr Tamaki, referring to the missing little finger that often
identifies gang members. Not long after its founding in 1969, CCC received
threats from gangs, which saw Mr Tamaki moving in on their territory, and he
still occasionally gets a call from a gangster type. 'We just give our
address and make clear to them that our office is directly opposite
Kojimachi police station.'
The legislation a decade ago limited collection for profit to lawyers, but
Mr Tamaki has got round that restriction by establishing a separate
'voluntary membership union' which takes fees of 30-40 per cent of money
recovered for its 5,000 members.
But Mr Tamaki's real achievement is building a data base that gives the
company leverage over the debtors of his client companies. There are four
other credit information companies, but by specialising in bad debts, CCC is
able to warn a delinquent consumer that he or she will soon be given a spot
on Japan's largest credit blacklist.
Having watched debts mount and companies crumble, Mr Tamaki is amazed at the
laxity of corporate Japan: 'Companies have just jumbled all their
uncollectable loans together and reported them as loan assets. They know
there are serious problems, but no one wants to take responsibility for
them.' A reason more companies are turning to CCC, he said, is that 'bubble
era' executives have retired or resigned and the new management is less
reluctant to highlight the sins of the past. One of those sins has been to
provide too much credit to consumers poorly educated in its dangers.
The non-profit Japan Credit Counselling Association assists consumers who
are tangled in credit. Small investors and shoppers have been left exposed
by the ebbing tide of the Japanese economy, as overtime payments have
fallen, and collateral (such as stock holdings and golf club memberships)
has collapsed.
Calls to the association rose from 2,929 in 1990 to 5,243 in the fiscal year
to the end of March. In the first quarter this year, there were 1,887
inquiries, with the average caller a young man or woman between 20 and 29
years owing a total of Y5m (Pounds 20,900) to 11 separate companies.
None of this is news to Mr Tamaki, who explained that the loan-sharking of a
decade ago generally claimed working-class victims, but the credit boom of
the late 1980s has left debts spread across society.
This trail of wreckage is often difficult to follow, as the counselling
association found that 27 per cent of bankrupts had moved house and only 31
per cent remained in the same job. Tracking down delinquent debtors has
always been part of Mr Tamaki's business, but the real growth is in
providing credit information to burned but wiser companies before they lend.
For CCC, the only problem is finding enough staff to deal with the new
demand.' We really are making money,' Mr Tamaki explained. 'But it is a bit
difficult to find young people who want to work in debt collection. People
still think it's only the business of the gangsters.'

<TEXT>
MR Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, is expected to set out a
package of measures designed to curb political violence and break the
stalemate in constitutional talks when he addresses an emergency session of
the United Nations security council tonight.
He will be among leading South African politicians, including Mr Nelson
Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), and Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the Inkatha Freedom party, to address the
session, which opens today.
Mr Botha is expected to elaborate on President F W de Klerk's recent
suggestion that international observers might have a role to play in efforts
to curb the violence that led to last month's ANC withdrawal from
constitutional talks.
The government is not expected to oppose Mr Mandela's call for a UN
representative to make a fact-finding visit to South Africa. But it is
likely to resist his suggestion that such a visit should be followed by
despatch of a UN mission to monitor violence, drawing a distinction between
a small group of observers and a large, more active UN force.
On the eve of the UN meeting, Mr de Klerk announced steps to meet some of
the ANC demands for resuming democracy talks. He promised to disband
controversial security force units which the ANC accuses of fomenting
violence.
Both sides have stressed the significance of the UN occasion, but from
different perspectives.
Government officials pointed out that what was once inconceivable has been
made possible overnight: leaders of homelands and black minority parties
have been given a platform at the UN. Their presence will be used to
underline Pretoria's argument that a post-apartheid constitution must
reflect the concerns and interests of black as well as white voters
concerned about minority rights.
For its part the ANC sees today's proceedings as an important step towards
direct international involvement in the South African crisis.
Meanwhile, efforts to avert industrial disruption continued as the South
African Co-ordinating Committee on Labour (Saccola), a body representing big
employers, distanced itself from reports claiming it had lent its weight to
key ANC demands, including the need for early moves towards an interim
government and elections for a constitution-making body.
The reports come amid efforts by Saccola and Cosatu, the trade union
grouping, to reach an agreement to head off next month's general strike. Mr
Bokkie Botha, Saccola chairman, said speculation about talks had created
'dangerously wrong impressions'.

The Indonesian military yesterday handed President Suharto the results of
its own investigation into the massacre of civilians in the disputed
territory of East Timor last year, writes William Keeling in Jakarta.
The report is likely to signal the government's determination to close the
incident which caused many international donors to express concern.
An earlier report organised by the government said about 50 people had been
killed in the incident, as against an estimate of up to 180 by independent
witnesses.
Most international donors, who meet in Paris this week to consider aid to
Indonesia for the year ahead, expressed their satisfaction with the first
report and are expected to pledge about Dollars 4.8bn to Indonesia, a
similar sum to last year.
Yesterday's report says that only 18 graves have been discovered. An armed
forces spokesman conceded, however, that some of the 66 people still missing
are believed dead.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF China's most hardline communist ideologues, Li Ximing, has made a
public statement strongly in favour of reform, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Li, who is party chief for Beijing, was quoted in an article which carried
his name in yesterday's Beijing Daily that economic change should be speeded
up along capitalist lines and that left-wing thinking should be resisted.
His statement echoes instructions issued recently by Deng Xiaoping, the
country's senior leader.
Western diplomats and Chinese observers have long viewed Li as an unashamed
Maoist and there had been suggestions in the capital that he would soon be
removed. He is a member of the Politburo and is seen as a close associate of
Li Peng, the prime minister.
His article, a lengthy report summarising a meeting of Beijing's Communist
party standing committee, is a signal that left-wingers fear Deng's campaign
is unstoppable.
Deng has said that those who do not support reform must step aside. One by
one, ideologues within the party have given support to Deng's policies. Li
is by far the most strident hardliner so far to step into line.
Diplomats say Deng's opponents have been weakened by the deaths over the
past few months of several leading communist traditionalists. They say the
opponents fear for their positions during a period of intense back-room
dealing at Communist party headquarters in the run-up to the crucial 14th
party congress later this year.
Separately, China's labour minister, Ruan Chongwu, warned that unemployment
will rise as the nation carries out economic reforms.

THE Clinton-Gore ticket, cruising to overwhelming endorsement by the
Democratic party this week, played to its strengths yesterday.
Mr Clinton's only scheduled public appearance was in front of the Democratic
women's political caucus, already potentially swelled by the addition of six
women candidates for the Senate, 34 for the House, and, as the prospective
nominee said, with the prospect of more to come.
The Arkansas governor laid out his feminist credentials. 'I am the grandson
of a working woman, the son of a single mother, the husband of a working
wife who earns far more than I and the father of a daughter who wants to
build space stations in the sky.' He added: 'I have learned that building up
women does not diminish men.'
Senator Al Gore took his commitment to the environment to a meeting of
environmentalists. President Bush's performance at the Rio Earth Summit,
which he had also attended, was 'a disgrace'.
At the convention, delegates early today approved a statement of policy
putting jobs and economic growth at the top of the party's agenda.

THE Rev. Jesse Jackson galvanised the Democratic convention early today with
an inspirational evocation of the party's close ties with organised labour,
while barely mentioning the two men who will head the presidential ticket in
November.
The black civil rights leader called in his address for America to be 'put
back to work', so as to reduce the totals of '10m unemployed, 25m receiving
food stamps, 25m in poverty and 40m with no health care'.
He called for US public funds to be diverted from defence, there being 'no
Russian empire to fight', and said there was 'hope in the world tonight'
because of the election in Israel of the new administration of Mr Yitzhak
Rabin.
Almost in passing, he urged the party to 'support the ticket', but his main
reference to Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore, the presumptive
presidential and vice-presidential candidates, was in the context of his
approval for their support of statehood for the District of Columbia.
Mr Jackson, as a non-voting representative in Congress of the District, is
keen on the mainly black area being allowed full voting rights.
Meanwhile, Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California, kept
fellow-Democrats in doubt over whether he would support Governor Clinton and
Senator Gore. Democratic party officials said Mr Brown, who won the backing
of 616 delegates during the primaries, had agreed to lend his support but a
spokesman for Mr Brown denied there had been any such agreement, saying the
Democrats were 'spinning political fluff'.
Mr Jim Desler, the party spokesman, said: 'Jerry Brown said that he would
work for a Democratic victory. The word 'endorsement' was never used.'

convention, Jurek Martin finds Bush-bashing to the fore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST night of an American political convention is the overture to the
work of the week, and the Democrats certainly sang it in harmony on Monday.
But not everybody belted it out with the same raucous vigour.
Take the lead tenor from New Jersey. There was a time when Bill Bradley
could hold an audience in Madison Square Garden in the palm of his hand on
any given evening.
That stopped 15 years ago. 'Bradley back in the Garden' - to quote the
buttons on every New Jersey delegate in sight - was not wearing basketball
sneakers and a number 24 shirt, but the dark suit and tie of a professional
politician increasingly regarded as the Democratic party's thoughtful
conscience and, albeit less widely, as its best presidential candidate - not
this year but before too long.
Senator Bradley's keynote address on Monday night showed him at his least,
and most, impressive. On the down side, one conclusion is safe. Rumour has
it that he has spent almost as many hours practising his public speaking as
he did his jump shot. If so, it was to much less effect.
The Garden did not hang on his every word, not in comparison to his
fellow-keynote speakers. Governor Zell Miller of Georgia, for example, had
them rocking in the aisles with his full-frontal assault on the Republican
opposition.
Yet even he paled into insignificance when the final act. Barbara Jordan,
black and now confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis, delivered a
soaring, cadenced civics lecture, in its way as memorable as the address she
gave in the same arena to the 1976 convention when a congresswoman from
Texas.
As a formal speaker, Mr Bradley still lacks the necessary attributes of
timing and delivery. He swallows his good lines and talks on when his
audience is applauding.
There are other considerations. First, one speech does not necessarily a
political summer or winter make. Mr Mario Cuomo gave a great one to the 1984
convention and is still only governor of New York; Governor Bill Clinton
delivered a terrible one to the 1988 convention and is about to be the
Democratic presidential nominee.
Second, there was, as ever, substance to the Bradley speech. The theme -
facing up to collective responsibilities rather than indulging in
'individual thrills' - is not new for him, but he is developing it all the
time. It is one that is not easily reduced to slogans.
'What we face is a crisis of meaning,' he said in one of his pithier
passages. 'Without meaning, there can be no hope; without hope there can be
no struggle, and without struggle there can be no personal betterment.
Individualism degenerates into greed without agreement on its limits. The
microchip may be faster than the human brain but it isn't connected to a
heart. A new drug might defeat a disease but it won't eradicate hatred.'
Or, again on a more hopeful note: 'It is sometimes said Americans lack a
sense of tragic life. It would be more correct to say that Americans are not
content to let tragedy have the last word. The United States is history's
greatest experiment in the elimination of despair.'
This is the sort of reflective philosophy that political conhear. Add to
them Barbara Jordan's reflections - the need for equality of sacrifice,
including social entitlement programmes, the impermissibility of racism, be
it black or white, and the imperative of valuing reason over emotion in
assessing character - and it cannot be said that the Democrats were sent
home to bed with nothing to think about.
The vague sense of dislocation is that this was not the intended dual theme
of the first night. One part of this was to be a lot of Bush-bashing, to
which Mr Bradley ponderously contributed. Perot-pulverising, however, was
much less in the score, though there was some of it from Governor Miller.
The Democrats have worked out that the Bush-Perot conflict helps them.
The other element was to demonstrate that this is no longer a party of
pot-smoking, draft-dodging subversives - not in living memory have its
delegates been presented with such an orgy of flag-waving patriotism,
derived from Republican choreography.
Emotions were wound up not, as in days of yore, by the haunting and
socially-conscious songs of Woody Guthrie (This Land is Your Land) and by
gospel choirs, but by a succession of marching and big bands straight out of
high school and Las Vegas floor shows. This was designed as a celebration of
America, marred only by the fact that a whole line of white tubas was
clearly emblazoned with the name of their Japanese manufacturer.
Dissent was also dismissed with Republican efficiency. When 600-odd
delegates began chanting 'let Jerry speak' on behalf of the former governor
of California, the other Brown, Ron, the party chairman, moved briskly to
other business. It will require an act of some magnanimity for the
Californian to be permitted to address the convention. Mr Nelson Mandela,
who is to speak tonight, was much easier to fit in at short notice.
Hardly a word was heard from the podium that might embarrass the party
nominee. Barbara Boxer, running for the Senate from California, got in a dig
at the free trade agreement with Mexico, which Mr Clinton basically
supports, and Mr David Dinkins, New York mayor, went further than Mr Clinton
in demanding that US cities be rebuilt before those in Russia.
But that was about it. Unless Mr Cuomo, who is to nominate Mr Clinton
tonight, publicly urges him to come clean and raise taxes, as he did on
television on Sunday, departure from the party line is not scripted.
The delegates responded to this new direction. They cheered at every
invocation of their national spirit and at every imprecation against the
Republicans. The Idaho delegation leader epitomised the spirit of the night
by declaring that he was from 'the state which knows how to spell potato'
(which Vice-President Dan Quayle does not).
In this mood, they might have expected something more rollicking from Bill
Bradley. When he talked, so did they, among themselves, which is standard
practice most of the time, but not necessarily in front of keynote speakers
in prime televised time. It took a Jordanesque gift of oratory to make them
listen.
It was indeed a first night which, for all that its target was
middle-America, was not without its subtle contradictions. Mr Clinton will
have to square them when he speaks before the final curtain.

FT  15 JUL 92 / PRI snatches victory from its own defeat / A look at Mexican
democracy after a PAN triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico has lost only
its second election for a governorship in more than 60 years - yet, for
President Carlos Salinas, the elections on Sunday could hardly have gone
better.
The party lost the northern border state of Chihuahua, but did so to the
conservative National Action Party (PAN). This should both strengthen the
government's democratic image and the faction in the PAN which is
conciliatory towards the PRI.
Furthermore, the PRI - in power nationally for 63 consecutive years -
appears to have defeated the left-leaning Party of Democratic Revolution
(PRD) for the governorship in Michoacan, home state of Mr Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the PRD's founder,
The government's plan, said Miguel Angel Granados Chapas, a political
commentator in La Jornada newspaper, has been to 'present Cardenas as an
unviable option for the 1994 presidential elections by showing him incapable
of leading his party to victory in his own state.'
This appears to have been accomplished. Also, the weekend results should
further widen the gulf between PAN and the PRD, an important government
objective over the past three years.
The electoral authorities report the PRI with 50.9 per cent of the vote in
Michoacan, against 34 per cent for the PRD, with 76 per cent of the vote
counted.
In Chihuahua, the PAN has 51 per cent, against 42 per cent for the PRI, with
56 per cent counted. Mr Francisco Barrio Terrazas has claimed the
governorship for the centre-right PAN, after alleging he was robbed of the
job after a 1986 election. Cheering Barrio supporters took to the streets
after the weekend election.
Even so, the way in which the PRI defeated the PRD in Michoacan casts doubt
on the government's commitment to a fairer, more open political system.
Frederico Reyes Heroles, editor of the respected political magazine Este
Pas, put it thus: 'The controlled media, illegitimate resources,
indiscriminate support, legislation and agencies - all under the thumb of
the executive and its officials - turn the (electoral) contests into
fiction.'
The PRD claims that the government party fiddled the electoral roll,
outspent it 50:1 and, through its control of the state's electoral
machinery, inflated its vote. Mr Ricardo Pascoe, PRD spokesman, described
the electoral process has 'fraught with irregularities'. The PRD is still
claiming victory, and post-electoral tension is expected.
Widespread fraud, characteristic of previous Mexican elections, did not
occur on Sunday, partly due to the government's tough new electoral law.
Many of the PRD's charges of fraud are by now little more than an automatic
response to its own weak electoral showing.
However, the party's central complaint that it had to compete 'against the
whole apparatus of the state' may have more validity. The PRI used money
from Solidarity, the government's anti-poverty campaign, to undercut support
for the opposition. Michoacan will receive the equivalent of Dollars 275m in
Solidarity money this year, three times the national average per head.
Solidarity's emblem of the national colours is almost indistinguishable from
that of the ruling party.
The campaign was one of the most expensive and sophisticated undertaken by
the government party, which set up a huge organisation of paid and voluntary
cadres, culminating in 72,000 vote-promoters, each of whom was expected to
deliver 10 votes on election day. Good performers were promised free
holidays.
The government tried to turn the campaign into a contest between their
pro-business candidate, Mr Eduardo Villasenor, and the PRD, in which it
succeeded in more ways than one. While he travelled in a borrowed
helicopter, or one of three aeroplanes, the PRD made do with three minivans,
and some Volkswagen Beetles. Almost without exception, the media in the
state supported Mr Villasenor, giving little coverage to the PRD.
President Salinas seems in no hurry to dismantle the apparatus that makes it
difficult to compete fairly with the government party. This month, he said
that he had made 'a cautious reform, no less profound, but careful in the
sense we are not going to provoke splits nor run the risk of breakages'.
The president, most analysts have now concluded, has decided to preserve the
PRI, not just because he fears damaging divisions, but because it has proved
very effective at winning elections.
The party is being reformed, with old corporate sectors being turned into
regional voluntary organisations. As Michoacan showed, greater emphasis on
regional, rather than corporate organisation, helps deliver the vote.
Because of the PAN victory in Chihuahua, it is easier for the president to
hold out against any radical reform. The conciliatory wing in charge of the
PAN has won two gubernatorial elections and been handed a third governorship
when fraud charges undermined a PRI victory in Guanajuato last year. As the
main beneficiary of selective democracy practised by the PRI, the leaders
may see no need to push for any stronger reform.
The government's fear that the opposition might unite in the 1994
presidential elections on an pro-democracy crusade has receded. Instead, the
opposition is likely to be divided, with the PAN celebrating its victory and
the PRD mulling over the now mandatory post-electoral protests.
The PRD will have to ponder its future. It has failed to win in its
stronghold, where Mr Cardenas won 64 per cent of the vote in 1988. If the
party's protests against electoral irregularities turn violent, the
government will portray it as a disruptive, dangerous force inimical to
change, further damaging its chances of recovery before 1994.

DO DEMOCRATS have more fun? If they don't, it's not for want of trying.
On Monday afternoon in New York, just as the party's convention was being
gavelled to order at Madison Square Garden, more than 500 of the 5,000
delegates seemed far more interested in making merry.
The scene was a huge white carnival tent beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, where
Senator John Breaux, a dapper good ol' boy from the bayou country of
Louisiana, found himself surrounded by beautiful blondes, carnival clowns in
pale blue satin and raucous bands that played pure Dixie, as the party
faithful attacked plates piled high with blackened catfish and crab
fritters.
The Brooklyn bash, just one of dozens of convention-related parties this
week, saw Governor Bill Clinton's army of supporters keenly intent on
imbibing an ocean of alcohol.
The music played, the sun bore down on the crowd, the din became a roar and
Brooklyn's borough president extolled the virtues of cheesecake, Coney
Island hot dogs and the Democratic party.
The party faithful, however, were busy in vigorous pursuit of the fun side
of 'Fun City'.
The 45-year-old Senator Breaux, neatly sidestepping oil industry lobbyists
and besotted delegates in Hawaiian shirts, addressed himself to the issue at
hand.
'You have to understand that we have raised fun to a new standard this week.
There's fun. There's a whole lotta fun. And then there's Louisiana fun. We
closed down the Tatou Club early this morning and we're still at it,' he
explained.
The ever-salacious New York Post newspaper was spot on, meanwhile, as its
three-inch headlines screamed PARTY TIME] and proceeded to tell the story of
how go-go dancers from a strip bar called Goldfingers shed their bikini tops
before cheering Democrats as they cruised around Madison Square Garden on a
flatbed truck.
The incessant partying, which was already under way at the weekend, took
delegates on a roller-coaster series of taxi rides from socially conscious
'minority' festivities in Harlem to funky gatherings in Greenwich Village,
from select soirees on the Upper East Side to dives on the Lower East Side.
The Tatou, a midtown night club where Mr Clinton recently played his
saxophone, was everybody's favourite. Less popular was the black-tie Texas
All-Star Gala on Sunday night at the trendy Supper Club in the theatre
district. 'The highlight of that event,' said one weary Congressional
staffer from Oklahoma, 'was getting out of there.'
While the rank and file guzzled beer, the well-heeled and well-connected
sipped champagne at the A-list events. Chief among these was party stalwart
Pamela Harriman's Waldorf Astoria function in honour of Bob Strauss, the
Democratic power broker turned Bush administration ambassador to Moscow.
Equally coveted was an invitation to the Dollars 1,000-a-ticket gathering at
Mayor David Dinkins's digs, starring newlyweds Senator Edward Kennedy and
Victoria Reggie, just in from Hyannisport.
Sandwiched between the elite and the street were the numerous cocktail
parties for state delegations. Mr Tom Udall, New Mexico's attorney-general,
explained why he was attending so many functions: 'The reason is to keep my
wife from shopping all the time.'

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS MAY be the year of the woman candidate in US politics, but not much has
changed for male candidates' wives.
The Democratic party has sought to use its convention in New York to
showcase its impressive roster of female candidates for this autumn's
elections, capitalising on the spreading belief that the white, male
homogeneity of US political institutions desperately needs a change.
A surge of interest in the issues of sexual harassment and abortion has
increased the focus on women candidates.
Sexual harassment moved to the top of the political agenda during the
challenge last year by Professor Anita Hill to the Supreme Court nomination
of Judge Clarence Thomas; it has been kept there by the continuing
investigation into assaults on women officers at a Navy pilots' convention.
Nor has attention on abortion faded after the Supreme Court's mixed decision
on the issue late last month.
On Monday, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, one of only two women with
the 98 men in the Senate, introduced some of her party's strongest
contenders for Senate elections in November: candidates such as Ms Lynn
Yeakel in Pennsylvania, Ms Barbara Boxer and Ms Dianne Feinstein in
California, and Ms Carol Moseley Braun in Illinois.
At the same time, though, Mrs Hillary Clinton was busy trying to fade into a
traditional, soft-focus pose as the wife of the Democratic party's
prospective presidential candidate.
Women candidates may be allowed minds and careers of their own, but Mrs
Clinton, who has both, wants voters to think first of her cookies.
She was accused of alienating traditional homemakers earlier this year with
a barbed remark about staying home and baking. Now, however, she is fighting
for the cookie vote in a bake-off against Mrs Barbara Bush, arranged by Good
Housekeeping magazine.
Mrs Clinton claims her recipe is more 'democratic' because it uses vegetable
shortening rather than butter, and is appealing to convention delegates,
through teeth that some observers describe as 'barely unclenched', to back
her in the contest.
It has not escaped the notice of some women delegates that there is a
certain incongruity between efforts to break one mould by bringing women
candidates to the fore, while pushing Mrs Clinton back into another.
Yesterday afternoon, however, she broke out of the mould with a rousing
political speech to the Democratic party national committee's black caucus,
in which she ranged from children's issues and education to civil rights.
She mentioned cookies once.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK faces 25% cut in rebate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission will today suggest a 25 per cent cut in real terms
in the valuable rebate the UK receives on its contributions to the EC
budget. This is assuming its own plans for a nearly one- third increase in
EC revenue under the Delors II budget proposal go ahead.
According to a document the Commission is to examine today, Brussels is
suggesting a cut in Britain's rebate from this year's level of 5 per cent of
the EC budget of Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 47bn) to 3.8 per cent in 1997.
The document notes, however, that a change in EC financing under Delors II
and bigger farm support payments under the Common Agricultural Policy
reforms would leave Britain's net financial position relatively unchanged.
Nevertheless, any sign of Commission tampering with the rebate, which the UK
won after an epic EC battle waged by former prime minister Baroness
Thatcher, is bound to stir political controversy among the Tory
Euro-sceptics.
And it could set the scene for fierce debate between the UK and its
partners. Germany, the EC's main paymaster which is baulking both at the
Commission's revenue plans, and at the UK rebate, is certain to argue for a
bigger cut in the rebate.
The document says the rebate has 'on average exceeded significantly what was
expected when the new system was put in place in 1988', under the 'Delors I'
package which runs out at the end of this year. For 1991, for example, the
1988 forecast was Ecu2.4bn and the outcome was Ecu3.5bn. The document says
the system is 'extremely lacking in transparency,' seemingly referring to
resentment by Britain's partners.
The UK won the rebate in 1984. The mechanism refunds to the UK two-thirds of
the gap between what it pays in and gets out of the EC budget, and has
returned a total of Pounds 12.5bn since 1985.
The British government has insisted it will veto any change in the rebate
system, and yesterday officials said its concern was to preserve the
mechanism used to calculate the refund.
The Commission believes its plans would give back the Ecu1bn cut in the
rebate through extra spending in the UK, which would bring down the refunded
amount anyway.
This is because the Delors II package would raise less revenue from VAT and
more from relative GNP, favouring the UK by an extra Ecu370m.
There would also be Ecu1.3bn more farm spending in the UK under already
agreed reforms to the CAP. The UK's small share of EC farm spending relative
to its contributions was one of the main original justifications for the
rebate.

FT  15 JUL 92 / EC launches second PVC cartel probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is again investigating an alleged cartel in the
European PVC industry, less than four years after fining 14 plastics
manufacturers for price-fixing.
Commission officials confirmed yesterday that some of the same companies
were implicated in the new investigation, which began last week with two
days of dawn raids across the Community.
The groups raided include Norsk Hydro, EVC, a joint venture between ICI and
Enichem, Elf-Atochem, Shell, Wacker Chimie, Huls and LVM. Officials said
this was 'a separate inquiry covering a separate period'.
The PVC market, like much of the commodity plastics sector, is highly
unprofitable at the moment. The industry supplies the depressed vehicle and
construction sectors and prices have declined steadily over the last 12
months. Manufacturing is a continuous process and stocks have been building
up throughout Europe.
The groups have been seeking ways of increasing margins and have taken every
opportunity to raise prices, although they have had difficulty avoiding
discounting. All deny collusion.
The first investigation began in January 1987 and ended in 1988 with the
Commission imposing fines of Ecu24m (Pounds 17m) on the 14 PVC-makers.
The chemicals companies given the largest fines were Solvay of Belgium
(Ecu3.5m), Elf-Atochem of France (Ecu3.2m), Enichem of Italy and Britain's
ICI (Ecu2.5m each), and Huls of Germany (Ecu2.2m).
The legality of those fines is still in question, however, following a
landmark ruling by the EC's lower judicial body in February. The Court of
First Instance annulled the fines on the grounds that the Commission had
broken its own internal rules.
Brussels is to appeal against the CFI ruling. Officials denied yesterday
that the new investigation was a reaction to the court's decision.
The European Commission has also opened an in-depth inquiry into the
proposed steel piping link-up between Mannesmannrohren-Werke and Hoesch of
Germany, in spite of the German cartel office's request to examine the deal
itself. It is the third time that Brussels' competition authorities have
overruled such a request from the Bundeskartellamt since new merger rules
came into force in 1990.
But the Berlin-based cartel office said yesterday it was happy that the
four-month inquiry had been opened and agreed that the Commission's merger
task force was better placed to assess the Community-wide impact of the
deal.

LITHUANIAN Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius, accused by his opponents of
bungling economic reform, was ousted by parliament yesterday in a vote of
no-confidence, Reuter reports from Vilnius.
Mr Vagnorius, a close ally of President Vytautas Landsbergis during the
struggle for independence from Moscow, blamed his downfall on ex-communists
whom he accused of trying to seize back power in Lithuania.
Pressure for his dismissal came largely from the majority leftist faction in
parliament, which accused him of failing to tackle acute economic problems.
His fall spells trouble for Mr Landsbergis, already rebuffed in attempts to
reform the system of government and create a strong executive presidency.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is likely to fail to conclude a standby
agreement with Russia because of a continuing lack of monetary control by
Moscow, international economists said yesterday.
The economists, mostly American, in Moscow this week for talks with
ministers, were told yesterday the budget deficit amounted to 20 per cent of
gross national product. This is roughly the same deficit as that run by of
the Soviet government last year before the collapse of the Union.
At the same time, private forecasts by government officials point to
Russia's inability to reduce significantly the deficit by the year end -
despite a pledge to the IMF that the deficit, net of all foreign assistance
or loans, will be brought down to 5 per cent by December.
This commitment, together with a promise to bring down inflation to 9-10 per
cent a month, was a condition of the granting of a first tranche of Dollars
1bn from the total proposed loan of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.5bn).
Economic policy makers in the west are discussing how western financial aid
can be continued without an IMF 'seal of approval' on Russian economic
reform. There remains strong political pressure in the west, though not in
Japan, to help Russia financially. But until now, the official position has
been that the IMF must take the lead.
Mr John Williamson of the Institute of International Economics in Washington
said that, given the figures on the deficit, 'the chances of the rest of the
IMF loan going through are very slight. In fact I would think it was wrong
of the IMF to lend money in face of what is now happening.'
Prof Richard Cooper of Harvard University said: 'I think after hearing these
figures it must be unlikely that you get an agreement now.'
But Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the senior government official in charge of
negotiations with the IMF, said: 'I would agree it would be unlikely if
these figures continued to be so bad. However, we have a good, tough budget
and I think we can stick to it and get the figures we agreed with the IMF.'
Mr Kagalovsky said the major problem was that of defining the 'rouble zone'
of former Soviet republics which will continue to use the rouble, against
those which decide to introduce their own currency. Mr Kagalovsky said: 'We
would be happy to see any country stay in the rouble zone, but if they do
they must follow the policy, produced in Moscow, by the (Russian) Central
Bank'.
In recent months, other republics, especially Ukraine, have created large
amounts of new rouble credits for enterprises, which the Russian central
bank must honour. Discussions on defining and disciplining the rouble zone
are under way within the Commonwealth of Independent States.

RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic
fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping
operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed
Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide
security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the
border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of
Tskhinvali.
But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four
civilians, underscoring the difficulties facing the operation.
The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former
Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of
bloodletting in ethnic clashes.
South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North
Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin. Hundreds of people have
been killed since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians.
The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet bands.
They will be joined later by a multi-ethnic force - Russians, Ukrainians,
Ossetians and other mountain peoples - under nominal command of North
Ossetian leaders.
Their mission is to form a barrier between the two sides, opening the way to
talks.

<TEXT>
MR Milan Panic, a US businessman born in Belgrade, was sworn in as premier
of Yugoslavia yesterday, after pledging to end the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina
and take control of the military.
Mr Panic said he would act as his own defence minister, but it was unclear
if he would have enough power to effect his proposed plan to 'call for an
immediate ceasefire and the demilitarisation of Bosnia'.
The new prime minister, who promised to bring democracy to Yugoslavia, is
now on a collision course with Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, who
backs Serb forces fighting in Bosnia and appears to support a command
economy.
Mr Panic said his government had four aims: to stop the war and bring
lasting peace to Bosnia, create conditions for a multi-ethnic,
multi-religious society, introduce freedom of the press, and revive the
economy.
He called for the disarming of all forces in the republic under UN auspices.
Saying he respected Bosnian independence, he urged re-estab lishment of
transport, communications and postal connections.
The parliament, dominated by Socialist (former Commu nist) deputies, who
endorsed his candidacy by a vote of 99-33, gave Mr Panic, 62, a mixed
reception. Some deputies attacked him for 'lack of patriotism'. The ruling
Socialists have repeatedly attacked opposition leaders as traitors to
Serbia. Mr Panic stressed he was a patriot.
He called for a financial stabilisation programme, saying he would 'devote
80 per cent of his efforts to getting the UN sanctions lifted. The
already-flagging Serbian economy has been hard hit by the sanctions, imposed
on May 31.
The appointment as minister of justice of Mr Tibor Varady, an ethnic
Hungarian, was seen as Mr Panic's gesture of conciliation towards Serbia's
ethnic minorities. He also said a cabinet position would be set up for
ethnic minorities. Serbs make up 67 per cent of the republic's 9m
population.
Mr Panic was appointed by Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Serbian writer-president of
the unrecognised Yugoslavia. Mr Cosic, viewed as the spiritual father of all
Serbs, told the federal parliament: 'The government's task would be to
change an ideological state and society into a democratic one of free
people'; he appealed for tolerance.
Mr Milosevic gravely listened to the prime minister's calls for rapid
privatisation and democratic transformation. The opposition and university
students have called for the resignation of Mr Milosevic.
Borba, the Belgrade daily, has reported that Mr Milosevic is thinking of
resigning. Diplomats said Mr Panic's call for early elections in November
could offer the Serbian president a graceful exit by declaring he would not
stand then. But the still-popular Mr Milosevic, has not yet showed any sign
of quitting.
A western diplomat said Mr Panic may lack the key instruments to bring about
change in Yugoslavia. 'He will face enormous obstacles. He is a businessman,
not a politician, who has dropped into a snake pit'.

THOUSANDS of distraught refugees are expected to gather at central European
borders following Croatia's refusal to take any more people fleeing the war
in Bosnia-Hercegovina, a United Nations relief official said yesterday.
'We are very concerned about the situation ..I think you could have
thousands of refugees in emotional situations piling up at the borders,'
said Mr Laurens Jolles, legal officer at the Belgrade branch of the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees.
Refugees from the war in Bosnia, which has killed at least 7,500 people and
left thousands more missing, have flooded into Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia,
Austria and Hungary. Tens of thousands more remain trapped in Bosnia by the
fighting.
The UNHCR says that more than 2.2m people have been driven from their homes,
with over 1.7m seeking refuge within the frontiers of the former Yugoslavia,
and 500,000 distributed around other European countries.
Croatia said on Monday it was on the verge of collapse, overwhelmed by the
nearly 580,000 people who had sought refuge there from fighting in Bosnia
and from within Croatia. It said the border with Bosnia would not be closed
but that all new arrivals would be transported directly to the borders of
its northern neighbours.
'Foreign countries are not willing to open their borders and want to turn
Croatia into a refugee centre,' the government said. 'There is not enough
understanding or help from the international community.'
Croatia's inland cities and coastal resorts have been overrun by displaced
people and tent settlements have sprouted in several parts of the former
Yugoslav republic.
The government said refugee camps would now serve only as transit centres
and that the new ruling would be enforced by the interior ministry.
UNHCR officials said neighbouring countries, not only Croatia and Serbia,
should share the burden of the refugee exodus.
Mr Peter Kessler, the UNHCR spokesman in Sarajevo, said: 'We regret the
(Croatian) decision but at the same time there was literally a flood of
people.' He added: 'There is still a lot of troop activity throughout
Bosnia. People do not feel secure. Those who choose to stay behind find
themselves facing persecution.'
Serb forces, which control more than half of Bosnian territory, are driving
out Moslems from eastern Bosnia in a policy of 'ethnic cleansing'.
Hungary reacted last night to the Croatian decision by barring entry to
Bosnians travelling through Croatia. 'The Geneva Convention says refugees
should be accommodated in the neighbouring country, and the neighbouring
countries in this case are Serbia and Croatia, not Hungary,' a government
spokesman said.
Since the start of July, about 2,000 Bosnians have arrived in Hungary,
taking the refugee total from the conflict to 54,000.
Many of the recent arrivals said they were forced out of their homes by Serb
militiamen, given fresh Yugoslav passports and put on trains to be dumped in
Hungary.
The Hungarian authorities fear a new wave of refugees as the Serbian transit
camp on the deportation route in Vojvodina is reported to be full.
In Austria, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky urged other European countries to
take refugees.
Austria is giving shelter to about 50,000 refugees from the fighting. It has
introduced visa requirements for fugitives from Serbia and Montenegro, but
is allowing in without visas Bosnians from areas suffering from the Serbian
onslaught.
Mr Ivan Jarnak, of the Croatian interior ministry, plans to visit Vienna
today to discuss the Croat measure. Austria is hosting a meeting of seven
central European heads of government tomorrow to discuss the deteriorating
refugee position.
The other main host countries for the refugees are Germany, which has an
estimated 200,000, Switzerland with about 40,000, and Sweden with the same
number.
Mr Heinz Schoni, of Switzerland's Office of the Delegate for Refugees, said
there were 'tens of thousands' of displaced people from the former
Yugoslavia in Switzerland but the government did not have precise figures
because they do not usually apply for asylum.
Normally, they join relatives already living there. About 10,000 people have
asked officially for asylum, mostly ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
Switzerland has also issued 30,000 visas to citizens of the former
Yugoslavia since January when visas became compulsory. Everyone from Bosnia
may stay, even if their visas have expired. Croatians are supposed to return
but those from badly destroyed areas have been given a temporary reprieve.
Serbians are required to leave, with the exception of army deserters and
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
'We have not closed our frontiers,' said Mr Schoni. 'We have one of the
biggest groups of displaced Yugoslavs in Europe.'
In Sweden, three-quarters of the refugees who have entered this year are
ethnic Albanians from the province of Kosovo in Serbia, many of whom have
travelled via Poland. However, half the inflow over the past month have been
from Bosnia-Hercegovina.
There was speculation yesterday that Croatia was directing Bosnians towards
its neighbours in an effort to influence international opinion.
A European diplomat in Belgrade said: 'Croatia made the move to call world
attention to the crisis. There is also a tremendous problem in Serbia which
will only increase with the UN sanctions.'

FT  15 JUL 92 / London talks 'last chance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE leader of Bosnia's Serbs, Mr Radovan Karadzic, yesterday said
EC-sponsored talks due to open in London today could be the last chance for
peace and called on the United Nations to police a green line between the
warring factions, Reuter reports.
Mr Karadzic blamed Bosnian Moslem leaders for violating ceasefires in
Sarajevo but said he was willing to meet them and Croatian leaders at the
talks in London. He hoped the talks would achieve 'an unconditional
ceasefire - then let us talk for 10 months if it is necessary, but without
any more killing.'
Mr Karadzic said he would welcome more UN monitors or peace-keeping forces
to police all of Sarajevo, not just the airport where they are now, and to
separate the warring forces. 'I would like the (UN) mandate . . . for the
whole area of the city of Sarajevo and . . . I would suggest a green line
between the sides in the conflict,' he said.
He said he believed that all sides to the conflict might now understand that
there could be no winners. 'I do hope that all three sides are aware that
this may be the last chance for peace.'
Mr Karadzic hoped the EC talks would lead to a formal resumption of the
peace negotiations suspended in May by Bosnia's Moslem leaders in protest at
a Serb mortar attack in Sarajevo which killed 16 people and injured 110.
British officials said yesterday that Lord Carrington would have separate
talks with Mr Karadzic, Bosnian foreign minister Haris Silajdzic, and Mr
Marte Boban, a leader of Bosnia's Croat community.
Peace talks that Lord Carrington held in Sarajevo earlier this month failed
and were followed by one of the worst upsurges in fighting since the siege
of the city began.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Bundesbank policy wins OECD support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S hardline interest rate policy has won unconditional backing from
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The Bundesbank should keep rates high for as long as necessary to bring
inflation down to the target range of 2 per cent or less, the Paris-based
institution says in its latest economic survey.
Meanwhile, it adds, there is no need for action to counter recent rapid
expansion of German money supply.
The report, released conveniently to feature in the media one day before the
independent central bank's council is due to review its monetary targets,
will further demoralise European Community members lobbying for German
interest rate cuts to help them out of recession.
It could also undermine the position of bank council members such as Mr
Lothar Muller, president of the Bavarian state bank, who are lobbying hard
for tighter monetary controls.
The Bundesbank itself sent out further signals yesterday that it will not be
hustled by complaining European Monetary System (EMS) partners into relaxing
its interest rates stance.
It was understandable that others might want lower interest rates, the bank
said in its latest monthly report, but it did not follow that the use of
'suitable counter-measures' should be hindered in countries facing
'intolerable' price inflation.
The bank was maintaining its position in the interests of Europe, the report
claimed. The D-Mark was the anchor of the EMS and any weakening of its
stability standards would make the conditions for economic and monetary
union more difficult to achieve in several countries.
Money supply figures for May, confirmed without comment yesterday in the
Bundesbank report, show the broad M3 measure growing at 9 per cent
year-on-year, compared with the target range of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per
cent.
'A temporary above-target monetary expansion would not seem to call for
further tightening of monetary conditions, but there should be no let-up in
the pursuit of lower inflation, even if this means high interest rates for a
prolonged period,' the OECD survey says.
To paraphrase the report's delicate language, it says that, since
reconstruction of the wrecked eastern economy has increased calls on every
conceivable west German resource, it is hardly surprising that money is in
demand.
There is also evidence of D-Mark hoarding and demand from neighbouring
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, where the hardest currency in Europe is
widely preferred to the softer local alternatives.
Meanwhile, it adds, the interest rates screw must be held down until
inflation rates respond.
Inflation in western Germany will fall from 4.3 per cent now to between 3
per cent and 3.5 per cent in the second half of this year, it adds.
A scheduled one point increase in value added tax to 15 per cent next
January is expected to push the rate up another 0.5 per cent.
There is also a risk that instead of absorbing cost pressures, companies
will pass them on through price rises, further fuelling upward movement. 'In
such a scenario, the scope for reduction of interest rates would be more
limited and the upturn of economic activity weaker than in the present
projection,' the report says.
However, if more high wage deals and the temptation to pass on cost rises
are avoided, inflation could be down to around 2.75 per cent by the end of
next year.
Making no mention of the impact of the maintenance of existing high rates on
Germany's partners in the European Monetary System - Bundesbank policy has
been under persistent fire as the main dampening influence on attempts to
break out of recession - the report focuses solely on domestic challenges.
The OECD expects western gross national product (GNP) to grow 1.3 per cent
this year - compared with most expect-ations of around 1 per cent  - and 2.3
per cent in 1993. In the east, GNP should rise 7.5 per cent in 1992 and 9
per cent next year.
It notes that government and Bundesbank policies seem set to support a more
sustainable growth rate than in the post-unification boom. Most expansion
will come from increased exports.
Internal demand will be dampened by the impending VAT increase. High
interest rates, lower company profits and sub-potential growth will reduce
investment in the west. These factors, coupled with low growth in import
prices, will also help cut inflation.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Italy extends privatisation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government's privatisation plans are more sweeping than first
announced, according to Prof Guiseppe Guarino, the new industry minister.
The government has set no limit on the shareholdings in individual companies
that can be sold to private investors, he told the Financial Times
yesterday. But the government is limiting to 45 per cent the stakes to be
sold off in two special holdings - containing the assets of the state
industrial and financial entities brought under the wing of the Treasury as
a result of last Friday's emergency budget.
'Since last Friday, we are now thinking differently,' he said. The public
sector deficit meant the state could not bail out industry and even if it
could this was against Italy's commitments to the EC, he added.
As at Monday, the following concerns have come under the control of the
Treasury and have become joint stock companies; IRI, the main state holding
company; ENI, the state oil company; ENEL, the electricity authority; and
INA, the insurance institute. IRI, ENI and ENEL employ 650,000 people and
have a combined turnover of nearly L160,000bn (Pounds 70.3bn), with debts
close to L80,000bn.
The Treasury under Mr Piero Barucci, a former banker, will be responsible
for financial control and the Ministry of Industry for industrial strategy.
However, the team co-ordinating privatisation includes the Christian
Democrat and former finance minister, Mr Giovanni Goria, and Prof Franco
Reviglio at the budget ministry. Mr Reviglio is a former finance minister
and head of ENI.
Within the next two weeks the government will create two 'mother holdings'.
These will combine the four joint stock companies plus the Treasury's
holdings in the commercial bank, BNL, and the banking and finance group,
IMI. It will be decided this week whether the holdings will be divided
between industry and financial interests.
Much depends on whether IRI's controlling interests in the banks Comit,
Banca di Roma and Crediop are hived off. But the aim is to have the total
assets, provisionally estimated at L60,000bn, in broadly similar quantities
in each of the two holdings. Prof Guarino insists they will be debt free but
it has yet to decide how to treat existing liabilities.
Before the end of 1992, the two new holdings will issue bonds to be
underwritten by a consortium of banks. These should be convertible into
shares with tax incentives on a sliding scale. Private stakes in the
holdings will be limited to 45 per cent.
But Prof Guarino insists there is no limit on the percentage of shares to be
sold in subsidiaries. This will be determined by the companies themselves. A
possible administrator of the two 'mother holdings' is Prof Romano Prodi,
former head of IRI but the government recognises the private sector will be
sceptical as long as the state keeps a controlling interest.
Prof Guarino accepts that many of the state companies are under-capitalised.
and fresh capital can only come from the domestic and international markets.
A significant constraint will be the ability of the domestic market to
absorb some L12,000bn a year of privatisations.
The heads of IRI, ENI and ENEL have welcomed the measures, although
previously strong supporters of public sector enterprise. If market criteria
are to prevail it is unlikely that the politicised boards of the companies
can remain as before. The boards have also reflected the dictates of the
main political parties. Unlike previous industry ministers, Prof Guarino
rejects the idea of strategic sectors. He says the single European market
and increased competition have rendered this outdated.
In a remarkable turnround for a government which previously viewed Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, as a scourge, Prof Guarino claims:
'We ought to be thankful to Mr Brittan because he has made us realise we
have to change'.

FT  15 JUL 92 / De Michelis faces corruption probe
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gianni De Michelis, foreign minister in Italy's previous Andreotti
government, has been placed under investigation for alleged corruption,
Venice magistrates announced yesterday.
Mr De Michelis is the leading Socialist figure in the Veneto region and the
magistrates' move follows an inquiry into alleged rigged contracts and
illegal financing of political parties.
Mr De Michelis last night vowed to defend himself vigorously.
On July 6, Mr Giorgio Casadei, a key aide of the former foreign minister in
the Veneto, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of alleged corruption
relating to contracts at Venice airport and an autostrada extension.
The magistrates must now decide whether to ask parliament to waive immunity
on Mr De Michelis, who took over as deputy leader of the Socialist party
last month when Professor Giuliano Amato was chosen to be prime minister.
The Venice magistrates' investigations follow similar lines of inquiry to
those of the Milan municipal corruption scandal.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Rail white paper paves way for gradual sell-off: BR split in
two under 'radical changes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WHITE PAPER on the future of British Rail yesterday paved the way for a
step-by-step privatisation starting as early as next summer.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the proposals comprised the
most radical changes to Britain's railways since nationalisation in 1948.
However, the 21-page document set out only the basic framework of a process
which seems likely to leave BR in charge of much of the passenger railway to
the end of the decade and beyond.
Mr MacGregor said it was impossible to predict when privatisation would be
complete but confirmed that it would not be within the five-year lifetime of
the present parliament.
The white paper was due to have appeared in December but became bogged down
in embarrassing ministerial differences about the best way to proceed.
The result is a watered-down version of the proposals first put forward by
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the previous transport secretary, and containing little
detail about how the privatisation goals are to be achieved.
The biggest immediate change is unlikely to be perceived by passengers. BR
will be split into two, with one part owning the tracks, and the other
running the trains.
The government will then attempt to privatise the train services. However,
only the freight services will be sold outright: the passenger services will
be contracted out under franchise.
The white paper gives few details about how or when the franchises will be
offered. Mr MacGregor said that there would be 30 to 40 of them, and that
franchising would be carried out 'flexibly and progressively.'
Legislation paving the way for the changes will be introduced in November.
If royal assent is obtained the following summer, the first freight services
could be privatised almost immediately, but the first passenger services are
unlikely to be franchised before spring 1994.
The white paper also provides for the private sector to get involved in
running stations. Some might be rented to franchisees, it says, and the
government may also be prepared to consider other selling or leasing
arrangements 'provided that the interests of operators and passengers using
them are protected'.
Would-be train operators reacted with interest to the proposals, although
most will want to see how much BR proposes to charge for the use of its
tracks before pursuing the idea.
The white paper was also welcomed by Tory MPs, although some qualified their
enthusiasm with reservations about the time the benefits would take to show.
But Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, predicted a contraction
in rail services, saying the white paper was 'ripe for exploitation by
property speculators, route operators bribed by public subsidies, and
inevitably by the Tories' City friends'.
Although the proposals are much less radical than BR had at one time feared,
they were given a muted response by Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman. He said it
was the government's job to determine policy, and BR's job to manage. 'We
believe we have got something we can manage.'
The TUC attacked the proposals, saying the white paper would 'shunt BR into
the sidings of further decline and neglect'.
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the move but said it was
important that improvements to the network were not abandoned.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Perot poll campaign shows signs of growing disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Democrats and Republicans are openly speculating that Mr Ross Perot
will not launch his independent run for the US presidency, amid growing
signs of disarray in the Texan billionaire's camp.
Mr Perot might pull out now that his prospective campaign has run into
controversy and lost momentum, according to Governor Ann Richards of Texas
and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, both Democrats, and Mr Bill Bennett,
the Republican former secretary of education.
Several newspapers reported from Dallas yesterday that Mr Hamilton Jordan,
who ran the successful Carter campaign in 1976, was threatening to resign as
an adviser because Mr Perot was refusing to listen to his advice.
Mr Jordan denied the reports. But Mr Ed Rollins, the Republican political
expert recruited at the same time as Mr Jordan, confirmed there had been
'internal dissension' last week when Mr Perot summarily dispensed with the
services of an advertising consultant recommended by both of them.
Mr Perot opted instead to use an old Texas colleague with little experience
in politics.
Mr Perot also lost the potential support of a prominent Democrat yesterday
when Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia endorsed Mr Bill Clinton, who is
due to be formally nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate
tonight.
There had been a spate of well-founded rumours that Mr Perot was considering
offering Mr Wilder, who withdrew from the Democratic race early in the year,
the number two spot on his ticket.
The Perot bandwagon has slowed. The opinion polls, which had him ahead of
both President George Bush and Mr Clinton last month, now mostly put him in
second or third place. The decline is not as fast as his rise, but a poll
published yesterday had him down to 24 per cent, with Mr Clinton on nearly
35 per cent and Mr Bush on 31.
Mr Perot is increasingly viewed in a negative light, mostly because of the
lack of specifics behind his populist ideas.
Last weekend, he appeared to demean a black political audience by referring
to 'you people'. This received such critical coverage that he is understood
to have personally complained to CNN, the network on which he has promoted
his own cause.
Mr Perot has left himself with an exit should he choose not to run. He has
always said it would require successful petitions to put his name on the
ballot in every state before he would answer the call.
This has been achieved in more than 20 states. The last filing deadlines in
some states are not reached until September.
It had been thought he might wait another month for his formal declaration,
seeking to highlight the popular appeal of the registration drive. Policy
positions were also expected to stay under wraps until then.
Mr Bennett, an outspoken conservative who himself recently turned down an
invitation to become co-chairman of the Bush campaign, said he hoped Mr
Perot would stay in the race because his presence would most hurt the
Democratic presidential candidate.
However, the Democratic party believes that the core Perot support is
heavily Republican.
It is also concentrated in the south-western and western states which have
voted republican in most recent presidential elections.
The rise in Mr Clinton's popularity is seen in part as a reflection of
public disaffection with the acerbic Bush-Perot rivalry.
At present it suits the Democrats to have Mr Perot remain in the game, as a
diminished but still consequential force.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Major predicts recovery in second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR threw his weight behind predictions of economic recovery in
the second half of this year in spite of new evidence yesterday that his
election victory had failed to spur growth.
Answering Mr Neil Kinnock on his last appearance as Labour leader at prime
minister's question time, Mr Major told MPs that both the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the independent
London Business School had forecast recovery from the second quarter of this
year. 'We share that view', the prime minister said.
However, official industrial production figures for May and the latest
quarterly business confidence survey from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business
information group, painted a bleak picture of the economy.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet said weak retail and construction activity and the burden
of bad debts on companies had dashed the hopes of full recovery this year.
'There is now no certainty of the recovery getting fully under way before
1993,' said Mr Philip Mellor, D&amp;B's marketing manager.
The Central Statistical Office reported a 0.6 per cent drop in manufacturing
output in May, and a 0.4 per cent decline in overall industrial production
in the March to May period compared with the three months to the end of
February.
Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist with Warburg Securities in London, said
the figures suggested that the UK economy was stuck in recession for the
eighth successive quarter.
'The UK will be hard pressed to record unchanged output in the second
quarter', he said.
Amid sharp exchanges in the House of Commons over the recession, the prime
minister rejected opposition charges that the economy was at risk of sliding
into a 1930s-style slump.
He said the ingredients for recovery - rising exports, increasing car sales
and falling producer price inflation - were already in place.
'It will be a recovery based on a rate of inflation that's far lower than
anyone in this House predicted it would be 18 months ago and it's from that
basis that we will get the growth we would all wish to see,' Mr Major added.
The prime minister's comments came as Downing Street made clear that the
government's commitment to sterling's parity in the European exchange rate
mechanism was '100 per cent'.
Senior officials said it remained far from certain that the German
Bundesbank would increase the strains in the exchange rate mechanism by
raising interest rates tomorrow.
Mr Major was ready to order an increase in UK borrowing costs if that was
needed to support the pound, officials added.
The government's repeated support for the ERM and the UK central rate of
DM2.95 appeared to bear some fruit yesterday. Although the pound closed
lower in London against a generally stronger dollar - finishing at Dollars
1.913 against Dollars 1.9295 - it lost only   1/4 pfennig against the
D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.85 after at one point hitting a low of
DM2.8464. In late New York trading it was quoted at DM2.8502.

FT  15 JUL 92 / 'No' vote by French would split EC, warns Mitterrand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FRENCH vote against the Maastricht Treaty in the September 20 referendum
would break up the European Community, President Francois Mitterrand warned
yesterday.
A French 'no' vote to European union 'would break Europe, because there
would be no more impulse', Mr Mitterrand told a television interviewer
during the annual Bastille day celebration. 'It would put an end to 45 years
of French foreign policy . . . A French refusal would seem like a negation
of everything.' France's position was decisive, because 'it had a driving
role' in European construction.
The passion with which a normally cool Mr Mitterrand pleaded for Europe
yesterday reflects the rising political temperature in France as the
pre-referendum campaign gets under way.
On the surface, the government need not worry, because opinion polls suggest
60 per cent are in favour of Maastricht, compared with 40 per cent against.
Yet French opinion can be very volatile and the government is anxious the
electorate should not misuse the referendum to vote against Mr Mitterrand,
whose popularity is at a low ebb.
'I have never said that if you vote for Europe, you vote for me . . . I am
not concerned in this affair, neither with the yes nor with the no,' he said
yesterday.
Mr Mitterrand also attempted yesterday to mollify truckers and farmers,
whose recent protests against government decisions have been mingled with
anti-European feeling. He understood truckers' tough conditions and farmers'
fear of falling prices and accepted the right to demonstrate. Yet 'the state
had to make itself obeyed,' he explained, in reply to a question over the
use of force to shift roadblocks.
Because of the Maastricht vote, Mr Mitterrand suggested it was unlikely he
would hold a referendum this year on plans for constitutional reform. In
November, he said these could give the French parliament extra powers,
reduce the seven-year presidential mandate and introduce an element of
proportional representation into general elections.

</HEADLINE>

   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SQUEEZE combined with bargain hunting helped stock index futures end sharply
ahead after an initial retreat, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the FT-SE futures contract for September delivery opened at 2,480
and quickly went into retreat, falling to 2,472 within minutes of the
opening. Independent traders were the main sellers, which also had the
effect of leading the underlying cash market lower.
But a feeling that September had been oversold, together with the
independent traders moving to cover short positions, not only caused a
turnround but led to a squeeze, sending the contract strongly forward.
The release of poor UK economic data had no effect and was followed by a
quiet period of sideways trading over the lunch time period before buyers
returned to send the contract to a strong finish.
September closed at 2,509, up 17 from Monday's close and around 10 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Volume reached
6,429 lots.
In traded options, turnover improved to reach 25,005, up from 20,613 the
previous day. A large part of the day's business was in the FT-SE 100 option
ahead of Friday's expiry. Volume in the index option totalled 13,284 lots.
The Euro FT-SE traded 1,433 contracts. Business in the stock options was
dull. BAe was the most actively traded, with a day's total of 900 contracts.
This was followed by Courtalds on 891 lots.

FT  15 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome tension increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY continued over the price likely to be set for the issue of 330m
Wellcome shares by Wellcome Trust, the medical charity which holds 73.5 per
cent of the equity. There is a growing feeling in the market that the issue
price will be around 850p when the tendering for shares ends on July 24.
Observers said bear raiders have brought the share price down to a level
regarded as more appropriate by the market and institutions. Yesterday, the
stock eased a penny to 877p and traders expect the shares to remain in a
tight trading range during this account. Institutional investors are said to
be bidding for the issue at a 2 to 3 per cent discount to the market price.
Some said the discount could be as high as 5 per cent, implying a strike
price around 835p.
A strike price of 850p would allow the stags to buy the issue, so as to sell
again when trading starts. This prospect would disappoint Wellcome, which
had hoped that using a tender process rather than the traditional discounted
price method would allow a fair market value to be established. However, the
company is believed to be satisfied with the level of interest in the UK.
Properties bounce
The bounce in the stock market was mirrored in the maligned property sector,
which has hit a 30-year relative low, according to securities house UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew. On this evidence, selected stocks seemed to find a floor
yesterday as UBS, among others, advised clients to buy. British Land put on
8 to 183p, MEPC 3 to 261p and Slough Estates 11 to 136p in busy turnover in
the normally neglected sector.
Property issues have underperformed the market by 25 per cent this year
alone, with falling asset and land values, together with declining rental
returns, and well-publicised crashes, all adding to investor unease. The
sector relative now stands at 49.9, the first time it has gone below 50
since the FT-Actuaries Indices were first published just over 30 years ago.
Fresh evidence of the hill that share prices have to climb also emerged
yesterday, the Richard Ellis Monthly Index showing a near-16 per cent fall
in rental values to June 1992, including the biggest monthly fall recorded -
2.4 per cent - in June alone.
Reuters strong
News and information organisation Reuters climbed 28 to 1169p as buyers
moved in ahead of half-year results due next Tuesday. US investment bank
Goldman Sachs was said to be buying heavily.
Upgrading the group, Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite forecast
profits of around Pounds 190m, against Pounds 170m previously, and said the
company's cash holdings are likely to have grown to around Pounds 650m from
Pounds 500m. He also forecast dividend growth of about 15 per cent.
He added: 'The two new trading products, Dealing 2000-2 and Globex, are
technical successes. Around 83 per cent of Reuters' revenue is outside the
UK, so it is relatively unaffected by national recessionary worries. The
stock feels very firm and it could easily return to the 1200p level.'
L &amp; G upset
Disappointing new business figures for the first half of the year from Legal
&amp; General, the UK's third largest life assurance group by market
capitalisation, saw the shares slide in an otherwise firm life sector.
The stock has underperformed the life sector in recent weeks as the market
anticipated poor new business numbers and some analysts cast doubts on hopes
of an increase in the dividend this year.
There is also concern in the market about continuing problems in the
mortgage indemnity business, which left L &amp; G with a Pounds 121m
underwriting loss in 1991. The shares slipped 8 to 346p in 2.2m turnover.
British Petroleum was in the vanguard of the market's rally. The shares at
first fell below the 200p mark, and then stabilised before driving ahead in
the wake of determined US buying interest.
Aiding the recovery was a positive note by County NatWest. The broker said
that much of the bad news has now occurred, with oil prices down and
analysts' profits estimates sharply reduced.
The broker also noted that the market had probably factored in a 50 per cent
cut in the dividend, and it anticipated a 40 per cent reduction. County said
that for once Shell Transport 'looks more vulnerable than BP in the short
term'. BP shares regained 6 1/2 to 207 1/2 p on good turnover of 8.5m, while
Shell eased 2 to 480p.
Standard Chartered added 7 at 425p amid relief that the Isosceles
refinancing had been completed. TSB dipped 4 to 144p as profit-takers moved
in after recent bid speculation.
There was no knock-on effect in life assurers after the slide in Legal &amp;
General. Lloyds Abbey moved up 11 to 387p, Refuge, reporting new business
figures on July 22, rose 7 to 683p, while Prudential, announcing similar
data a day earlier, edged up 3 to 252p.
A gloomy annual meeting statement from Courtaulds and continuing profit
forecast cuts from analysts hit the shares, but they picked up later to
close only 4 off at 498p.
Hints that Cadbury- Schweppes had been hosting bullish presentations in
Europe added to the glow surrounding the stock this week. The shares gained
7 to 481p.
Argyll remained firm ahead of today's agm, rising 4 to 359p. J. Sainsbury
was also resilient; Hoare Govett reported positive noises from the company
on current trading and upgraded its current-year forecast by Pounds 10m to
Pounds 735m.
Hotel group Forte found little early support as a large seller in the
market, adverse press comment and a BZW downgrade all helped the shares
crumble 8 to 162p. They later recovered to close 2 off at 168p in hefty
turnover of 5.1m.
Talk of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into compact disc
prices undermined Thorn EMI, which tumbled but climbed back to end 4 off at
799p.
Turnover in business services group BET rose to 7.2m after the company
announced a Pounds 200.7m rights issue to be used to redeem USDollars 380m
of BET's USDollars 500m Auction Market Preference Shares. The shares lost 4
to 129p, but sentiment was helped by a BZW recommendation. Johnson Matthey
was wanted ahead of today's annual meeting, firming 4 to 415p.

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Economists wrestle with
Bundesbank riddle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT the Bundesbank could do to interest rates tomorrow in its battle to
curb German money supply left the continent's equity markets stultified,
once again, yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
Economists wrestling with the options open to Buba have tended to decide
that it will either do nothing, increase the discount rate (but not the
Lombard rate) or directly reduce the amount of money that it supplies to the
Germany banking sector. 'Either move', said UBS Phillips &amp; Drew this week on
the latter two options, 'would be likely to put pressure on banks' lending
rates, but would not influence interbank money market rates.'
Mr David Deakin of Nikko Bank (UK) said pointedly that high interest rates
have sucked in the money market deposits which contributed to the offending
German M3 figure. 'If the Bundesbank imposes further tightening this week,'
he added, ' . . . it will compound the felony by making German interest
rates even more attractive to the international depositors who already swell
the M3 figure with their cash.'
FRANKFURT ended narrowly mixed, the DAX index easing 2.40 to 1,734.10 after
a decline of 0.76 to 686.32 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover rose from
DM3.9bn to DM4.2bn.
Among individual stocks, Degussa, whose exposure to the lower dollar is a
matter of argument between its detractors and its fans, fell DM5.20 to
DM324.50 marks. Another loser was Allianz, the insurer, which fell DM21 to
DM2,219 on the break of a key technical chart point.
Other fallers included Mannesmann, where there were profits to take, down
DM3.50 to DM286.30; AMB, down DM10 to DM865 on news that its chairman will
be replaced next month; and Asko, down DM11.50 at DM716 in sympathy with
poor figures, and a share price slump at its Swiss-based Adia subsidiary.
The mood of the day was generally short of enthusiasm. This was reflected in
the shipbuilder, Bremer Vulkan, which tried for approval with a 113 per cent
jump in group net profits for 1991 despite a 13% decline in sales, seemed to
get it iniitally with a DM3 rise to DM92.30 but eventually closed unchanged
at DM89.30.
MILAN rose on short-covering ahead of the close of the July trading account
today but closed off the day's highs. Stocks which go ex dividend on
Thursday remained in demand. The Comit index rose 6.71 or 1.5 per cent to
447.76 in turnover estimated at near Monday's L82.9bn.
Among industrial blue chips, Fiat rose L139 or 2.7 per cent to L5,260 while
Montedison gained L30 or 2 per cent to L1,440. Olivetti was also firmer,
adding L68 or 2.3 per cent to L3,065. James Capel has downgraded its
estimates for the computer company because it believes that there is still
no evidence that the bottom of the information technology cycle has been
reached. The broker now expects it to remain in the red in 1992 with a loss
of L100bn, having previously expected a return to profit, of L12bn.
ZURICH extended its preoccupation with second-liners, the temporary
employment group, Adia, topping the active list as it fell SFr42 to SFr216
for a cumulative drop of SFr120, or 36 per cent since early last week on a
poor outlook for profits.
The SMI index of leading shares closed 6.4 lower at 1,835.1. Second on the
active list was a recent high-flyer, the watchmaker, SMH, which fell SFr15
to SFr1,330 on profit-taking.
MADRID went into reverse again, but closed above its worst with the general
index down 1.21 to 234.54 against an intraday low of 233.31. Construction
stocks led the way down, reflecting the sector's vulnerability to cuts in
public spending and featuring a Pta420 drop to Pta6,060 at Cubiertas, Pta55
to Pta1,415 at Dragados and Pta48 to Pta782 for Uralita.
OSLO fell 1.7 per cent to a new 1992 low in thin trading, led down by
shipping shares on renewed pessimism about chances for higher chartering
rates. The all-share index closed 6.75 weaker at 384.30 in turnover worth
NKr109m. The shipping index closed almost 3 per cent weaker, with Bergesen A
shares falling NKr4 to NKr91.
TEL AVIV rallied in active trading, buoyed up by confirmation of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's new government. The blue chip shares index rose
2.21 or 1.5 per cent to 155.15 in turnover of Shk139m.
AMSTERDAM was slightly firmer but trading was very thin as investors stuck
to the sidelines ahead of the Bundesbank's meeting on Thursday. The CBS
Tendency index rose 0.4 to 121.3.
VIENNA's decline was exacerbated by a weaker futures and options market, as
the ATX index went as low as 830.19 before rebounding to end 1.21 down at a
record closing low of 863.86.
Paris remained closed for the Bastille holiday and will re-open today.
Metrologie Internationale, the electrical equipment distributor indirectly
controlled by Paribas, said its shares will be suspended today ahead of the
announcement of a major asset sale.

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stays above
17,000 in spite of profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING after Monday's strong gains depressed share prices in thin
trading yesterday, but the Nikkei average managed to remain above the 17,000
mark, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 137.10 down at 17,064.63. The index reached a
high of 17,258.73 in the morning session on small-lot buying, falling to the
day's low of 16,961.76 in the afternoon.
Turnover picked up slightly to 200m shares from 193m. Daily average volume
for the first half of this year has fallen to 263m shares, down about 75 per
cent from its peak of 1bn shares in 1988.
Declines led advances by 543 to 345, with 199 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks lost 4.80 to 1,294.15, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 2.30 to 1,020.63.
Share prices moved in parallel to the futures market, which fluctuated on
short-term trading by institutional investors. Traders said institutions
were selling the futures contracts short and buying back at lower levels.
'Some domestic institutions are taking profits on small-lot purchases made
at lower levels, but other than that, there is not much incentive to do
anything,' commented Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Late afternoon reports that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, had
commented that a further easing in monetary policy was unnecessary prompted
light selling. Traders, however, were comforted by the fact that the Nikkei
was well supported around 17,000.
Toshiba, the most active stock of the day, ended Y1 easier at Y665. It
initially rose on reports of the company's joint development of advanced
semiconductor devices with International Business Machines, of the US, and
Siemens, of Germany, but later retreated on profit-taking.
Nippon Credit Bank weakened Y120 to Y5,380 on reports of large outstanding
bad debt at its non-bank financial affiliates. Other banking issues were
unaffected by the news: Sumitomo Bank firmed Y10 to Y1,400.
Electric furnace steel makers were higher on hopes that inventory adjustment
for H-shaped beams was under progress. Tokyo Steel gained Y30 to Y3,140 on
speculation that the company may revise its earnings estimates upwards for
the current year. Toa Steel was also actively traded but closed unchanged at
Y1,230.
Oil issues lost ground on fears that weakening demand for oil products as a
result of the economic slowdown would lead to lower profits. Showa Shell
Sekiyu, a leading oil refiner, fell Y50 to Y1,140.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 67.36 to 19,531.81 in volume of 9.1m
shares.
Roundup
SPECULATION in Seoul and Bangkok, and improving economic fundamentals in New
Zealand, produced the leading gains in the region yesterday.
SEOUL staged a rebound after a two-week downtrend, on speculation that the
government would bring in measures to boost the market. The composite index
rose 14.54 to 527.08 and, while turnover remained slow, it recovered from
Won107.4bn to Won136.2bn.
Big manufacturing stocks led the recovery after their fall to 1992 lows.
Yukong, the country's largest oil company, advanced by its upper limit of
Won1,000 to Won23,100.
NEW ZEALAND moved on an inflation rate of just 1.0 per cent for the 12
months to June 30, which extended the decline in domestic bond yields and
left the NZSE-40 index 15.73 higher at 1,582.08 in turnover up from
NZDollars 22.1m to NZDollars 39.3m.
Lower bond yields created buying interest in high-yielding stocks such as
Telecom, the national telephone company, which rose 8 cents to NZDollars
2.20 in heavy volume. Brokers linked the renewed activity in the stock to
buying from the US, where Telecom is traded in ADR form.
BANGKOK speculators flocked into the market in the afternoon in search of
finance and property issues. The SET index gained 7.41 to 741.87 in turnover
of Bt6.29bn. Hemaraj Land and Development, which made its market debut on
Friday, hit its 10 per cent upper limit with a rise of Bt10 to Bt119 in
turnover of Bt537.6m.
HONG KONG registered its third consecutive rise in active trading, although
its final gain was of token quality after an afternoon wave of
profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended 11.34 higher at 6,097.19 in
turnover up from HKDollars 3.635bn to HKDollars 3.74bn.
Follow-through buying of HSBC and Cathay Pacific led the market up, the
former climbing 50 cents to HKDollars 52.50 after Monday's HKDollars 3
spurt, and Cathay by a further 40 cents to HKDollars 13.00.

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg shivers in political chill
 -The JSE is keeping a nervous eye on the ANC's popular campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's recent political tribulations have blown a chill wind over
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), which is keeping a nervous eye on the
African National Congress's (ANC) mass action campaign in an effort to
discern what sort of future faces the country.
The timing of last week's market fall followed comments from Mr Nelson
Mandela, the ANC leader, making clear that there would be no quick return to
the negotiating table following the collapse of constitutional talks last
month.
Until that point, the market had tended to assume that it was witnessing a
lovers' quarrel rather than parties seeking a separation. Like most people,
it had been duped into believing that the government and the ANC were close
to a settlement, whereas it is now clear that they remain deeply divided on
fundamental issues.
The overall index slipped by 5.4 per cent to 3,483 between July 3 and last
Friday. Over the same week the industrial index lost 4.8 per cent, having
earlier been down by 6 per cent; gold shares declined marginally.
This week, the overall index began by shedding a further 1 per cent, or 35
points, on Monday, and declined 15 points to 3,432 yesterday. The industrial
index fell 24 points yesterday to 4,226.
One beneficiary of the JSE's misfortunes has been the capital markets, where
rates on the Eskom 168 and government R150 bonds fell last Friday to 2 1/2
 year lows. The wave of buying here reflects the view that bonds are the
only asset that will perform in the current political climate.
Mr Charles Booth, research director at stockbroker JD Anderson, says the
direction of the equity market from here will be determined by politics. If
the mass action campaign really bites, he believes that the market could
well go lower. If it turns out to be a damp squib then it will probably stay
at current levels. 'I cannot see it going up until all parties are back at
the table and talking,' he adds.
Mr Graham Boyd, an economist at stockbroker Simpson McKie, cautions,
however, that reading the politics right in South Africa has often meant
getting the market wrong. While the JSE is focused on politics now, it could
shift back to more traditional fundamentals. Here there is little cause for
optimism.
The date for an economic recovery to commence is being pushed back all the
time and there is consensus that 1992 will be a year of decline in GDP.
Last week's correction eliminates the unexpected rally which took place
during May and June, leaving prices where they were three months ago. While
the market is still perceived to be in high territory, Mr Booth says
research done at his firm, putting their own fair value on leading
industrial companies, suggests that the market is only overvalued by about 4
per cent - assuming a reasonable economic recovery next year.
Mining shares have, in general, caught a cold along with the rest of the
market. Although metal prices have been a bit firmer recently, the stronger
commercial rand has had a dampening effect on gold, platinum and coal share
prices.
Although, at this stage, the market looks more likely to go down than up,
there are two bull factors to be considered. One is the downward trend in
interest rates, with at least one more rate cut expected this year. The
other is the healthy state of the gold and foreign exchange reserves, which
traditionally lend support to the JSE.
Neither should that ephemeral creature, confidence, be left out of the
equation, especially in a country where exaggerated swings in sentiment are
part of the landscape. Should the South African rugby team manage to achieve
back to back defeats over the All Blacks and the Wallabies in a month's
time, old hands would not be found betting against a rise in the market.

COCOA prices at the London Futures and Options Exchange fell sharply
yesterday, continuing the downturn that began on Monday morning. As
speculators and investment funds unloaded holdings the September delivery
price tumbled to Pounds 594 a tonne at the close, down Pounds 22 on the day
and Pounds 38 from the 2 1/2 -month peak reached on Monday. Traders
suggested, however, that the market was likely to consolidate at around the
present level, which was still Pounds 85 above the 16 1/2 -year low reached
nearly three weeks ago. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER and TIN prices
made modest gains from Monday's closing levels but other metals lost further
ground. And copper's rise of Pounds 9.25 in the three months position was
mainly a reflection of sterling's weakness. In dollar terms, the price was
down slightly from Monday's final kerb close. Tin prices were boosted
earlier by a wave of short-covering following the falls of the three
preceding trading days. After drifting back later the three months price
closed at Dollars 7,077.50 a tonne, up Dollars 25 on balance. NICKEL
remained easier after investment fund liquidation, the three months price
closing at Dollars 7,442.50 a tonne, down Dollars 72.50 on the day.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Call for cocoa price of Pounds
1,400 a tonne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW international cocoa agreement now under negotiation in Geneva should
aim to defend a price level of about Pounds 1,400 a tonne, or more than
double the current price, Mr Alain Gauze, the Ivory Coast's minister for
commodities and head of its delegation to the talks, hinted yesterday. He
told a news conference that this 'would be a good price'.
However, Mr Gauze did not disguise the fact that producing and consuming
countries, now half-way through a three-week negotiating session, remained
far apart on the objectives and financing of the new accord. The present
International Cocoa Agreement expires in September 1993.
Discussion has centred on the proposal made by consuming countries for the
introduction of a withholding scheme to keep supplies back from a saturated
world market, coupled with longer-term measures to curb production.
Producers, led by Ivory Coast, which accounts for a third of world output,
say they are willing to accept withholding, provided the plan reverses the
downward trend in prices, stabilises the market and lifts the price 'to
remunerative levels'.
Mr Gauze would not say yesterday how much cocoa would need to be withheld
from the market to defend a price of Pounds 1,400 a tonne. However, he
estimated that 400,000-450,000 tonnes would have to be held back just to
cover the costs of the scheme. He added that producers did not want any
ceiling on withholdings and described the limit proposed by consumers of
300,000 tonnes as 'insignificant'.
With the inclusion of the 240,000 tonne buffer stock now held by the
International Cocoa Organisation, world cocoa stocks were around 1.2-1.3m
tonnes, he said.
Mr Gauze also criticised consumer proposals to finance the proposed
withholding scheme principally from payment of arrears to the International
Cocoa Organisation. The organisation is owed nearly Dollars 140m, much of it
by the Ivory Coast and Brazil. Producers say the new scheme, like the old,
should be financed by a levy on cocoa trade, including the exports of
countries not members of the agreement, such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Mr
Gauze said arrears should be repaid by a surcharge on the levy.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum highest for nearly 12
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATINUM PRICES rose strongly again yesterday to their highest level for
nearly a year. Gold followed platinum's lead and broke through the
psychologically-important Dollars 350 a troy ounce barrier.
Some analysts suggest platinum's recent performance has been caused by
nervousness about the upheavals in South Africa, the world's biggest
producer, accounting for more than 65 per cent of supply.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Durlacher and Co, the London stockbroker,
pointed out, however, that 'most platinum buyers have seen it all before.
There has been no sign of panic buying - otherwise platinum, and gold,
prices would be considerably higher.' He suggested that other, non-South
African factors were at work in the platinum market. 'I get the impression
the producers are happy about the medium-term outlook and that they feel the
price was forced down too far.'
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, suggested that
platinum's price might fall back as the deadline for a general strike in
South Africa, for two or three days starting on August 3, passed.
But Mr Neil Carson, general manager of marketing at Johnson Matthey, the
world's largest platinum marketing group, said prices should be able to hold
on to present levels because supply and demand were in reasonable balance. A
sudden rise in the three-month platinum leasing rates to about 5 per cent
during the past few weeks indicated the tightness of physical supply, he
added.
Platinum touched Dollars 392.50 an ounce at one stage in London yesterday
before meeting some profit-taking. It closed at Dollars 391.75 an ounce, up
Dollars 4.90 on the day. Gold closed in London up Dollars 1.85 an ounce at
Dollars 350.55.

FT  15 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Matsushita launches Dollars 1bn global
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, the giant Japanese consumer electronics
group, waited until late afternoon in London yesterday before launching its
ground-breaking Dollars 1bn global bond issue.
The 10-year issue, the first global issue by a corporation, will be priced
today to yield 41 to 43 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. Some
participants in the deal commented the pricing was tighter than anticipated.
However, the yield spread was agreed following talks between the borrower,
the joint lead-managers, Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston, and
junior participants in the deal.
The registered bonds will be sold in the international and US domestic bond
markets. Although the World Bank has seen strong European buying of its six
global bond issues, the appetite of Euromarket investors for registered,
corporate paper remains untested.
The late launch suggested the issue was targeted towards US investors.
Syndicate officials said yield spreads in the US market were tighter than in
the Euromarket, and demand from North America was seen as crucial to
underpin the deal.
The syndication contained several features unusual in Eurobond issues,
including a Dollars 300m 'pot' of bonds from which underwriters can obtain
additional paper for clients beyond their initial commitments. Lehman
Brothers said it expected an equal distribution between the US and Europe,
with Far Eastern investors taking perhaps 20 per cent of the bonds.
Matsushita will use the proceeds of the issue to refinance debt relating to
the purchase of MCA, the US entertainment group. Matsushita is the second
Japanese company to launch a Dollars 1bn bond issue to refinance outstanding
debt. In May, Toyota, the motor giant, launched a Dollars 1bn Eurodollar
issue to refinance maturing equity-linked finance raised in the late 1980s.
The poor performance of the Tokyo stock market this year has made it
impossible to raise equity-linked funding on any scale. Moreover, Japanese
banks are less willing to increase credit lines as they work to meet
capital-to-assets targets set by the Balse committee of central bank
regulators.
However, bankers said yesterday that Matsushita was one of only a handful of
corporations able to raise debt finance from the bond markets on this scale.

RYOKO Securities, which is 33 per cent owned by the Mitsubishi Bank group,
is to pull out of Switzerland, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Tokyo-based brokerage will return Ryoko Securities' Swiss licence on
July 20. The move stems from shrinking primary and brokerage business in
Switzerland, and to ensure help in underpinning cost-cutting in Japan.
Three Japanese second-tier securities companies paid Y9.8bn to compensate
clients' losses from securities trading during the two years to March 1992,
according to the Finance Ministry.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange fined Dai-ichi Securities, New Japan Securities and
Kankaku Securities Y5m each. Four officials at the three companies have
resigned and 21 had their salaries cut.
The moves are part of last summer's compensation scandal which hit the
Japanese securities industry. It centred on unethical practices.

FT  15 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Bankers mull over a Pounds
5bn debt financing puzzle - Treasury plans to sell utility loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government's plan to sell up to Pounds 5bn of loans made to
privatised utility companies presents bankers with one of the most teasing
corporate finance puzzles since the privatisation programme was first
hatched in the early 1980s.
Last week, Baring Brothers was appointed to advise the Treasury on the sale,
following a competitive tender involving around a dozen banks and securities
firms. Barings must now come up with a strategy by which the government can
realise cash from its hotch-potch of loan assets.
The project has an air of urgency. The government has budgeted on raising
Pounds 1bn this fiscal year, reducing the public sector borrowing
requirement and the amount it must borrow from the gilts market.
The loans range in size from a substantial Pounds 350m loan to National
Power due for repayment in 1998, to small loans of less than Pounds 50m to
regional electricity companies. Some must be repaid next year; others do not
mature until 2008.
Although the assets themselves are complex, bankers said the government has
three simple options:
The debt can simply be offered for sale to investors in its current form,
since most is already structured as securities which are easy to trade.
The main problem with this approach is that the loans carry interest
payments of up to 13.2 per cent, reflecting interest rates when the
companies were privatised. If the paper was sold directly to investors it
would need to be priced substantially above par redemption value - perhaps
107 or 108 per cent of face value.
Many investors are unwilling to buy bonds above par. UK taxpayers, for
example, would pay full tax on the interest income from high coupons but
would receive no deduction for capital loss when the bonds were redeemed at
par. Continental European investors are also reluctant to buy bonds trading
at a premium to face value.
Moreover, some of the debt - notably the Pounds 2.2bn loans to British
Telecom - is in the form of registered securities, rather than bearer bonds
favoured by international investors. Again, this limits the number of
potential buyers.
One merchant banker commented: 'Everything has a price, but selling most of
this debt directly to investors may not be the most price-efficient
solution.'
The debt could be repackaged into a more palatable form either by the
government or an investment bank. For example, the debt could be injected
into a special-purpose company which would issue bonds secured on this
underlying holding.
The special-purpose company could then offer securities in a form favoured
by investors: bearers bonds with coupons matching current interest rates and
priced just below par.
Against this, the costs of repackaging debt are prohibitive. The
special-purpose company would have to issue a larger principle amount of
current coupon bonds than the face value of the underlying debt: Pounds 110m
paper priced at par could be secured on Pounds 100m bonds trading at 110.
To achieve this, an investment bank could write a series of interest rate
swaps with the special-purpose company. But this type of exercise is costly
and would erode any gains from issuing more attractive, repackaged bonds.
The debt could simply be offered to the utility companies companies could
either refinance the debt with new bonds or redeem it out of cash-flow.
Indeed, many of the loans oblige the government to at least consult the
companies before it acts. Loans to the regional electricity companies (Recs)
give them the pre-emptive right to buy back the debt before the government
sells to a third party.
There would be little real cost-saving for the utilities even if the debt
could be refinanced in the bond market at lower interest rates. In the case
of the Recs, the price they would pay for the debt is set by a formula
agreed at the time of privatisation. Hence, the companies would have to pay
a premium to face value, just like any other buyer.
This could also lead to tax problems. The utilities receive tax relief on
high interest payments, but get no relief on the premium above face value
paid to the government to redeem the debt early.
It may be possible for some utilities to buy back the debt via an off-shore
subsidiary set up in a jurisdiction where the premium is tax deductable.
But, again, there are costs in setting up such an arrangement.
Against this, treasurers may see value in redeeming the government loans out
of cash-flow or bank credit lines and refinancing later, at a time of their
own choosing. This way the companies will regain the initiative, even if it
means paying a premium for control.

VISA, one of the leading US credit card companies, said its first-quarter
results showed an 11.5 per cent increase in domestic sales volume.
The San Francisco-based company claimed this was better than the average 10
per cent growth rate for other large credit card companies during the first
three months of 1992.
The rise came in the face of what most economists see as continued weak US
consumer confidence during the opening months of the year.
Visa said it recorded Dollars 40.7bn in card transactions for the quarter
ended on March 31. The number of Visa cards in circulation in the US rose by
4.5 per cent to 143m cards.

FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Marudai seeks to boost ratio of
cross-holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARUDAI FOOD, a Japanese food processing company, said yesterday it would
raise its ratio of cross-shareholdings by encouraging banks and insurance
companies to raise their exposure in return for lifting its own stakes in
some of the financial institutions involved. The move comes at a time when
many Japanese companies are reducing such links.
Japan's cross-shareholding system has been under pressure following the
collapse of stock prices and the slowing of the economy. A fall in bank
share prices in recent months was blamed on a weakening of that system as
troubled industrial companies cashed in long-term holdings. Marudai plans to
lift its ratio of stable shareholders from the present 55.3 per cent to
around 60 per cent.
'We think it will help us increase profits. If there was not a good
financial reason, we would not have this plan,' the company said.
Marudai is likely to strengthen links with Sumitomo group companies which
together already hold about 18 per cent of its shares.
One characteristic of the recent weakening of share links has been that some
companies on the fringe of the large corporate families have decided that at
present the cost of the connection outweighs the benefits. Other companies
have chosen to identify themselves more closely with the large families,
hoping to bolster their share price and to encourage other group companies
to broaden business ties.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXCESS aluminium supplies squeezed Alcan's margins in the second quarter
this year, contributing to a deeper loss for the period.
The Montreal-based aluminium producer also painted a sombre picture of its
near-term prospects. 'With considerable new capacity being added to the
industry this year, it is difficult to see much relief for prices,' Mr David
Morton, chairman, said.
The net second-quarter loss was USDollars 27m, or 14 cents a share, up from
Dollars 5m, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. The six-month loss also
widened to Dollars 40m, or 22 cents, from Dollars 6m, or 7 cents.
The second-quarter figure includes a Dollars 9m after-tax charge, equal to 4
cents a share, for cost-reduction programmes. Similar charges of Dollars
17m, or 8 cents, were taken a year earlier. Revenues slipped fractionally to
just under Dollars 2bn.
Mr Morton said an improvement in North America, Germany and France compared
with the previous three months was offset by poor results from Japan, partly
due to the weak performance of Nippon Light Metal Company.
Alcan shipped 191,000 tonnes of ingots in the second quarter, down from
219,000 a year earlier. Deliveries of fabricated products rose to 380,000
tonnes from 368,000 tonnes.
The average ingot price dropped by Dollars 38 per tonne to Dollars 1,431,
but Alcan said its average production costs had fallen by more than Dollars
100 per tonne in the past year.
During 1991, Alcan laid off about 4,000 employees worldwide.

FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Federal Express delivers Dollars
113.8m loss

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERAL EXPRESS, the largest overnight package delivery business in the US,
suffered a Dollars 113.8m loss after tax in the year to end-May.
The loss was scored on revenues down from Dollars 7.69bn a year earlier to
Dollars 7.55bn. FedEx, which has been incurring heavy losses from its
international operations recently, made a small Dollars 5.9m profit after
tax in 1990-91.
However, in the previous year it reported a Dollars 115.8m surplus after
tax, and Dollars 184.6m in 1989-90.
In the fourth quarter of 1991-92, Federal said the overall after-tax profit
totalled Dollars 35.8m, up from Dollars 31m in the same period a year
earlier.
But its international business remained in the red - although the operating
loss from this division fell to Dollars 53.2m, on revenues of Dollars
536.1m, against a deficit of Dollars 74.6m on revenues of Dollars 633.5m a
year earlier.
In March, FedEx announced a withdrawal from the highly-competitive European
delivery industry, sub-contracting all its intra-European delivery business
and laying off more than 6,000 employees.
This move, according to Federal, has succeeded in removing more fixed costs
than revenue, thus aiding profitability. Express package volumes to and from
Europe had been maintained at levels 'ahead of expectations'.
Mr Fred Smith, Federal's founder and chairman, warned that further
improvement would 'require a continuation of growth in international express
package volumes and higher profit ability from international air freight
business'.
For 1991-92 overall, the loss from the Memphis-based company's international
operations totalled Dollars 612.9m, compared with a Dollars 419.1m deficit
in the previous 12 months.
The former figure, however, was scored after Dollars 254m of restructuring
charges, largely to cover the withdrawal from Europe. The 1990-91 loss came
after charges of Dollars 121m.
On the domestic front, where Federal Express carries about half the nation's
overnight express packages, FedEx said the climate remained extremely
price-competitive.
Despite this, Federal managed an operating profit margin of 12.2 per cent,
which it attributed to productivity gains and cost improvements.

Fidelity

<TEXT>
FIRST Fidelity, the biggest bank in New Jersey, yesterday unveiled a 46.7
per cent increase in its second-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 76.3m.
The 500-branch bank, whose earnings per share rose from 80 cents to 93 cents
year-on-year, has been recovering from property loan losses caused by
exposure to Mr Donald Trump and other developers.
Mr Tony Terracciano, chairman of First Fidelity, said that while loan demand
remains sluggish, earnings were beginning to reflect the benefits of the
core retail franchise and a more positive trend in the quality of assets.
During the second quarter, First Fidelity's non-performing loans declined by
Dollars 60m to Dollars 596.7m. The level of non-performing loans as at June
30 was 25 per cent lower than the Dollars 803m level a year ago.
The bank, which with Dollars 29.3bn of total assets is the 25th-largest in
the US, said its improvement was helped by a rise in net interest margins
and a 10.8 per cent rise in service fees on deposit accounts.
Chase Manhattan said it expected to receive Dollars 40m to Dollars 50m in
interest payment on cross-border loans to Brazil during the second half of
1992, following the recently-announced agreement between Brazil and its
leading bank creditors.
The bank received Dollars 9m of interest payments during the second quarter.
Chase said that Dollars 557m of its total Brazilian debt of Dollars 1.2bn is
presently classified as non-performing.
Mr Michael Esposito, chief financial officer, said he expected the level of
bad debt provisions to continue at relatively high levels this year.

<TEXT>
BOISE Cascade, the US forest products group, yesterday announced a
second-quarter net loss of Dollars 45m and indicated it would remain in the
red until 1993.
'If the economy continues to grow at a modest rate, and if we are able to
obtain further modest increases in paper prices, Boise Cascade should return
to profitability during 1993,' said Mr John Fery, the chairman.
The second-quarter loss, which worked through at Dollars 1.38 a share,
compared with losses of Dollars 32.6m, or 95 cents a share, in the same
period of last year. Sales totalled Dollars 922m, down from Dollars 978m.
The US paper industry has been suffering from a sharp cyclical downturn for
the past two years, but analysts have been forecasting a modest recovery
during 1992.
However, another leading manufacturer, Georgia-Pacific, depressed Wall
Street expectations last week when it announced it would only make a small
second-quarter profit.
Boise Cascade said the operating performance of its paper and paper products
division in the second quarter continued to be severely affected by weak
paper prices, which were on average modestly below the very low levels
reached in the first quarter.
Results compared unfavourably with a year ago.
Prices for business and printing papers and market pulp strengthened
modestly in the second quarter, relative to the first quarter, but
newsprint, coated and uncoated ground-wood paper prices reached new lows in
the cycle.
The group's office products segment, hit by the weak US economy, saw profits
down from a year ago on slightly higher sales volume. The dip was attributed
to a seasonal swing from the first quarter, pressure on margins and the
divestiture of the wholesale office products distribution operations.
Building products saw income modestly stronger than the second quarter of
last year but down on the first quarter of this year. Lumber prices rose to
record levels in the first quarter but have moderated since then.

COCA-Cola, the Atlanta-based soft drinks group, yesterday reported a 20.4
per cent improvement in second-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 581m.
Earnings per share improved by a slightly larger 22.2 per cent, to 44 cents,
compared with 36 cents a year ago.
Sales during the second quarter reached Dollars 3.55bn, up 16.8 per cent
over the same period in 1991.
Coca-Cola said that unit case sales in its domestic market fell by 1 per
cent, and gallon sales of concentrates and syrups by 2.5 per cent, as stocks
were run down.
However, in Europe warm weather and heavy marketing lifted second-quarter
unit sales by 14 per cent year-on-year. This included gains of 25 per cent
in France, 17 per cent in Britain and 12 per cent each in Germany and Italy.
Coca-Cola said worldwide soft drink volume continued to advance in the
second quarter, with international unit case sales increasing 4 per cent and
gallon sales advancing 3 per cent despite softness in the high volume
markets of Brazil and Mexico.
First-half net income advanced to Dollars 964.1m from Dollars 803.3m in the
previous year on sales which rose to Dollars 6.3bn from Dollars 5.5bn.
Earnings per share for the period were lifted to 73 cents from 60 cents.

patent claims

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONEYWELL, the US controls company, yesterday reported a 10 per cent
increase in second-quarter net income, due largely to gains from settlements
in a long-running dispute over camera technology.
The group produced net income of Dollars 85.1m, or Dollars 1.23 a share, on
sales of Dollars 1.49bn, compared with income of Dollars 77.6m, or Dollars
1.10 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.52bn in the same period of last year.
However, some Dollars 7.4m in after-tax profits, or 11 cents a share, was
due to Honeywell's settlement with various companies for their use of the
company's patented technology for automatic focusing cameras.
A court in New Jersey ruled in a test case in February that Minolta, the
Japanese camera manufacturer, had infringed Honeywell's patent. Minolta
subsequently agreed to settle the suit for Dollars 127.5m, and since then
Honeywell has been reaching settlements with other camera manufacturers.
It said yesterday it expected to report additional settlements in the third
quarter.
In the second quarter, its home and building controls unit made Dollars
48.2m in operating profits, up from Dollars 32.1m a year earlier, on sales
up from Dollars 512m to Dollars 557m.
The industrial unit made Dollars 45.1m, down from Dollars 58.1m, on sales
which rose from Dollars 412m to Dollars 430.4m. The company said a changing
product mix and aggressive pricing competition meant lower margins.
The space and aviation business saw operating profits of Dollars 63.6m,
compared with Dollars 60.6m, on sales down at Dollars 460.9m, compared with
Dollars 548m. The sales drop was due to lower demand for commercial flight
systems. The improved profit was attributed to 'rigorous cost controls, a
favourable product mix in military avionics and non-recurring inventory
valuation adjustments in commercial flight systems'.

BETHLEHEM Steel, the second-largest US steel group, yesterday reported a
second-quarter loss of Dollars 64m after taking a Dollars 25m charge in
connection with a legal battle.
The company said that, excluding the charge, its net loss for the period was
Dollars 39m, a little better than the Dollars 45m loss recorded in the same
period of last year.
Bethlehem only announced its bottom line figures yesterday and said its
complete results for the period would be unveiled on July 29.
The Dollars 25m charge increases the company's reserve for loss
contingencies in connection with a dispute over title to coal previously
mined by Bethlehem.
In early June, the Kentucky Supreme Court filed a 4-3 opinion adverse to
Bethlehem in the case.
Bethlehem said that in the second quarter its steel production costs were
lower than in the first quarter, but average realised prices were also lower
for most of its products. It expected prices to improve later this year and
in 1993 if the US economy improved.

HOOGOVENS, the Dutch steel producer, has agreed to acquire the 60 per cent
it did not already own in Norsk Blikkvalseverk, of Norway, AP-DJ reports
from Amsterdam.
NB Steel will add 130,000 tonnes a year to Hoogoven's annual steel
production of 670,000 tons for the packaging industry.
The Dutch company declined to disclose revenues from its packaging steel
business. However, prices presently run at between Fl 800 and Fl 1,200
(Dollars 700) per tonne, depending on the type and quality of the steel
being used, industry officials said.
Hoogovens said the full takeover of Bergen-based NB Steel would strengthen
the Dutch company's position in the world packaging steel industry.
Hoogovens acquired the initial 40 per cent stake in NB Steel in January
1990.
Meanwhile, Hoogovens declined to comment on a report that it is seeking a
deferral of payments on a loan from the Dutch government.
Hoogovens is seeking to reschedule payments on the 10-year, Fl 570m
subordinated loan issued in 1984 by the Economics Ministry, according to the
report.
The loan was obtained to help finance a far-reaching restructuring plan
following the collapse of Estel, its partnership with Hoesch, the German
steel manufacturer.

FIAT has decided to expand its co-operation with Japan's Hitachi and
Sumitomo in the field of earth-moving equipment.
The Turin-based automotive group yesterday signed an agreement to form Fiat
Hitachi Construction Equipment, controlled 80 per cent by Fiat Hitachi
Excavators and 20 per cent by NH Geotec. Fiat Hitachi Excavators is already
controlled 51 per cent by Fiat, 44 per cent by Hitachi and 5 per cent by
Sumitomo.
The new venture is to be controlled ultimately 51 per cent by Fiat through
Geotec and based at Lecce in southern Italy. Whereas the previous venture
combined the Italian groups and the two Japanese companies' production and
technology in hydraulic excavators, the new deal extends this to roller
loader, dozers and construction equipment.
The agreement follows the decision by John Deere earlier this year to pull
out of a three-pronged venture. Fiat will be pooling its resources from
FiatAllis in Geotec which includes a commercial network in Europe, Africa
and the Middle East; while the Japanese partners will bring in Equipco,
Hitachi's French-based distribution arm as well as technology and quality
control.
In four years, the original Fiat Hitachu alliance has seen its share of the
European market rise from 7 per cent to 13 per cent. The capital for the new
venture has yet to be decided.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian bank, yesterday came under renewed
pressure to choose Internationale Nederlanden (ING) as a strategic partner
when the Dutch banking and insurance group revealed it had increased its
stake in BBL to 10.03 per cent.
The BBL board will meet today to discuss whether it should link up with ING
or with Credit Communal, the publicly-owned Belgian credit institution.
ING said yesterday it had added a further percentage point to its BBL stake
in order to demonstrate its determination to co-operate further with the
bank. BBL is unlikely to make a firm decision today.
The boardroom debate is likely to revolve around the vexed question of
whether Belgian companies should be allowed to fall under the influence of
non-Belgian partners. According to opponents of such deals, that has been
the fate of Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company,
since France's Compagnie de Suez bought a majority stake.
But Brussels stockbrokers and the BBL's own management believe it would be
short-sighted of the bank to ally itself with a strictly domestic
institution like Credit Communal, which is jointly-owned by all the
municipalities and provinces of Belgium. 'If BBL wants to grow on the
European level it would be a little unhelpful to link up with a Belgian
bank,' said one BBL official yesterday.
Pressure from the Credit Communal camp is also being stepped up. Last week,
Banque Internationale a Luxembourg bought a 5.7 per cent stake in BBL from
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company which is the bank's
largest shareholder. Credit Communal is the Luxembourg bank's main
shareholder, and Mr Albert Frere, who heads GBL, is believed to favour a
Belgian future for BBL.
ING said in April that it was interested in buying all or part of the GBL
stake.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BUCKNALL GROUP, the only quoted firm of quantity surveyors, was hit hard by
the effects of the recession in the construction industry and ran up a loss
of Pounds 1.92m pre-tax for the year to end-April.
That compared with profits of Pounds 1.23m in the previous 12 months.
The dividend for the year is omitted - shareholders received a 4.8p total
previously. Losses per share of 13p compared with earnings of 10p in
1990-91.
Mr David Bucknall, chairman and chief executive, said the directors had
taken an average pay cut of 22 per cent while salaries of subsidiary company
directors and senior managers had been reduced by 10 per cent.
This had helped generate savings of more than Pounds 1.7m a year.
Group turnover fell by 17 per cent to Pounds 17.3m. Mr Bucknall said that UK
turnover, down by 30 per cent, had fallen faster than the group could cut
costs and this had led to losses.
Overseas turnover, on the other hand, had risen by 98 per cent to Pounds
4.5m.
The group had also been successful recently in winning other types of work
away from the private office market which had borne the brunt of the
recession in the UK.
Pre-tax losses for 1991-92 were struck after taking account of exceptional
provisions of Pounds 383,000, (Pounds 447,000) mostly due to redundancy
costs. The group's UK staff during the latest 12 months had been reduced
from 418 to 367.
Year-end gearing of 75 per cent compared with 123 per cent 12 months
earlier.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: GIM launches smaller companies investment
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW INVESTMENT Managers is launching a new investment trust which will
invest in smaller companies and aim for a high yield.
Despite the problems which have hit the new issues market, including three
investment trusts, in the last month, GIM said it had picked its time well.
Mr David Williams, managing director, said: 'I don't think our timing could
be better. We are confident we're at the bottom of the cycle and the current
weakness of the market offers very real opportunities for growth over the
longer term.'
The trust, to be called Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies, will buy
shares in companies with a market capitalisation between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 250m with a minimum dividend yield of 120 per cent of the FT-A All
Share index. The projected initial gross yield will be 7 per cent, and the
managers expect dividends to grow faster than inflation.
GIM argues that smaller companies outperform UK equities during periods of
economic expansion.
The launch of the trust will be aided by Shires, GIM's flagship investment
trust, which will transfer smaller companies shares to the value of Pounds
5m from its own portfolio in return for a Pounds 5m shareholding in the new
trust.
Williams de Broe, sponsor to the issue, has obtained underwriting for Pounds
12.5m, and is aiming for a maximum of Pounds 30m. The trust, primarily aimed
at the retail market, will try to attract private investors via personal
equity plans.
Warrants will be attached to the ordinary shares on a 1-for-5 basis, but the
company has avoided the more complicated capital structures popular with new
investment trust issues earlier this year, saying that these could create
conflicts of interest between different classes of shareholder.
The formal launch will be on Friday and the trust will remain open to
subscriptions until August 20.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Contract failure knocks Birse to loss of
Pounds 13.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRSE GROUP, the building and civil engineering company in which Bilfinger &amp;
Berger, the German contractor, has a 15 per cent stake, incurred a loss of
Pounds 13.2m during the year to end-April.
The deficit compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10m the previous year,
and was struck on turnover up from Pounds 317m to Pounds 356m.
Losses per share were 16.6p compared with earnings of 7.6p last time.
Following a same-again interim of 1.65p, the group is proposing not to pay a
final dividend.
The result had been widely expected and the company's share price yesterday
remained unchanged at 23p. This compares with a price of 120p when Birse was
floated and Bilfinger acquired its strategic holding in the autumn of 1989.
Losses included exceptional charges of Pounds 13.1m. Of these, Pounds 8.5m
arose from the failure earlier this year of Quietwaters, a private developer
which owed substantial sums to Birse for the construction of a golf course,
hotel and leisure complex in Essex.
Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said another Pounds 3.5m of losses arising from
the collapse of Quietwaters had been deducted from operating profits, which
fell from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 4.3m.
The remaining Pounds 4.3m of provisions, he said, came from write-downs of
the group's residential and commercial property interests.
Mr Birse said the group's order book now showed a good mix of business. More
than 80 per cent of contracts were either with public sector customers or
secure large privatised water companies.
Construction profits excluding provisions fell from Pounds 12m to Pounds
3.4m. Housing incurred a Pounds 600,000 operating loss (Pounds 700,000
loss), and remained a difficult market. Commercial property made an
operating profit of Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 100,000) before write downs of
Pounds 3.7m.
COMMENT
Questions have been raised in recent weeks about Birse's ability to survive
the sharp downturn in the UK construction market, illustrated so savagely by
the collapse of the Quietwaters contract. The group, which has been very
aggressive in bidding for work in recent years, took pains yesterday to
underline the security of its order book, particularly in northern England
where it says average margins remain between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. In
southern England contracts are lucky if they do more than cover overheads,
according to Mr Birse. Gearing of 92 per cent on net debt of Pounds 24.9m
may be uncomfortable but is not life threatening and is an improvement on
the previous year. Judging by comments from analysts, the group convinced
the market yesterday that speculation about its future had been misplaced.
Nonetheless it should do little better than break-even in the current period
and the share price, given the problems in the sector, will struggle to
improve much. Bilfinger - which has still to win a contract in joint venture
with Birse - must be feeling a little sick.

conduct and pay for clinical trials scheduled to begin during the third
quarter of this year.
Although final terms have not been agreed, Glaxo is expected to manufacture
and market the drug worldwide if it is licensed.
The medicine, known as BB-882, will be given in oral doses.
British Bio-technology is also planning to develop an injectible version of
BB-882 to treat acute shock. The Oxford-based company will conduct the early
trials, and if successful, may conclude a further agreement with Glaxo.
Mr James Noble, finance director, said: 'This is a perfect deal for us. It
off-loads the whole burden of costs for the clinical trials. Glaxo is the
best possible partner to conduct the trials and then market the drug.'
The agreement with Glaxo follows a similar deal with SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, to co-develop
and market arthritis and cancer treatments.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Etonbrook Properties in dispute over
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETONBROOK Properties, the former Business Expansion Scheme company which
came to the market last year, yesterday launched a sharp attack on one of
its shareholders as it prepared for an acrimonious extraordinary meeting
next month.
Mr Jonathan Harris, chairman, accused Multitrust of attempting to take over
Etonbrook through the back door, by opposing the company's plans for a
capital restructuring. 'If someone wishes to buy Etonbrook, make a bid,' he
said, and added that the group's plans for a capital restructuring were part
of a controlled liquidation to return value to shareholders.
Etonbrook, which recently sold one of its three remaining properties for
Pounds 1m, plans to pay shareholders 25p per share and a 2.7p dividend as a
result of the sale. However, it cannot pay the ordinary dividend until it
meets its convertible redeemable preference share obligations, which fell
due on April 1.
Since the group has no distributable reserves, Mr Harris wants to
restructure the share capital to provide the money to pay preference and
ordinary dividends. Etonbrook has already set aside the Pounds 1.2m
necessary to redeem the shares. The restructuring will be put to the vote at
the EGM on August 7.
Multitrust has has been campaigning against the board's strategy, but Mr
Andrew Perloff, chairman, was unavailable for comment yesterday.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kalon has acceptances for 6.3% of Manders
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALON, the Yorkshire-based paints maker, had received valid acceptances by
Monday's first closing date in respect of 2.32m ordinary shares in its
Pounds 92m hostile 8-for-3 bid for Manders (Holdings). This represents about
6.3 per cent of Manders issued ordinary share capital.
The bidder has also received acceptances in respect of 21,555 Manders
preference shares (2.7 per cent).
Mr Roy Amos, chairman of the target paint, inks and property group, said he
was pleased 'the vast majority of Manders shareholders have taken our advice
to ignore the Kalon offer', adding that it showed the 'fragility of Kalon's
business and share price'.
The value of the offer had continued to fall, he said, to a 'mere 6 per cent
premium' to Manders' share price of 237p immediately before the offer
announcement.
Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon group managing director, said that the level of
acceptances was 'extremely encouraging', adding that Manders shareholders
were already demonstrating their disenchantment with Manders' record of
failure.
Kalon's shares closed down 1p at 93 1/2 p; Manders' slipped 2p to 243p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION finally caught up with CMW Group, the USM-quoted architect, in
the second quarter of the present year resulting in an interim pre-tax loss.
The company, however, is attracting new commissions and hopes to be in
profit in the second half.
Turnover for the six months to May 31 fell 19 per cent to Pounds 2.17m for a
loss of Pounds 471,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 252,000.
The loss was after exceptional redundancy charges of Pounds 111,000 and
interest costs of Pounds 183,000 (Pounds 181,000).
The interim dividend is passed - 0.9p was paid previously.
Mr Peter Denner, chairman, said the company had managed to avoid the worst
effects of recession over the past two years. He added, however, that it had
taken its toll in the second quarter.
Losses were 5.91p (earnings 5.35p). Lower extraordinary costs of Pounds
32,000 (Pounds 508,000) left retained losses of Pounds 370,000 (Pounds
358,000).

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Sterling Publishing recovers to Pounds
2.05m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING Publishing Group, owner of Debretts Peerage, appears to be
recovering from untimely expansion in 1990, with the announcement of Pounds
2.05m in annual pre-tax profits, compared with a losses of Pounds 1.04m.
Mr Michael Preston, deputy chairman, was bullish about the current year,
saying he would be disappointed if the company did not surpass 1990 profits
of Pounds 4.4m. 'Advertising is showing a very healthy increase. The current
year is looking very good indeed.'
Mr Preston said the group had increased advertising revenue by 40 per cent
in the year just ended, due to concentrating on more internationally
marketable publications.
Turnover for the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 35.9m to Pounds 41.6m,
including Pounds 7.63m from discontinued operations. Interest payable fell
from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 1.89m and debt was reduced by Pounds 3.16m to
Pounds 17.6m. Since the end of the period borrowings have fallen by a
further Pounds 3.6m, partly due to disposals.
Sterling, which publishes reference and trade books which earn their revenue
through advertising, pulled out of or discontinued several titles during the
year.
This meant a virtual turnround on the expansion of 1990-91 which brought the
group into the sharply depressed US market. Jami, the direct marketing
business, and two US publications had been sold since the year-end.
Costs of reorganisation and disposals made after the year-end of Pounds
5.34m (Pounds 1.56m) were taken as an extraordinary item. A further Pounds
4.57m (Pounds 1.62m) charge arose from the accounting requirement that
goodwill previously written off be taken in the profit and loss account upon
disposal.
The loss attributable to shareholders was almost doubled to Pounds 8.03m
(Pounds 4.14m).
Fully-diluted earnings per share were 6.9p, although on a continuing basis
they were 6.1p, compared with losses of 5.5p. The proposed final dividend is
raised to 2p (1p), for a maintained total of 2.5p.

Morris Ashby, the USM-traded specialist aluminium die-casting and machining
group, lifted pre-tax profits 14 per cent in the year ended March 31,
following a strong second half.
Mr Norman Gardner, chairman, was confident that the current year would see
record profits.
Turnover rose 23 per cent, from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 15.3m, with the
profit at Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.05m). Earnings per share were 10.7p (8.7p)
and the final dividend is 3p for a total of 4.7p (4.1p).
Mr Gardner said in the second half benefit was taken from new orders coming
on stream. The largest increase was in passenger car component manufacture
but significant rises were also experienced in heavy vehicle, electrical,
and the hydraulic/pneumatic markets.

By the end of the year to April 30, pre-tax losses at John D Wood, the
estate agent, had risen to Pounds 497,000, including Pounds 100,000 of
non-recurring expenditure.
At the halfway mark the loss came to Pounds 194,000. For the 1990-91 year
the profit was Pounds 15,000.
Losses per share were 4.8p (0.3p) and there is no dividend, compared with an
interim of 1.5p for the previous year.
Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 4.71m. The London residential department
traded profitably, the Wimbledon sales office was successful and expenditure
had been cut, directors reported.
However, the country business was again badly hit by market conditions with
values falling by 40 per cent from their 1988 peak.

An extraordinary charge of Pounds 204,000 (Pounds 92,000), mainly relating

Pounds 56,000 (Pounds 258,000).

Multitone Electronics, the paging systems and equipment maker, achieved a 36
per cent advance in pre-tax profits and is raising its dividend by 50 per
cent.
In the 53 weeks ended May 2 turnover increased by 9.5 per cent to Pounds
21.2m after the group obtained a larger share of the market in generally
aggressive competitive conditions.
Profit moved up from Pounds 1.42m to Pounds 1.93m after development costs of
Pounds 1.95m, broadly unchanged in real terms, and interest costs cut from
Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 144,000.
The tax rate was reduced to 35.1 (39.3) per cent as profits earned in the UK
had risen faster than those overseas. That boosted earnings per share to
8.33p (5.75p) and the dividend is stepped up to 3p (2p) through a final of
1.75p.
At the year-end there was a net cash balance of Pounds 319,000 compared with

Nobo Group improved substantially in the second half but the final dividend
is cut to 2.5p, reducing the total from 6.6p to 3.5p for the year to April
30.
This office equipment group saw the year's pre-tax profit slide from Pounds
2.05m to Pounds 1.11m, after exceptional costs of Pounds 227,000 (Pounds

Mr Reg Barr, chairman, said borrowings were reduced significantly in the
second half and, coupled with lower interest rates, led to a decrease in
interest costs from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 663,000.
Turnover came to Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 24.4m). Earnings per share worked
through at 6.34p (12.35p).
Results of the Dutch operation were below expectations and that again

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Aitken declines to Pounds 2.33m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AITKEN HUME International, the banking and financial services group, turned
in a reduced pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.33m for the year to March 31.
This was cut from Pounds 3.01m last time, when the accounts were qualified
as a result of a dispute over payments due in connection with the
acquisition of the Bachmann Group, a Guernsey-based financial services
company.
The 1992 pre-tax figure was struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds
1.09m to reward management of Aitken's US fund management arm for its
improved performance. This charge was mitigated by a refund of surplus funds
amounting to Pounds 510,000 from its UK pension scheme.
The US arm made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.3m), whereas the
UK and Channel Islands banking activities, hit by bad debts, incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 635,000 against profits of Pounds 634,000 last time.
The accounts included the results of the Bachmann group - a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 1.74m) - up to its disposal in March this year.
Disposal costs of Bachmann were taken as an extraordinary debit of Pounds
12.9m, leaving the group with an attributable loss of Pounds 11.4m (Pounds
1.9m profit).
Losses per share were 19.84p against earnings of 3.01p. There is no final
dividend (0.5p), giving a reduced total of 0.5p (1p).

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Eurotherm shows 47% advance to Pounds 6.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTHERM, the control equipment group, yesterday reported a 47 per cent
rise in interim profits after a substantial pruning of its workforce and
overheads.
The pre-tax line at end-April rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 6.7m, on sales
only 0.8 per cent higher at Pounds 78.1m.
Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said the company had encountered the worst global
recession in its 27 year history, and there was no sign of any improvement
at the moment.
The company had misjudged the extent of the economic downturn and had
entered the recession with too many overheads, he said.
During the first half, however, overheads had been cut by Pounds 2m and in
the last 18 months 400, mainly white collar, employees had been shed
reducing the workforce to about 2,300 worldwide.
'We spent the last nine months getting the house in order,' Mr Leonard said.
'Now we have to increase sales.'
While many of the group's markets were in trouble, the water and electricity
companies were flush with cash and a potential market, and the food sector
was maintaining demand in the packaging industry.
Gearing fell from 30 per cent to 25 per cent and the company said cash flow
would remain positive until the end of the year.
Earnings per share rose from 6.7p to 9.97p and the interim dividend rises 20
per cent to 3p.
Eurotherm was founded in 1965 by Mr Leonard and three partners with Pounds
70,000, and its growth has been mainly organic.
Mr Leonard said this pattern would continue, although there might be a time
in the US where Honeywell is a dominant competitor, when the group would
have to acquire in order to build its control business more rapidly.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Thames wins Pounds 29m ITV deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television yesterday announced it had won a larger than expected
Pounds 29m programme deal with ITV for the first eight months of next year.
The deal includes a third-weekly half hour edition of The Bill, its police
drama series. These account for more than half the value of the programme
package which will launch Thames as an independent producer.
The group lost its licence to Carlton Television in last year's competitive
tenders and ceases to be a broadcaster at the end of this year.
It said yesterday that the deal had been blocked for a time by Carlton which
did not want past episodes of The Bill to be available for UK Gold, the new
Thames-BBC satellite channel.
The channel, to be launched in the autumn, will concentrate on library
programmes. Thames had to threaten that The Bill would not be available to
ITV next year before a deal was agreed.
The Pounds 29m deal over 8 months compares with the Pounds 70m-Pounds 80m
worth of programmes Thames now sells to the network in a full year. It has
lost its current affairs programmes such as This Week, daytime programmes
and most of its comedy programmes.
Apart from The Bill the package covers a new series of Minder, This Is Your
Life, Wish You Were Here?, The Best of Tommy Cooper, Mr Bean and Count
Duckula.
Once the planned new central networking system is in place Thames will begin
negotiations for the supply of programmes to ITV beyond August 1993.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: European sales rise helps Low &amp; Bonar
improve to Pounds 11.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging and plastics company, yesterday
announced a slight increase in interim profits, buoyed by European sales.
At the pre-tax level they rose by 4.9 per cent to Pounds 11.8m.
Mr Jim Leng, who is being promoted later this year from chief executive,
Europe, to group chief executive, said the performance was due to improved
productivity and better margins, stemming from cost cutting.
Turnover for the six months to May 31 slipped to Pounds 151m (Pounds 152.2m)
due to lower prices and a fall off in North American sales. Poor demand for
industrial shipping sacks led to a pre-interest loss of Pounds 329,000 for
the US packaging division, compared to a Pounds 311,000 profit a year ago.
But European profits increased 20 per cent to Pounds 11m, despite difficult
markets. Margins improved from 9 per cent to 10.6 per cent and the UK
plastics division turned from a loss to a small profit.
Profits before interest increased 5.6 per cent to Pounds 13.1m. Interest
charges rose slightly to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 1.1m), partly caused by the
acquisition in May of a Dutch floorcovering company.
Earnings increased 6.7 per cent to 9.39p and the interim dividend is a
same-again 2.7p.
The shares gained 4p to 281p.
COMMENT
After falling out of favour for 18 months, Low &amp; Bonar is finding its way
back onto brokers' buy lists. The company's investment programme is starting
to show fruits in terms of improved productivity. As the programme winds
down, Low &amp; Bonar's capital expenditure to depreciation ratio is set to fall
from 2 times in 1990 to about 1.5 this year. The market also likes the look
of the new management. The one question mark hangs over US packaging, which
will remain a loss-maker this year and will only really turn round when
customers in the industrial and construction sectors see an improvement. The
shares, like the rest of the sector, have already anticipated recovery, but
forecast profits for the full year of Pounds 26m put Low &amp; Bonar on a
multiple of 13.7, which is not demanding.

FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Automotive side limits Triplex Lloyd's
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Triplex Lloyd slipped 7 per cent in the 12 months to
end-March as the industrial engineering group fought the weakness of the
building products market.
However, a strong performance by its automotive and engineering and power
divisions restricted the decline at the pre-tax line to Pounds 7.07m (Pounds
7.57m).
The group incurred an attributable loss of Pounds 2.59m after extraordinary
items of Pounds 3.09m to cover the write-off of loss-making Canadian
operations and a transfer to reserves of Pounds 4.85m for goodwill related
to those operations. There was a profit last time of Pounds 5.3m.
The strength of the performance in the automotive and power divisions led to
an increase of 18 per cent to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.7m) in operating
profits. The rise came largely because of an improvement in margins, from
6.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent in automotive and from 5.8 per cent to 7.4 per
cent in power.
Earnings per share were 11.4p, down from 12.7p. The recommended final
dividend is unchanged at 4.5p, bringing the total, for the third successive
year, to 7p.
Although the group expects little over the coming year from its building
products division, 'automotive and engineering and power divisions are well
positioned to sustain and indeed improve their profitability even if UK
economic activity should remain depressed,' said Mr Colin Cooke, chairman.
COMMENT
Triplex Lloyd is now benefiting from both an investment and acquisition
programme and a more concentrated focusing of its business. This is enabling
it to pick up business in the automotive sector and exploit a power sector
where demand is strong anyway. Exposure to the UK market is being reduced.
There is no reason why this incipient strength should not be more apparent
over the current year. Arguably then, the share price, latterly languishing
around its 1992 low, looks cheap compared with some of its peers. In the
expectation of higher profits this year - possibly about Pounds 9.5m, to
give earnings of 12.5p - the prospective multiple at 137p is under 11,
against an actual sector average of over 25.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Investors seek more European rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK institutional investors have written to European stock exchanges asking
them to move against restrictions which limit shareholders' ability to
obtain information about companies and influence management.
The UK Institutional Fund Management Association, a trade association, wrote
to heads of all European stock exchanges last week urging them to protect
voting rights of shareholders to encourage foreign investment.
'The association is concerned at the restrictions that exist in many
European countries on voting and shareholder rights,' said Mr Paddy Linaker,
IFMA chairman and chief executive of M&amp;G Group, the unit trust managers, in
the letter. 'We believe that the effect of restrictions on voting and
shareholder rights is to discourage investment interest and reduce
companies' access to capital, or at least worsen the terms on which it is
available.'
European companies - and the exchanges where their shares are traded - have
expressed little enthusiasm for UK and US-style shareholder activism.
Yesterday, Mr Ronald Weichert, a spokesman for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,
said the exchange did not believe its practices were restrictive or that
changes were necessary. German rules which allowed companies to limit
shareholders' votes to 5 per cent of their stake only affected a small
number of companies, he said.
UK fund managers, increasingly flexing their muscle with corporate boards at
home, have been frustrated by their lack of influence with European
corporate boards, in spite of rising investments there. Mr Stephen Dowds, a
director at Capital House Investment Management, said: 'The vast amounts of
money invested by international investors should not be seen by company
managements and controlling shareholders as a cheap source of funds to be
rewarded only by an annual report in English, the occasional presentation at
the Savoy and a fraction of a voting right.'
Ms Margaret Stoker, European fund manager at Capital House, cited Dutch
'certification' rules. These allow companies, such as Philips, to issue
shares into a holding company it controls. Voting rights then accrue to the
holding company and no hostile bid can succeed.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Bronfmans suffer from investors' unease: The problems facing
the Canadian family's convoluted empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A striking trend on the Toronto stock exchange (TSE) in recent months has
been the unremitting decline in the share prices of companies controlled by
the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family.
At the very least, the falls signal the investment community's growing
discomfort with the convoluted structure of the far-flung group, which
includes such pillars of Canadian business as Noranda, the country's biggest
mining and forestry group; Royal Trust, the second-largest trust company;
and Trizec, North America's leading publicly-traded property developer.
But the selling may also reflect a deeper unease at the intricate
cross-holdings that are a hallmark of the Bronfman empire, which controls
assets worth about CDollars 100bn (Pounds 43.6bn) and between 5 per cent and
15 per cent of the market capitalisation of the TSE.
Investments by individual companies in each other's preferred shares may
have created the perception that difficulties in one company could ripple
through others.
Between them, property companies Trizec and Bramalea have a debt load of
CDollars 14.7bn - CDollars 1bn more than the ailing Olympia &amp; York.
'This is a group that functions on dividend payments,' says the head of
research at one Toronto securities firm. 'If it doesn't get them, it runs
out of oxygen.'
Brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman are cousins of the heirs to the Seagram
liquor fortune, although the two businesses are completely separate.
The 64-year-old Mr Edward Bronfman began disengaging himself in 1989,
leaving Peter, 62, and his family with majority control of Edper Holdings,
the top company of the group. Most of the remaining shares in Edper are held
by the senior managers - led by South African-born Mr Jack Cockwell, 51 -
through Pagurian, a publicly-traded company.
Mr Cockwell and his colleagues decline to be interviewed. A spokesman said
that they blame the drop in share prices on a misconception that problems at
property developer Bramalea, which is struggling to stave off bankruptcy,
could undermine the rest of the group.
The property companies have taken the heaviest pounding in the stock market.
Earlier this week, Bramalea plunged to 78 cents, down from almost CDollars 5
at the beginning of this year. Trizec's shares are bumping along at their
lowest level for more than two decades.
Bramalea last month halted both common and preferred share dividends and
Trizec cut its semi-annual dividend from 18 to 12 cents a share. Cut off
from the debt markets, Trizec also heavily diluted its equity last month
with a CDollars 275m private placement which was priced far below the value
of its assets.
The question is whether other Bronfman companies will be forced to follow
Trizec and Bramalea's lead in trimming dividends. Judging by their share
prices, the market seems to believe they will.
Hees International, the group's merchant banking arm, has fallen to a
52-week low of just above CDollars 10. Royal Trust has tumbled from CDollars
8.25 at the end of March to CDollars 5.38 this week. Edper Enterprises, the
most senior publicly-traded company, also touched a one-year low of CDollars
4.10 earlier this month.
Beyond the property developers, concern is centred on Royal Trust, whose
main business is home mortgages and other financial services. RT's quarterly
earnings have failed to match dividends for the past two years, first as a
result of a string of problems in its European and US operations, and more
recently, the property slump in Canada.
Mr Kersi Doodha, analyst with Maison Placements Canada, said in a recent
report that 'management is of the view that so long as there is no
'permanent impairment' in profitability, payout of dividend higher than
earned is justified. More conservative investors may have a contrary view.'
An RT official insisted that the company was financially sound and knew of
no reason why the share price should have dropped as far as it had.
Nonetheless, share prices indicate that investors believe the quarterly
dividend, currently at 18.5 cents a share, will be cut when interim results
are published on July 23.
Noranda is another Bronfman company whose CDollars 1-per-share annual
dividend has far exceeded its profits in recent years. Second-quarter
earnings are also likely to be mediocre, and it is committed to heavy
spending to curb pollution at its pulp and paper mills.
But the directors appear to be hoping that profits will soon recover smartly
on the back of a further upturn in commodity prices.
Mr Julian Baldry, analyst at Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto, predicts that 'if
necessary, (Noranda) will sell assets to maintain the dividends'. If
anything, the plunge in share prices could stiffen the resolve of some
Bronfman companies not to cut dividends.
Compulsory share purchase schemes, often financed by bank loans, are another
hallmark of the Bronfman management style. The last thing that executives,
already staring a big capital loss in the face, want to see is a cut in
their personal income stream.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market has had its fill of prospectuses recently, so perhaps it was just
as well that yesterday's White Paper on the future of British Rail was as
exciting as a railway timetable, though without the hard information. By all
accounts there is considerable private sector interest in the project, but
until the Government spells out details like the extent - if any - of debt
obligations, the nature of the track charging system and the powers of the
regulator, it can scarcely be translated into action.
The real frustration is for companies like BICC and Trafalgar House, which
would benefit if BR's investment matched its aspirations. Maybe the answer
is to sell the whole network to SNCF in return for a French promise to
support London's pitch for the European central bank.

FT  15 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK life companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market had been expecting dire new business figures from Legal &amp;
General. But the reality yesterday of a one fifth drop in worldwide annual
premiums and a one third slide in single premiums served to knock a further
2 per cent off the shares. Admittedly, L &amp; G has been losing ground to its
rivals as part of a conscious effort to cut back its distribution network.
Nevertheless, the increasingly harsh impact of low consumer confidence on
the insurers raises the question of whether the sector is as defensive as
investors still seem to think.
Life companies, for instance, have outperformed the market by about 10 per
cent in the last four to five weeks on the grounds that there is huge hidden
shareholder wealth in their life funds which will prop up dividends for ever
and a day. It is certainly true that the gradual move towards accruals
accounting has served to highlight this crock of gold, and that where
companies are under pressure to get their hands on it ways of doing so can
be found. Most of the bigger groups hotly deny similar intent, but there was
intense industry interest last month when London and Manchester announced
that it had won Department of Trade and Industry blessing to transfer
surpluses on investments from non-profit and unit linked policies to the
profit and loss account.
All the same high bonuses, over-generous payouts and various misadventures -
not least L &amp; G's exposure to mortgage guarantee insurance - have left the
life companies weaker than they were even six months ago. It is worth
bearing in mind that the bulls went on buying the composite insurers
throughout much of last year on the argument that their strong balance
sheets would support at least a maintainted level of dividends. That cosy
theory will shortly be put to the test.

FT  15 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: BET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The mere 3 per cent dip in BET's share price yesterday in response to a
Pounds 200m rights issue is thought-provoking. The market is evidently glad
to see BET, like ECC before it, raising cash to pay off its auction market
preferred stock (Amps). But if a company were to seek cash to rid itself of
an excessive burden of floating rate debt - which in essence is what BET is
doing - would the market be so forgiving?
The timing behind BET's move is intelligible enough. The list of non-US
companies with Amps outstanding is getting shorter all the time, and the
market is showing worrying signs of illiquidity. If a BET auction were to
fail - as has happened to Ratners - the effects on the share price do not
bear thinking about. The fact remains, though, that the rights money will
cost BET a net 5.7 per cent - assuming a held dividend - against 4.6 per
cent for the Amps. The price of reduced risk for the company, in other
words, is dilution for the shareholders.
That apart, the withdrawal of BET from the Amps market, having been the
first non-US company to discover it in size, may be taken as the end of and
misunderstanding of these instruments in the UK may seem odd to a US
observer. But the market for Amps consists wholly of US investors who are
interested primarily in big, familiar, triple-A US corporations like
Coca-Cola and Exxon, rather than unknown foreign minnows.
Perhaps more to the point, several of the UK companies issuing them -
Maxwell Communication, for one - had every reason to disguise their true
balance sheet gearing and flatter their interest cover. Perhaps the epitaph
for Amps in the UK should be that for too many of the issuers, the true
rationale was the naivete of the UK market in scrutinising accounts.

FT  15 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: A tricky time of year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However disappointing the May figure for UK production, the broader picture
is still one of just perceptible upturn. In the latest three months,
manufacturing output was 0.6 per cent higher than the three months before.
What is unclear is whether this was merely part of the second-quarter blip.
If the latest retail statistics are a guide, the extra production may simply
have gone into excess stocks. If so, the next figure or two in the series is
going to look correspondingly depressing.
It is getting to the time of year when City economists are having to think
hard about whether to revise down their GDP forecasts for 1992. At present,
the consensus for growth in the calendar year is approximately zero. But
those forecasts were posited on the assumption that some kind of recovery
would be coming through by the mid-year. The next retail sales figures and
the surveys from the Confederation of British Industry will be scrutinised
accordingly. Everything hangs on the consumer, whose spirits seem to be
drooping with the passage of time. There remains, of course, the grisly
outside possibility that UK interest rates will actually go up. In that
case, the forecasting community might as well go fishing.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Labour leadership contest fails to fill the house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILL CLINTON and Al Gore may be playing to a full house of Democrats in New
York this week but in the UK the party faithful are unlikely to be standing
in the aisles when Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett are elected as
leader and deputy leader of the Labour party.
Guest celebrities are also likely to be thin on the ground this Saturday.
Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU engineering and electrical union - the
third biggest union affiliated to the Labour party - will be attending a
family wedding.
His union's cheerleading contingent will be reduced from the customary
70-plus to a mere six delegates for the meeting of the electoral college in
the giant Royal Horticultural Hall in London.
The GMB general union is sending 22 delegates instead of its usual 80 and
the National Union of Mineworkers is sending one delegate. He is not even an
executive member.
The unions, which account for 40 per cent of the electoral college, will be
heavily outnumbered by the 650 delegates from the constituency parties which
have 30 per cent of the vote, and the 270 Labour MPs, who also have 30 per
cent. The latter have to attend in person for their votes to count.
For a party that has been accused of relying too much on glitz and trade
unions, a sharp reduction in both might be counted a blessing.
But most union leaders will still be there and the Labour press office has
been wondering how it can avoid those television shots of trade union barons
dropping their votes into the ballot box.
There will be no windy speeches from trade union bosses. Indeed there will
be scarcely any speeches at all.
Mr John Evans, the Labour chairman, will make some introductory remarks.
After the votes are counted the victors will say a few words.
For the leftwing NUM executive this lack of opportunity for traditional
labour movement rhetoric was described as an 'insult' and accounts for the
lack of a delegation.
Rightwing unions are also irritated by the unnecessary cost of the day. Mr
Jordan said there was overwhelming support for Mr Smith and no need for a
contest at all.
Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the electricians sections of the AEEU, said the
voting could have been done by post. 'It will prove an extremely expensive
ballot box and the money could have been better used for other things,' he
said.
On one thing almost everyone seems to be agreed - it will never happen again
like this.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: Minimum reserves answer to German monetary expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WIM BOONSTRA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As German monetary expansion is purely a domestic phenomenon, the
Bundesbank should pursue a policy that aims directly at its source, viz
German bank credit. In addition, the bank should try to minimise adverse
implications of its tight monetary policy for other EC countries.
The solution to the dilemma is relatively simple. An increase in minimum
reserve requirement rates will dampen bank credit expansion, without
necessarily leading to increased money market interest rates. Therefore, one
could suppose that a combination of an increase in minimum reserve
requirement rates and a lower interest rate on the Bundesbank weekly repo
tenders will tighten monetary conditions in Germany, while at the same time
creating room for monetary easing elsewhere in Europe. Other Bundesbank
measures (increasing the discount or Lombard rates, or limiting the discount
or Lombard facility) will all lead to higher money market interest rates.
As a result of the sharply inverted yield curve, this will lead to a further
acceleration of M3 expansion, as investors move into high yielding
short-term deposits. If the Bundesbank seriously wants to dampen monetary
expansion, an increase in the minimum reserve requirement rates is the only
measure that would make sense. If, however, the bank decides to raise
interest rates once again on Thursday, one could suspect it of having a
parallel agenda. Monetary policy could well be an instrument to lecture on
central bank independency in Europe.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: When memory is altered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER HINES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Alan Cane's excellent and well-balanced article on the
subject of 'altered' IBM memory (Technology, July 10).
The fact that altered memory has been supplied to end users by leasing and
broking companies, sometimes knowingly, mostly unknowingly, cannot be
denied.
Neither can it be denied that some of this memory has been altered using
incorrect components and/or to an unacceptable standard of workmanship.
These practices have already been condemned by all responsible members of
the leasing and broking community, which wish to supply only equipment -
whether altered or not - which is acceptable both to IBM and to the end
user.
To this end, it would be helpful if IBM would tell us whether or not IBM
itself alters or reconfigures or creates 'new' IBM memory which it then
incorporates into its 'new' machines out of used chips and memory cards in
exactly the same way as the companies it is now suing.

<TEXT>
Sir, Before readers of your delightful article on the Church's missing
millions (July 11) reach for their cheque books, may I point out that the
figure of Pounds 12,000 as the pay of the clergy is misleading?
In December 1982, the Church Commissioners, in a memorandum to the General
Synod, estimated that a vicar was better off with his stipend of Pounds
5,802, plus his tax-efficient perks, than if he were to be paid Pounds
10,500 only, with no housing. Adjusting for inflation, the perks therefore
now seem to be worth Pounds 8,099 making, with the average stipend of Pounds
12,800, a total of Pounds 20,899. In the interim, interest-free loans have
been made available for car purchase.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Foreign Affairs: Europe bares its claws - Although a defence
structure is developing, the relationship with Nato remains unresolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a strange, crabwise fashion, Europe's 'defence identity' continues to
develop. Last December, in Maastricht, the nine member states of the Western
European Union (WEU) declared their intention of developing that body 'as
the defence component of the European Union and as a means to strengthen the
European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance'.
This week WEU is holding two meetings in Rome: one to open negotiations on
the enlargement of its membership, which was also agreed in principle at
Maastricht; the other to organise the naval operations, aimed at enforcing
UN sanctions against Serbia, which were agreed in Helsinki last week.
The Maastricht decision on enlargement concerns essentially Greece and
Turkey. The former, as a member of the EC, and putatively therefore of the
future European Union, is invited to 'accede to WEU';the latter, as a
European member of Nato outside the EC, is invited to become an 'associate
member' of WEU with 'the possibility of participating fully' in its
activities.
The distinction is important to those, especially the French, who are
determined that the EC must eventually evolve into a full political union
with its own defence, separate from - even though still allied to - the US.
Whereas for those (notably the British) to whom Nato remains the
indispensable and irreplaceable framework of European defence, it was vital
that European members of Nato such as Turkey should not be debarred from
helping to 'strengthen the European pillar'.
Associate membership was a compromise solution. The trouble with it is that
WEU is a mutual defence pact, whose members are obliged by treaty to go to
each other's assistance if attacked. As a mere associate member, Turkey will
not benefit from this guarantee, but will have to remain content with the
slightly weaker guarantee in the Atlantic treaty, which says merely that an
attack against any of the signatories, in Europe or the North Atlantic, will
be considered an attack against all. So Turkey is being offered the dubious
privilege of being invited to participate in WEU's activities, without
obtaining the extra security that WEU membership should provide.
Even on those terms Britain and some others were unhappy about Greek
membership, fearing that it would drag them into a Greek-Turkish conflict on
the Greek side. That has now been avoided by last month's Petersberg
Declaration, which specifies that the mutual assistance clause will not
apply to conflicts between allies: a rather extraordinary statement, since
it implies a licence for allies to attack each other with impunity. Since
Greece traditionally regards Turkey as the most serious potential threat to
its security, it would not be surprising if it decided that WEU membership
on those terms was not worth having.
Meanwhile, the Adriatic mission is the first operation entrusted to WEU
within Europe. Until now, Nato enthusiasts have suggested that WEU should
only act outside the Nato area, so as not to get in the way of the really
important business. That position has proved untenable: how can an
organisation purporting to express a 'European defence identity' be debarred
from taking any direct part in the defence of Europe?
But the relationship between WEU and Nato is still far from satisfactorily
defined. The two appear to be in competition in offering their services to
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe for peacekeeping
duties. In the Adriatic operation (which is notionally enforcement, not
peacekeeping) they are supposed to be co-operating. Does this mean that WEU
members will contribute to the WEU force, while others contribute to the
Nato force? That might seem logical, but Britain is going to oppose it at
the Rome meeting. British officials do not like the idea of a Nato force
composed of 'the US and the also rans'. They think, apparently, that WEU
members should contribute some ships to the WEU force and some to the Nato
force.
One can only hope that these Byzantine discussions do not reach the ears of
the hapless Bosnians, in whose interests the operation is supposedly being
conducted. In fact, of course, it has very little to do with their
interests. The Dutch defence minister, among others, has admitted quite
openly that sending forces to the Adriatic is 'a political gesture' which
will not prevent any strategic goods from reaching Serbia. The force does
not have power to arrest ships, and in any case supplies are said to be
reaching Serbia via the Danube rather than the Adriatic.
Neither Nato nor the WEU has any intention or expectation of rescuing Bosnia
by military means (although the moment for rescuing it by any other means,
if there ever was one, is long past). Bosnia is simply the laboratory in
which formulae for future European defence are being tested.
The British government is pleased with itself for having got other WEU
members, including France, to accept the principle of strengthening Nato's
'European pillar'. Yet it refuses to accept the logical consequence, which
would be to canalise the European contribution to Nato through WEU.
It is true that this is made more difficult by the fact that France does not
belong to Nato's integrated command structure. Nato commanders are
understandably bothered by the fact that the new Franco-German corps, now
baptised 'Eurocorps', will include some troops that are answerable to them
and others that are not. Besides, it is questionable whether there is any
military logic, in post-cold war Europe, in setting up a new main defence
force composed largely of conscripts, when the strategic requirement is
clearly for professional forces, flexible and highly mobile, able to
undertake a variety of assignments at short notice.
But Britain's obsession with the supposed danger to Nato from the Eurocorps
is such that Whitehall bridles even when a non-governmental US think tank,
the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, dares to suggest* that the US
should take a more relaxed attitude on the matter. Yet the ostensible
objection to the Eurocorps is that it will antagonise the Americans. Not for
the first time, London seems determined to be more royalist than the king,
or rather more Atlanticist than Washington.
Britain's desire to reintegrate France into the common defence of Europe is,
if sincere, entirely laudable. But to keep insisting on French reintegration
into the present structures of Nato is self-defeating.
On this point even the strongly Europeanist critique of British defence
policy produced last week by the Institute for Public Policy Research** has
missed the point. The French do not want a Europeanised Nato, even under a
European supreme commander. They want a genuine two-pillar alliance, with
Europe's contribution mediated through a single structure, namely the WEU. I
must be very obtuse, but I cannot see why that is such a bad idea, or why it
is assumed that the US will be against it.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: No good reason for advocating that Lord Weinstock
should retire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir SIGMUND STERNBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your series of articles on GEC comes to the fairly obvious conclusion
that it is a successful, well-run company and that much of its success is
due to the energy and wisdom, over many years, of its chairman, Lord
Weinstock.
Nevertheless, you seem to believe that Lord Weinstock, who is 67, should
retire and you say that the main institutional shareholders in GEC say that
'there is no question of Mr Simon Weinstock succeeding his father'.
Both these statements are controversial to say the least. There are many
successful companies which have, at their head, chairmen who are in their
late 60s and 70s. Equally there are companies where son succeeds father over
a number of generations. The Rothschild and Sainsbury families are examples,
and there are others.
So far as age is concerned, you may be interested to know that I founded my
own company, ISYS, when I was in my late 60s, and created a product which
has revolutionised the implementation of computer application now used by
the world's largest corporations daily. On my board is a previously retired
personality, who has proved most successful.
Likewise my charitable foundation's director is a retired communal executive
who is doing well in his new career. Your own article (Man in the News, July
11) about Taikichiro Mori who, at 88 and still active, is the richest
businessman in the world, is a further indication that age need not be a
barrier to success. Sigmund Sternberg,

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS

<TEXT>
'I have heard all the arguments before; only the countries using them change
from time to time' - Professor Posthuma of the Netherland Bank, quoted in De
Vries, The Non-reform of the International Monetary System, 1976.
Nobody who had to report on the international crises of the 1960s and 1970s
can watch the present argument within the European Monetary System without
an agonising sense of deja vu. There is one huge change: the Americans are
now on the sidelines. Floating has its own problems, but does confer a
degree of freedom. A system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates allows
little room for conflicting interests, and so political horns may be truly
locked, and negotiation turn into a multilateral monologue - the term a
frustrated Jeremy Morse coined to describe the futile wrangling in the
Committee of Twenty (charged with designing a new world monetary system, and
known for the past 18 years as the Interim Committee, thus confirming his
pessimism).
The rules of a fixed-rate wrangle require first a pivot currency, which is
also the core store of value in the system. Within Europe the D-Mark has
taken over this role, and with it, the charges that used to be brought again
the Americans, and the defences they used to put up. German domestic policy
has its main impact outside Germany; or as the French once said of the
Americans, when they sneeze, the rest of the system catches pneumonia. But
the Germans now argue, as the Americans did in the early 1970s, that this is
a problem for their partners, not for them; they are free to adjust their
policies, or their exchange rates, if that would make them more comfortable.
The standard response, now as then, is to attack the domestic policies of
the core country. The received wisdom of the rest of Europe is that German
fiscal policy is too lax and its monetary policy too tight. A decade ago,
exactly the same charges were made against President Ronald Reagan - though
in a floating system, they were made with less heat. These charges are
rejected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in
its new German report, although this does question the German stress on the
growth of M3 as a policy target.
But there is no such thing as a new mistake; Lady Thatcher (or more likely,
Lord Lawson) could prove from British experience that when interest rates
are pushed up, broad money grows faster, not slower. If the Germans continue
to repeat UK history, the European currencies may be dragged up to almost
any level against the dollar, with results for the whole continent as
damaging as they were for Britain then. UK policy was reversed thanks to Sir
Alan Walters, who had the ear of Mrs Thatcher. But Sir Alan is now
marginalised as one of the Liverpool Six; even if one man had similar
influence in Europe, it is not clear whose ear he would have to win.
Meanwhile, the German reply has been rehearsed many times before: their
partners should agree to a D-Mark revaluation, which would check German
inflation and stimulate demand in the rest of the system. The French have
taken up their traditional blocking position, and have now been joined by Mr
John Major, the British prime minister, who is clearly another
number-fetishist. History unfortunately suggests that the economic situation
will have to get alarmingly worse before they can be frightened out of their
fixed poses.
However, history does contain partial solutions, as well as endlessly
recurring problems. Three might be applicable here. First, countries with
strong currencies can do something to keep their troubles and restraints at
home, even if they allow free capital movements. From 1960 to 1978, the
Germans or the Swiss repeatedly used withholding taxes, or special bardepot
reserve requirement on their banks, to discourage foreign inflows. These
measures were never fully effective - notably, they leave business in the
strong-currency country free to borrow cheaply abroad; but they were partly
effective, and would allow some interest-rate freedom for partners.
A second possibility would be for the Germans to bang heads together, as the
Americans repeatedly did - once by marooning the whole Group of Five on the
circling presidential yacht Sequoia, on a broiling Washington day, until
they reached agreement. Under such pressures the French did agree to a
rising D-Mark, the Japanese did revalue, and gold was demonetised.
Or simplest (and unfortunately least probable), Germany could imitate
another form of American floating, and leave the ERM for a time (an
interim?) while reunification is sorted out, and float Reagan-like above
their troubles and ours.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Leading Article: No revolution for British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN REACHING a verdict on yesterday's white paper on the future of British
Rail, it is necessary first to ask what it is trying to achieve. Anyone who
had hoped for revolutionary change is likely to be disappointed. But if the
goal is a better railway, then it offers - potentially - a step in the right
direction. However, without further radical changes in transport policy, the
white paper is unlikely to improve rail services greatly - and could even
accelerate their decline.
By common consensus, there is much that is wrong with BR. A long period of
underinvestment in the 1970s and 1980s has left it without the equipment
needed to deliver a uniformly attractive and reliable passenger service. The
deficiency is especially noticeable on some of the more heavily used
commuter services in London and south-east England. The problem is
exacerbated by a management culture that has only recently started to
grapple with the idea that BR exists for the convenience of its customers
rather than its employees.
Privatisation could, in theory, put this right - first, by giving the
railways access to private capital for investment, and second, by leading to
a radical change of culture among managers and staff. But after years of
wrestling with different ways of achieving this desirable objective, the
government has had to accept that, even taking into account the potential
for efficiency gains, there is not enough profit to be had from Britain's
railways to attract any buyers. There will be no glitzy sale of BR shares to
the general public in this privatisation.
Evolutionary approach
The government has, instead, opted for an evolutionary approach. For the
present, only the freight operations and the stations are to be offered for
sale, while the railway tracks will remain under BR's ownership.
Private-sector operators will be invited to introduce new services to BR's
tracks, but the only significant change to BR's existing passenger services
is that the private sector will be invited to bid for franchises to run
them.
Insofar as this counts as privatisation at all, it is a pretty watered-down
version. True, the franchising arrangement offers scope for the private
sector to inject that much-sought-after change in management culture, but
this is about all. Depressingly, since the tracks and most of the trains
will remain in BR's ownership, so will most of the responsibility for
railway investment, which means it will be just as tightly constrained by
the public sector borrowing requirement as ever.
Substantial upgrading
In practice, therefore, there is little chance that passengers will see big
changes in services in the near future. Franchisees are likely to be
interested in running only the few lines that have already benefited from
substantial upgrading. Even here, their enthusiasm will be determined by how
much money they believe they can make from a franchise, which will hang in
turn on how much they have to pay for the use of BR's tracks.
It is on this crucial issue of track charges that the success of rail
privatisation depends. Railways are in tough competition with other
transport modes, particularly roads. If would-be train operators find that
railway track costs are disproportionately high, compared with the cost of
using the roads, they are unlikely to see any potential for acceptable
returns; and privatisation, with all its potential benefits, will fail.
Indeed, there is a danger that BR will be left with the rail network and the
least profitable services, while the cream is skimmed by the private sector.
The Treasury would be even less willing or able to find the greater amounts
then needed to finance the necessary modernisation.
Nevertheless, by separating the track infrastructure from the trains,
yesterday's white paper at least creates an opportunity to encourage a
socially desirable transfer of traffic from road to rail, by levelling out
the relative costs of access to the two. Since the government is unlikely to
increase subsidies to the railways to reduce track costs, charges should be
raised for road users to reflect the social costs of additional traffic, by
means of a combination of higher fuel taxes and tolls on motorways. If the
government fails to increase costs to road users, the rail revolution will
not happen.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Leading Article: South Africa at the UN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of constitutional talks in South Africa, rising political
violence, an impending general strike and the growing antagonism between
President FW de Klerk and the African National Congress (ANC) leader, Mr
Nelson Mandela, are a dangerous and volatile combination.
What lies in store for the republic may well be a painful and protracted
confrontation between white and black nationalism that outsiders are
helpless to avert. But if today's emergency meeting of the UN Security
Council can help curb the violence that led the ANC to break off talks, thus
assisting the parties to return to the negotiating table once more, the
opportunity to do so should be seized.
Such an opportunity may, in fact, exist. Mr de Klerk's offer to accept the
presence of international observers as part of a fresh multi-party
initiative to combat violence falls far short of Mr Mandela's call for a UN
monitoring force. But it is welcome, nevertheless. The offer will be more
credible if Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, makes a
convincing case when he sets out the government's position on violence and
the constitutional negotiations before the Security Council. The government
has the means to quell most of the violence; it must demonstrate it also has
the will.
On its own, a group of international observers, backed by military and
police advisers - which is what Mr de Klerk may have in mind and the
Commonwealth secretariat has already proposed - will probably be
ineffectual. But there already exists a framework in which such observers
could operate as facilitators of the peace process, providing support and
advice to local institutions, all the while reminding the warring parties
that they are coming under increasing international scrutiny.
Sensible agreement
Part of that framework is the National Peace Accord signed last September by
all leading parties, including the ANC, the government and Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party. This document has been
honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Yet it remains an
eminently sen-sible agreement which, given political will on all sides,
could form the basis for resolution of the conflict in South Africa. Among
other elements, it contains a code of conduct for the security forces and
political parties. It also provides for local and regional committees to
resolve political disputes. Its work would be enhanced by the advice of
international observers.
International inquiry
Such a group would also be able to draw on the investigations of a judicial
inquiry into township violence under Mr Justice Goldstone, whose integrity
and independence are not in question. The commission has started an
investigation of last month's massacre at Boipatong, in which 42 people
died. Two international legal experts have joined the commission, which goes
some way towards meeting the ANC call for an international inquiry into the
massacre.
If Mr de Klerk genuinely wants to resolve his country's crisis, he needs to
do more. The South African government must tell the UN today that security
force units notorious for their brutality, such as 32 Battalion, will be
disbanded, as will police units consisting of former members of Koevoet, the
counter-insurgency force that once operated in Namibia; that carrying of
dangerous weapons in public will be banned and the law enforced; and that
hostels, the source of much of the friction in the Johannesburg region, will
be upgraded and properly policed.
This is merely to put into effect proposals previously advanced by Justice
Goldstone's commission, which began sitting last year and recently condemned
the government's inadequate response in terms amounting to an indictment of
Mr de Klerk's handling of the violence wracking South Africa. To ignore the
commission's recommendations, Justice Goldstone said, 'can only be
calculated to diminish if not destroy the credibility and effectiveness not
only of the commission but also of the government'. If President de Klerk
can satisfy an international observer group that he is taking heed of this
warning, then South Africa's peace process could be put back on track.

ON its first night BBC1's new soap, Eldorado (7.00) had to face a double
episode of Coronation Street (7.30 ITV) which must have had some effect on
its pulling power, and anyway a first week must inevitably be
unrepresentative. Now, with its fifth episode tonight, it is beginning to
operate under conditions which will become the norm. Channel 4 screens the
news against it and BBC2 a yoof programme which should not cause too much
worry. But what about the greybeard game show Take Your Pick (7.00) on ITV?
Doubtless the soap will prevail in the long term, but for a while ITV may
have success fighting soap with game. BBC2's 'Screenplay', Bad Girl (9.00)
is a first drama by George Case, previously a documentary director. The
story is about a young single mother whose son is taken into care after he
is injured. It is claimed 'her predicament has echoes of a 'Cathy Come Home'
for the 90s'. Among the rock and roll greats, Chuck Berry has the sort of
reputation Tommy Cooper had among leading comedians: the greatest natural
talent of them all. Berry is the subject of Mojo Working (11.05 C4).

FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: Cheltenham Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE scene at Cheltenham Town Hall told a sorry tale. With a commendable
degree of realism, only half the hall had been laid out with seats and even
those were far from full. The recession has caught up with the Festival and
visitors are averse to being adventurous.
The programme was planned in more ambitious times. This year's theme is
Switzerland's influence on 20th-century music, although by the middle of the
festival fortnight there were already as many holes in that plan as in a
portion of Swiss cheese. The events looked much more the traditional
Cheltenham offering of varied new music, British and foreign, in readily
digestible helpings.
The main interest of the central weekend was the pairing of two new violin
concertos: the first British performance of the second violin concerto by
the Danish composer Poul Ruders and the premiere of the Violin Concerto by
Paul Patterson. Each had its merits and, given the contrast in styles, they
benefited from being heard in close proximity.
Ruders is an individualist who has drawn inspiration from sources far and
wide. Ives, Stravinsky, de Falla and Sibelius have all been mentioned in the
front rank, with Tippett and Schnittke close behind, but none of those
seemed the slightest bit relevant here. The Second Violin Concerto is mostly
slow and melancholy (the composer's own word for the second of its four
interlinked movements).
If any style comes to mind, it is what Mahler might have done if he had
lived to progress beyond the Tenth Symphony. The solo part consists of long,
yearning lines which stretch upwards into the very limits of the violin's
compass. The three slow sections are too similar and the fast fourth takes
too long to arrive. But Rebecca Hirsch played every note of the solo part as
though it was fit to burst with emotion. The brooding orchestral backdrop
was provided on Monday by Kees Bakels and the Bournemouth Symphony
Orchestra.
Two days earlier the Violin Concerto by Paul Patterson was less ambitious in
where it wanted to go, but it is that much surer of its ground. The concerto
is not too long, as the Ruders was, and its proportions are well worked out.
The first brooding movement, a soulful threnody for the violin, fails to
develop the argument sufficiently strongly for the rest of the concerto to
seem a necessity. The slow movement, however, is appealing, if
over-sentimental; the finale has sparkle. Malcolm Layfield visibly lived the
solo part and the Goldberg Ensemble supported him with a trim accompaniment.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: Feminists to a man - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE we no longer seem to have the sort of judges who quaver 'What are the
Beatles?', we really ought to slap a preservation order on Lord Rees-Mogg,
who clearly comes from the same club. Peering out from behind those
spectacles and speaking in that endearing lisp, he delivers wonderfully
potty pronouncements upon television.
His latest corker is the assertion that because television is run largely by
men, television drama is dominated by male attitudes and male fantasies, and
for evidence he cites the sex scenes in Melvyn Bragg's A Time To Dance.
It seems his attention was drawn to this by complaints to his clean-up
group. How many complaints? Conveniently he cannot remember. More than 300?
'Oh no, less than that'. It would not be surprising if it was fewer than 30,
since the BBC's monthly aggregation of complaints by category shows that sex
comes way down the list, usually outnumbered 20, 30 or 40 times by
complaints about scheduling ('Why, oh why must you drop children's
programmes to stay with the tennis?').
What the dear old buffer has missed is that even though men do predominate
in broadcasting, these days they are feminists to a man, which has a
profound effect upon television drama, a fact which could not possibly
escape anybody who watched as much television as the average viewer.
From Coronation Street to Clarissa men are depicted with contempt. They are
shown as weak, inept, inferior to women in every way, and simultaneously
sexually rapacious and incapable of satisfying women in bed.
If he watched Eldorado he would find that the men ranged from wimps to
criminals, all of them inadequate, stupid, sly, or incompetent - sometimes
all four. Did Lord Rees-Mogg see ITV's excellently acted and produced Firm
Friends with Billie Whitelaw and Madhur Jaffrey, which treated all men as
something that needed scraping off women's shoes? Still, we should not
complain too much; the prating peer adds hugely to the sum of national
merriment.
                              *      *      *
Disparaging men as a group is, of course, highly fashionable (imagine
programmes taking the same attitude to black people) and is unlikely to harm
Eldorado. The word 'flop' has been used widely to describe a first night
audience of 6m, a figure undreamed of in the circulation departments of the
newspapers using the word.
Twice as many people, we are told, watched ITV's spoiler - the 60-minute
Coronation Street special. What we are not told, though it must surely be
significant now that more than 80 per cent of British homes have video
recorders, is how many regular Street viewers, who presumably constitute the
bulk of Eldorado's target audience, were taping the newcomer while watching
their old favourite.
No soap opera ever started at the top of the ratings, and the proof of the
Eldorado pudding will, as usual, be in the eating. Leaving aside the quality
of the drama, this promises to be a long term winner. The idea of using the
sunny Spanish setting, familiar to so many package-tour Britons, as the
permanent location looks shrewd (a perpetual holiday) and the success of the
Australian soaps suggests that the teenage element will also be a big
attraction.
Whether the BBC ought to be spending Pounds 10m a year on such stuff is
another question, but 12 months from now, when Eldorado is nudging
Coronation Street at the top of the ratings, the BBC will use it as proof
that they do not merely spend the licence fee on pointy-headed drama for a
Hampstead minority but serve all the public some of the time.
                              *      *      *
Lord Rees-Mogg has not been the only source of 'Shock] Horror]' headlines
about television recently. Reports about the current issue of Cultural
Trends say that, according to its figures from the Policy Studies Institute,
viewers are watching four hours a week less television today than they were
in 1985. Yet if you consult the figures produced by BARB, the joint BBC/ITV
ratings body, you find that the hours viewed in the first week of the month
for the first six months of 1985 and 1992 (this year's figures in brackets)
are: 34.03 (32.47), 29.44 (29.09), 28.13 (28.59), 27.56 (27.53), 25.19
(26.19) and 22.27 (23.13).
Of course newspapers love 'trends' which show television viewing falling,
but not only do these figures fail to bear out the claimed trend (over the
long term the graph shows a pretty steady rise) but today's figures still
exclude the viewing of rented videos.
                              *      *      *
However big the ratings for televised motor racing (and in Britain it seems
likely that nationalism is currently a major factor in these figures, thanks
to Nigel Mansell's unprecedented success), the sport as spectacle becomes
more and more tedious because of the Alice In Wonderland handicapping
system.
In a sensible sport such as sailing, you establish which boats go fastest
and start them at the back of the fleet so that they have to overtake
everyone else to win. In motor racing, as viewers of the British Grand Prix
saw on Sunday, they do the opposite, starting the fastest car from the
front. The effect, predictably, is a procession in which the fastest car is
never passed.
The televising of soccer with its boring nil-nil draws has prompted this
column to demand the doubling of goal sizes and the abandonment of goalies
in the hope of achieving 50 or 60 goals a match. For the sake of viewers
everywhere, perhaps this should be broadened into a Campaign For Sensible
Sport, urging that in motor racing the slowest should start first and the
fastest last, with enough of a stagger to avoid crashes at the first bend.
If they wanted a real contest of driver skills, they could handicap the cars
according to their speed - but that might scupper the constructors'

Does your heart sink when you are watching a good athletics meeting and the
commentator follows an event with the words 'Now Charlie Farnsbarns is
trackside with my colleague. . .'? Willy-nilly, the programme comes to a
halt and is turned into a chat show, usually a bad one. You can hear
athletes parroting coaches and newspaper reporters ('Well, with the Olympics
coming up it's gotta be a great morale booster for me' said Colin Jackson
during ITV's Crystal Palace programme on Friday), just as you can hear
convicts in prison documentaries parroting social workers ('I'm alienated
from me dad, see, it's all sibling rivalry, innit?').
If the rule was that interviews with athletes were screened only when they
had something original to say we would get 50 per cent more sport in these
programmes. Channel 4's Tour De France gets it right: they leave the race
for about 30 seconds to tell you some odd detail about modern bicycle design
or a rider's antecedents, and then dive straight back into the peloton.
                              *      *      *
There are so few programmes of arts criticism on television that almost any
addition is welcome, but Siskel and Ebert, the cinema series on BBC2, seems
a particularly odd choice.
First, one of the few critical programmes we do already have is Barry
Norman's excellent Film 92, so the time would be better devoted to dance or
drama or even television itself, a subject in which the public is rather
interested despite the supercilious attitude of many broadcasting executives
who tend to watch even less than Lord Rees-Mogg.
Second, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert make their buddy-buddy programme about
new releases for an American network, so they are forever saying 'Coming up
next ..' or 'After the break ..' which, on BBC2, is absurd because all they
can do is fade to black and promptly resume. Moreover talk about a movie
being a 'CN17 not an R' is meaningless in Britain. Why not Powell and
Andrews or Malcolm and Walker?

oddly - pirouetting cygnets. On-stage processes an electronic swan driven by
a man in a fluffy white boa and spangly trews. No, not the latest flight of
fancy by English National Opera but a rather sedate entrance by Andy Bell,
the voice of Erasure.
Erasure are the tabloid version of Pet Shop Boys, a camp duo (the gnome-like
Vince Clarke looks after the music) who have been worthily successful with
albums that knit up-front lyrics ('A little respect') with disco rhythms,
and a commitment to stage spectaculars which thrill the mass market and even
get approving nods from the gay community.
At the Hammersmith Odeon for the next week, there is a traditional non-stop
variety show. The Pet Shop Boys have similar ambitions, but while their
performances look as if they have been modelled on some contemporary Belgian
dance theatre troupe, Erasure seem inspired by the late night revues put on
at the Gargoyle, or one of those extinct night clubs that catered for Arabs.
The eight dancers stream on in costumes ranging from red plastic to lycra
bikinis: and how glad you are to see them. Without the business, the charms
of Andy Bell, a Gazza figure without the footballer's wit, would quickly
pall.
Bell is my sticking point about the show. I admire a man who performs
happily wearing Y-fronts. I liked his sturdy voice. I was almost touched
when he slipped on red shoes to sing 'Over the rainbow', but could he not
manage one witty remark, one less-than-oafish expression.
This apart, Erasure offers one of the best musical tickets in town. Their
Abba parody, which has taken them to the top of the charts, is rather tossed
away on stage, but there are entertaining cameos. Clarke, who hides his
gadgetry inside some kind of mobile farm cart, is intriguing with his poker
face and occasional desires to dress as Mae West; the dancers show classical
points; the backing singers are identical twins from Mauritius, an obvious
plus.
The most successful sequence is a lively cowboy number, when Bell, wearing a
tinsely blue outfit designed to show off his bottom, rouses the crowd by
singing 'Stand by your man'. Fun, but somehow predictable.
The audience was packed with happy bopping kids rather than gays, which
suggests that Erasure is more committed to pop success than taking camp into
yet more outrageous territory.

DONIZETTI'S Tyrolean opera comique needs an intrepid titular soprano, a
lusty romantic tenor with some style, and a ripe mezzo of interesting
character. On Monday, the Royal College of Music Opera School fielded just
such a team, young though they were. With the student orchestra playing
admirably for Michael Rosewell, whose expert brio was a tonic throughout, it
was an evening of many pleasures.
The piece was sung and spoken in courageous French, heartened by the fact
that the appealing heroine Anne-Marie Panzarella is French. Her bright
soprano is surprisingly full-toned already, and ascends confidently (a hint
of steam-whistle at the top would probably vanish in a larger theatre); the
personality is broad-gauge and direct, but there was much graceful feeling
in her sad Act 2 air. No divination is needed to predict a happy career for
her.
There was odder French from her sweetheart Tonio and her lofty 'aunt', La
Marquise. That, however, was part of their exotic charm - for the tenor
Ya-Lin Zhang is Chinese, and the mezzo Naoko Noma hails from Osaka. He has a
forthright Italianate ring, with real metal in his timbre, and is
presentably handsome (but somewhat plump: nothing became him like trading in
his Tyrolean Lederhosen for a decent French uniform). She wields a vocal
instrument of intriguing potential and colour, and an ultra-mannered persona
which may develop into something striking and dramatically valuable.
Only the baritone Laurence Whitehead sounded hampered by too-cautious
French, in the lengthy comprimario role of Sulpice. It wants a lot of fluent
character: he was competent, but rather a dull stick. The young chorus made
a brave noise that belied their numbers, and their high spirits were a
consistent asset.
The production by Vernon Mound is eager but raw (strong on
formation-marching, helpless with individual character). Robert Lloyd's sets
are kitschy-peculiar, and impossible to light well - as David Whittlestone
evidently discovered: his self-conscious lighting-tricks were mildly
irritating. None of that mattered much.
Monday's principals and conductor appear again on Thursday; the final
performance on Friday features an alternate solo team and a different
conductor. Both are sold out.

FT  15 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Surveyor may owe duty of care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NICHOLAS H Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst:
July 2 1992
A SHIPS' classification society owes a duty of care capable of giving rise
to a liability in damages to cargo-owners if its surveyor's recommendation
influences shipowners to sail a defective ship and, as was reasonably
foreseeable, she sinks with the cargo on board.
Mr Justice Hirst so held on a preliminary issue in an action by Marc Rich &amp;
Co AG, owners of cargo carried on Nicholas H, against the Japanese
classification society, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai.
HIS LORDSHIP said the action arose out of the total loss on March 9 1986 of
Nicholas H and her cargo on a voyage from Peru and Chile to Italy and the
Soviet Union.
The cargo consisted of lead and zinc concentrate owned by Marc Rich. The
total pleaded value of the lost cargo was over Dollars 8m.
The action was begun against the shipowners and Nippon. The owners sought to
limit liability under the Hague Rules, and the claim against them was
settled for Dollars 500,000. The action against Nippon was for the Dollars
5.5m balance.
The claim against Nippon was in tort. The preliminary issue was whether on
the facts pleaded Nippon owed a duty of care to Marc Rich capable of giving
rise to liability in damages.
For the purposes of the preliminary issue only, the facts were assumed.
The vessel loaded at Callao in Peru and Antofagasta in Chile.
On February 22 1986 she anchored off San Juan, Puerto Rico, with a crack in
her hull. Further cracks developed. Arrangements were made for Nippon to
survey the vessel at anchor.
The surveyor's report recommended that repairs be carried out at the nearest
port prior to sailing to Italy, and that the vessel be retained as classed
subject to those conditions.
The recommendation would have involved permanent repairs, for which
facilities were available locally.
Temporary repairs were carried out. The shipowners baulked at carrying out
the recommended permanent repairs.
The vessel was surveyed again. The surveyor recommended that she proceed to
Italy, the repairs to be examined and dealt with as necessary after
discharging cargo.
On March 2 the vessel sailed. The following day the temporary repairs
cracked. On March 9 she sank with all her cargo. There were no casualties.
Marc Rich alleged that Nippon was negligent in altering the initial
recommendation and permitting the vessel to continue her voyage when only
temporary repairs had been carried out.
Mr Gross for Marc Rich contended that as a result of recent decisions the
law had drawn a clear dividing line between physical damage cases and
economic loss cases.
He said that in physical damage cases all the plaintiffs needed to do to
establish a duty of care was to prove (i) foreseeability that lack of care
might result in harm; and (ii) ownership or appropriate possessory interest
in the property physically damaged or lost.
He submitted there was no need to make good the two additional criteria
which applied in economic loss cases, namely (iii) proximity and (iv) that
it would be 'fair, just and reasonable' to impose a duty of care in tort.
If he was wrong on his main submission he submitted he could make good his
case on (iii) and (iv) on the assumed facts.
Mr Aikens for Nippon submitted that the general principles stated in
economic loss cases were equally applicable to physical damage cases and
that (iii) and (iv) applied.
His basic submission was that since a shipowner was under a non-delegable
duty as bailee to take care of cargo there was no room for the imposition of
a further duty on a classification society.
He argued that Nippon had the closest and most direct relationship with the
shipowners, so that the undoubted claim against them and the suggested claim
against Nippon were mutually exclusive.
In Grant v Australian Knitting Mills (1936) AC 85 it was argued by the
defendant manufacturers of a defective garment which the plaintiffs had
bought from an intermediate retailer, that the contractual relationships
covered the whole field and excluded any question of tort liability.
Lord Wright disposed of the argument. He said the claims in contract, based
on independent causes of action and different considerations, were
irrelevant to the claim in tort. He said 'the tort liability is independent
of any question of contract'.
Though on its different facts Grant was not binding, that principle applied
in the present case, seeing that the claim against Nippon was a separate
cause of action, based on different considerations, and independent of any
question of contract.
Mr Aikens's basic submission was rejected.
House of Lords authorities showed clearly that the law had in recent years
tended to draw an ever stronger contrast between economic loss and physical
loss cases (see Murphy (1991) 1 AC 398).
However, it was not accepted that just because general statements of
principle appeared in economic loss cases they must invariably be restricted
to that class.
So far as proximity was concerned it was clear that in the great majority of
physical damage cases (see Hua Lien (1991) 1 Lloyd's Rep 309, 328) the duty
of care did not give rise to any problem because it was self-evident that a
duty existed (eg, in road and factory accident cases).
But having regard to statements in Caparo (1990) 2 AC 605,617,633 and Murphy
(page 485), it seemed clear that proximity was a relevant criterion in
physical damage cases, particularly where there was no direct physical
contact between the plaintiff and defendant or between vehicles or equipment
under their control.
The proximity criterion was essential in the present case, particularly
since there was such a wide variety of circumstances where a party not in
contractual relationship with Nippon might seek to establish liability and
where proximity provided a valuable test for separating the sheep from the
goats.
The 'fair, just and reasonable' criterion was a relevant test in economic
loss cases. The only physical damage case in which it was applied was Dorset
Yacht (1970) AC 1004, where exceptional public policy considerations
existed.
That criterion would be relevant very exceptionally in physical damage
cases, and then only if the defendants could establish that public policy
considerations required the court to give immunity from a duty of care which
would otherwise have been upheld.
On the assumed facts there was a very close degree of proximity between the
surveyor and Marc Rich. Although he had no direct physical control over the
vessel the decisive influence on the shipowners which his second
recommendation must have had, and would reasonably be foreseen to have, was
very akin to control.
Therefore, on the assumed facts, a sufficiently close and direct
relationship of proximity was established.
That conclusion was based simply on those assumed facts and had no general
application to any other situation which might arise between a
classification society and cargo-owners or other third parties with whom it
was not in contractual relationship.
There were no special public policy considerations which justified
application of the 'fair, just and reasonable' criterion. If, however, that
was wrong, the court was satisfied there was nothing on public policy
grounds to debar Marc Rich from making good the duty of care.
On the facts pleaded Nippon did owe Marc Rich a duty of care capable of
giving rise to a liability in damages.
The word 'capable' was emphasised because nothing in the judgment should be
interpreted as establishing that Nippon actually owed such a duty of care.
The assumed facts were in issue and could only be determined on a full trial
after all the evidence had been heard.
For Marc Rich: Mr Peter Gross QC (Lovell White Durrant).
For Nippon: Mr Richard Aikens QC and Jonathan Harvie (Norton Rose).

FT  15 JUL 92 / People: Next steps at Alexander Proudfoot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Proudfoot, the world's biggest quoted management consultancy, is
replacing its chief executive with a committee. Thomas Huhn, the ex-Chicago
Bears football player and Proudfoot's group chief executive since 1987, has
retired and his responsibilities are being assumed by an expanded management
committee.
Neil Hamilton (right), the company's 60-year-old finance director, will
chair the management committee. Hamilton says that Huhn had decided that
after 32 years of 'running for an aeroplane every Monday morning' it was
time for someone else to take over.
The company says that having undertaken a detailed review of its operations
over the past few months, it has now decided to expand the management
committee which runs the firm on a day-to-day basis and include those
members responsible for the operating performance of its three main
geographic regions. Alan Steelman, 46, will be responsible for implementing
operational decisions.
Proudfoot, a US firm which got a UK stock market listing after it reversed
into Lord Stevens' City and Foreign Holdings in 1987, has managed to buck
the recession better than many of its rivals.
At the same time as it announced Huhn's retirement, the company stated that
'trading conditions have marginally improved and it is anticipated that
earnings per share for the second half of the year will be modestly better
than the first'.
The company confirmed that based on current trading conditions the dividend
will be maintained even though it is likely that earnings cover will be
reduced. David Forster of Kleinwort Benson Securities estimates that full
year profits will fall by around a fifth to Pounds 38m.
The 56-year-old Huhn, who joined Proudfoot in 1961, will continue to serve
as a consultant and will assist in the hand-over of selected clients.

Does a company which has only two customers, both large and both committed
to buying its product on multi-year contracts, need a director of commercial
development? SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned company which runs Scotland's
two nuclear power stations, believes it does and has appointed Bill
Stockdale (above) to the newly created post.
Stockdale, 46, says part of his job is to develop 'commercial awareness' in
a company which was carved out of the old South of Scotland Electricity
Board and whose market currently consists of ScottishPower and Scottish
Hydro-Electric. 'We have to keep improving our performance. We intend to be
the very best nuclear generator in the world,' he says.
Stockdale will be responsible for new projects, including the implementation
of large scale engineering projects at the the Torness and Hunterston B
advanced gas cooled reactor (AGR) stations.
He will also be in charge of corporate development, which will cover joint
ventures and alliances with other companies, as well as expansion of
Scottish Nuclear's business in eastern Europe where it is offering its
expertise to the operators of the somewhat questionable Soviet-designed
nuclear power stations.
A Yorkshireman, Stockdale trained as an engineer and worked for Foster
Wheeler, the US design engineering company, later joining ScottishPower in
Glasgow in 1990 as project group manager. He was briefly managing director
of engineering resources where he succeeded Robin Jeffrey, after the latter
became ceo of Scottish Nuclear earlier this year. He has now followed
Jeffrey to Scottish Nuclear's headquarters in East Kilbride.
*****
Sir David Trippier, the former environment minister who lost his seat at the
general election, has joined the Manchester law firm Halliwell Landau as a
consultant. A former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, he was
responsible for piloting the Environmental Protection Act through the House
and hopes to 'add an extra dimension to the quality of advice on
environmental issues that the firm already gives its clients'.
Since leaving parliament, Sir David (below) has accepted non-executive
directorships at St Modwen Properties, based in Birmingham, at Dunlop
Heywood, consultant surveyors with headquarters in Manchester, and at P&amp;P, a
computer services company based in his former constituency, Rossendale.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Jobs: Blackest year yet on executive market - Reported
upturns in demand for managers and specialists have evidently been false
dawns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAY not the struggle nought availeth, advised the poet Arthur Hugh Clough,
before adding by way of explanation: . . . not by eastern windows only, When
daylight comes, comes in the light, In front, the sun climbs slow, how
slowly, But westward, look, the land is bright.
One thing seems sure. Whatever he may have been referring to, it was not the
United Kingdom market for managers and higher-ranked specialist staff.
Over the past few days the Jobs column has scanned same not only from
eastward and westward, but also from northward and southward and all points
between. Nary a chink of daylight is to be seen.
That's not to say there has been any lack of false dawns. Indeed, I myself
was guilty of heralding one of them a whole year ago in the part of the
market which consists of advertisements of executive-type jobs in UK
national journals. Well within the next 12 months, I forecast at the time,
the advertised demand would be turning up again.
What it has actually done can be seen from the table alongside which, as
usual, is compiled from the quarterly counts made by the MSL international
consultancy. The upper part of the table focuses on the 12-monthly period
ended on June 30, going back to 1986-87, showing the number of job-openings
advertised in eight broad types of executive work. Each opening is counted
as one, no matter how many times the advertisement for it appears.
The bottom part of the table, below the 12-month totals, shows the all-types
tallies for each of the quarterly periods. As the demand is to some extent
seasonal - being usually highest in January-March then falling off with each
successive quarter - the most useful basis for comparison is the
corresponding three months of the year before.
By that yardstick, it is now 3 3/4 years since any quarter showed an
increase. Moreover, perhaps as a punishment for my hubris in predicting an
upturn just a year ago, every one of the quarters since then has been worse
than what was previously the lowest three-monthly tally since MSL began
counting in 1959 - 4,077 in October-December 1980.
Even so, one thing that the optimist in me at first interpreted as a bright
spot is the slowing of the rate of descent to a single digit between
January-March and April-June just gone. After all, on average across the
years, the seasonal pattern of the market produces a fall of about 9 per
cent between those two quarters. So a decline of merely 5 per cent might be
good news in disguise.
Unfortunately, my inquiries suggest not. The slowing looks to be a one-off
effect of the UK's general election in April. Organisations fearing a Labour
government apparently delayed filling vacancies until victory went to the
Tories, distorting the usual pattern.
Much the same benighted picture is shown by the counts which MSL has kept
since the mid-1980s of advertised demand by four sectors of business. In
every case it was a record low.
For the 12 months to June 30, high-tech companies produced a total of 874
executive jobs, 38 per cent down on the previous worst in 1990-91. Those in
energy and related industries totalled 1,108, little more than half as many
as in the 12 months before. Food, drink and tobacco companies produced 514,
down 18 per cent on 1990-91. Retailing's total was 11 per cent down at 511
for the 12 months, but mercifully the quarter just ended showed an increase
over April-June 1991.
True, advertised demand, although the largest part of the market, is not the
only one. There are also consultants recruiting by the personal-approach
methods of executive search, and so-called contingency recruiters who supply
candidates from large numbers of job-seekers on their books.
Not long ago it was reported that searchers and contingency businesses were
experiencing an upturn. But to judge by members of both camps I've talked
to, that upturn has shared the fate of the one I predicted last July. The
consensus was that, although business may now be better than in the depths
of last year, the rise in demand hasn't been sustained. 'Instead of scraping
the bottom, we're bumping along a foot or two above it,' said one.
All of which, alas, adds up to a continuing grim outlook for the thousands
of executives thrown out of work in the recession, mostly through no fault
of their own. Unlike the comparative handful of Lloyd's 'names' who've been
unlucky with their side investment, their plight has not been put on public
show. And although I've tried to discover what they are doing, nobody I'm in
touch with knows.
Agencies acting as clearing houses for freelance consultants and the like
report an increase in registrations, but not one commensurate with the
wholesale loss of jobs. I've also heard that advertisements now tend to draw
so many applications that some employers are going into competition with
contingency recruiters by setting up their own candidate banks for when the
dawn breaks. May it come soon.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Management: Keep a finger on the pulse to avoid hypertension
 -Dr Michael McGannon says beware the doctor or nurse who sends your
heartbeat racing / Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hypertension is one of the most common causes of heart attacks and strokes.
It is more serious than high blood pressure: it is a silent killer: those at
risk may be quite unaware of it. All adults should know their blood
pressure. Those with chronically high blood pressure have five times the
chance of developing heart disease as those with normal blood pressure. The
ideal pressure is between 90/60 and 130/80. But what do these numbers mean?
As it pumps, the heart contracts, then rests, contracts then rests. During
the contraction phase, the pressure generated by the heart is transmitted
through the arteries to all organs. This pressure wave, measured by the
first number, should be no more than 130. Above that level the pressure may
be damaging the arteries, causing them to lose their elasticity and harden -
rupture or blockage could result.
During the relaxation phase, the pumping chambers fill with blood for the
next volley. The second number measures how well the heart is relaxing: a
reading of more than 80 could mean it is not working properly during this
phase.
Although blood pressure tends to creep up with age, other things can also
raise it. Overweight leads to high blood pressure, as fat is a vascular
tissue through which the heart must pump much harder. Stress also
contributes through the release of too much adrenalin, while heavy drinking
and lack of exercise can make matters worse.
The good news is that high blood pressure can be controlled with no side
effects. The first step is proper diagnosis and evaluation; the second is
treatment, through changes in both lifestyle and medication.
Do not decide that you have high blood pressure on the basis of one reading.
'White-coat hypertension', in which the high blood pressure is actually
caused by the doctor or nurse, is not uncommon.
For instance, you may be active, non-smoking, a light drinker, lithe, and
handle stress well. But at your annual company check up, your blood pressure
is 165/100. As your lifestyle is already blameless, should you be on
medication?
The answer is that any high blood pressure reading should be confirmed by at
least two further readings, or better still by 24 hour monitoring. Make sure
the measurement is taken after at least five minutes of rest, and that you
have neither smoked nor drunk alcohol or coffee for at least two hours.
If your blood pressure is still high - an average of at least 140/90 - buy a
well-calibrated blood pressure machine from the chemist and take your
pressure at home under less stressful conditions.
Once you have confirmed beyond question that you really do have high blood
pressure, ask yourself the following questions:
Do you consume large amounts of salt, fat or alcohol?
Have you put on a lot of weight in the last year?
Have you been particularly stressed or sedentary recently?
Is there diabetes in the family?
If the answer to any of these questions is yes, there may be a good reason
for the high reading, and a change in lifestyle could bring it down.
Many executives are initially annoyed to find their blood pressure is up,
and later relieved to discover that they were unwittingly placing themselves
at risk by getting too fat or drinking too much. Recent studies have shown
that lifestyle changes - weight reduction, salt restriction, and cutting
down on alcohol - lower blood pressure and make medication more effective.
If none of these apply, other measures to consider include: stress
management, exercise, giving up smoking, and getting professional advice on
your diet.

Are you uncertain about what to do with your company's hazardous waste? Keen
to clean up an unsightly rubbish tip?
Britain's universities are eager to help. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors
and Principals is unabashedly touting for business. Its latest environment
policy package contains a catalogue* of environmental research achievements
and a range of environmental services on offer to British business.
A growing number of universities now offer inter-disciplinary research
centres, science parks and limited companies with exploitable resources for
industry. Environmental subjects include global warming and water pollution,
waste management, environmental auditing, accounting and law.
Financial constraints on universities have hastened the trend towards
sharing academic expertise with the outside world. Sheffield University, for
example, set up Environmental Consultancy, its advisory unit, in 1986 and
now contributes to a range of budgets across the campus. The unit's turnover
has increased six-fold since its inception, and the number of clients has
risen to about 70 from 16. They include local businesses, quoted companies,
government bodies and even local residents. Clients have commissioned work
worth anything from an hourly rate to Pounds 100,000.
Industry employs the university because its expertise includes access to
analytical equipment, library facilities and worldwide databases - and
because it represents an independent voice, says Chris Routh, manager of
Environmental Consultancy.
The stereotype of the woolly-headed academic is incorrect, he adds. 'A lot
of people that we use within the university have worked in industry, have
practical commercial experience, know what the client wants and know the
most cost-effective way of getting the answer for them.'
There are many ways in which industry and universities can work together:
Training courses tailor-made for industrial personnel, conducted at the
university or the work place. Brunel University offers a 'hands on' course
on environmental auditing, while the London School of Economics' geography
department runs courses in environmental planning and management, for
government, commerce and industry.
Consultancy contracts for advice on specific or general problems. University
of Sheffield's Environmental Consultancy performs environmental audits and
advises on land reclamation, with such clients as Mercedes Benz and the
National Rivers Authority.
Collaborative research programmes involving a university and one or more
large companies for long-term or strategic research, which may qualify for
part-funding schemes. Loughborough University is leading a consortium of
international companies, universities and research institutions to develop
eco-friendly cars.
Contract research commissioned from universities to help companies with R&amp;D
needs. At Kent University, Viridian Bioprocessing can make a bacterial soup
to eat industrial effluent.
Longer-term environmental research is also proving applicable to industry.
The University of Stirling advises companies how to cope with the possible
effect of global warming on longer-term planning, investment and market
share.
Reed beds are being researched at the University of Birmingham for a
cost-effective way of treating waters polluted by industrial waste, while at
Kent University, scientists have helped the Yorkshire wool industry by using
bacteria to break down the harmful pesticides which are washed out of the
fleeces.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Getting into hot water - The
Philippines' investment in geothermal energy is not without its drawbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Geothermal energy sounds like a heaven-sent answer to two of south east
Asia's most pressing problems - electricity shortages and air pollution from
the burning of fossil fuels - but the experience of the Philippines
demonstrates how even this apparently elegant solution is fraught with
environmental obstacles.
Just as the region's shrimp exporters either deplete the sea's natural
stocks or destroy coastal mangrove swamps to make way for shrimp farms, so
the Philippines must choose between a range of environmentally
unsatisfactory options to alleviate its desperate lack of electric power.
Coal-fired power stations in the Philippines have been criticised by nearby
residents for polluting the atmosphere and the fields, and a proposed
nuclear plant was suspended partly because of fears that it would be prone
to earthquake damage.
A decision this year to approve the building of a geothermal plant inside a
national park regarded as a holy place by local tribes has shown that
geothermal energy also has environmental drawbacks.
Exploitation of the earth's subterranean heat holds obvious advantages for
the Philippines, which is poor enough to need to reduce its oil imports and
rich enough in volcanic activity to make investment in geothermally-produced
electricity worthwhile.
The Philippines, with about 20 per cent of its electricity already coming
from this source, is the second largest producer of geothermal power after
the US. It intends to add 1,600 MW by 2000 to its existing capacity of
889MW. Indonesia also has substantial geothermal potential.
With power cuts up to 12 hours long on the main island of Luzon and on
Mindanao in the south, there is no doubting the need for further generating
capacity in the Philippines. The previous administration of Corazon Aquino
abandoned a 620MW nuclear power station built by Westinghouse of the US
under the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos before it was commissioned amid a
controversy over safety and alleged corruption, but neglected to order new
plants to make up for the electricity shortfall.
It was against this background that the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources (DENR), after years of delay, reluctantly issued an
environmental clearance certificate in January for a 120MW geothermal
project inside the Mt Apo national park on Mindanao. The decision angered
environmentalists, who argue that it endangers the wildlife in the park,
including the rare Philippine eagle, and negates the whole purpose of
establishing such national reserves.
Geothermal energy, exploited by drilling wells similar to oil wells and
drawing out hot subterranean water to run steam turbines, enjoys several
environmental and other advantages over alternative sources of electricity.
With no combustion required, the plants are more reliable and should release
less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than oil or coal-fired power
stations. Nor are they affected by the drought which has sharply reduced the
output of the Philippines' hydroelectric dams.
They must, however, be built in places with proven geothermal resources  -
places which may be distant from electricity consumers or, like Mt Apo,
environmentally controversial.
Nor are these the only problems. Like oil fields, geothermal fields
eventually run out of commercially exploitable energy. Drilling is
expensive, turbines are noisy and development of a geothermal field can
release unpleasant-smelling hydrogen sulphide and substantial quantities of
carbon dioxide.
Nazario Vasquez, vice president for energy of the Philippine National Oil
Company (PNOC), acknowledges that the first geothermal projects in the
country in the 1970s failed to recognise the problems of water pollution
caused by dumping the used underground brine on the surface, complete with
substances such as lithium, chlorides and boron which affected local rice
crops. Two of the four operational fields are run by PNOC and the other two
by Philippine Geothermal Inc (PGI), a subsidiary of Unocal of the US.
At PNOC's Mt Apo project all the fluid will be reinjected into the ground in
line with a 'zero-discharge policy', Vasquez says. 'While before we could
just walk into an area and develop it, the (Aquino) government opted to
seriously consider environmental clearances.' About a third of the 25 to 30
wells will be for reinjection and therefore to help the environment, he
says, rejecting suggestions that the reinjection is necessary in any case to
maintain the pressure of the fluid reservoir.
Of the 54,000-hectare national park, 701ha has been set aside for the PNOC
and only about 100ha will be used, he says, although environmentalists have
expressed concern that the road built by PNOC and the future development
will open the park up to further degradations by farmers and loggers.
'At the first (exploratory) PNOC well alone, the extent of forest
devastation is appalling,' wrote Yasmin Arquiza, a journalist and
environmental activist, before the PNOC was given the final go-ahead for the
project this year. 'Trees have been cut down indiscriminately to give way to
a sprawling field dotted with corn and cabbage patches.'
The tribes, meanwhile, have been bought off. They will receive one centavo
per kilowatt hour, equivalent to 7m pesos a year, to be paid into a
foundation for the local community and the environment managed jointly by
the developers, the DENR, the tribes and non-governmental organisations.
Mt Apo is not the only geothermal site where environmental considerations
are coming into play. The PNOC is planning to expand geothermal electricity
output from the island of Leyte by at least 440MW, and has calculated that
the carbon dioxide expected to be released into the atmosphere from
underground can be half absorbed by the trees on the 100,000ha of land it
manages there, and half reinjected. To help with environmental costs the
company is seeking Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.7m) in grants and Dollars 40m in
loans from the Global Environment Fund managed by the World Bank.
Geothermal energy projects may, in the words of a paper produced by PGI,
'tend to be more environmentally benign than the conventional alternatives',
but even geothermal power, it seems, cannot produce electricity without some
cost to the environment.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Recycling group for
electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON VAIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To counter the vast amounts of scrap electronics equipment dumped in the
UK's landfill sites, the computer and electronics industry is forming a
recycling association to promote the reuse and recovery of electronic
equipment.
The Industry Council for Electronic and Electrical Equipment Recycling
(Icer) brings together electronics companies, retailers and waste disposal
experts for the first time in the UK.
'Icer grew out of a report produced by the Centre for the Exploitation for
Science and Technology on end-of-life electronics,' said Graham Marson,
chairman of the new group.
'The companies who have joined already have an interest in being
environmentally sensitive and have established environmental policies and
strategies. Our diverse interest and backgrounds led us to believe we should
work together.'
Electronic and computer manufacturers Hewlett-Packard, IBM, ICL, BT,
together with retailers Thorn EMI Rentals and Boots have joined the group,
which also includes Dow Chemicals and ICI. Waste disposal companies Mann,
Mayer Cohen and the Bird Group represent the recycling industry.
According to Marson, Icer will be formally launched this autumn. Membership
is open to companies involved in electronics in the widest sense. Boots
became involved after considering how best to dispose of the hundreds of old
televisions, radios, kettles and toasters returned to its shops which no
longer work.
Cest predicts that 6m items of electronic equipment will be dumped into
British landfill sites by 1995. The waste will include 120,000 photocopiers,
800,000 personal computers, 1.3m televisions and 2m microwave ovens.
Marson hopes Icer will develop an infrastructure that will make electronics
recycling a commercial proposition. Icer will also lobby for what Marson
calls 'pragmatic legislation' to counter German recycling laws which require
electronics companies to take back all their old electronic equipment by
1994.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Management: Industrial power house in Guangdong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In less than a decade, Guangdong has changed from a mainly agricultural
economy to an industrial power house to rival Shanghai as China's premier
location for manufacturing. Hong Kong's transformation has been equally
rapid. It has switched from a significant manufacturing-based economy to one
which is daily becoming more service-based.
'What Hong Kong has is management, research and development, engineering and
marketing. The major decisions will continue to be taken here,' says Alan
Wong, chairman of Vtech.
Chinese figures show that Hong Kong dominates foreign investment in southern
China. At the end of 1990, there were 22,500 enterprises in Guangdong in
which Hong Kong and Macao businessmen had invested - accounting for some 77
per cent of foreign-funded businesses.
These companies have invested Dollars 11bn (Pounds 5.7bn) - some 56 per cent
of total investment in the region - and employ directly, or indirectly, an
estimated 3m workers. However, as a recent survey by the Federation of Hong
Kong Industries underlines, the investment by Hong Kong companies in
southern China is relatively small-scale.
The federation reckons that more than 60 per cent of Hong Kong companies in
the Pearl River region have invested less than HKDollars 10m, (Pounds
670,000) and for many, the investment is as little as HKDollars 1m to
HKDollars 5m.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gainsborough fetches Pounds 350,000
 -Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHALK drawing by Gainsborough, 'A peasant family going to market' (detail
right), sold for Pounds 352,000 at Christie's yesterday to an anonymous
telephone bidder.
The price was plumb in the middle of the saleroom's estimate and is the
second-highest sum paid at auction for a drawing by the 18th century English
artist. A year ago Christie's sold 'A lady walking in a garden' for Pounds
616,000.
Gainsborough made the drawing in Bath in the 1770s. It gives an idealised
view of rural life and owes something to the landscapes of Rubens. It comes
from the estate of the late Lord Clark, of 'Civilisation' fame.
The auction of British drawings and watercolours did well, totalling Pounds
830,863 with only 9 per cent unsold. A watercolour by Turner, 'The Splugen
Pass', was near the top of its estimate, selling for Pounds 242,000. It was
painted in Switzerland in 1843 and in 1878 had been given to Ruskin by a
group of his friends. The watercolour sold at Sotheby's in New York in 1984
for Dollars 275,000.
A pencil and chalk drawing by Sir Thomas Lawrence of Lady Selina Meade beat
its estimate at Pounds 16,500. Five of the top ten prices were paid for
works by Turner. His major oils have been difficult to sell lately but there
is obviously still a good demand for his more modestly priced watercolours.
On Monday, Sotheby's set a record price of Pounds 92,400 for a golf club, of
circa 1700. Yesterday in Edinburgh Phillips established a record for a golf
ball when a gutta ball made by Allan Robertson in 1849 sold for Pounds
19,250, beating the previous auction record by more than Pounds 6,000.
Robertson is best known for his feathery golf balls and only reluctantly,
and briefly, produced balls made from the new latex material.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Department tests contracting-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEASIBILITY of contracting out jobs at several divisions of the
Department of Employment, including Acas, the arbitration, conciliation and
advisory service, is to be tested by the government.
The department said that market testing to evaluate Acas, the information
division, parts of the research and evaluation division and activities in
the Health and Safety Commission will begin later this year. Other divisions
are being shortlisted for contracting-out evaluation.
Jobs will be evaluated against criteria including cost-effectiveness and the
quality of provision compared with private-sector providers.
The department formally denied that a shortlist had already been drawn up.
It said: 'In line with other government departments we have been looking at
areas of activity to market test. What aspects we will look at have yet to
be decided.'
The contracting out of jobs at the centre of the government machine is part
of a drive to put much of the Civil Service work out to competitive tender.
A white paper published last November suggested that 'market testing' could
save as much as 25 per cent of the Pounds 20bn central government costs.
All government departments are currently drawing up lists of activities they
could put out to tender. Last month it was disclosed that the Inland Revenue
was contracting out work to Manpower for secretarial and typing work.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM stresses party unity on ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday moved to emphasise that his commitment to sterling's
parity in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism had the full backing of his
cabinet colleagues.
As senior ministers acknowledged that divisions on the Conservative
backbenches had contributed to speculation against sterling, Downing Street
signalled publicly that the cabinet was unequivocally behind the prime
minister's stance.
Officials said that he had reminded yesterday's cabinet meeting that when
Britain had joined the ERM it had not been a 'short-term option'. Instead it
offered the means to reduce inflation and provide a stable basis for
sustained growth. That meant that the commitment was '100 per cent'.
Mr Major's reminder of the need for his colleagues to present a united front
 -a view subsequently endorsed even by ministers who were initially
sceptical about entry to the ERM - was followed by a sharp attack on the
government's economic strategy by Mr Neil Kinnock.
It coincided also with private acknowledgement by ministers that the public
calls for devaluation by some 'maverick' Conservative MPs had prompted
foreign exchange traders to believe that the prime minister might be under
pressure from within his government to change course.
The outgoing Labour leader used his last confrontation with Mr Major at
prime minister's questions to warn that present policies risked turning the
recession into slump.
Mr Kinnock, who stands down as leader at the weekend, was careful to avoid a
direct call for a realignment, but he urged the prime minister to use the
summer parliamentary recess to adopt a more ex-pansionary economic strategy.
Predicting that the recovery would get under way during the second half of
this year, Mr Major responded that there was 'no other way' to lay the
foundations for sustained growth.
The same message will be delivered in a letter being sent to all
Conservative MPs by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, later today.
With ministers acknowledging that MPs are coming under pressure from their
constituency parties over small business bankruptcies and rising
unemployment, Mr Lamont will emphasise the medium-term gains of sticking
with the present policy.
The chancellor, who was finalising the letter last night, will warn of a
tough clamp-down on public spending but he will add that an attempt to
'kick-start' the economy now would wreck the prospect of sustainable
recovery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of commercial insurance companies by government departments will
still be confined only to special cases, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial
secretary, said yesterday.
The Treasury had come under some pressure from the insurance industry to
review its existing arrangements under which government carries the risks
for losses itself.
Justifying the decision on the grounds of value for money, Mr Dorrell said:
'Across government as a whole the cost of paying premiums can be expected to
exceed the value of claims met by insurance companies.'

Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, questioned whether the government

Mr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, retorted by saying that tobacco
consumption had fallen in recent years. Measured against this decline,
tobacco companies had not achieved their aims, he said.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Lloyd's audit work opens up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUIDELINES released yesterday on auditing at the Lloyd's of London insurance
market should help open it up to a larger number of accountancy firms.
The notes, the second set from the Auditing Practices Board, are not
designed to lay down new standards but to spread existing best practice.
They cover the functions and duties of firms auditing brokers, syndicates
and managing agents, and stress that the auditors are responsible above all
to the individual Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the
market.
Relations between Names and businesses trading on the market have become
strained in recent months as a result of heavy insurance losses.
Mr Graeme King, general manager at Lloyd's regulatory services group, called
the notes 'a cartel-breaking document' that should lift the mystique around
auditing at Lloyd's.
'This is a solid demonstration that some of the highest levels of disclosure
in sets of accounts in the UK come from Lloyd's,' he said.
He said it would help expand the number of auditing firms currently
recognised by Lloyd's from the current 15.
The notes stress how vital it was that auditors examine the strength of
internal controls in the syndicates and the statistical techniques used to
calculate reinsurance. Syndicates specialising in in catastrophe reinsurance
have borne some of the worst losses at Lloyd's in recent years.
It says auditors should report direct to the Council of Lloyd's in
exceptional circumstances, such as when they no longer have faith in the
integrity of senior management of the business.
Practice note 2. The Lloyd's market. Auditing Practices Board. PO Box 620,
Central Milton Keynes MK9 2JX. Pounds 6.50.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EFFORT by dissident Lloyd's Names to seek a judicial review of the
insurance market is 'doomed to failure', Mr Gordon Pollock QC said in the
High Court yesterday.
Mr Pollock, representing Lloyd's, told the two judges presiding in the case
 -Mr Justice Popplewell and Mr Justice Leggatt - that the market was 'not
subject to public law'.
Lloyd's applied for leave to set aside a motion from six Names seeking a
judicial review in May. The application is the subject of the present case.
Judicial reviews are actions against public or semi-public bodies alleged to
have failed to observe their duties.
The Names are members of loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates. They contend
that by permitting a series of cash calls to go ahead Lloyd's has not met
its obligations to advance and protect the interests of its members.
Mr Pollock said that the interests of policyholders must be paramount.
The case continues today.

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Trade explosion pushes Mercosur towards
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL and economic instability in Brazil may yet scuttle attempts to
form a common market in South America, or at least delay the January 1 1995
deadline for implanting a single market to be known as Mercosur between
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
None the less, an explosion in trade, cross-border business links, falling
trade barriers and continuous advance in dull, but vital, regulatory
harmonisation are giving integration a dynamic of its own. Companies ranging
from powerful multinationals to small local companies are assuming that
sooner or later Mercosur will become a reality. This perception is in turn
accelerating integration.
Mr Jorge Bustamante, director of Merchant Bankers Asociados, a Buenos Aires
investment bank, says 'the impact of Mercosur here will be dramatic.
(Brazil) may postpone matters, but people are taking Mercosur into account.'
Multinationals were the first off the mark. The car industry began
integrating operations in Brazil and Argentina in 1985. It is unlikely that
Argentina's auto industry could have survived without access to Brazil's
market. Today, all big car and component industries in Brazil and Argentina
are integrating operations and sharing capacity.
Integration is becoming a question of life or death for smaller players. In
Argentina's industrial city of Cordoba, most companies have links with
Brazil. Georgalos, a chocolate maker, has linked with Brazil's Lacta to
exchange products and technology. Arcor, another food processing company,
has a factory in Brazil and is expanding its distribution network for
products made in Cordoba. Links between the two countries' service industry,
farmers and financial systems are also growing stronger.
These trends are reflected in the trade figures. In 1985, trade between the
four Mercosur countries added up to Dollars 3.82bn (Pounds 199m). By 1991,
trade was Dollars 10.60bn, accounting for 13 per cent of their total trade,
even though huge obstacles to trade still exist. Paraguay's exports to its
Mercosur partners tripled to Dollars 259m in 1991 from Dollars 82m in 1985,
but its trade deficit widened by 12 per cent.
Some Argentines think Brazil's crisis is too profound to find a rapid
solution and advocate bilateral trade agreements with Chile, Mexico, the US
and Canada and the European Community. Yet officials point out that only
three years ago, Argentina - now enjoying a measure of economic stability -
faced far greater unrest as the outgoing Alfonsin government collapsed amid
food riots and hyper-inflation.

FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US foments beer war with Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE beer war between the US and Canada intensified yesterday when Washington
demanded authorisation from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to
retaliate against its northern neighbour for discriminating against imports
of US beer. The US said it was seeking to recoup damage to US brewers of
about Dollars 80m a year.
A US complaint against discriminatory practices by state liquor boards in
Canada was upheld by a Gatt disputes panel last September. In April,
following earlier threats of retaliation by Washington, the two sides said
they had reached agreement on giving US brewers easier access to the
Canadian market. At yesterday's meeting of Gatt's governing council,
Washington accused Canada of deliberately trying to circumvent the panel's
findings.
The US is particularly angry about two practices by Ontario - a new beer
pricing system operated by the monopoly state liquor board, which includes a
handling charge for imported beer, and a rise in the tax on non-refillable
containers for alcoholic drinks.
Canada yesterday rejected the US demand for trade reprisals as 'completely
unwarranted' and said Washington was complaining simply because Canada had
not made changes to its liquor regime in a way that satisfied US brewers.
Separately, Washington agreed yesterday to a request by the EC for the
establishment of a disputes panel on the US trade embargo against some 20
countries which re-export yellow-fin tuna caught by nets which kill
dolphins.
Earlier the Gatt council approved a six-month extension to end-June 1993 for
Mr Arthur Dunkel's term of office as director-general.

Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, will arrive in Israel on Sunday to
begin a tour of the region aimed at relaunching Middle East peace talks
following the election of a new Israeli government under Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, Hugh Carnegy reports from Jerusalem.
Mr Rabin, who wants to speed up the talks, said yesterday on his first day
in office that he was optimistic about a speedy restoration of US-Israeli
relations which cooled under his predecessor, Mr Yitzhak Shamir. He said he
had spoken by telephone to President Bush and Mr Baker. Mr Avraham Shochat,
the new finance minister, referring to his government's bid to win Dollars
10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan guarantees, previously blocked over Jewish
settlement expansion in the occupied territories, said Mr Baker's visit was
of economic as well as political significance.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Arabs suspicious of Rabin's approach: Israel's enemies have
quickly lost their post-election optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Yitzhak Rabin won Israel's general election last month, Palestine
Liberation Organisation chairman Yassir Arafat said exultantly: 'The Israeli
public has voted against war and the terrorism of Shamir.'
By last Saturday, however, Mr Arafat had changed his tune, saying he did not
see Mr Rabin as different from Yitzhak Shamir, the former Prime Minister,
Other statements by Arab leaders - notably from Syria - have sounded a
similar note of scepticism over whether Mr Rabin, leader of the Labour
party, will offer anything more of substance to the Arabs than did Mr Shamir
and his hardline Likud party government, despite his offers to exchange
peace missions and to accelerate the Middle East peace talks. But there is
no doubt that Mr Rabin has a very different approach to peace making than Mr
Shamir. It is almost certainly because they recognise the challenges this
will present to them that Palestinian and other Arab leaders have begun to
back off from their initial optimism about his election.
Above all, Mr Rabin is a pragmatist who has never shared Mr Shamir's
ideological commitment to perpetual Israeli control of Eretz Israel - the
biblical land of Israel that includes the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In his final speech as prime minister on Monday, Mr Shamir bitterly attacked
Mr Rabin on this very issue.
Although he avoided saying so during the election campaign, Mr Rabin also
recognises that Israel cannot afford to defy the immense changes in the
world of the past several years - notably the disappearance of the Soviet
Union and its influence in the Arab world.
'It is our duty to see the world as it is now, to discern its dangers,
explore its prospects and do everything possible so that the State of Israel
will fit into this world whose face is changing.
'No longer are we necessarily 'a people that dwells alone', and no longer is
it true that 'the whole world is against us',' Mr Rabin said in a pointed
rejoinder to the siege mentality of Mr Shamir.
Unlike Mr Shamir, Mr Rabin believes Israel must trade occupied land in
exchange for peace and is ready to curb Jewish settlements there.
He insists on keeping Jerusalem and other so-far unspecified areas he deems
vital for Israel's security, which he will continue to settle. Labour party
policy does not yet accept an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank
and Gaza. These are big problems for the Arabs. But the acceptance in
principle of the 'land for peace' formula provides a far sounder basis for
progress in negotiations than did Mr Shamir's adamant rejection of it.
Under the terms of the Madrid peace talks, however, the final status of the
occupied territories is not yet the subject of negotiation. First, there is
to be a five-year interim period of Palestinian self-government as a
transitional phase.
Here, again, Mr Rabin is offering the Palestinians significantly more than
Mr Shamir. He is proposing to base the interim arrangements on those
outlined in the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt of 1978; Mr
Shamir said he was not willing to go as far as the Camp David proposals,
offering instead only 'municipal autonomy' - in practice not much more than
the right to collect rubbish.
Mr Rabin is offering the Palestinians elections to a self-governing
authority that will take over everyday administration in the West Bank and
Gaza from the Israeli military and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from
main population centres.
Paradoxically, Mr Rabin's more forthcoming approach has unsettled the Arabs.
Firstly, having benefited from the chill that afflicted US-Israeli relations
under Mr Shamir, Arab leaders are now afraid of a revived US-Israel front
that will put them under great pressure to make concessions. The US, after
all, brokered Camp David. For their part, the Palestinians, who until last
year rejected the Camp David formula outright, are already objecting to Mr
Rabin's general outline (detailed proposals will not be made until peace
talks resume in Rome, probably in early September).
They oppose his intention to keep direct authority over the Jewish
settlements, security, foreign relations and all frontiers. Palestinian
negotiators are especially concerned about their ability to win popular
support for an interim agreement which will inevitably limit the scope of
Palestinian self-rule.
While all Palestinians were agreed in rejecting Mr Shamir's offer, dangerous
splits are already in evidence over how to deal with Mr Rabin.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Transnationals pace the growth track: United Nations World
Investment Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTINATIONAL companies, far from being the gloved hand of first world
imperialism, are an important source of economic growth for developing
countries, at least those countries lucky enough to share in their largesse.
This is the message of the second World Investment Report, published today
by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Development.
Entitled 'Transnational Corporations as Engines of Growth', the UN study
concludes that foreign direct investment by transnational companies is fast
overtaking international trade as the driving force behind the globalisation
of the world economy.
Global foreign direct investment flows rose rapidly during the second half
of the 1980s, growing four times faster than domestic output and 2 1/2 times
as fast as exports. The total stock of foreign direct investment world wide
now stands at Dollars 1.7 trillion (million million) with annual flows in
1990 amounting to Dollars 225bn.
The bulk of this investment originates in developed countries, which also
attract more than four fifths of total outflows, with the EC, US and Japan
together accounting for 70 per cent of world inflows.
Developing countries have been losing out in the race to attract this
growing source of new investment. While the volume of total FDI to
developing counties continued to increase in the 1980s, its share in the
total fell.
The distribution of FDI across developing countries has remained highly
uneven; and those countries receiving the largest shares have tended to post
the fastest economic growth rates. East and south Asia together received 53
per cent of the total FDI inflow in 1986-1990.
Africa's share in total FDI is, by contrast, both small and shrinking.
Inflows of FDI fell to Dollars 2.2bn in 1990, 50 per cent down on the
previous year, and were only slightly more than that received by Portugal.
The UN report identifies a number of ways in which direct investment by
multinationals may speed economic development in developing countries:
Capital formation: while FDI constitutes only a small share of total
domestic investment it often constitutes a larger share of investment in key
growth industries such as consumer durables and high technology
manufacturing;
Technology transfer: the share of high or medium research-intensive
industries has increased as a proportion of total sales in the last decade;
Trade: US manufacturing affiliates in developing countries exported 33 per
cent of their output in 1989, up from 22 per cent in 1982.
These growth benefits tend to accrue to middle and high income developing
countries. The growth requirements of low income countries - higher
agricultural productivity, basic infrastructure and increased educational
and nutritional standards - are marginal activities of transnational
corporations.
As a result, the UN fears that many developing countries may become
increasingly marginalised because of their non-inclusion in the global
strategies of transnational corporations.
To counter this risk the UN report calls for the establishment of a
multilateral foreign direct investment facility as a tripartite venture
between host, home and transnational corporations to alleviate imbalances in
FDI flows.

SUDANESE government forces have captured the main base of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army at Torit near the Ugandan border, Khartoum radio
announced yesterday, Reuter reports from Khartoum.
The radio quoted Sudan's military ruler Gen Omar Hassan al-Bashir as saying
government troops entered the town, which the SPLA had held since 1989, on
Monday afternoon.
In Nairobi, an SPLA spokesman said troops had captured the guerrillas'
headquarters in Torit and the town was now under siege by the rebels. 'We
withdrew our forces from Torit yesterday and we have laid siege to it. The
government forces will be annihilated,' he said.
The SPLA has been rebelling against what it sees as domination by the Moslem
Arabised north over the mainly Christian and animist south.
Sudan's Islamic government has captured more than a dozen towns since its
forces mounted a dry season offensive against the southern rebels in March.
The rebels say the Khartoum government is trying to make southern Sudanese
accept Islamic laws and have been fighting for some autonomy and a secular
state.
As news of the army victory spread, people took to the streets of Khartoum
shouting Allahu Akbar (God is great).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Lebanese government said yesterday it was cutting public spending and
studying plans to sell off some state services to rescue the economy, Reuter
reports from Beirut.
Mr Michel Samaha, the information minister, said public spending for 1992
would not exceed 1,930bn Lebanese pounds (Pounds 570m) while revenue was
expected to be 1,200bn pounds.
'Bringing back financial and fiscal stability is very vital to regaining
confidence in the economy and currency,' Mr Samaha said. The previous
government was toppled on May 6 by street protests against the economic
crisis.
In a draft 1992 budget, the government had forecast its revenues at 867bn
pounds for the year. Speaking after a four-hour cabinet meeting, Mr Samaha
said the government had decided to reduce the public sector deficit from 56
per cent of overall spending in 1991 to 38 per cent this year. Public sector
deficits averaged 80 per cent of expenditures between 1984 and 1991.
Mr Samaha said that the government planned to slash the deficit to 20 per
cent of total spending in the second half of 1992, from 54 per cent of total
spending in the first half of this year. He said the cabinet was studying
plans to privatise services such as electricity and telecommunications,
partially or totally, and would discuss with foreign organisations setting
up a fund to support the currency.
Despite the end of the civil war in 1990, Lebanon has failed to attract
sufficient foreign aid and investment to bring the economy back to life and
repair war damage estimated at Dollars 15bn (Pounds 7.8bn).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF China's most hardline communist ideologues, Li Ximing, has made a
public statement strongly in favour of reform, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Li, who is party chief for Beijing, was quoted in an article which carried
his name in yesterday's Beijing Daily that economic change should be speeded
up along capitalist lines and that left-wing thinking should be resisted.
His statement echoes instructions issued recently by Deng Xiaoping, the
country's senior leader.
Western diplomats and Chinese observers have long viewed Li as an unashamed
Maoist and there had been suggestions in the capital that he would soon be
removed. He is a member of the Politburo and is seen as a close associate of
Li Peng, the prime minister.
His article, a lengthy report summarising a meeting of Beijing's Communist
party standing committee, is a signal that left-wingers fear Deng's campaign
is unstoppable.
Deng has said that those who do not support reform must step aside. One by
one, ideologues within the party have given support to Deng's policies. Li
is by far the most strident hardliner so far to step into line.
Diplomats say Deng's opponents have been weakened by the deaths over the
past few months of several leading communist traditionalists. They say the
opponents fear for their positions during a period of intense back-room
dealing at Communist party headquarters in the run-up to the crucial 14th
party congress later this year.
Separately, China's labour minister, Ruan Chongwu, warned that unemployment
will rise as the nation carries out economic reforms. According to the New
China News Agency, Ruan said China's employment policy, which ensures
cradle-to-grave job security, should be overhauled.
Ruan gave no figure for the number of unemployed, but he said China's urban
industries had a surplus labour force of over 10m, while the number of
surplus rural workers stood at more than 100m.
'The central government must encourage the development of the labour market
and competitive mechanisms to control labour and employment for all Chinese
citizens,' Ruan was quoted as saying.
The China Daily newspaper quoted him as saying that urban unemployment
should be limited to 3.5 per cent, or about 5m people.

<TEXT>
US consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 per cent in June, the government said
yesterday, providing new evidence that the sluggish economy is keeping
inflation in check, Reuter reports from Washington.
The government also said retail sales rose 0.5 per cent last month, almost
entirely because of a surge in new-car sales.
The Labour Department said the increase in prices at the retail level
compared with a 0.1 per cent gain in May. Last month's rise reflected a jump
in the cost of energy, partly offset by falling prices for clothing and
other goods.
The increase in sales followed a revised gain of 0.4 per cent in May, the
Commerce Department said. But excluding cars, sales barely rose 0.1 per cent
in June after a 0.2 per cent gain in May, suggesting consumers remain
cautious about making large purchases.
A sustained pick-up in consumer spending is considered vital for a broad
recovery in the US economy as purchases of goods and services fuel about
two-thirds of economic activity.

   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton-Gore ticket, cruising to overwhelming endorsement by the
Democratic party this week, played to its strengths yesterday.
Mr Clinton's only scheduled public appearance was in front of the Democratic
women's political caucus, already potentially swelled by the addition of six
women candidates for the Senate, 34 for the House, and, as the prospective
nominee said, with the prospect of more to come.
The Arkansas governor laid out his feminists credentials. 'I am the grandson
of a working woman, the son of a single mother, the husband of a working
wife who earns far more than I and the father of a daughter who wants to
build space stations in the sky.' He added: 'I have learned that building up
women does not diminish men.'
But the biggest applause was reserved for his commitment to defend freedom
of reproductive choice ('being pro-choice is very different from being
pro-abortion') and for his assertion that the country needed 'not just a new
generation of leadership, but a new gender of leadership'.
Senator Al Gore took his well-known commitment to the environment to a
meeting of environmentalists. President George Bush's performance at the Rio
de Janeiro earth summit, which he had also attended, was 'a disgrace'.
The focus on both issues made sense because yesterday the convention
reserved its principal business for the party platform. Although Mr Clinton
was accosted by anti-abortion activists on his morning jog and though
Governor Robert Casey of Pennsylvania insists on speaking out against
abortion, the party itself is united in committing itself to freedom of
reproductive choice and greater concern for the environment.
To the extent that dissent exists outside former Governor Jerry Brown's band
of insurgents, it is on economic and trade policy. Governor Mario Cuomo of
New York is on record as recommending that Mr Clinton should admit a tax
increase might be necessary, while Mr Paul Tsongas continues to grouse a bit
that not enough is being done to promote more investment.
Mr Clinton himself made one marginal hedge in policy in a TV interview, by
at least allowing for the possibility that the wealthiest Americans might
have to pay a bit more in social security taxes. But, unlike the British
Labour Party, he was careful to avoid specifics.
Equally, now that he has abandoned his earlier promise of a middle-class tax
cut, he is also not keen to entertain talk of any income tax increases.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic
fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping
operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed
Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide
security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the
border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of
Tskhinvali.
But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four
civilians and injured two others, underscoring the difficulties facing the
operation.
The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former
Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of
bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the Romanian to the Afghan borders.
Reports from the former Soviet republic of Moldova said several people had
been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government
forces and separatists.
In the Transcaucasian republic of Armenia, Radio Russia said five civilians
had died overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the latest victims of a
four-year undeclared war which has killed 2,000 people.
Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the
first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be
resolved with the help of 'political measures and actions'.
South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North
Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin. Hundreds have been killed
since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians.
The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet bands and
matching chevrons on their sleeves.
They will be joined later by a multi-ethnic force - Russians, Ukrainians,
Ossetians and other mountain peoples - under the nominal command of North
Ossetian leaders.
The peace-keepers' mission is to form a physical barrier between the two
sides, opening the way to future talks.
The greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on
both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the
control of either Russian or Georgian authorities.
Interfax news agency said Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, at
present on a visit to Moldova, proposed a similar peace-keeping operation
there.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY has introduced tax reforms to give a boost to the country's
struggling stock exchange, and in turn increase revenue at a time of severe
budget constraints.
The reforms, from January 1993, are intended to revive market activity,
giving encouragement to investors and to companies considering equity
flotations.
There will be tax exemptions for mutual funds which are invested up to 25
per cent in the stock market. Income earned from the management of mutual
funds is also to be tax exempt, together with income on venture capital
funds and income on real estate funds. To continue to enjoy tax exemption on
sales of securities, a company will have to hold the assets for at least two
years. Income generated from sales of rights issues at a premium will also
be tax exempt.
In a bid to raise revenues the new law sets a minimum 23 per cent
corporation tax rate, compared with a basic rate of 46 per cent. Effective
corporate tax is around 10 per cent as companies are entitled to a series of
tax incentives which they use to reduce their tax liabilities.
Hitherto, the government's appetite for funds has provided banks and
corporations with low risk high yielding assets, but also served to put
upward pressure on interest rates, damaging the investment climate.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA is simplifying restrictions on the movement of foreigners.
The government said it had ended the ban on travel to closed areas, although
there remained some places which could be visited only with foreign ministry
permission. This was because they contained security installations and the
state had not yet worked out a system for sealing off individual plants and
military bases.
The government spokesman, Mr Andrei Silantiev, said old rules requiring
foreigners to give the foreign ministry 24 hours' notice of travel plans
would be scrapped.
The new list of restricted areas replaces one drawn up in 1990 which is out
of date because of decrees by President Boris Yeltsin opening up whole
cities. Now that the city of Chelyabinsk has been opened up, for example,
just two territories outside the city will be 'regulated'. The list covers
areas in 16 regions of Russia, such as the town of Komsomolsk na Amure in
the Khabarovsk region, and islands in the Gulf of Finland.
In another belated gift to foreigners, parliament last week approved a cut
in income tax for top earners, which would include most foreign businessmen
in Moscow, from 60 to 40 per cent.

SNIPERS around the beleaguered city of Sarajevo are firing on ambulances and
aircraft carrying relief supplies to the Bosnian capital, a United Nations
agency said yesterday, Reuter reports.
'People are taking pot-shots at anything with 'humanitarian' written on it,'
Ms Sylvana Foa, of the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), said in Geneva.
Ms Foa said aircraft landing at Sarajevo's airport with relief supplies for
the city's estimated 300,000 inhabitants 'are taking hits as they come in'.
'A bullet shattered the window of one ambulance right by the head of one of
our people who was riding in it,' she said.
Sarajevo has been under siege since April from Bosnian Serbs opposed to the
republic's independence. UN peace-keepers in Sarajevo yesterday accused both
Serbs and the Croat and Moslem forces which oppose them of ceasefire
violations hours after mortar bombs landed near their headquarters.
In another incident, UN troops returned fire and killed a Serb sniper who
slightly wounded a Canadian soldier at Sarajevo airport, a UN spokesman
said.
He added that a record 25 relief flights to Sarajevo were expected
yesterday.
The leaders of the three warring factions agreed to come to London today to
meet Lord Carrington, the European Community envoy, in a new attempt to end
the fighting.
Meanwhile, Serb forces are said to be confident that within 48 hours they
will capture the town of Gorazde, 70km east of Sarajevo.
Serb forces launched an offensive on the mostly Moslem-populated town on
Saturday, deploying tanks and pounding it with heavy artillery. All
communications with the town, with a 70,000 population including 10,000
children, are cut. The town is critically short of food and medicine.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (7): Competitive pressure
rises - Users in the US have become more sophisticated about choosing cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR

<TEXT>
THE growing presence of non-banks in the US credit card market has loosened
the banks' stranglehold on issues of credit cards and created a new class of
credit cards.
Partly as a result of the increased competition, plastic card users have
become more sophisticated about which cards they choose and how they use
them, increasing the competitive pressure among issuers.
The pressure started in earnest in 1990 when telecommunications group A T &amp;
T entered the credit card arena, traditionally the domain of the banks, with
its Universal card. Within 10 months the Universal card had developed a
portfolio of nearly Dollars 2bn and ranked among the 16 biggest credit card
companies, essentially carving out a large niche in the market for non-bank
cards.
A T &amp; T is now the third biggest issuer of cards in terms of volume, and the
Universal card controls close to 13 per cent of the total US market. And
Sears is becoming an important player in the credit card business.
To make matters worse for the bank issuers, the rate of growth in the US
credit card market as a whole started to slow shortly after the Universal
card was launched.
According to The Nilson Report, a California-based newsletter for the card
industry, the amount charged to general purpose credit cards rose only 5.9
per cent last year to Dollars 374.4bn, compared with an increase of 15.3 per
cent between 1989 and 1990.
Perhaps even more damaging, as far as the banks are concerned, has been the
surge in consumer demand for lower fees and interest rates triggered in part
by A T &amp; T's method of entry into the field.
A T &amp; T initially wooed consumers by offering extremely favourable terms
including waiving annual fees entirely for customers who signed up in the
first year.
The banks responded by offering so-called 'enhancements' to their cards,
such as free travel insurance and frequent flier miles.
Banks were less willing at first to tamper with interest rates, which have
made the credit card business extremely profitable. Credit card interest
rates, which range from 8.5 per cent to 21 per cent with a median rate of
about 18 per cent, have remained essentially static at a time when other
forms of consumer lending such as car loans and mortgages have dropped to
their lowest levels in more than 10 years. The banks claim that the costs of
processing credit cards and the high cost of defaults justify the high
interest rate charges.
More militant card holders, however, became increasingly vociferous about
interest rates late last year and their cause was taken up by Congress,
which considered legislation that would put a ceiling on credit card
interest rates. The US law makers highlighted the discrepancy between the
high rates levied on credit cards compared with other forms of consumer
lending at a time when recession had brought down most lending rates.
Although the proposed credit card interest rate cap failed to become a law,
the adverse publicity, coupled with increasing competition and consumer
pressure, prompted many of the big bank issuers to start cutting their
rates, at least for preferred customers.
Citibank, the largest US issuer with about 30m accounts or about Dollars
47bn in annual charges, recently started offering lower rates to better
customers, charging them about 13.8 per cent compared with the 19.8 per cent
Citibank charges its standard card holders. About 9m customers are expected
to be eligible for the lower Citibank rates.
In addition, the new Citibank rates will be variable. Citibank now looks at
payment history and usage to determine interest rates. Card holders who
charge at least Dollars 1,000 a year, make timely payments and remain within
credit limits will get the lower rates, although they will be subject to
increased rates if they show a chronic pattern of transgression.
Similarly, American Express is offering its Optima revolving credit card
holders three types of rates, ranging from 12.5 per cent to 18.75 per cent
depending on creditworthiness.
Fleet Bank has started letting customers roll existing debt on to its credit
card with a 12.5 per cent interest rate, although new purchases on Fleet's
cards will be subjected to 17.9 per cent interest charges.
Annual fees may be the next area to come under attack. Although A T &amp; T has
officially announced a Dollars 20 annual fee for its card, it is still
offering to waive first-year fees for some 'selective' new customers and
bank issuers may be forced to follow suit.
Card issuers generally get about 10 to 15 per cent of their profits from
annual fees.
Lower interest rates and selectively waived fees will almost certainly cut
into revenues, but issuers hope the impact will be offset by a rise in
card-holder spending and lower attrition of existing card holders.
Other new trends include the advent of the secured card, where banks get
collateral in the form of a security deposit at the bank for higher risk
consumers who have had trouble getting approval for a standard credit card.
In June last year, Citibank launched a secured card pilot programme and it
is now expanding the test. Citibank's secured card carries a 19.8 per cent
annual rate.
Customers deposit amounts equal to the credit limit, between Dollars 300 to
Dollars 5,000, in the bank in an 18-month certificate of deposit paying 5
per cent interest to secure the credit card.
Fraud is also a growing concern. According to Citibank, credit card fraud
cost issuers about Dollars 1bn in 1991. In an attempt to combat fraud,
Citibank this year introduced a photocard with a colour photo of the card
holder bonded into the plastic on the back of the card.
In spite of the growing number of concessions credit card issuers are making
to consumer demand, it is unlikely that these will have a significantly
detrimental impact on earnings from this lucrative business.
Consumers, however, are likely to continue to benefit in the months to come
from the ongoing competition.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (6): Plastic takes over as
a common currency - Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAY FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY may still be raging over the future of the Maastricht Treaty but
Europeans are already turning to plastic as their common currency. And with
trade barriers and restrictions falling away, they may soon be shopping
around from country to country for the best deal.
Certainly, the European Commission is pushing hard for a cheap, quick and
reliable payment system to be set up across the borders of Europe. Derek
Pearmund, Visa International's executive vice-president for member
relations, believes that plastic cards have already established an efficient
network enabling cardholders to access money internationally.
Cultural distinctions between national retail financial markets within the
EC, however, may prove to be a stumbling block to the advances of the more
ambitious card issuers. High telecommunications costs may also be an
inhibiting factor, although Barclays' recent deal with BT in the UK to halve
the cost of calls may help to set the ball rolling across Europe.
In the longer term, the creation of a single European currency could wipe
out the profits generated by foreign exchange transactions.
Mark Sievewright, head of communications at Eurocard International,
MasterCard's partner in Europe, warns that the banks may have to rethink
some of their income streams. But card users can only make a profit on
incoming transactions, asserts Robin Stainer, head of Andersen Consulting's
financial services division. 'A single common currency will enable companies
to consolidate their operations as well as reduce their costs.'
It cannot be denied that plastic provides one of the easiest ways to cross
frontiers and break into new markets. 'It is relatively easy for a bank to
do business in another country,' says Eurocard's Sievewright. 'In the cards
business all you have to do is to set up a local language service bureau to
sort out queries from cardholders and merchants.' Indeed, Barclays Bank and
Banco de Santander, one of Spain's leading issuers, have both ventured into
Germany's nascent card market with Banco de Santander now the biggest credit
card issuer in Germany.
Germany, along with France, Italy and Spain, has contributed greatly to the
explosive growth of cards in Europe. Both Visa and MasterCard-Eurocard
expect that European card sales volume will overtake that of the US over the
next two years. With nearly 62m cardholders and a card volume of Dollars
146bn Visa boasts that it has twice the number of cards and twice the volume
of its closest European competitor.
But it will face a formidable opponent later this year when Eurocard finally
completes its merger with Eurocheque International to form Europay. With a
combined total of 75m cards in circulation Mark Sievewright is confident
that Europay's range of products cannot be matched. 'We may have entered the
market later than Visa but we have the right products,' he said.
Both Visa and MasterCard-Eurocard have spotted the growth potential offered
by Europe's travel and entertainment market. It is estimated that Europeans
spent around Dollars 200bn on travel and entertaining last year. In spite of
its recent troubles, American Express still firmly dominates this sector,
but it may soon be faced with even more competition if the Japanese giant
JCB goes ahead with its plans to start issuing cards in continental Europe.
Jim Jamison, American Express's vice-president of Travel Management
Services, predicts that co-branding relationships will grow. 'In general the
European market will be made up of fewer, larger players as more and more
companies decide to work with partners across Europe.' American Express has
recently teamed up with Banco de Santander in Spain and has already
established a strong partnership with Lloyds Bank in the UK.
The race is also on to unlock the 120m debit cards issued by domestic
schemes in national markets which are unaffiliated to either Visa or
MasterCard-Eurocard. Italian card issuers CartaSi and Bank of Americard are
the first in Europe to sign up with Visa to issue cards with the redesigned
Electron electronic debit brand.
MasterCard-Eurocard expects eastern Europe to play a crucial role in the
development of its forthcoming Maestro/edc electronic debit programme.
Earlier this year Komercni Banka in Czechoslovakia rolled out the first
Cirrus on-line ATM network in Eastern Europe which may help kickstart the
spread of on-line programmes across Hungary, Poland, the Baltic States and
the CIS. 'Eastern Europe has the advantage of seeing what went wrong in the
West and learning from our mistakes,' said Eurocard's Mr Sievewright.
But there are many obstacles to the integration of plastic into societies
that have operated on cash for nearly 40 years. There are urgent
telecommunication and infrastructure needs, and there will be no mass
issuance of cards until currency becomes convertible.
'In terms of domestic markets there are some good opportunities,' said
Visa's Mr Pearmund but he warns: 'They have to be very carefully weighed
against cost and risk. It will take a while before any investment is
covered.' Mr Stainer agrees: 'It's a nice thing to talk about but this is a
scale business. Volume in eastern Europe is so minute as not to be
interesting for serious players.'

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (8): Beating the
cardsharps - Plastic fraud cost the UK industry Pounds 165m in 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK ANY UK banker what the main issues in the payments cards industry are
and he is certain to list fraud among them. Last year fraud on payment cards
cost the banking industry Pounds 165m, up from Pounds 122m the previous
year.
Though the UK has a mature payment card market, its experience is fairly
typical. Criminals across the world are waking up to the fact that stealing
money with a plastic card is easier and less dangerous than trying to rob a
bank by more traditional method.
They have also discovered that because the payment card market is a global
one, it is especially vulnerable to fraud. Counterfeiters in Hong Kong can
manufacture phoney British credit cards for use in third countries where
retailers will have difficulty spotting them.
Visa debit cards stolen from handbags or wallets in London can be smuggled
across the Channel in a few hours to be used in retail outlets before they
get on to hot card lists.
Two sorts of payment card are especially vulnerable. One is the gold card
which has long attracted counterfeiters and collusive retailers. Until
recently it was possible for fraudsters to use the gold cards of some banks
to draw down quite large amounts of cash on the spot with no questions
asked.
The other especially risky category is debit cards. A fraudster can siphon
money directly out of a current account with a series of small purchases
deliberately pitched below retailers' floor limits. Because the money is
coming directly out of his or her current account, the distress to the card
holder is likely to be greater than it is on credit card fraud.
Still, card fraud has to be seen in perspective. The loss of 0.2 per cent of
sales on card fraud is still tiny whencompared to other losses by the banks
or even to the 2 or 3 per cent of their turnover which retailers find goes
on 'shrinkage' - a euphemism for theft and breakages.
Since the banks carry the risk of any losses on fraud, naturally they see
things differently from the retailers. 'We have set up sophisticated
authorisations procedures which are expensive to run. It is the retailers
who benefit, very considerably, from this service. Is it not reasonable to
request that they contribute to the benefits they receive?' asks Mr Tim
Green, chief manager of Switch card services.
Two years ago, the banks set up the Plastic Fraud Prevention Forum, chaired
by Barclays. One of its main activities is to try and encourage consumers
and retailers to be on their guard.
Card issuers now also accept that more transactions will have to be carried
out on-line - ie, with the terminal linked by a telephone call to a central
computer. In the US, 85 per cent of card transactions are on-line. In
Britain, telecommunications costs are much higher, but the banks are now
hopeful that they may soon be able to negotiate a deal with British Telecom.
Early this month, Barclays announced an agreement with BT allowing retailers
using its PDQ electronic terminals to make free authorisation calls from
September. Barclays will absorb the cost of the calls, at present around 5p
each.
Two years ago, Barclays Merchant Services, handled less than half of its
transactions electronically. Today, the figure is 78 per cent.
Checking that funds are available and that the card has not been registered
as missing or stolen is one side of the battle against fraud. The other is
to ensure that the person using the card is actually the one named on the
card.
Last winter, Mr Kenneth Baker, the then Home Secretary, held several
meetings with the main UK credit card issuers to see how the fraud problem
could be tackled. The talks centred mainly on the problem of identifying
cardholders. Mr Baker and senior police officers believe that card fraud is
closely linked with drug smuggling and that sophisticated gangs of thieves
channel the revenue from card fraud to finance drug-dealing operations.
The Home Office particularly favoured the use of photographs on cards,
prompting suggestions that in effect it was trying to get the banks to
introduce identity cards through the back door.
Mr Baker persuaded the banks to pledge Pounds 500m on fighting card fraud
over the next three years but he failed to convince them of the virtues of
putting photographs on credit cards.
Though two banks, TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland, are now running trials
with photocards (and seem to have found them popular with their customers)
most bankers believe there is an inherent flaw in putting photographs on
cards.
'Photocards means that retailer staff at the point of sale have to make a
decision whether or not to go ahead and accept a card. We think it is much
better if the procedures automatically make it clear whether or not a card
can be accepted,' says Mr Jim Parsons at APACS.
As a result British banks are now looking at other ways of establishing that
a card is being used by its rightful owner.
Their dilemma is that many of the methods which can be used to make cards
more secure may be more expensive to introduce than the fraud which would
otherwise take place.
The two front-runners are PIN numbers at the point of sale and dynamic
signature verification, storing information on the card about the way a
cardholder signs his or her name.
But there are other possibilities ranging from fingerprinting to scanning
the cardholder's retina with a laser beam. This method has been used in
military establishments for years apparently without problems, but banks
seem to think that it will not go down well with the general public.
The advantage of dynamic signature verification is that it is not intrusive
and makes little difference for the customer to what happens at the point of
sale.
But it has several snags. One is that it probably implies a shift from
magnetic stripe to smart cards to store the information on micro-chip and a
new generation of terminals to read the chips.
Another is that signature verification technology has not yet reached the
point where it always gets things right. Trials suggest that a few bona fide
card-holders would get rejected, while some talented forgers would get
through.
So the banks could well decide to go for PINs, at point of sale. Some
retailers in Europe already use PINs, apparently without problems. Consumers
may not love PINs, but if they reduce the losses on card fraud, they will be
the ultimate beneficiaries.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (9): Survival seems
assured - Image of store cards still dented by memories of credit surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORE cards do not, at face value, have much of a future.
Many bad memories of the credit surge of the late 1980s revolve around both
the ease with which credit could be obtained from retailers, and its
expense. It was easy to build up a heavy bill.
That led to mountainous debts. Store cards - the cards offered by individual
retailers, usable in general only in the stores themselves - suffered a dent
in reputation as a result, from which survey evidence suggests they have
still not fully recovered.
A survey by Credit Card Software International (CCSI) earlier this year
found that 'high interest rates' was the most common reason, cited by 31 per
cent of respondents, given by consumers for not having a store card.
Credit from a store card is certainly expensive compared to the rates on
offer from credit cards, which almost always charge less than 30 per cent
annual percentage rate (APR).
Store cards vary from 26.6 per cent (Marks &amp; Spencer and Selfridges) to 38.5
per cent (Kingfisher). Other high rates come from Littlewoods and Sears
(38.4 per cent) and Dixons (37.6 per cent).
A further complication is the widespread introduction of front-end fees by
credit card issuers, who found they were needed to cover losses on accounts
which were regularly paid in full.
Card-users with all the big four clearing banks, and with several other
leading issuers are now obliged to pay an annual fee, even if they always
pay their bills promptly. This move caused outrage among consumer groups,
but neatly made it easier for credit card issuers to make a profit.
This avenue towards cutting costs is not open to store cards, which aim in
part to foster increased brand loyalty. Customers might regard fees as an
unreasonable burden on a product which could only be used in one store, and
so fees are 'not even on the agenda', according to Ms Elizabeth Stanton of
the Retail Credit Group. They could if anything harm the loyalty of regular
customers.
A year ago there were several premature obituaries of store cards as an
ossified market, unable to compete with more flexible rivals.
However, the retail credit industry ardently denies this, pointing out that
the cards are not intended primarily as a vehicle for lending.
Ms Stanton said: 'The primary aim of a store card is to increase customer
loyalty. An awful lot of people never pay any interest at all on their cards
in any case.'
On this argument, store cards are simply the application of modern
technology to the usual service of offering regular customers an account.
Store cards are now the most convenient method of doing this, and so their
survival in form should be assured.
The cards' proponents also suggest that the introduction of fees by credit
cards might boost the use of store cards. Mr Keith Douglas-Jones, a member
of the Finance and Leasing Association, and marketing director of Sears
Financial Services, says: 'Bank card issuers have seen their traditional
revenue streams reduced, and have compensated by introducing fees.
This will lead to a store card renaissance, in those areas where the issuers
provide a range of tangible service benefits for their customers.
'Store cards are highly developed loyalty-building marketing tools used by
retailers to strengthen the relationships with their best customers. The
credit, if required, is just another feature which gives the account its
versatility and flexibility.'
The CCSI survey seems to support this conclusion. It found that ease of use
was cited by 56 per cent of store card holders as a reason for using a card,
while 21 per cent used them because of card-holder discounts. Vitally, given
the cards' role in fostering brand loyalty, holding a store's card makes a
consumer 50 per cent more likely to use that store each week.
But the survey also showed that store cards fall a long way behind other
credit instruments.
Only 16 per cent of adults own at least one current store card (5 per cent
have two or more), compared with 45 per cent who hold a bank credit card,
and 74 per cent who have a current account, which normally will include a
cheque card.
And a look at the figures for Marks &amp; Spencer suggests that store cards are
regarded by consumers as a competitor to credit cards. Marks &amp; Spencer does
not accept any credit or debit cards apart from its own store cards, and the
company accounts for one third of all recent purchases using store cards,
according to the survey.
Marks &amp; Spencer has also taken a distinctive course in keeping its card
operation 'in house'. This issue divides the industry.
Mr Neil Grant, director of the Finance and Leasing Association, says: 'There
have been two distinct approaches taken by retailers and there are arguments
in favour of both approaches. Those, like Sears and Marks &amp; Spencer, which
have maintained their own card operation, feel this is the best way to
ensure their store cards are used as an important marketing tool. Others
have passed their store cards to finance houses when the financial going got
tough.'
A year ago it looked as though farming administration out to finance houses
would become the norm.
However, the trend has now come to a halt. According to Ms Stanton: 'There
was a great switch starting two or three years ago but it's now settled
down.' She said companies which had kept their operations effectively
in-house included Sears, Littlewoods, Kingfisher and the John Lewis
Partnership.
The bigger names which opted to contract out their services included
Storehouse, Burton and House of Fraser.
However, fraud has brought co-ordinated action from the industry. The
problem - either at the point of application for a card, or by interceptions
in the post - is growing, and the industry is addressing it via the Credit
Industry Fraud Avoidance Scheme (CIFAS). This pools information by allowing
companies to enter details on fraudulent applications with a credit
reference agency. The applicant can then be subjected to more rigorous
tests.
For the future, 'smart cards', which would cut down on the risk of fraud
still further since they carry a small amount of intelligence with them, are
likely to be the next significant item on the agenda. The possibilities of
the new technology for enhancing the cards' use as a tool for brand loyalty
are obvious, and are being explored.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (2): Future belongs to
debit card - UK customers have become more astute about avoiding interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN a decade ago, the credit card business was one of the most
lucrative lines in UK retail banking. Today, the picture has changed
completely. In 1992, the credit card operations of the larger banks are
fighting to stay in the black. Some UK bankers can even be heard speculating
that the credit card is in decline. The future belongs clearly to the debit
card.
One symptom of the decline is a fall in the number of credit cards in
circulation. In 1990, there were 30m credit cards in the UK, but the figures
changed sharply when Lloyds Bank introduced annual charges. Now there are
around 26m credit cards, while debit cards have come from nowhere to 20m
since 1987.
Why have these changes happened? The recession in the UK economy is part of
the explanation. Banks have been hit by shrinking volumes of business and
the need to make provisions against bad debts. Customers have become more
astute about avoiding interest by paying back on time.
'With no prospect of significant growth in the credit card business for the
foreseeable future, everyone's attention is focused on reducing cost, and
avoiding fraud and bad debt. We have started ahead of the competition and
because of this we are now seeing the benefits flow through ahead of the
market,' says Mr Gerald Hawkins, general manager at Lloyds Bank.
One side of the card business has proved especially disappointing. In 1989,
the Big Four piled eagerly in to merchant acquiring - the provision of card
services to retailers - which had previously been handled by Barclaycard for
Visa and Access for the MasterCard/Eurocard brands.
Last year the banks lost about Pounds 75m on this business and only Lloyds
claims to be making a profit.
The losses have revived long-standing tensions between card issuers and
retailers. Early this year the banks reversed a policy of offering retailers
lower processing charges to win market share and raised their tariffs. The
average charge went up from 1.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent of each
transaction, provoking cries of protest.
Five large food retailers (Asda, Tesco, Gateways, Sainsburys and Safeway)
announced that they would hold out against the banks and establish a Joint
Negotiation Committee.
In the US, most banks long ago gave up trying to make money out of merchant
acquiring and left the job to specialist companies. So far these have not
appeared on the UK scene.
Things could get still worse for the banks if some of the retailers get
their way. They are beginning to press for a review of the interchange fee
system, the fixed charge which the retailer's bank pays to a credit card
holder's bank. Interchange fees generate much of the income banks get from
their card operations and they are usually set by the international payment
systems, Visa International and MasterCard, and so are not subject to
negotiation between a bank and its customer.
In the days when merchant service charges were well above 2 per cent, the
existence of the interchange fee did not bother retailers too much. But some
large retailers today have negotiated merchant service charges of 1.2 or 1.3
per cent - and most of the payment goes on the interchange fee.
A shake-up of the interchange system is unlikely to come quickly. The
interchange fee is an international rather than simply a British way of
doing things and politicians (with the exception of Mr Nicholas Ridley when
he was at the Department of Trade and Industry) have been reluctant to
interfere with it.
If the interchange fee system were to break down, the economics of card
issuing would be revolutionised. Card holders and the smaller issuers would
be the main losers. Card holders would have to pay more for the card
services they receive and almost certainly the large banks would find it
easy to undercut the smaller issues.
Small banks are as yet undeterred. They see credit cards as a good way to
broaden their customer base. Bank of Cyprus (UK), for example, is using its
Visa card to find new customers.
Meanwhile, debit cards continue to grow rapidly. Turnover on Switch, the
electronic-only debit card launched in 1988, is now around Pounds 4bn a year
with around 14m transactions being processed a month.
Mr Tim Green, chief manager of Switch Card Services, forecasts that by the
year 2000 there will be 8m debit card transactions a day with about 70 per
cent of adults using them.
'We expect debit transaction to overtake credit transactions in 1992 and to
exceed cheque volume by 1996,' says Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive
of Barclaycard.
The expansion of the bank card market has created some serious problems
about card branding, especially ways of distinguishing credit and debit
cards. None of the solutions on offer so far has been very elegant.
Visa has had to introduce a second branding, called Delta, for its UK debit
cards so that retailers who want to take debit cards but not credit cards
can do so. In practice, Delta remains something of an ugly duckling among
payment card brands. Not all retailers understand it and few consumers seem
to do.
There is even greater confusion about brandings on the other side of the
fence where until a few years ago there was just one branding, Access. Now
Access seems to be fading. MasterCard products abound and staff numbers at
the Access branding operation are expected to be cut by as much as half in
the near future.
If one of the Access banks dropped the branding, it would probably not
survive. Possibly the four banks which own the Access brand will eventually
sell it off.
Eurocard, the European affiliate of MasterCard which is prevalent, has never
caught on as a branding in the UK, since British banks prefer a global
branding.
On the debit card side, the pattern is less easy to predict. The Switch
branding dates back only to 1988 and though it was set up by a group of
Access/MasterCard banks, it has as yet no international affiliations.
An eventual tie-up with Maestro, the MasterCard debit branding, and the
European Debit Card scheme looks likely. Mr Ron Williams, the director of
payment services at National Westminster, says he is fairly optimistic about
the chances that Switch will join the EDC/Maestro group.
Just how Switch will co-exist with these brands if it does so, is hard to
say. Possibly Switch customers will be given the choice of paying an extra
fee to be linked to EDC and Maestro. But it is equally conceivable that the
branding could start to go the way of Access.
Meanwhile, banks have got the green light from the Bank of England to
securitise some of the credit card debt - an operation which is already
familiar in North America. Each bond offer will be individually inspected by
the Bank. The move will take some of the strain off the banks' card
operations. Barclays, the UK's oldest and largest card issuer, looks likely

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (3): Saturation problem
looms - Asia-Pacific region poised for star performance in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE 1980s were years of expansion for the Asia-Pacific credit card market as
ever more vacationers returned home having discovered plastic money as one
of the greatest wonders of the western world.
This, combined with rapidly rising affluence and declining social stigma
attached to borrowing, should enable the Asia-Pacific region to remain the
credit card industry's star performer through the 1990s.
At industry leaders Visa International and MasterCard, the number of cards
in the region reached 45.5m and 32m respectively at the end of September
1991, 17.5 per cent of their combined global total, according to European
Financial Management and Marketing Association statistics.
Visa's figure increased 500 per cent in the five years through 1991 and is
continuing to more than double annually in a number of countries, a company
spokesman adds. Meanwhile, total Visa card sales in the 40-nation region
jumped 28.7 per cent last year to Dollars 37.7bn, more than twice the 1988
level and approaching 10 per cent of worldwide sales.
'The Taiwanese market is about to explode' because of financial deregulation
and the expected addition of about 50 new bank issuers, the Visa
International spokesman says.
In Japan, which dominates the regional market with about 80 per cent of
cardholders, annual growth in total credit cards averaged 16 per cent in the
eight years through March 1991, according to the Japan Consumer Credit
Industry Association (JCCIA). By 1989, credit card charges amounted to
Y23,000bn, or nearly 10 per cent of personal consumption.
Consumer credit firms, bank affiliates and retailers are Japan's leading
card issuers. The market share of banks has doubled over the past decade to
about 50 per cent of the 180m cards in circulation. All leading firms now
offer Visa and MasterCard memberships along with their own name. Visa says
Japanese issuers are sending out its cards at a rate of nearly 1,000 per
hour. Meanwhile, the consumer credit specialists have held firm, issuing
about 20 per cent of new cards, while department stores, petrol and other
retailers have lost market share.
Saturation is rapidly becoming a problem, however, with 1.5 cards in
circulation for every man, woman and child. The result is not surprising:
like Japanese companies in many other industries, credit card issuers are
turning from a fixation on market share to improving profitability.
'Our growth averaged about 20 per cent over the past five years since we've
made strong efforts to expand, but with cards now widespread it will
probably be closer to 10 per cent in the near future,' says Mr Shinobu
Fukuoka, manager of corporate planning at DC Card, a Mitsubishi Bank group
company affiliated to Visa and MasterCard.
'Around the middle of last year the economy and consumer spending began
slowing in response to the bursting of the bubble economy, and we're seeing
a declining asset effect,' he adds. 'We'll therefore aim for good customers
and increased use per customer. In Japan, the average credit card sale is
about Y20,000 versus Y5,000 in the US, so use here can rise significantly.'
Mr Steve Norris, general manager marketing in the Asia-Pacific region for
Visa International, says: 'The slowing in Japan is largely due to a
consolidation phase after an incredible increase in the number of cards over
the last five years.'
Young cardholders are the main focus of marketing efforts at Union Credit,
another bank affiliate, according to Mr Mikio Ohkawara. 'They lead the
market, but we're also trying to get people in their thirties and forties to
use their cards more.'
Widespread press reports that excessive credit card use was responsible for
last year's surge in personal bankruptcies to the highest level since 1984
are accelerating the shift away from expansion at all costs. Still, the
problem appears overblown, given that just 24,000 people went under,
including individual proprietors and others hit by economic hard times.
Of the total, sour credit card debt was responsible for about 18,000
bankruptcies, estimates Mr Paul Heaton, senior analyst at Smith New Court in
Tokyo. 'The problem has been put on the consumer credit companies' door, but
that's not fair,' he says. 'Lots of others are issuing credit cards.'
At the same time, industry officials concede credit standards have been
slack. In their rush to sign up card holders, issuers have required little
more than a name, address, income figure and place of work, says DC Card's
Mr Fukuoka.
The industry is now rushing to install more point-of-sale credit
confirmation terminals. However, the tenfold increase since 1984 to 80,000
units and planned doubling again within three years will cover only a
fraction of the retail outlets that accept credit cards. Another initiative
involves improving credit reporting. In the past, issuers had access only to
so-called black information on credit card defaults. The Credit Information
Centre (CIC) for the first time this year also is making available 'white'
information - loan values outstanding and repayment records among
individuals who have not defaulted.
This will enable the CIC's 800 member banks, consumer credit firms and car
distributors to obtain outstanding card balances and presumably prevent
consumers from taking on debt with one card to pay off another. Next June,
the CIC will add data on housing loans and other items.
Many individual issuers also have cut one-time purchase limits significantly
to the Y200,000-Y300,000 range, including lower maximums for young
cardholders.
Partly in response to US pressure to stoke domestic consumption, Japanese
authorities last month granted bank card issuers rights similar to consumer
credit firms' to issue revolving credit. DC Card is planning to begin
offering such terms from autumn, though 'there are some worries about people
delaying payment', says Mr Fukuoka.
The Y10bn cost to the industry of setting up computer systems to track
revolving balances is another big hurdle, adds Mr Ohkawara.
For issuers, interest rates of 13-14 per cent on revolving credit could
nevertheless add a large new source of revenue to the 2-3 per cent
commissions charged to shops and 28 per cent for loans via automated cash
dispensers.
A big problem is bad publicity, says Mr Norris: 'Although revolving credit
is a major source of revenue in the US, in Japan so many articles have
appeared about young people going beyond their means that I don't think
anyone is going to take a hard stand until the educational function is
carried out on how to use this service.'
At the same time, Japan's frugal ways will die hard, argues industry analyst
Mr Heaton: 'I don't think it will make a big difference to banks because
most people don't want to take on debt. They just want to put off payment
until the end of the month,' he says. Even the nation's consumer credit
firms, among the largest card issuers with rights going back decades to
issue instalment credit have found few takers for this option, he notes.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's support for revolving
credit also seems lukewarm at best, suggesting the movement could take some
time to gain momentum, an industry official adds.
Financial authorities in other Asian nations are also wary of a credit
explosion, given savings and consumption patterns in the west. Although the
Visa spokesman said the company faces a 'generally positive regulatory
environment,' he cited Singapore's minimum income requirement and South
Korea's limits on overseas spending among local constraints on card
issuance.
Looking to Japan, the most mature market in the region, issuers are finding
that wide card distribution and changing demographics will require them to
offer unique services. DC Card is looking into making hospital payments and
other services through its card, says Mr Fukuoka.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (4): Forgers outsmarted -
Security tops the list of technical priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS in Britain lost about Pounds 165m through card fraud last year, which
explains why security is at the top of their list of priorities for progress
in card technology.
However, security has a price. The most secure technology of all, the smart
or chip card, still costs significantly more than the humble magnetic stripe
(mag stripe) card on which most charge and credit systems are based.
The growth and acceptance of the chip card, however, has been dramatic. It
is no longer a novelty pursued by the French (who invented it) for
chauvinistic reasons. British Gas intends to use chip cards in place of hard
cash in domestic meters; the new mobile telephone networks may use chip
cards to add 'intelligence' to dumb handsets. Mobile telephones of the
future will be inert boxes of electronics until the card is inserted,
customising them for individual users. The chip card is undoubtedly the way
of the future.
Why is the chip card so secure? Because it is impossible for a criminal to
forge, read or write to a chip card without access to sophisticated
knowledge and equipment.
There are only a handful of semiconductor manufacturers worldwide with the
skills to build a complete microprocessor into the dimensions of a bank
card. They include Siemens of Germany, Motorola of the US, Bull of France
and Hitachi of Japan.
The amount of processing power and memory which can be crammed on to a
single sliver of silicon, however, is increasing each year, making possible
a wider range of functions. On-card encryption - coding - of information,
for example, adds a new dimension to security but is a heavy burden on the
processing unit.
New chips, not yet announced, will have a mathematics co-processor built in,
a second microprocessor concerned entirely with the arithmetic processes of
encrypting and decrypting information at an acceptable speed.
The fundamental argument in card technology revolves around on-line or
off-line working. On-line working means that each time a card is used, a
conversation takes place over the telephone lines between the card reader
and the card issuer's computer centre to establish that the card is genuine,
that it is being used with the correct personal identification number (pin)
and that the card has neither been lost, stolen nor used beyond its expiry
date (the hot card list). Full details of the transaction are recorded as it
is made and if, for example, the transaction limit was exceeded, it would be
disallowed. Some argue that on-line is the only secure way.
Off-line working using a magnetically-striped card means that only a few of
these checks can be made. There is a limit to the amount of information that
can be stored and manipulated on such a card.
Chip cards, however, are able to store very large amounts of data in
semiconductor memory, which is making possible another level of card
security - photographic identification.
Retail outlets, police and the Home Office all have an interest in the
development of cards carrying a photographic image. The Trustee Savings Bank
and the Royal Bank of Scotland are carrying out limited trials with cards
bearing their bearer's photograph.
There are a range of technologies available for image capture and printing.
DataCard Corporation, which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of
plastic transaction cards and related technology, making more than 500m
cards a year, has developed a process which makes it possible to print a
digitised colour image of the card holder on to the card in a single pass.
The image and the information on the card is protected by a security
overlay, which DataCard says is tamper-proof. The system produced high
security cards, DataCard says, for situations 'in which a physical breach of
security could be catastrophic'. A weakness, especially where the image is
being used to protect a bank card, is that criminal rings may be able to
find a member with a fair likeness.
McCorquodale Smart Card Systems (MSCS), which claims to be the UK's only
manufacturer of multiple-application smart cards, is working with a small
computer company, CEM Systems of Belfast, to pioneer a new kind of visual
smart card technology.
Essentially, the image of the subject is captured from a colour photograph
or video tape and stored in digital form in the card's memory. A clever data
compression technique is used which squeezes the amount of information in
the image into a thirtieth of the original space in two seconds.
The image is regenerated using CEM's proprietary card reader which takes
only seven seconds to reconstruct a recognisable image of the card holder.
Mr Trevor Crotch-Harvey, managing director of MSCS, says that in volume the
reader would cost only Pounds 500.
One interesting advantage. People change in appearance with time. The MSCS
system enables the image to be updated extending the life of the smart card
and making the initial investment in the equipment a better proposition.
For the foreseeable future, however, it seems likely that mag stripe cards
will have the edge, in the UK, on smart cards. This is because of their
familiarity, low cost and the investment in processing hardware and
software. There are, for example, some 45m ATM (automated teller machines)
cards circulating in the UK at present. The UK banks have more than 14,700
cash dispensers while building societies operate a further 3,200. Cash
dispenser cards can be used overseas in 110,00 Visa and 76,000 Mastercard
dispensers.
These networks operate efficiently only because of the quality of the
software underlying the system. Mr Steve Hilling, director of payment
systems for Sema Group, the Anglo/French company which claims to handle 76
per cent of card management services for UK retail groups, argues that card
technology has opened competition for the banks.
'To keep their competitive edge, banks will have to sharpen up on monitoring
market trends and market positioning. This, together with the advantages of
further centralisation of processing to trim overheads, will speed the
integration of card management and electronic funds transfer at the point of
sale (Eftpos) systems into mainstream banking'.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (5): MasterCard gets a
brighter image / Profile of Alex 'Pete' Hart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR Alex 'Pete' Hart, president and chief executive officer of
MasterCard, left Harvard he wanted to be a footballer. It turned out, he
says, that professional football was a great deal more exacting than playing
in Ivy League games.
So the young Mr Hart, born in 1940 and one of five children from Lancaster,
Ohio, dropped his original career plans and set about selling lumber for
commission.
After six years, a chance meeting with a bank chairman produced a surprise
invitation in 1968 to become a banker at BancOhio. Twenty years on, Mr Hart,
by then executive vice-president of First Interstate Bancorp, was elected
head of MasterCard, the world's second largest plastic card payments system.
At the time he took over MasterCard, there was little secret that it was in
the doldrums. Visa International, its West Coast-based rival, dominated the
market. MasterCard had suffered a run of senior resignations. Its brand had
a lacklustre image and outside the US, MasterCard seemed to have allowed
itself to be eclipsed by local partners, especially in Europe where its
branding was obscured by those of its affiliates, Access and Eurocard.
Since then Mr Hart has worked hard to put MasterCard on an even keel. He
says the main difference between it and Visa is that Visa is more of a
glitzy card, and he has no aspirations to offer glitz.
But he has made some significant cosmetic improvements to MasterCard's
image. The branding marks on the face of the cards have been brightened up.
A new debit card mark, Maestro, is being launched this year after a careful
gestation.
It is based on the assumption that debit cards are fundamentally different
from credit cards: most consumers will have room for only one debit card in
their wallets.
Using Cirrus, the national network of automated teller machines which Mr
Hart helped to found, MasterCard's cash machine facilities have been greatly
enhanced. The MasterCard/Cirrus cash machine network now includes 77,000
cash machines in 31 countries, still some way behind Visa.
He has also set up a network of regional offices for MasterCard which have
given it greater parity with Visa outside the US. Its fastest-growing region
is now Latin America. His most delicate diplomatic task has been to manage
the relationship between MasterCard and the German and other north European
banks which dominate Eurocard.
There is still no sign of the north Europeans (other than the British)
abandoning their cherished regional branding, but the working relationship
between them and MasterCard has improved during Mr Hart's tenure of office.
Does the international banking system really need two different brands of
card payment system offering services which in the last resort are mostly
more or less identical? Mr Hart believes that two networks create
opportunities for choice and broader market appeal than would otherwise
exist.
In the short term, his goal is to reverse two decades of steady loss of
market share to Visa. In the 1980s, such a hope would have seemed fairly
forlorn. But Mr Hart has evolved a strategy.
It is based on several assumptions. One is that MasterCard must distinguish
itself through quality of its services and their profitability.
Another is that MasterCard will displace Visa only if banks find it
advantageous to push its products first. MasterCard claims to have a
slightly better yield than Visa on its cards: in the long term, Mr Hart
wants to raise the difference to around 30 basis points.
By the time that point is reached, Mr Hart expects that some of the larger
banks will be promoting MasterCard products rather than Visa.
Since his membership overlaps almost exactly with that of Visa, the rivalry
cannot be pushed too far. Anything that one system does is immediately
demanded by its members from the other system.
'Duality (bank membership of both Visa and MasterCard) has been something of
a curse which has spread across the earth,' he told MasterCard members at
the organisation's annual conference in Vancouver in April.
However, Mr Hart's third assumption is that with Maestro and the debit card,
the era of look-alike matching products in the payment card world is
probably drawing to a close.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (1): Revolution in plastic
 -As a new generation of cards supplants old-fashioned credit cards in the
UK and US, payment by plastic is spreading to more and more countries / A
look at prospects for the industry against the background of a slowdown in
the world economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE MAY be a recession in many countries across the industrial world, but
it has done little to hold up the advance of card-based payment systems
across the globe.
In countries where payments cards are well established, such as the US and
the UK, a new generation of plastic card products, from debit cards to
prepayment cards, is supplanting the old-fashioned credit card.
Elsewhere, the plastic card revolution is spreading to countries where cash
dispensers and electronic terminals were previously unknown.
This spring Plus, the international inter-bank cash dispenser network,
expanded into 12 new countries from Malaysia and the Philippines to Spain
and the United Arab Emirates.
In 10 years Plus has grown to the point where it has nearly 200m card
holders in 30 countries. It describes its growth as explosive.
Nevertheless the slowdown in the world economy has been bad news for the
card world, judged against the rates at which payment card systems expanded
in the late 1980s. Visa's worldwide card sales volume of Dollars 393bn in
1991 was a relatively modest 16 per cent up and MasterCard grew by only 12.5
per cent during the year to Dollars 220.9bn.
Visa's market dominance looks unshakeable for the foreseeable future. Though
the gap between Visa (281m cards worldwide) and MasterCard (172m cards
worldwide) remains wide, Alex 'Pete' Hart, the MasterCard president since
1988, has restored morale and a sense of direction to his organisation.
MasterCard now has effective regional structures and it is moving fast to
catch up on services such as international cash-machine networks where a few
years ago it lagged well behind Visa.
On one market front, the debit card, MasterCard is this year making a bold
initiative which, if it succeeds, could place it ahead of Visa.
Several Visa debit cards, such as Barclays Connect in the UK, have been up
and running for several years, but Visa's debit card products are hard to
distinguish from its credit cards. MasterCard has entered the debit card
market much later but is taking a more radical approach to the challenges it
poses.
This summer MasterCard rolls out Maestro, its brand name for a world-wide
on-line point-of-sale debit card operation. It now has a network of bank
cash-machines and retail outlets covering most of the US. In Europe, it will
be represented by a sister scheme, EDC, the European Debit Card, set up by
Eurocard.
The debit card has already established itself as the dominant payment card
product of the 1990s with the numbers of cards issued rising rapidly. It
offers the banks an easy way to reduce their processing costs and consumers
seem to have accepted it.
Those who do not like the idea of losing a few week's free interest may be
mollified with a second generation of debit card products in which payment
is made monthly: by 1995 there will be around 90m monthly debit cards in
Europe alone.
By contrast, the credit card may be now on the way to becoming a niche
product supplying a revolving credit linked to a bank account. Though a few
banks and building societies do not charge an annual fee for their credit
cards, their number is shrinking rapidly. Consumers in other countries
already pay charges, usually much stiffer ones.
They may end up paying much higher charges if some day retailers across the
globe revolt against the present fee system and bring down the interchange
system under which most of the commission a retailer pays on each credit
card transaction by his bank goes to the bank which issued the card.
Even without such an upset in the economics of the credit card industry,
some bankers think that the credit card may already be coming to the end of
its life as a product. They foresee a shift towards gold cards to serve
customers who want to borrow money on their cards.
It is not only the credit card issuers who are feeling the impact of market
pressures. Take American Express: to protect its customer base from erosion
by Visa and MasterCard, it has to spend heavily on marketing. In spite of
this the number of Amex cards worldwide has dropped slightly to 36.1m from
36.7m. Its income was down by 23 per cent in the first quarter of this year
to Dollars 125m.
Attempts to beat Visa and MasterCard on their own ground by entering the
credit card market with the Optima card caused Amex heavy losses over the
past few years.
As a result, Amex plans to trim its Dollars 9.4bn Travel Related Services
budget by just under 11 per cent over three years. It has also sold a
Dollars 1.1bn stake in First Data Corporation, its processing subsidiary in
a public offering.
One way forward for the charge card issuers is to seek co-brandings with an
outside partner. Amex recently announced a tie-up with Banco Santander in
Spain and says it plans further deals of this sort. Diners' Club, the other
main charge card issuer, has found a successful niche by issuing co-branded
cards with airlines.
Another response to the changing economics of the card-based payments world
is to farm out some of the operations involved to a third party, rather than
try to do them all in-house.
This trend has been particularly striking in the processing of credit cards
where an outside specialist can take advantage of larger volumes of business
to process cards more cheaply than the individuals are able to do for
themselves.
Last year, First Data Resources became Europe's largest third-party
processor by purchasing Signet, the Southend-based processing plant set up
by the Access consortium, for Pounds 146m from Lloyds, National Westminster,
and Royal Bank of Scotland. FDR, which now processes about 14m card accounts
a year, is looking to expand in Europe. There are other competitors bidding
for the same market, notably Sligos of France (which also bid for Signet),
but FDR has the head start.
In the US, there has been a steady withdrawal by banks from the processing
market and also from providing card services directly to retailers. In their
place new specialist third-party processors are emerging.
In Europe, CCN Systems, a subsidiary of Great Universal Stores, has set up a
joint venture with Asko, Kaufhof, Metro, one of Europe's largest retailing
consortiums, to provide European third-party processing services.
Rising operating costs are not the only pressures affecting the economics of
the payments card business. One unwelcome item on all card issuers' agenda
is fraud. MasterCard International describes fraud as an international
moving bush fire, leaping from one country to another.
Global losses on fraud are thought to have passed the Dollars 1bn mark in
1991. To combat losses on this scale, it looks as if the banks will have to
invest in new technology and strike deals with telecommunications companies
all over the world allowing them to handle more transactions on-line.
The fraud challenge has speeded up the adoption of new technology, but much
of it will be ineffective unless banks and governments across the world
agree on common standards.
Technology is also spawning a host of new payment card products. Ten years
ago, pre-payment cards were virtually unknown.
Today, about 1bn are used world-wide each year. Applications are spreading
from telephones to transport, such as road toll systems.
Mr Peter Harrop, the author of a recent study of pre-payment cards, expects
around 1.7bn cards to be used by 1995 and thinks that they will gradually
replace coins and low value banknotes in many everyday transactions.
This is good news for suppliers. Bank payment cards are relatively uniform,
but pre-payment cards are likely to be much more diverse, not least because
it does not matter if one issuer's cards are completely incompatible with
those of another.
Indeed it can be a positive virtue, making fraudsters' work hard and
obliging a card holder to stick to a particular service.
Even more diverse forms of payment may lie in the distant future. The
machines that identify card holders at point of sale terminals may one day
fulfil the dreams of some rich North Americans and make cards unnecessary.
By 2020, a generation of super-intelligent terminals may be able to identify
customers from their finger print or retinal patterns; check their account
status with their bank; and simply ask them to sign for their purchase.
But that is probably a fantasy. Plastic cards are more than just extremely
convenient payment instruments. They enable banks to carry their branding
deep into the daily lives of their personal customers. Modern retail banking
is unthinkable without payment cards and their influence is set to grow
further in the years ahead.

MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, yesterday praised the Israeli
prime minister's offer to go to Arab capitals in search of a peace
breakthrough, Reuter reports from Washington.
'I think that any time Arab nations and Israel can sit down face to face and
talk peace it is a very good thing,' Mr Baker said. 'Whether it is done in
the context of the peace process which we have developed or whether it is
done outside it, I think it would be a very, very good thing.'
Asked if he still intended to proceed with the peace process that the US
initiated with a Middle East conference last October, Mr Baker said: 'The
point I want to make . . . is that we should not exclude anything that
should lead to peace.'
Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the
administration was considering sending a senior official to Israel to
prepare for a possible visit to Washington by Mr Rabin.

Czech premier Vaclav Klaus said his government would not bow to pressure to

FT  14 JUL 92 / EC's high interest rates come under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE MINISTERS of all EC states, including Germany, yesterday deplored
Europe's high interest rates, but conceded the level of rates was
effectively in the hands of the Bundesbank.
This hand-wringing by EC politicians was tempered by a widespread feeling
among them that the German central bank was unlikely to raise its interest
rates at its meeting on Thursday.
'My deep conviction is that the Bundesbank is not outside reality, and that
the reality is that interest rates are too high,' Mr Michel Sapin, France's
finance minister, said yesterday.
This sentiment was echoed by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer.
After chairing his first EC finance ministers' meeting, he said: 'I hope
there will not be an increase in German rates later this week. We recognise
that unification has posed certain problems in Germany. There has to be the
right balance between fiscal and monetary measures there . . . but in the
end, it is for the Germans to decide.'
Mr Horst Kohler, Bonn's state secretary for finance, repeated Germany's
litany of budgetary problems related to unification.
'No one put us (Germans) in the dock on interest rates,' he said after the
meeting.
There was, he said, 'a perspective' of rates coming down in Germany and
elsewhere in Europe, but perhaps too slowly to spur a job-creating economic
recovery.
The UK chancellor underlined the long-haul approach to lowering interest
rates. He summed up the mood at the meeting by saying 'the right conditions
for lowering interest rates . . . will be achieved by reducing budget
deficits and inflation'.
The new Italian government was praised for the measures it has taken to
contain its 1992 budget deficit.
Seeking to scotch rumours that a German rate rise might be accompanied by a
realignment of currencies within the European Monetary System, Mr Piero
Barucci, Italy's new finance minister, said there was no likelihood of
devaluing the lira.
Such a step 'would go counter to all the measures taken (by Italy) in the
last few days', he said.
The Dutch government, whose 'convergence' plan was discussed by ministers,
was told that 'fiscal consolidation is the key requirement' for bringing its
debt and public spending down to the levels laid in the Maastricht treaty
for monetary union.

FT  14 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in HSBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST day's trading in HSBC (Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation)
as a constituent of London's FT-SE 100-share Index saw the shares race
higher both in London and Hong Kong. Investors were additionally encouraged
by news that the bank had sold its 10 per cent stake in the Hong Kong
airline Cathay Pacific.
HSBC's entry into the Footsie, following its successful takeover of Midland
Bank, triggered a flurry of buying from Footsie tracking funds. The shares
rose 7 1/2 to 348p and were the most heavily traded on the London market
with turnover reaching 22.5m.
The sale of the 10 per cent shareholding in Cathay Pacific was viewed
positively by banking specialists, who said they expected HSBC shares to
continue to move ahead.
Demand for Fisons
Pharmaceuticals group Fisons recovered sharply as UK merchant bank Kleinwort
Benson decided that the price had fallen too far. The house already had the
stock on its buy list and was telling clients that the fundamental value of
the company's drugs, marketing infrastructure and R &amp; D pipeline were 'in
excess of the current share price'.
Kleinwort also believes that if Fisons does not sort out its manufacturing
problems a hostile bid of at least 350p a share is a possibility. The stock,
which had fallen after end-of-account bear-raiding on Friday, closed 16
better at 205p.
Hints that institutional investors overweight in Glaxo might be adjusting
portfolios in readiness for the forthcoming Wellcome issue reacted against
last week's buying and sent Glaxo 20 lower to 690p.
There was a further deflation of sentiment after an article in the US press
reiterated concern about side-effects from the anti-migraine drug
Sumatriptan, which Glaxo markets in the UK as Imigran. It also cited
possible rivals to the group's ulcer drug Zantac. Wellcome picked up 3 to
878p.
SmithKline Beecham held up well as both the 'A' shares and the units were
split to allow for an easier comparison between the two. The 'A' stock
closed at 454p, slightly firmer than the 904p mid price before the
two-for-one split. The units were affected by a 10-for-one split and closed
at 412p, against an opening price of 4098p.
Barclays was a casualty in an otherwise buoyant banking arena, as the shares
continued to react to increasing worries about a dividend cut. The bank is
scheduled to announce interim figures on August 6.
The stock was also affected by further switching from Barclays into National
Westminster. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken advised the switch last week. Barclays
finished 4 lower at 316p and NatWest moved forward 4 to 339p.
Lloyds Bank delivered another good performance, although dealers said the
rise of 8 to 435p owed more to a continuing stock shortage than any surge of
buying.
TSB continued to intrigue banking specialists as long-running rumours of a
possible stake-building operation as a prelude to a full bid continued to
circulate. The shares settled 6 higher at 148p on 6.1m traded, with dealers
noting above-average turnover in recent sessions and increased activity in
the traded options.
Lloyds, which lost out in the battle for control of Midland Bank, has been
rumoured as a potential bidder for TSB, although it has played down the
stories.
The composite insurance sector, which fell 9 per cent relative to the wider
market last month, lost further ground amid growing concern about the safety
of dividends in the sector. General Accident, labelled 'expensive' by County
NatWest, which says the stock trades at a 10 per cent premium to net asset
value as opposed to discounts by all the other composites, weakened 9 to
418p.
ICI lost 20 to 1143p as last week's end of account speculation that Goldman
Sachs had offloaded its alleged 10m-share stake in the group died away.
There had been a rumour that one securities house was prepared to take stock
from Goldman at 1150p a share and also that Goldman had been active in the
futures market last week.
A downgrade in Courtaulds left the shares off 11 at 502p. UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew cut its forecast for the year ending March 1993 by Pounds 10m to Pounds
210m and the following year's by Pounds 15m to Pounds 230m. The revision
follows a recent and heavy Smith New Court profits downgrade last month of
its biggest UK competitor, ICI. Smith is also adjusting its Courtaulds
figure but is not believed to be as bearish as UBS.
Chemicals distribution group Ellis &amp; Everard fell 13 to 172p. The group
announced that the chairman was leaving after 'management differences' in
the company and revealed a 27 per cent profits slide to Pounds 9.1m.
Preliminary results from Tomkins, showing profits at the top end of market
expectations and a 15 per cent increase in the dividend, were given a warm
response by the market. The shares were hoisted 12 to 471p in turnover of
1.2m.
P &amp; O's recent uncomfortable ride in the stock market continued and the
shares lost 10 to 388p. They were said to have been weakened by an overhang
of stock apparently sold into the market last week as part of a programme
trade.
The biggest casualty in the oil sector was Enterprise, which receded 7 to
371p following a Nomura downgrade.
Confident trading noises continued to emanate from Cadbury-Schweppes, the
shares adding 5 at 474p.
Among retailers, Morrison Supermarkets firmed a penny to 120p ahead of a
London presentation this week, as did Argyll, to 355p, with an encouraging
agm expected tomorrow.
Some switching from Tesco, where margins are said to be suffering, into J.
Sainsbury left the former 2 off at 253p and the latter ahead 4 at 451p.
In a quiet leisure sector, Thorn EMI found favour as Hoare Govett put the
group on its weekly top buy list, having decided that the stock had reached
the bottom of its relative trading range. The shares gained 9 to 803p in
meagre turnover.
Interest rate concern and dividend worries hit a number of leading property
shares. Great Portland Estates declined 7 to 123p, Hammerson 'A' 11 to 285p,
MEPC 8 to 258p and Slough Estates 15 to 125p.
Media buying company Aegis, which had fallen on Friday after a broker's sell
note, bounced 4 to 43p.
Confirmation of a Pounds 30m contract for 150 armoured cars was not enough
to prevent GKN dipping 4 to 381p.

FT  14 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currency factors depress share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN OVER the implic-ations for sterling of developments in European
currencies, deepening ahead of Thursday's meeting at the Bundesbank, kept
the UK stock market depressed yesterday. Trading volume was poor and the
market ended the first day of the new two-week trading account with a loss
of a further 12.5 points on the FT-SE Index.
Determined rejection by both Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr
Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, of calls from some political
sources for sterling devaluation combined with fears in the City of London
that the Bundesbank might tighten monetary policy this week. Lingering hopes
for an early cut in UK interest rates have been replaced by fears that they
could be forced up.
Equities opened lower and a brief attempt to rally was soon extinguished.
With the September futures contract on the Footsie below 2,500 for most of
the day, the stock market remained resolutely on the downside, showing a
fall of 17.1 at the day's low. Share prices recovered a little in late
trading when Wall Street opened the new session with a gain of 8 Dow points
in London trading hours.
At the close, the FT-SE was down 12.5 at 2,478.3. Selling pressure remained
light, as reflected by Seaq volume of 349.4m shares, well below levels
acceptable to the London securities industry. Friday's Seaq total of 519.5m
reflected customer, or retail, business in equities worth only Pounds
982.8m, according to Stock Exchange statistics. This value total is at the
low end of the range of market profitability.
Weakness in the dollar gnawed away at recent share gains in such
transatlantic favourites as Glaxo and Rothmans International. ICI turned
lower again as the market continued to shy away from the possibility that a
large US investment bank might seek to place a 10m-share stake in the UK
chemical company. However, Wellcome edged higher ahead of the share placing
operation.
UK stock market strategists have remained noticeably wary, and have
generally taken a relatively cautious view of the near-term outlook. At
Goldman Sachs, Sushil Wadhwani sets a 12-month target for the Footsie index
of 2,900 - 'provided that the economy is seen to recover, albeit at a
sluggish rate' - but, if the UK economy fails to recover, or valuation norms
change, then 'equities might weaken to 2,000 in 12 months'.
Nomura Research Institute, commenting on the UK recession, says 'it is not
over yet', warning that recent rises in manufacturers' and retailers' stocks
might be the result of inflated expectations about demand growth.
At Nikko Securities, Peter Thorne also suggests that recent negative
sentiment has been caused by unrealistic economic expectations and remains
convinced that UK equities are good value against bonds and other
international markets.
Richard Kersley at Barclays de Zoete Wedd believes that a yield ratio on
equities against bonds now at its lowest point since 1974 must be a
supportive factor for share prices.

FT  14 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages recovery from
early decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AMID conflicting pressures, US share prices posted modest gains in thin
trading yesterday as markets staged a recovery from early losses linked to
weakness in bond prices and the dollar, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was ahead 6.75 at 3,337.31,
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was slightly firmer on balance at 414.87, up
0.25. The Nasdaq composite put in the day's best performance, rising 2.42 to
570.22.
Turnover on the New York SE was a meagre 149m shares, while rises outpaced
declines by 978 to 738.
Overnight losses on foreign markets combined with continued weakness in the
dollar, linked to speculation that the Bundesbank may raise German interest
rates; and these two with declining bond prices as the 30-year benchmark
bond fell  1/2 point, pushing the yield back up to 7.67 per cent. All of
this undermined early sentiment but some positive quarterly earnings reports
helped prices recover by mid-morning.
Bank stocks were a feature amid a string of well-received figures, although
most of the early gains were erased later in the session by profit-taking.
JP Morgan, after advancing more than Dollars 1 on news of a sharp rise in
second-quarter profits from Dollars 231m a year ago to Dollars 385m, settled
back to end unchanged at Dollars 61 5/8 .
Chase Manhattan had an early rise but fell later to finish down Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 27 7/8 in active trading, after the bank reported a net
profit of Dollars 152m in the quarter, up from Dollars 132m at the same
stage of 1991.
First Chicago moved in a similar pattern, gaining ground before closing a
net Dollars  5/8 off at Dollars 35 7/8 , having reported second-quarter
profits of Dollars 68.2m, up 17 per cent from a year earlier.
Also in financials, Federal National Mortgage Associ ation (Fannie Mae) rose
early on, but ended down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 63 3/4 in turnover of more
than  1/2 m shares, after news of record three-month profits of Dollars
402m, compared to Dollars 382m in the previous quarter.
Alcoa firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 73 1/2 after the company reported a
second-quarter loss of Dollars 30.6m after taking charges of Dollars 104.7m
related, among other things, to employment reductions.
IBM put on Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 97 7/8 on news that the computer group
had entered an alliance with Siemens, of Germany, and Toshiba, of Japan, for
the joint development of advanced semiconductor products.
On the Nasdaq market, Spartan Motors plummeted Dollars 6 7/8 to Dollars 13
5/8 in heavy trading after the company warned that second-quarter earnings
would come in between 28 and 34 cents a share, well below market
expectations.
Century Medicorp jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 19 after stating that it
was negotiating the terms of a stock swap acquisition by another, as yet
unnamed but larger, healthcare company.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed steady after a day of light trading activity. The TSE
300 index edged up 1.7 to 3,449.2 and advancing issues led declines by just
272 to 244. Volume came to 18.9m shares.
The real estate group posted the day's biggest decline, 1.91 per cent. One
of the sub-group's most heavily weighted stocks, Cambridge Shopping Centres,
fell CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 15 1/2.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Fears of rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S steep slide on the foreign exchanges obliterated any bullishness
that might have lingered in the cash and futures markets yesterday, with
some dealers beginning to wonder whether Britain might be on the verge of an
interest rate rise.
Even in the relatively inexpensive conditions that prevailed in the cash
market yesterday, rates could not but fail to go up. A Pounds 1.05bn
shortage forecast by the Bank of England at the start of the day was swiftly
removed by dealers. An easier flow of money from the authorities, however,
could not stop rates firming in the afternoon, as the pound sank to a
DM2.8525 London close, later plumbing a low of DM2.8489.
Futures traders also had one of their busiest days of the year. The
September contract fell 24 basis points to 89.85, a level which certainly
dismisses all possibility of a cut in base rates before the autumn, and
probably takes into account a rise. Trading in the contract was extremely
heavy, reaching a volume of 37,323 lots. This price assumes that three-month
sterling cash rates will be at 10.15 per cent in mid-September.
The market remains overwhelmed by fears that the Bundesbank will tighten
monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday. In the cash market,
dealers decided to take out the shortage quickly. One discount house dealer
said: 'They simply did not want period rates to get any worse.'
Another dealer said there was no incentive in the interbank market to offer
cash at a discount. 'We are now so resigned to rates not moving down before
September that there will be no prizes for being clever, even if the
Bundesbank does not tighten on Thursday.'
By the close of trading, the yield curve reflected rates of 10 1/8 per cent
all the way out to one-year. Three-month money was up from a previous 10
1/32 per cent.
The Bank's operations were at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for
Bands 1 and 2 and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo). In
the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 50m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 25m
in Band 2 and Pounds 812m in a repo for resale on August 3. The forecast was
later revised to Pounds 1bn and in the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds
113m of Band 1 bank bills.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling falls to 3-month low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING fell victim to heavy selling on the foreign exchange markets
yesterday, as dealers grew increasingly nervous that the Bundesbank will
raise interest rates at its council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz.
The UK currency finished in London at DM2.8525, exactly two pfennigs down
from Friday's close and nearly a pfennig below yesterday morning's opening.
In later trading, it was down to a low of DM2.8489, a level last seen on
April 8, at the height of worries over a possible Labour victory at the
general election.
At the end of the day, the pound was more firmly rooted at the bottom of the
European Monetary System grid, with a 2.16 percentage points differential
between it and the next weakest currency, the Italian lira.
There was no hint from Germany yesterday as to whether the authorities will
raise interest rates on Thursday or tighten the conditions under which banks
can borrow money at the emergency Lombard rate. Traders, however, will not
have been helped by a rise in call money rates in the German markets
yesterday to 9.65-9.75 per cent, close to the Bundesbank's emergency funding
rate of 9.75 per cent.
Dealers said the increasing uncertainty about Britain's interest rate policy
was also undermining the currency. Although the prime minister reiterated
the chancellor's commitment to the European exchange rate mechanism
yesterday, the market is still unsure whether the authorities are prepared
to stick to this policy, especially if it means raising rates again.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London,
said: 'There is a mismatch between rhetoric and action. We have recently
seen the Bank of Italy raise rates as a consequence of being in the ERM. The
market wants to know whether the British are prepared to do the same.'
The dollar was the other victim of the D-Mark yesterday, falling to DM1.4780
from a previous close of DM1.4955. Yesterday, analysts highlighted political
uncertainty in the US as a factor behind the dollar's weakness, swayed by
the opening of the Democratic party's convention in New York.
There is also uncertainty about US economic indicators due out this week.
Some analysts expect today's retail sales figures for June to be down 0.2
per cent, and tomorrow's industrial production figures to fall the same
amount. The US unit further weakened in New York to end at DM1.4743.
The yen closed stronger against the dollar, helped by news that Japan's
trade surplus in the first half of 1992 had widened to Dollars 49.03bn.
Dealers were also influenced by newspaper reports suggesting that the Bank
of Japan is not about to cut interest rates.

fare, when Mr John Gummer steered through a meeting of his fellow farm
ministers a plan to protect specialist foods against imitation, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
Any Dutch or Danish farmer with ambitions to copy Brie de Meaux, Crottin de
Chavignol or Bleu d'Auvergne cheeses can forget them. But big cheese
businesses will be able to go on making as much Greek-style feta or
English-style Cheddar as they like.
The decision, the first ministers have made under Mr Gummer's chairmanship,
means pungent French cheeses and other specialities strongly associated with
a particular region can be labelled as authentic and cannot be imitated.
The scheme, on the lines of France's appelation controlee system for fine
wines, is intended to boost sales of high-class traditional foods after
years of EC farm policy that encouraged quantity at the expense of quality.
The plan was dogged for months by difficulties over what to do about
products such as feta and Spanish-style chorizo sausage, which are made all
over the EC.
Now a list of foods whose recipes have already travelled well beyond their
motherlands will be drawn up to prevent makers laying claim to them as
extra-special. And any product that was legally on sale in the EC at the end
of June can go on being sold as before.
The scheme divided ministers on north-south lines. It was supported
enthusiastically by countries such as Italy and France, while the
Netherlands and Denmark, which specialise in the mass production of everyday
cheese, voted against. Belgium joined them.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Foreign weakness prompts slide in
Treasuries

US TREASURY prices fell yesterday as weakness in foreign markets overnight
carried through into New York trading.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  17/32 at
103 23/32 , yielding 7.673 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down
 1/16 at 101 5/32 to yield 4.361 per cent. Trading activity was described as
extremely quiet.
After late selling on Friday, and early Monday losses in Asia and Europe, it
was no surprise that bonds opened lower in the US markets. Traders,
searching for an explanation for the lack of strength in Treasuries, cited
the weakness in the dollar (which has been undermined by talk of a
tightening in German monetary policy) and doubts about the outcome of this
year's presidential election.
Minds of dealers and investors are likely to remain focused on political
risk in the market because of the Democratic National Convention.
As for the economic fundamentals, trading will be light until today's June
retail sales and consumer prices data is released. Later in the week June
industrial production figures will be published, followed by last month's
housing data and May's trade balance, all of which should give bond market
participants a clearer idea of how the economic recovery is progressing.
In the credit markets, after trading at 3 3/16 per cent for the first half
of the day, Fed funds firmed slightly to 3 1/4 per cent, the target recently
set by the Federal Reserve. The upward move in the rate was achieved without
any intervention by the Fed.
THE Spanish bond yield curve became even more sharply inverted yesterday as
dealers speculated that the Bank of Spain may decide to notch up money
market rates ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank meeting.
Ten-year Spanish bonds now yield 11.51 per cent, compared with a 12-month
rate of 12.87 per cent.
The Bank of Spain intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market
yesterday to protect the peseta, at Pta63.70 against the D-Mark. Dealers
said the currency came under pressure due to worries about a Bundesbank
squeeze on monetary conditions, if not a rate rise, at Thursday's meeting.
The longer end of the Spanish bond market benefited from good news on
inflation, running at 6.2 per cent year on year, according to June figures.
The Spanish bond market is currently 'stuck in a spread range of 350 to 380
basis points over bund yields ahead of the French referendum on the
Maastricht treaty in September,' according to Mr Steve Major, international
bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais.
THE German bund market fell a  1/4 -point yesterday on concerns that the
Bundesbank will raise rates at Thursday's meeting. Although many analysts do
not expect the key Lombard rate to be altered, the Bundesbank has a number
of other options which would allow it to tighten monetary conditions.
'The Bundesbank meeting is the sole focus of the market this week,' one
trader said.
The new 10-year bund ended at a yield of 7.98 per cent, with some support at
a yield of 8 per cent: the price has already fallen 40 basis points since
Friday's auction.
UK gilt prices dropped half a point yesterday as sterling's weakness
continued to depress market sentiment. Dealers reported relatively low
volume in the cash market, as prices were marked down early on Monday
morning. A technical support level at 98.30 on the gilt future on Liffe is
underpinning the market, dealers said.
'The fact that the government has left sterling below the narrow band floor
has led to some questioning of government policy on the Exchange Rate
Mechanism,' said Mr Adrian James, international bond analyst at NatWest
Capital Markets.
JAPANESE government bonds ended  3/8 point higher, boosted by speculation
that the reserve ratio for commercial banks deposited with the Bank of Japan
may be lowered.

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: International losses push FedEx
Dollars 113.8m in red

<TEXT>
FEDERAL EXPRESS, the largest overnight package delivery business in the US,
made a Dollars 113.8m loss after tax in the year to end-May.
The loss is scored on revenues down from Dollars 7.69bn a year earlier to
Dollars 7.55bn. FedEx which has been incurring heavy losses from its
international operations recently, made a small Dollars 5.9m profit after
tax in 1990-91. However, in the previous year, it reported a Dollars 115.8m
surplus after tax, and in 1989-90, Dollars 184.6m.
In the fourth quarter of 1991-92 alone, Federal said that the overall
after-tax profit totalled Dollars 35.8m, up from Dollars 31m in the same
period a year earlier. Federal's international business, however, remained
in the red - although the operating loss from this division fell to Dollars
53.2m, on revenues of Dollars 536.1m. This compared with a deficit of
Dollars 74.6m on revenues of Dollars 633.5m a year earlier.
In March, Federal announced a withdrawal from the highly competitive
European delivery industry, sub-contracting all its intra-European delivery
business and laying off more than 6,000 employees. Express package volumes
to and from Europe had been maintained at levels 'ahead of expectations'.
But Mr Fred Smith, Federal's founder and chairman, warned that further
improvement would 'require a continuation of growth in international express
package volumes . . . and higher profitability from international air
freight business'.
For 1991-92 overall, the loss from the Memphis-based company's international
operations totalled Dollars 612.9m, compared with a Dollars 419.1m deficit
in the previous 12 months. The former figure, however, was scored after
Dollars 254m of restructuring charges, largely to cover the withdrawal from
Europe. the 1990-91 loss came after charges of Dollars 121m.
On the domestic front, where Federal Express carries about half the nation's
overnight express packages, FedEx said that the climate remained extremely
price-competitive. Despite this, Federal managed an operating profit margin
of 12.2 per cent, which it attributed to productivity gains and cost
improvements.

EXCESS aluminium supplies squeezed Alcan's margins in the second quarter,
contributing to a higher loss.
The Montreal-based aluminium producer also painted a sombre picture of its
near-term prospects. 'With considerable new capacity being added to the
industry this year, it is difficult to see much relief for prices,' Mr David
Morton, chairman, said.
The net second-quarter loss was USDollars 27m, or 14 cents a share, up from
Dollars 5m, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. The six-month loss also
widened to Dollars 40m, or 22 cents, from Dollars 6m, or 7 cents.
The second-quarter figure includes a Dollars 9m after-tax charge, equal to 4
cents a share, for cost-reduction programmes. Similar charges of Dollars
17m, or 8 cents, were taken a year earlier. Revenues slipped fractionally to
just under Dollars 2bn.
Mr Morton said an improvement in North America, Germany and France compared
with the previous three months was offset by poor results from Japan, partly
due to the weak performance of Nippon Light Metal Company.
Alcan shipped 191,000 tonnes of ingots in the second quarter, down from
219,000 a year earlier. Deliveries of fabricated products rose to 380,000
tonnes from 368,000 tonnes.
The average ingot price dropped by Dollars 38 per tonne to Dollars 1,431,
but Alcan said its average production costs had fallen by more than Dollars
100 per tonne in the past year.
During 1991 Alcan laid off about 4,000 employees worldwide and shut down
about 8 per cent of its smelting capacity because of low world prices.

VISA, one of the leading US credit card companies, said its first-quarter
results showed an 11.5 per cent increase in domestic sales volume.
The San Francisco-based company claimed this was superior to the average 10
per cent growth rate for other large credit card companies during the first
three months of 1992.
The statistics are set against the backdrop of a perception by most
economists that US consumer confidence remained weak during the opening
months of the year.
Visa said it recorded Dollars 40.7bn in card transactions for the quarter
ended on March 31. The number of Visa cards in circulation in the US rose by
4.5 per cent to 143m cards. The number of Visa transactions in the US
increased by 9 per cent.

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Going hard on soft drinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEAGRAM, one of the world's biggest producers of hard liquor, has embarked
on an ambitious and aggressive drive to become a global player in the orange
juice business.
The Canadian company - best known for its Glenlivet, Chivas Regal and
Martell labels - entered fruit juice in 1988 with the Dollars 1.2bn
acquisition of Tropicana, a leading US producer of orange juice.
The deal marked its first significant foray into non-alcoholic drinks.
'It was seen as a longer-term strategic investment, broadening Seagram's
base in the beverage business,' says Mr Myron Roeder, president of Tropicana
International.
Fruit juices and juice-based drinks comprise the second largest grocery
category in the US, with retail sales growing by close to 50 per cent over
the past 10 years to Dollars 11.3bn last year. Orange juice is worth more
than Dollars 3bn a year.
Ten years ago, ready-to-serve juice accounted for 30 per cent of sales: the
rest came from frozen concentrate. Today, ready-to-serve juice has a 56 per
cent share of the US market, and Tropicana is the ready-to-serve brand
leader.
At the time of its takeover, Tropicana had annual sales of Dollars 700m,
mainly in the eastern US. By the end of 1990 the brand was being distributed
nationally with sales running at about Dollars 1.2bn a year.
Tropicana leads the overall orange juice market in the US with an estimated
volume share last year of 22 per cent. It claims to buy a quarter of
Florida's orange crop. The brand has been extended successfully across other
fruit drinks, notably a combination of orange with cranberry and mango.
Latterly, Tropicana has been pushing hard into international markets with
aggressive sales drives into Japan and Canada. Tropicana has entered the
Dollars 1.9bn UK market and ventured into France. A pan-European framework
has been established in anticipation of the single European market next
year.
In France, Tropicana acquired Maxime Delrue, a company which has handled its
bottled juice exports for 25 years, and has signed a distribution agreement
with Cedilac, a leading dairy company.
Tropicana has high hopes for Europe: the market is generally fragmented and
unbranded, and annual consumption per head is barely half the 40 litres of
the US. Mr Roeder sees no reason why similar growth should not be secured.
Tropicana's expansion is an expensive business, and this is fully reflected
in operating profits. In spite of strong sales, profits have been flat for
the past three years. After restructuring charges of Dollars 24m last year,
Seagram's income from the total juices, mixers and coolers operations
amounted to Dollars 79m against Dollars 895m from spirits and wines.

GREAT Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, one of the largest US supermarket
operators, saw first-quarter profits tumble.
The company, which is 53 per cent-owned by Germany's Tengelmann group, also
revealed it was writing off the value of its equity stake in Isosceles,
which owns the UK Gateway grocery chain. A&amp;P owns 7.2 per cent of Isosceles
and is taking a Dollars 89.2m provision to cover the potential loss on its
holding.
The after-tax figure, before the Isosceles provision and other one-off
accounting items, was Dollars 22.8m, compared with Dollars 36.2m a year
earlier. Sales slipped from Dollars 3.59bn to Dollars 3.32bn, while
operating profits fell to Dollars 60.1m from Dollars 89.8m.
A&amp;P has been badly hit by general food price deflation and acute competition
in the supermarket industry. Acquisitions in Canada and Michigan have also
proved tough to integrate.
However, the company said the climate was gradually improving, as the US
economy hauls itself out of recession.
A&amp;P shares closed Dollars  1/4 lower in New York at Dollars 27, having
earlier touched Dollars 26 7/8 .

profits record with Dollars 402m

<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported
its sixth consecutive quarter of record profits.
The largest residential mortgage provider in the US made a profit of Dollars
402m between April and June, eclipsing the previous record of Dollars 381.6m
in the first three months of the year. The results were 21 per cent higher
than the Dollars 331.5m earned in the second quarter of 1991.
The second quarter was the busiest ever in terms of the number of home loans
bought from mortgage originators and the amount of mortgage-backed
securities (MBS) sold to investors. The combined volume of these was a
record Dollars 67bn, up from Dollars 55.6bn in the previous quarter.
Because of strong loan acquisitions and securitisations, the total MBS
outstanding rose to Dollars 413bn and the net mortgage portfolio to Dollars
140bn by the end of the quarter.
The sharp increase in business activity helped offset a decline in Fannie
Mae's net interest margin, which fell from an average of 145 basis points in
the first quarter to 139 basis points. The company attributed this to
increased refinancings in the mortgage portfolio.
Fannie Mae's acquisition of foreclosed properties rose slightly to 2,391,
while charge-offs in the quarter were Dollars 58.6m, up from Dollars 56.7m
in the first quarter. The serious delinquency rate for single-family home
loans fell to 0.6 per cent in May of this year.
Fannie Mae's earnings were initially well received, but profit-taking saw
them close Dollars  3/4 lower on the day at Dollars 63 3/4 .

charge
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINUM Company of America (Alcoa), the world's biggest aluminium company,
plunged to a loss of Dollars 30.6m, or 37 cents a share, in the second
quarter. The decline followed after-tax charges totalling Dollars 104.7m, or
Dollars 1.22 a share.
The charges also pushed Alcoa's first-half earnings down 74.5 per cent from
Dollars 178.2m, or Dollars 2.09 cents, to Dollars 45.4m, or 52 cents.
The company maintained it had done reasonably well, considering the turmoil
in the industry and low aluminium prices, to be able to report earnings of
Dollars 74.1, or 85 cents, before charges in the second quarter. In the same
months of 1991, net earnings were Dollars 81.2m, or 95 cents.
Although sales in the second quarter fell from Dollars 2.57bn to Dollars
2.41bn, shipments were up from 659,000 tonnes to 706,000 tonnes. In the
first half, sales slipped from Dollars 4.98bn to Dollars 4.66bn while
shipments totalled 1.37m tonnes, against 1.34bn in 1991.
Although aluminium prices were substantially lower in the quarter, the
impact was mostly offset by a fall in costs, a favourable tax rate, and
reductions in finance costs.
The second-quarter charges included Dollars 44.9m (Dollars 65.9m before
tax), or 52 cents, for redundancy payments. Alcoa said recently it would
reduce its world-wide workforce of 65,000 by 2,100 this year.
There is also an extraordinary charge of Dollars 50.2m, or 59 cents, for the
previously-announced redemption of high-cost debt to reduce financing costs,
and a charge of Dollars 9.6m, or 11 cents, paid to US hourly employees to
extend labour contracts by one year.
This is the second time in six months Alcoa has been hit by substantial
charges. In the fourth quarter of 1991 it suffered charges of Dollars 217m
relating to the cost of environmental clean-ups and restructuring.

at three US banks

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS of recovery among US commercial banks emerged yesterday as improved
second-quarter earnings were unveiled by JP Morgan, Chase Manhattan and
First Chicago.
Although the trend may not extend across the board as US banks report their
results over the next week or two, analysts said their forecasts indicated
that the worst of the US banking industry's recent woes appeared to be over.
JP Morgan, the bank that has bucked the sectoral trend, led the way with a
sparkling 67 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 385m.
Earnings per share increased to Dollars 1.94 for the three-month period,
from Dollars 1.17 a year ago.
While Morgan achieved strong revenue growth in each of its main business
activities, the second-quarter net profit figure was lifted by a special
Dollars 124m pre-tax gain from the sale of Mexican government securities
that were acquired by the bank during debt refinancings in 1988 and 1989.
Although the after-tax impact of the gain on Morgan's earnings was not
disclosed, analysts estimated that the bank's second-quarter profit would
have improved by less than one-third had the gain been stripped out.
Chase Manhattan produced a 15.1 per cent improvement in its second-quarter
earnings, to Dollars 152m. Earnings per share were 83 cents, against 80
cents in the second quarter of last year.
First Chicago, announced a 19 per cent increase in second-quarter net
income, to Dollars 68.2m. Earnings per share at the bank were 79 cents
against 73 cents a year ago.
Highlights from the JP Morgan results included a very small Dollars 25m bad
debt provision, up from Dollars 10m a year ago. Non-interest revenues,
including the Dollars 124m special gain, jumped to Dollars 844m from Dollars
557m a year ago. Net interest revenue rose by 23 per cent to Dollars 434m.
Operating expenses were Dollars 745m, up from Dollars 585m because of higher
bonuses and increased hiring.
In the non-interest revenue stream, trading revenues rose by 22 per cent to
Dollars 287m, led by increases in swaps and other interest rate contracts as
well as foreign exchange.
Morgan's corporate finance revenue was 21 per cent higher at Dollars 110m;
its investment management fees increased by 19 per cent to Dollars 92m;
operational service fees were Dollars 102m, up by 7 per cent and
credit-related fee rose by 32 per cent to Dollars 50m.
Chase Manhattan said its net interest revenue was Dollars 878m, up from
Dollars 834m a year ago. The bank's bad debt provisions were Dollars 295m,
against Dollars 265m in the second quarter of 1991. Net loan write-offs were
Dollars 297m, down sharply from Dollars 682m a year ago, when heavy
charge-offs were taken on loans to Brazil and Argentina.
First Chicago's bad debt provisions were Dollars 105m, up by 17 per cent
year-on-year. Net interest income was 9 per cent higher at Dollars 300.9m,
while non-interest income was also 9 per cent improved at Dollars 336.6m.
On Wall Street, JP Morgan's share price closed unchanged at Dollars 61 5/8 ;
Chase's price was Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 27 7/8 , and First
Chicago's price was Dollars 35 7/8 , down Dollars  5/8 .

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Foods group whets appetites for
a sell-off / Examining one of Italy's most appealing candidates for
privatisation and finds its chief executive is opposed to any such sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SME, the Italian state-controlled foods and retailing group, is one of
Italy's most appealing privatisation candidates. With Mr Giuliano Amato's
new government apparently more serious than its predecessor about asset
sales to slash the budget deficit, SME's time may have come.
The group, which is 62 per cent-owned by the IRI state holding company, made
net profits of L125.6bn (Dollars 111m) after minorities last year on sales
of L5,814bn. In none of the three areas in which it operates is it on a par
with Europe's leaders. Food retailing, SME's biggest business and probably
the most attractive to potential buyers, with sales of almost L2,500bn in
1991, is concentrated in the 221-store GS supermarket chain.
Restaurants and catering, the smallest of SME's activities, with turnover of
just over L1,000bn, could also be appealing, although the loss-making Motta
operation could be hard for buyers to digest. Meanwhile, food production,
with 1991 revenues of more than L2,300bn, remains SME's most difficult nut
to crack. While the Italgel frozen foods subsidiary performs strongly, the
CBD canned foods and oils side is still losing money.
Privatisation is already under way. Last month saw the second stage in a
three-step deal to transfer control of SME's Pavesi confectionery arm to
Barilla, the big, private pasta group. Pavesi is the best-known of the four
loss-making subsidiaries spun off into joint ventures with the private
sector in 1990 in an attempt to improve profitability.
'The idea was to concentrate on a smaller number of businesses,' says Mr
Mario Artali, SME's chief executive for the past two years. With current
sales of almost L280bn, Pavesi has been by far the most successful of the
four.
The deal with Barilla, which bought an opening 49 per cent stake, allowed
for the transfer of full control by 1993 at an agreed price of L240bn. Last
month, the terms were altered slightly; Barilla bought a further 10 per cent
for L80bn, giving it majority ownership ahead of schedule, and the two sides
look set to conclude the full sale by next January.
Mr Artali admits that Pai, Adams and Nuova Forneria, the three other joint
ventures, are not going so well, and full disposals probably remain
dependent on a return to profitability. However, he stresses food production
is no longer the 'nightmare' it was when he joined. Setting up the joint
ventures helped SME to concentrate on a smaller number of businesses, and
progress has been made on improving earnings on the industrial side, partly
by branching out into fresh milk.
The Pavesi sale has given SME the financial cushion to complete the
restructuring of its food industry side, he says. By rejigging the deal last
month to avoid bunching capital gains into one tax year, SME can look
forward to substantial extraordinary earnings for the next two years, giving
it time to tackle remaining problems in food production.
Mr Artali doubts further piecemeal privatisation is on the cards. Any
decision to sell would have to come from the government via IRI. However, he
makes clear his opposition to a sale. And if SME is to be privatised at all,
it should be in one piece. Breaking the business up 'has no sense', he says.
'SME is too small, not too big.' Mr Artali cites Spain, where foreign,
notably French, groups have made deep inroads into food retailing, to the
detriment of the indigenous agricultural and food industry. Imports of
processed food rose at the expense of domestic producers. 'It was a mistake
for the country.'
He also queries the financial arguments for privatising SME. Around 38 per
cent of its shares are quoted, with a stock market capitalisation of about
L1,700bn. But that substantially understates the value of the business, he
argues. Placing the remaining shares would mean selling at a discount to the
current market price, reducing the proceeds from privatisation. 'Prices on
the Milan stock market no longer reflect the value of a company,' he said.
Mr Artali's hope is for SME to stay public at least long enough to expand
those parts of the group, such as food retailing and catering, which are
doing well, while gradually improving the food production side.
SME currently has about 8 per cent of the food retailing market in Italy.
But although its GS chain ranks second only to the country's big
co-operatives in food sales, Mr Artali thinks it is 'not sufficient'. Growth
will come through expanding GS, concentrated in Piedmont and Lombardy in the
north and Lazio and Campania in the south, into other parts of the country
while filling in gaps where it is already well represented. The aim is to
create new regional centres with sales of between L200bn and L300bn, he
says.
Acquisitions could accelerate matters. SME has already integrated two small
supermarket chains bought in the past two years. And Mr Artali would also
like to set up more hypermarkets: the first is opening this year and plans
call for around two launches a year.
Autogrill is also set to expand. The traditional motorway services business
plans to develop abroad, while new domestic growth is expected through
opening restaurants in new locations such as shopping centres. The company
is even considering joint ventures - an unprecedented step  - and looking at
eastern Europe, where the motorway network, and related services, offer
prospects to expand.
Mr Artali recognises the sizeable barriers to his plans. With only around 20
supermarket chains in Italy, chances for growth through acquisitions are
limited. Moreover, prices are already sky-high and there are few sellers.
Meanwhile, the pace of organic growth for both supermarkets and hypermarkets
is restricted by planning rules and small retailers' hostility.
With Italy's motorway network virtually complete, he also accepts the
catering business has reached its limits in many domestic locations.
Autogrill will have to pump more business through existing roadside sites,
while foreign expansion, though appealing, will not come easily. Meanwhile,
urgent changes are necessary at Motta, the inner-city restaurant chain whose
earnings no longer live up to its famous name.
Whatever the problems, SME has one big advantage over most of its
public-sector counterparts. Its businesses generate cash, meaning it has
relatively little debt and no need for heavy borrowing. Sales in the first
five months of this year were 9.1 per cent up at L2,445bn, while earnings,
swollen by extraordinary gains, should surge by at least 20 per cent to
L155bn, according to Milan brokers Pasfin. SME's current L1,700bn three-year
investment plan will be entirely self-financed, notes Mr Artali. In the end
that, rather than politics, may be the main factor making privatisation less
pressing.

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: East German Investment net asset value
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EAST German Investment Trust reported a net asset value of DM2.81 (96p)
as at June 30 1992.
The outcome compared with asset values of DM2.78 12 months earlier and
DM2.71 at the December 31 year-end.
The trust, which concentrates its portfolio in unquoted companies located or
operating in the former east Germany, came to the market in February last
year following a placing by County NatWest and Berliner Bank.
Net revenue for the six months to end-June dropped from DM1.67m to
DM904,000.
Earnings per share emerged at DM0.019, down from DM0.042 last time.
During the period under review, the trust invested DM54m in a further eight
investments across a broad range of activities including white goods,
television operations, property development, laboratories and building
products.
This lifted its total investment to some DM86m across 13 unquoted companies
 -representing 55 per cent of total assets.

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Playing a variety of roles in natural
resources / Investigation into the investment career of Clive Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLIVE SMITH, the Midlands entrepreneur known for his involvement in the
flotations of several natural resource companies in London in the 1980s, is
no stranger to litigation. Two legal actions have been taken out against him
in the last six months.
Mr Smith has been involved in companies such as Butte Mining, Geevor,
Petranol, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Globe Petroleum, formerly called Far East
Resources.
The Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into two, Richmond
and Butte, following a raid on the offices of Bryant &amp; Co, a Jersey
accountant which once managed some of Mr Smith's offshore interests.
A self-made millionaire, Mr Smith played various roles in the resource
companies, from shareholder to board executive, and even chairman.
The degree of his involvement in many of these companies is unclear, as
virtually all of his interests are held in offshore trusts. 'My entire
affairs are dealt with offshore by different administrators,' he said
yesterday.
The share prices of all but one of these resource companies have collapsed,
hit by a variety of factors from failed ambitions to the sharp decline in
fuel and mineral prices. The exception was Petranol which was taken over by
Mr Hubert Perrodo, the French investor, and renamed Concorde Energy.
The first piece of litigation to come to light in recent months concerned
Butte Mining, which Mr Smith helped to float in 1987. The latest relates to
the Big Sinking Field, a Kentucky oil property which was eventually sold to
Globe Petroleum, a UK company in which Mr Smith was an investor. Globe has
been suspended at 4 1/2 p since March.
On March 13 1991, Sun Glow Joint Ventures of the US sold the Kentucky
property to Proctor Investments, which is registered in the British Virgin
Islands, for Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.2m) in cash and Globe shares.
Proctor's ultimate ownership is unclear, but Mr Smith actively negotiated
the purchase. He also personally guaranteed Proctor's promise to buy back a
Dollars 450,000 tranche of the Globe shares.
Proctor failed to do so and Sun Glow is seeking payment from Mr Smith. He is
contesting the legal action and last night said Proctor 'is certainly not
connected to me'. However, he added that with so many interests overseas, it
was difficult even for him to remember all the details.
Immediately after the purchase, Proctor transferred the field to Kingsway,
another British Virgin Islands company, which had been formed four months
earlier and owned just one other, smaller asset in Texas.
Globe agreed to buy Kingsway for Dollars 19.5m on March 27, just two weeks
after Proctor had paid Dollars 2.3m for the Sinking Field. The next day, a
prospectus for Globe's full stock market listing valued the Kentucky
reserves at Dollars 26.7m and the Texas asset at Dollars 4.5m.
The prospectus does not mention Mr Smith's role in the transaction, although
he was a Globe shareholder through Supernal Services, his Jersey-based
vehicle, and his two daughters were also investors, or the price which
Proctor originally paid for the assets.
Five months after the sale to Globe, the company's auditors, Moore Stevens,
expressed concerns that Mr Smith 'may, in effect, exercise such influence as
to be deemed a shadow director of the company within the definition of the
Companies Act'. Their anxieties were communicated in a letter addressed to
Mr Michael Plant, managing director.
Mr Arthur Davy, who was in charge of the Globe account at Moore Stevens,
said last week he had not been aware of Mr Smith's association with Proctor
at the time of the transaction.
Mr Smith's past has been the subject of some controversy in the City of
London. He left Petranol, the resources group where he had been chairman, in
April 1986 but kept his 25 per cent shareholding.
In May, the Takeover Panel ruled that Mr Smith had been working in concert
with a hostile predator, Inoco, which was bidding Pounds 21m in shares for
Petranol. The Panel ordered Inoco to include a cash element in its offer,
but instead it dropped the bid.
Mr Roger Jeffries, an Inoco director and known to Mr Smith from the days of
Petranol's flotation, subsequently resigned. Mr Smith said he had no idea at
the time that Mr Jeffries was on the Inoco board.
In 1987 Mr Jeffries helped to bring Far East Resources to the market,
eventually becoming a director of the company. Mr Jeffries also held a wide
range of natural resource interests, including stakes in Richmond and Butte.
Mr Smith is also currently contesting US litigation by Butte, which claims
damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 184m) from about 70 individuals and
companies. Butte is alleging fraud, and misrepresentation on the part of
various defendants, involving, among other things, the purchase of US
assets. Butte is also asking for damages to be trebled under US
anti-racketeering legislation.
When the allegations were first made in May, Mr Smith said: 'I have never
been involved in any racketeering. Any claims are frivolous.' He said his
family's shareholding in Butte remained at the same level as when the
company was floated in 1987, some 19m shares.
Butte shares were placed at 100p each in 1987, rose to 140p in 1988, but
subsequently collapsed. Last night they languished at 2p each.
Among the many allegations made by Deutsch and Frey of New York, Butte's
contingent-fee lawyers, is that in 1988 Butte paid Pounds 51m, mainly in
shares then priced at 125p each, for a company whose sole asset in Montana,
had cost Dollars 90,566 only a short while before.
No trial date has yet been fixed but Butte believes the case might reach
court at the end of 1993.
In 1987, Mr Smith's Supernal Services took a 26.5 per cent shareholding in
Geevor, the Cornwall tin miner with an 85-year history and a London quote.
Supernal paid 125p a share. Mr Smith sold a 9 per cent stake to Mr Eric
Grayson, formerly of Burnett &amp; Hallamshire, who moved in as chairman with
plans to turn Geevor into an international mining group.
After Mr Grayson's arrival Geevor bought coal mining assets in the US and
the UK, but they failed to live up to expectations. New management was
installed in the middle of 1990.
However, attempts to revive Geevor foundered early last year when its bank,
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, withdrew the mining company's
facilities. Geevor's shares were suspended at 4 3/4 p in January. Attempts
have since been made to rescue the company via a reverse takeover.
Mr Smith has also been linked to Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, where creditors
recently foreclosed on the last of the main assets it had when it came to
the market in June 1989.
Floated at 105p, Richmond's public offer was a failure, when would-be
investors questioned the valuations of Texas assets purchased for about
Dollars 2m and valued in the offer documents a month later at Dollars 30m.
Only 12.2 per cent of the shares were taken up. Immediately following the
flotation, 30 per cent of Richmond was held by companies registered in
Liberia.
Richmond has suffered a series of mishaps since flotation, including the
abandonment of a property in Louisiana, a dispute over the Texas assets, and
a failed Pounds 31m rights issue in October 1990, when 25 per cent of the
issue was left with underwriters, County NatWest, and brokers Girozentrale
Gilbert Elliott.
The shares, which were 173p in 1990, closed at 7p last night. Richmond's
main remaining assets are two joint ventures, one in Siberia and another on
Apache tribal lands in New Mexico.
Richmond's broker at flotation, Corporate Broking Services, of which Mr
Smith held 11 per cent, went into liquidation last year. It also acted as
broker to Geevor and Globe.
Other directors of CBS were Mr Jeffries, and Mr David Wilkinson, joint
managing director of Richmond. Mr Wilkinson, a former director of Butte and
Far East Resources, is also named in the Butte litigation.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Ellis &amp; Everard shares fall by 7% after chairman departs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in chemicals distributor Ellis &amp; Everard fell 13p, or 7 per cent, to
172p yesterday following the departure of Mr Michael Marshall, executive
chairman since 1990, due to 'management differences'.
Mr Marshall, who built up a private chemicals company in the early 1980s,
joined Ellis &amp; Everard in 1986. He is temporarily replaced by Mr Simon
Everard, a former chairman. 'Mike was a successful entrepreneur. But
building a private company and being a chairman of a PLC is different,' Mr
Everard said.
Advisers to the company said there had been a clash of styles.
Mr Marshall, who left the company on Friday, said he was very surprised.
'It's all happened very suddenly in the last week,' he said.
Ellis &amp; Everard announced the shake-up along with lower than expected
profits for last year, dragged down by margin pressures and a poor
performance from its swimming pool chemicals division.
But Mr Everard said the company's problems were in no way similar to those
of MTM, the specialist chemicals manufacturer which saw its shares collapse
earlier this year following the chairman's resignation and a profits
warning. '(Mr Marshall's) departure is in no way results-related,' Mr
Everard said.
Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 12.6m in the year to April 30, from Pounds
17.5m. Operating profits for the pools division fell by more than Pounds 1m,
affected by poor weather and recession.
In the US, squeezed margins, combined with rising healthcare and insurance
costs, led to a profits fall of 23.5 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. Turnover
increased 7.1 per cent to Pounds 383.4m, helped by acquisitions in Ireland
and Spain and the exchange rate.
There were extraordinary items of Pounds 9.5m, although Pounds 8.2m related
to goodwill previously written off against reserves. The remaining Pounds
1.3m of provisions covered losses incurred on the disposal of two
subsidiaries and a third which is for sale.
Earnings per share fell from 15.9p to 11.5p. An unchanged final dividend of
4.8p is recommended, to give a maintained total of 7.05p, which is 1.6 times
covered. Mr Peter Wood, group managing director, said trading had improved
since the year-end.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Chinese buy 10% stake in Cathay Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO CHINESE companies yesterday said they would buy a 10 per cent holding in
Cathay Pacific from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for HKDollars 3.39bn (Pounds
227m).
China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), a subsidiary of the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), and China Travel Service (Holdings)
Hong Kong (CTS), will each take a 5 per cent share in the airline and a seat
on the company's board.
The sale ends Hongkong Bank's direct financial involvement in Cathay. It was
an early supporter of the airline, which was founded soon after the Second
World War. By 1983, the bank owned 30 per cent of Cathay but has since
reduced its interest.
The Chinese holding, together with that owned by Beijingcontrolled CITIC
Pacific, takes China's disclosed interest in Cathay to 22.5 per cent.
In Hong Kong, the purchase was seen as a further safeguard of Cathay's
business interests. It may also help mitigate the tension between Cathay and
China's civil aviation administration.
Mr Peter Sutch, Cathay's chairman, said the company was pleased to have CNAC
and CTS as shareholders.
'Their involvement . . . reflects the increasing co-operation between
airlines in Hong Kong and aviation and tourism interests in the People's
Republic of China,' Mr Sutch said.
The bank said it made an exceptional profit of HKDollars 3.16bn on the
transaction. It sold its 143.4m shares in Cathay for HKDollars 11.80 - HK10
cents lower than Friday's closing price.
Mr William Purves, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank chairman, said the bank had
intended to retain a long-term investment in Cathay. But aviation was not
one of the bank's core activities and it responded positively to an approach
to sell its holding.
Cathay approached the bank about four months ago on behalf of the two
companies. The bank was initially reluctant to sell, but, according to one
executive close to the deal, assessed that an increase of the Chinese stake
in Cathay was in the airline's best interest.
The bank's share price rose strongly on the announcement, closing HKDollars
3 higher at HKDollars 52. Cathay's share price ended HK70 cents higher at
HKDollars 12.60.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Inner city initiatives have failed says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT policies aimed at reversing inner city decline have largely
failed, a report from the independent Policy Studies Institute concludes
today.
The report's overall finding - that 15 years of urban-aid programmes have
left the gap between deprived areas and the rest of the country as wide as
it was or worse - comes at an embarrassing time for the government.
On Thursday ministers will announce successful bidders in City Challenge,
the latest in a long series of initiatives aimed at reviving the inner
cities.
The report acknowledges that City Challenge - under which local authorities
bid competitively for government funds for specific urban projects - and the
government's proposal for an Urban Regeneration Agency have not had time to
prove themselves. It says, however, that 'given the record so far, it is
difficult to have much confidence in more of the same'.
The report uses official statistics to examine employment, education,
training, poverty, health and housing in deprived areas.
'Under most headings, the gap between conditions in deprived areas and other
kinds of place remains as wide as it was a decade and a half ago. In some
respects the gap is wider,' it concludes.
Ministers hope City Challenge, by making local authorities think
competitively about priorities and work with the private sector, will be
more successful than previous initiatives.
They are keen that the announcement of the City Challenge winners should not
mean that projects which fail to gain funding through the scheme are
inevitably shelved.
Particular importance is attached to maintaining private sector interest in
the proposals. Another possibility might be for some City Challenge
'runners-up' to be considered by the Urban Regeneration Agency to be set up
through legislation in the autumn.

FT  14 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Regalian
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone seeking fresh evidence of the desperate state of the London property
market need look no further than Regalian's Pounds 38m disposal of Red Lion
Court. It is a forced sale, to be sure, but then there is scarcely a deal
these days which does not fall into that category. What is striking even in
today's depressed markets is the meagre residual value placed on the site.
The total sale proceeds compare miserably with the Pounds 35m which the
company itself reckons it might have been able to raise on the back of a
fully amortised 23-year mortgage. In this way, the interest and capital on
the mortgage would have been met by the remaining rents from the long lease
signed by Lloyds Bank at a princely Pounds 38 per square foot in distinctly
happier times. The implication is that the German investment company
purchasing Red Lion Court is assuming a residual value when the lease
expires of just Pounds 3m. Even if the building remains over-rented for the
rest of the term, and even if the City is still awash with unlet space in a
quarter of a century, that seems like a reasonable bargain. All the more so
given that the 8 per cent which a borrower might pay for a D-Mark loan of
the same maturity compares with a yield of 11.2 per cent at yesterday's
price.
While the cash infusion should substantially reduce Regalian's borrowings,
it would take a brave investor to bet on the shares even at 7.5p. There is
certainly room to doubt whether the company deserves to be put in the penny
stocks along with the likes of Rosehaugh and Speyhawk. From the market's
point of view, though, Regalian is just another company trying to prove that
its assets exceed its liabilities.

FT  14 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Though Tomkins's full-year figures are eminently sound, they are scarcely as
glamorous as the recent performance of its share price might suggest. The 5
per cent rise in earnings per share means that for two years in a row the
performance has been static in real terms. The company talks of operational
gearing in an upturn. But the consensus forecast - normally well-informed in
Tomkins's case - is for earnings growth this year of barely 10 per cent. In
other words, the bounce is another year away again.
But then, a forward multiple of 15 or so is not hugely demanding. Indeed, as
Tomkins freely admits, it leads to a separate problem, in that the
clapped-out companies which it might otherwise want to bid for are on the
same multiple or higher. In other words, the market remains touchingly
convinced that the bounce, when it comes, will benefit badly managed
companies more than it will Tomkins. Perhaps the interim results season will
throw up one or two victims, as BTR found a year ago with Hawker Siddeley.
But if Tomkins could weather the past year with no real benefits from
acquisitions at all, it doubtless reasons that time is on its side.

FT  14 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Cathay Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two clouds have been hanging over the Cathay Pacific share price of late.
One is the global recession in air travel, from which even the Asian growth
economies have not been wholly insulated. The other has been Hongkong Bank's
evident eagerness to sell its remaining 10 per cent stake. Yesterday's news
that Chinese interests are to pay HKDollars 3.39bn (Pounds 227m) for the
holding removes at least part of the uncertainty and, as the 6 per cent jump
in Cathay's price implies, may have a more lasting effect. With more than 22
per cent of the airline now controlled by Chinese interests - including, as
from yesterday, a subsidiary of the Civil Aviation Administration of China -
Cathay's bargaining position in negotiations over flights in and out of the
People's Republic ought now to be improved.
The deal, of course, is in line with the Hongkong Bank's avowed intent to
shed peripheral assets. Conveniently enough, the stake was in the balance
sheet at virtually nothing, so the bank will be able to book a handy
exceptional profit to offset provisions for its exposure to Olympia &amp; York -
likely to be of the order of USDollars 300m-USDollars 400m - and to Mr John
Elliott. The intriguing question is where the clearing-up operation leads to
next. One widely touted option is the bank's stake in container terminal
group HIT, whose valuation may be boosted by hype over the construction of
Hong Kong's Terminal 9.

FT  14 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling cornered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For those of a lurid turn of mind, yesterday's further 2-pfennig slide in
sterling points to a shoot-out between the UK government and the foreign
exchange market. Messrs Major and Lamont continue to assert, in as many ways
as they know how, that their commitment to the ERM is absolute. The market,
half expecting a rise in German rates this week and only half believing that
the UK has the stomach to follow suit, continues to challenge that
commitment.
In fact, the odds are still against the issue coming to a head. If the
Bundesbank settles for technical manoeuvres in the money markets, sterling
may scrape by. After all, some form of German tightening is already in the
price, and sterling is still 7 pfennigs clear of its absolute floor. Then
again, in the unlikely event of German rates being formally raised by half a
point or so, the UK would surely be obliged to follow. For in that case, UK
short rates would be below Germany's. As Mr Lamont pointed out in a
different context last Friday, that is a situation which obtained for just
16 weeks throughout the 1980s.
But if the market thinks Messrs Major and Lamont would duck the necessity,
it is surely wrong. By going as far as they have in their public
pronouncements, both men have deliberately destroyed that option, if it ever
existed. A rise in UK rates would do material damage to the real economy,
particularly in respect of consumer confidence. But it would be beneficial
in one single respect. Since the UK joined the ERM it has cut rates nine
times. It has never raised them. For the markets, this creates an
asymmetrical view of sterling wholly at odds with the other member
currencies, for whom adjusting rates either way is a matter of pragmatic
routine. It might almost be said that the UK has to raise rates to become a
full member of the club and to stop being picked on. The timing would be
fairly appalling, but so are the alternatives.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Support for Clinton grows as Democratic convention opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Democratic party convention opened in New York last night with Governor
Bill Clinton secure in the knowledge that he is no longer last in the polls.
Opinion surveys released in the previous 24 hours put him at least level
with President George Bush and generally ahead of Mr Ross Perot, the
prospective independent presidential candidate, whose support is beginning
to show signs of erosion.
This is important for Mr Clinton, as he awaits the Democrats' formal
nomination on Wednesday night, because of the real fear a month ago that he
would come to the convention in a poor third place, thus exciting the sort
of internecine warfare for which his party is notorious.
The New York Times/CBS poll yesterday had Mr Bush in a narrow lead at 33 per
cent, to Mr Clinton's 30 per cent and Mr Perot's 25 per cent. More
significant than the bald numbers, this and other surveys report a
measurable increase in Mr Clinton's personal standing over the last month.
A Newsweek survey found that 38 per cent said they were now more likely to
vote for him than a month ago, with 44 per cent saying that the choice of
Senator Al Gore as running mate also made them more likely to support him.
The Times poll found Mr Gore with a much more positive image than
vice-president Dan Quayle.
The Clinton-Gore ticket, therefore, has a temporary, if not overwhelming,
degree of momentum, which has in turn helped suppress internal dissent. Only
Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California and Mr Clinton's erstwhile
primary opponent, was withholding his endorsement yesterday.
The convention opened two and a half minutes late to lots of patriotic
flourishes, with Mr Ron Brown, the party chairman, declaring that 'New York
is the start, the White House is the finish'. The formal opening night was
to include speeches from prominent Democrats, including Senator Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, who used to grace Madison Square Garden, the convention
venue, as a basketball player.
The day had begun for Mr Clinton with a morning jog, followed separately by
Mr Gore, and Mr Clinton went on to an open air 'town meeting', in which he
answered questions.
It looks as if he will have most of the week's headlines to himself. Mr Bush
was fishing in Maine yesterday and his appearance at an all-star baseball
game in California tonight is hardly a distraction.
Mr Perot, meanwhile, is struggling to combat the adverse reaction to what

FT  14 JUL 92 / Partners thank each other for the memory: The growing trend
towards global alliances in the semiconductor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Semiconductor memory chips have long been the subject of bitter trade
tensions between the US, Japan and Europe. Now these crucial computer
components are at the centre of a series of international collaborations as
some of the world's largest electronics companies seek to share the rising
costs of development and manufacturing.
Two agreements announced yesterday are the latest examples of a growing
trend to-wards international co-operation. First, International Business
Machines of the US, Toshiba of Japan and Siemens of Germany have agreed
jointly to develop 256-megabit dyn-amic random access memory (D-Ram) chips.
Memory is the cornerstone of digital electronics. The reductions in cost and
size together with increased reliability which can be achieved by
compressing more memory on to a single chip are dramatic. As more of the
added value in electronics comes from information stored in chips, larger
memories contribute hugely to the development of a wide range of electronic
products from 'personal assistants' to mobile phones.
The second agreement yesterday, between Advanced Micro Devices of the US and
Fujitsu of Japan will set up a joint venture to make 'flash' memory devices,
which are expected eventually to replace the disk drive in personal
computers.
In spite of the fiercely independent and nationalistic nature of the
semiconductor industry, manufacturers are being drawn into collaborative
arrangements by the need to share both the escalating costs and the risks of
remaining on the leading edge of semiconductor technology. 'The costs now
exceed what any single company can bear,' said Mr Tsuyoshi Kawanishi, senior
executive vice-president of Toshiba, a leading Japanese chip maker.
This is particularly evident in the Dollars 7bn global D-Ram market, where
the cost of development and manufacturing is soaring while prices are in a
steep decline. With research and development of the 256MB D-Rams expected to
exceed Dollars 1bn, the world's chip makers are looking for partners.
The trend towards cross-border alliances was signalled last year when NEC,
Japan's largest semiconductor maker, and AT&amp;T, the American
telecommunications group, agreed to work together on advanced technology
needed to develop 64MB D-Ram chips. Today, 16MB chips are the most advanced
high-capacity devices commercially available, but 64MB chips should be ready
in about two years.
Hitachi of Japan and Texas Instruments of the US are also working together
on future generations of D-Rams while IBM already has a D-Ram
technology-sharing agreement with Siemens as well as a joint manufacturing
alliance in France with Siemens. Toshiba similarly has links with Siemens,
and in Japan with IBM.
While yesterday's agreement between IBM, Siemens and Toshiba currently
focuses on research and development, joint manufacturing would be a 'logical
extension' of the alliance at some point in the future, Mr Jack Kuehler,
president of IBM, acknowledges.
Notably absent from the D-Ram venture are any of the rising stars of the
Korean semiconductor industry which has become a big supplier of D-Rams over
the past four years. However, the partnership may be open to additional
participants. They could come from among competitors such as the Japanese
companies NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu, and Samsung of Korea.
Although sharing the huge costs of developing 256MB D-Ram technology is one
advantage of the agreement, Mr Kuehler stressed that reducing risk was also
a primary motivation. 'You have to make technology decisions before you are
ready,' he said. The alliance brings a larger pool of expertise to bear on
research work.
The number of such alliances reflects the importance of D-Rams as a
'technology driver' and the size of the market. More important than the
design of the D-Ram chip is the development of technology used to
manufacture it.
To achieve a density of 256m memory cells on a single chip will require
shrinking the size of the circuit elements to just one quarter of a micron,
about half the size of today's most advanced chips. This will require
significant advances in materials and production eq-uipment, tools and
processes. Once they are achieved, the technology will be applicable to all
types of semiconductor devices.
What are the commercial prospects for megachips? With prices for 4MB parts
at rock bottom and huge overcapacity because of the recession, no
semiconductor manufacturer is making money out of D-Rams at present. The
semiconductor industry, however, is notorious for its 'boom to bust'
commercial cycle. Manufacturers pour in research and development funds to
develop a product which can be sold at a premium price. As the technology
matures, prices fall. Manufacturers, therefore, have to cream off the
profits in the early stages of a chip's life. The hope is that competition
will reduce the number of players in the market, giving survivors a better
chance of profitability.
Entry into the emerging market for flash memories, devices that are
eventually expected to replace disk drives as the data storage medium of
choice in portable personal computers and facsimile machines, is also costly
and involves considerable risk. 'In the future it will become increasingly
difficult to succeed if a company is going to play by itself,' said Mr
Hikotaro Masunaga, managing director at Fujitsu, yesterday.
In many ways, the deal between Fujitsu and Advanced Micro Devices carries
co-operation in the semiconductor industry furthest, and most clearly
illustrates the reasons why companies are seeking partnerships. In very
Japanese style, Fujitsu and AMD will purchase a small equity stake in each
other. Mr W J Sanders, chairman of AMD, said he insisted on this because
this would give Fujitsu, 20 times bigger than AMD, an interest in seeing AMD
succeed.
At the same time, the two companies will jointly spend Dollars 700m on a
50-50 joint venture to manufacture flash memory devices. AMD has the
technology for flash memory devices, but lacks the resources to build on its
own a facility of the scale required. Fujitsu, on the other hand, lacks the
technology for flash memory. But it does have the expertise in semiconductor
manufacturing, the capital to invest, and access to the Japanese market.
By pooling resources, the two companies are able to contemplate a
large-scale facility that will produce 20,000 eight-inch semiconductor
wafers a month, thereby allowing for considerable economies of scale and
setting a standard which the competition will have difficulty matching.
'You are going to see more and more alliances,' Mr Kuehler predicted.
'Alliances are the way of the future.' Whether these will be international
depends upon where the centres of particular technological expertise lie, he
suggested. 'The issues are skills, people and money, and ways to bring them
together, whether that involves international agreements or not.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Reviving the inner cities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE DECAY at the heart of Britain's cities is one of the biggest challenges
faced by its government,' according to Urban Trends, the new survey of
inner-city life from the Policy Studies Institute. Since the first white
paper on urban regeneration was published in 1977, billions of pounds have
been spent on the UK's inner cities through a battery of government
initiatives. Yet the PSI survey concludes that these measures have had
little impact on narrowing the gap between the most deprived boroughs and
the rest.
Even more gloomily, this first independent assessment of 15 years of urban
regeneration policy finds that the gap has widened in some respects. In most
of the areas studied, the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools has
worsened over the period - against the national trend. People from deprived
areas have done worse out of training than those from other areas.
Homelessness in many of these areas has increased by more than average.
These are depressing findings at a time when minor riots have become an
almost routine feature of life in many British cities.
The report does, however, find some evidence of success in the efforts of
urban development corporations, City Action Teams and Task Forces in
improving the employment position of those who live in their areas.
Considerable effort has gone into reclaiming derelict land and docklands.
Transport and other economic infrastructure has been improved to tempt
business back. But the effects have been patchy: while a third of the
deprived areas surveyed saw their share of UK unemployment fall, the share
increased in just over a third.
City Challenge
That patchiness could be exacerbated by City Challenge, the new bidding
process used to allocate much of the government's funds for urban
regeneration. On Thursday, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary,
will announce the 20 urban priority areas which have won a share of Pounds
750m over the next five years in the second round of bidding. Eleven local
authorities shared out more than Pounds 400m in last year's first round, so
just over half of the 57 urban priority areas should have been successful in
winning City Challenge money by the end of this week. The rest will have to
wait until round three for their chance to fund what are likely to be
equally deserving projects.
Ministers are said to be uneasy about the fate of local authorities which
lose out in competitive bidding. The failure of Birmingham's bid in the
first round of City Challenge threatened the future of its imaginative
partnership with the private sector to regenerate the Heartlands area, for
example. A new urban development corporation was hastily created which
provided Pounds 50m of funding to keep the show on the road. More such ad
hoc solutions may have to be conjured out of Mr Howard's hat if some inner
city areas are not to be allowed to spiral on down after Thursday's winners
are announced.
Funds unavailable
The PSI, inevitably, proposes more money, which is highly unlikely to be
available given the pressing need to contain the growth in the public sector
borrowing requirement. It would be foolish to expect a crock of gold.
More promising is the PSI's second recommendation: better management of
whatever budget there is for inner-city regeneration. Money is already
available through a plethora of different schemes, via various agencies and
from several government departments. A clearer focus, preferably involving
just one stop for local government, would allow targets to be better defined
and progress to be regularly monitored. It would also reduce the scope for
local authorities to indulge in 'grantsmanship', in which skilful
exploitation of government grants yields bigger dividends than efficient
delivery of services.
There is no reason in theory why City Challenge cannot evolve to provide a
one-stop funding agency, with clear objectives and tight monitoring, but
that will involve the government throwing away the powerful sanction of
withholding funds entirely. Without a more mature and trusting relationship
between central and local government, Britain is unlikely to do more to
regenerate its inner cities in the next 15 years than it has done in the
past 15.

FT  14 JUL 92 / No place for bank to call home: The bruising battle over the
site for the European central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tussle over the site of the European central bank (ECB) centres on the
clash of competing national symbols. The bank, which is designed to one day
run a single European currency, provides a glittering prize for financial
centres jostling to bring money, jobs and prestige to their cities.
The ECB is a linchpin of the Maastricht treaty on political and economic
union. The weighty national issues at stake ensure that politics rather than
economics will determine where the bank eventually finds a home. But, until
the wrangling over its venue is settled, highly contentious questions on the
central bank's organisation and functioning are being left in abeyance. For
some central bankers and economists worrying about how - and, indeed,
whether - the ECB will eventually work, the debate over the bank is
concentrating too much on public relations, and not enough on
practicalities.
For the moment, however, the matter is firmly in the hands of the lobbyists.
Sir Brian Jenkins, Lord Mayor of London, who heads Britain's bid to bring
the bank to the City, leaps from his chair into a corner of his office. He
fishes out a plastic-framed 20m Mark banknote printed during Germany's 1923
hyper-inflation, a gift from the Dresdner Bank. This is evidence, says Sir
Brian, that the Germans - who want to bring the bank to Frankfurt or Bonn on
the basis of their postwar record of monetary stability - have not always
been anti-inflation champions.
Sir Brian, campaigning on the basis of London's size and prowess as a
financial centre, is doing his best to counter a brochure from Frankfurt,
recently presented to him by Mr Andreas von Schoeler, the city's mayor.
Frankfurt's promotional leaflet, emphasising that Europe's mooted central
bank will best prosper in a 'culture' of price stability, points out that
the UK has registered a 524 per cent inflation rate during the past 20
years. Germany, by contrast, was top of the EC league table with a mere 113
per cent.
Ms Gabrielle Eick, the Frankfurt official in charge of the city's campaign,
is keeping up the momentum - even though a majority of EC leaders came out
for Bonn by a 10 to two majority at their summit in Lisbon. 'Bonn,' she says
scornfully, 'is not a financial centre.' Amsterdam, meanwhile, is also
pressing ahead with its own bid. The city knows that its best chance will
come from disagreement between Germany, Britain and France. 'Our case is
based on the fact that, as a financial centre, we're not a threat to
Frankfurt, London or Paris,' says Mr Jan Steinhauser, who is running the
city's campaign.
An ECB decision is likely at the EC's heads of government summit in
Edinburgh in December, which must choose a site for the bank's forerunner,
the European Monetary Institute, planned to start in January 1994. Even
cities with little chance of winning are not giving up. Edinburgh is
sticking to its apparently hopeless quest for at least part of the bank's
functions. In an unusual initiative, the Scottish capital is considering
going into partnership with other marginal contenders, Barcelona and Lyon,
to bid for the whole operation.
The ECB would carry out decisions made by a governing council of
representatives from national central banks. It would function as a
policy-making machine, a collector of banking statistics and as a large
operator on financial markets. ised, they would probably be executed in a
decentralised way. Existing national central banks would be maintained as
operating arms, and some of the bank's central functions (such as banking
supervision, computer systems and accounting) could also be split up.
For the central bank to succeed in its intention of controlling inflation,
location of its head office in a prime banking centre would not be
essential. 'With good telecommunications,' says a top official from the Bank
for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank in Basle, 'it could
operate from the top of a mountain.'
Backers of London and Frankfurt say, however, that the bank's policy-making
touch would be surer if it were based in a city with acknowledged financial
expertise. The bank could indeed represent a colossal prize. If all the EC's
monetary reserves came under its sway, it would be responsible for foreign
exchange holdings of Dollars 300bn.
The ECB could start operations by 1999, according to the Maastricht
timetable. Plans for monetary union could be heavily disrupted by further
problems in ratifying the treaty, as well as by member states' economic
difficulties. But, for the moment, most EC leaders assume that the ECB will
be a reality by the end of the century.
In the political horse-trading, which also involves the sites of about a
dozen other EC institutions, Germany has the greatest weight - on account of
its economic and political stature. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is arguing
strongly for the bank to take root in Germany to help overcome popular
German misgivings over giving up the D-Mark. In an accompanying move to win
favour from France, Germany could agree to the new European currency being
called the 'Eurofranc', according to one idea circulating in the Bonn
chancellery. Earlier this year, apparently prompted by Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
the Spanish prime minister, Mr Kohl conceived the idea of proposing Bonn as
an alternative to Frankfurt, on the grounds that the small city on the Rhine
would be more acceptable to other countries' financial centres.
Although it is officially backing Barcelona, Spain is one of Mr Kohl's
natural allies in the ECB skirmish. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, deputy governor of
the Bank of Spain, said in May that he was 'convinced' that Germany would
succeed in attracting the central bank.
Britain's own ECB campaign has been intensified since Mr John Major awarded
London his personal backing at a Downing Street meeting on May 13. Since
then, the Corporation of London, the City's governing body, has been given
Treasury help and the support of embassies abroad. However, Mr Jacques
Delors, the European Commission president, warned earlier this month that
Britain's efforts would almost certainly be in vain. This reflects both the
UK's lack of full political commitment to Emu and also, Mr Delors says, the
need to provide the Germans with 'assurance' on the bank site as
compensation for the D-Mark's demise.
For London's Sir Brian Jenkins, however, the game is far from over. Like an
obstinate lawyer trying to overturn a solid majority on a recalcitrant jury,
London's Lord Mayor is continuing a tour of European capitals to try to
persuade governments that putting the bank in London is 'best for Europe'.
The Corporation of London still has Pounds 1.2m left of a Pounds 1.5m 'war
chest' set up to finance its ECB campaign, while Frankfurt has earmarked DM
700,000. Mr Hans Daniels, the mayor of Bonn, by contrast, has not spent a
pfennig on any form of ECB campaign. He says he is 'happy' with the idea
that the bank may come to the Rhine - but plainly believes it is much more
important that Bonn keeps as many ministries as possible when the German
government moves formally to Berlin later in the 1990s. In line with Bonn's
low-key posture, the city says the ECB could be built on the site of a
recently-demolished Rhineside cement works.
The Bank of England, Bundesbank and Nederlandsche Bank have all been helping
their respective financial centres in their political campaigning. Top
Bundesbank figures have probably been less active publicly than their
counterparts at the Bank of England. But the German central bank firmly
backs the view that an ECB outside Germany would probably be opposed by the
German public.
Public attention throughout Europe has concentrated on the sparring over the
bank site. Other, highly intractable, problems are, however, bubbling
beneath the surface. One focuses on the issue of the ECB's independence. The
Bundesbank is dissatisfied with the lack of progress in most countries on
making national central banks independent - one of the conditions of the
Maastricht treaty.
Additionally, European central banks disagree on how the ECB would operate a
common European monetary policy. This is one of a series of ECB-related
issues on which European central banks are trying to co-ordinate ideas -
with little success so far. Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the
BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, who has made a study of ECB plans, criticises the
lack of clarity on how the ECB would run monetary policy. Excessive debate
on the site is an extreme case of 'putting the cart before the horse', he
says.
EC central bankers have set up three committees and five lower-level working
parties to try to make joint suggestions in fields ranging from banking
supervision, monetary policy and foreign exchange to statistics, payments
systems and banknote printing. In monetary policy, the Bundesbank argues
that minimum reserves on bank deposits - levied in West Germany since 1948 -
should be introduced throughout the Community to provide harmonised monetary
control.
The Bundesbank firmly opposes French and British suggestions for holding on
to large parts of national monetary practices. The Banque de France and Bank
of England argue that this is in line with subsidiarity  - delegating
decision-making to as local a level as possible. This argument is stoutly
rejected by a top Bundesbank official, who says that the other countries do
not want a fully-fledged European central bank, but simply a form of loose
'currency board'.
Some EC officials see the US Federal Reserve system as a 'model' for the
workings of the ECB. Based on the New York Fed's role as the market arm of
the Washington-centred Fed network, Britain backs the view that London could
provide the operating arm for a European central bank with its head office,
say, in Bonn. As analysts such as Mr Remsperger point out, however, the
analogy is faulty. Since European countries linked by Emu will all be
operating separate fiscal policies, central banking money market operations
 -closely linked to governments' budgetary policies - will have to remain
highly decentralised.
As the ECB lobbying intensifies in the coming months, such questions may
come closer to the headlines. It would not be before time. Mr Anibal Cavaco
Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, complained last week that wrangling
over choosing the ECB site was damaging 'the credibility of the whole
Community'. However, the damage would be still greater if the EC agreed on a
place to build the bank - but found that there was no consensus on how it
should carry out its business.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Poland's new government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WELL-GOVERNED and prosperous Poland is essential to stability in the
centre of Europe. The formation at the weekend of a new Polish government
headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka is, therefore, to be warmly welcomed. Warsaw
should now be able to resume negotiations with the International Monetary
Fund, deal with foreign investors and resume the task of creating modern,
democratic institutions.
Much depends on the degree to which the new prime minister can forge a
coherent administration out of seven parties. Much depends as well on the
kind of support offered by the president.
Mr Lech Walesa deserves much of the blame for the political turmoil of the
past two years. He deliberately undermined the cohesion of the first
non-communist government, led by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Once elected as
president, by a far from enthusiastic electorate, he proceeded to quarrel
with most of his erstwhile political friends and intrigued endlessly to
enhance his power.
The struggle became acute after last October's general elections, which were
held on the basis of a flawed electoral law. The result was a fragmented
parliament and resurrection of the communists as the second largest party.
Mr Walesa opposed the new government led by Mr Jan Olszewski, forging what
his Polish critics complain is a de facto alliance with former members of
the communist nomenklatura in the armed forces and secret police.
Two years of in-fighting between the president and parliament have
undermined popular support for parliamentary democracy. But they have also
further encouraged able Poles to eschew politics and public service and
devote themselves to making money instead.
Entrepreneurial energy
The latter is not a wholly adverse development. Poland's strength is its
entrepreneurial energy. Economic reforms during the first few months of
democracy, particularly the freeing of foreign trade, the abolition of many
subsidies and zloty convertibility, were sufficient to spark off rapid de
facto privatisation of the economy. Like Italy, post-communist Poland has
shown that its people are able to keep the economy going, even without an
effective government.
Zloty devaluation has stimulated export growth, which is also helping to
pull the economy out of a steep recession. Meanwhile, cuts in government
spending have kept inflation within limits acceptable to the International
Monetary Fund. With a new government, negotiations with the IMF on an aid
and credit package worth about Dollars 2.5bn can resume.
Steady government
Things could, in short, have been worse. But Poland needs a period of steady
government to restore the confidence of foreign investors, restart the
stalled mass privatisation programme, modernise the tax and banking systems,
and create an effective and affordable social security network. Poland also
needs a government able to deal with the sensitive question of the
involvement of many public figures in the previous communist regime. Until
this is done, the suspicion will remain that some are using their old links
either to blackmail those now in power, enrich themselves, or both.
A witch hunt must be avoided. Many who worked for the former regime were
neither scoundrels nor incompetent. Active and passive opposition to the old
regime was more widespread in Poland than elsewhere. But those who served
the old regime, especially in areas like internal security and the military
should be identified. Those who are hostile to democracy cannot expect to
occupy the most sensitive positions.
Poland's first post-communist governments ruled on the basis of a compromise
that outlasted the collapse of communism. This delayed the vetting process
that was needed. But coping with the past must not divert attention from the
main priority: building a stable, prosperous and democratic future. With
that overriding goal in mind, President Walesa and parliament should work
together to support the new government. That government is after all formed
of parties that have their origin in the Solidarity movement, which under Mr
Walesa's leadership restored democracy to Poland and thus paved the way in
eastern Europe.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Twelfth Night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT the English Shakespeare Company mostly does is to tour, so Claire
Lyth's trappings for its Twelfth Night are coolly plain and adaptable. A
floor of green and gold tiles, some pretty, spidery screens, tall panels of
curtains; moody lighting by Michael Bogdanov does the rest.
Michael Pennington's production pretends not to be a 'production' at all,
just the play itself played straight, with everything coming from the words
 -and the songs too, which have a sharp dramatic point. Pennington tips his
hand in a programme-note: he has definite, even tendentious readings of
Shakespeare's characters and their situations. The players stick loyally to
his recipes, and the net effect is a tonic: fresh, unblinking, direct.
At some points it narrows the range of feeling in the comedy; but Twelfth
Night has inexhaustible possibilities, and the specialised view here is
quite happy enough to be going on with.
Jenny Quayle's Viola (who speaks the verse better than anybody) is concerned
with the 'lost' Sebastian, her twin and spirit-double. Whenever she
remembers him, she grips one's heart - and after their rapt reunion, they go
off embracing each other rather than their new partners.
Her attraction to Michael Mueller's Orsino is an unexplained accident, and
her romantic debacle with the gender-blind Olivia a minor inconvenience.
Allie Byrne's Olivia is a crisp estate-manageress. For most of the play she
deals with Viola-'Cesario'-Sebastian as with a raw junior. Like her
gentlewoman Maria (Tracey Mitchell), she grows shrill in vehement passages,
and her grip on the verse slackens.
Malvolio (Timothy Davies) owes a great debt to John Cleese, but repays it
with interest. Derek Smith's Uncle Toby is tough and truculent, more sour
than roguish; Colin Farrell's jesting Feste offers authentic music-hall,
practised routine with dead eyes.
As for Sir Andrew Aguecheek, James Hayes' comic-cuts costume and wig make
him a simple ass. The role of Clown has been redistributed, to the advantage
of Sean Gilder's wry, friendly Fabian. Alan Cody brings a welcome, salty
breath of passion to Antonio.
For Sebastian himself, Vivian Munn's funny, boyish face and shy gaucherie
twin him nicely with Viola, but scotch the virile contrast he should make.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Music at the Almeida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW that the greatly loved Almeida Festival has become an Almeida (new)
Opera season, non-operatic music is a receding factor: not abandoned, but
distinctly marginalised. Three concerts on Sunday, however, made their
marks, some of them black.
First there was the Argentinian pianist Alma Petchersky, billed to play the
complete Goyescas of Granados - with its bright pendant 'El Pelele', which
the composer wanted always to be included even if other movements were
dropped.
As we learned upon arriving at the Almeida, Miss Petchersky had decided to
omit it, and the big opening 'Requiebros' and the Fandango; in fact she
offered a bit more than half of the music, just four movements for patrons
who had paid Pounds 6 or Pounds 8 to hear the whole cycle. I thought that
rather disgraceful, but I judged prematurely.
In the event, it was so dispiriting to hear her pick her way through the
chosen movements - slowly and carefully, eyes glued to the score - that it
would have been quite dreadful if she had played them all. For that relief,
much thanks. By sight-reading standards she was neither unmusical nor
especially inaccurate; but these appealing, diffuse, self-quoting pieces
need a flair, a variety of touch and an instinctive long breath which are
unavailable to a pianist who is still learning the notes.
That recital, billed absurdly as 'Goyescas I', was followed by a 'Goyescas
II' from a more efficient pianist, a young Belgian who likes to be known as
'Luk''.
His grab-bag programme consisted of old Krenek's Sonata no. 7 (defiantly
academic-'serial', but quite lucid and mellow), pieces by the Almeida
opera-composers Nils Vigeland and Nigel Osborne (essentially neo-romantic),
and curious stuff by three composers of whom the programme-book told us
nothing except that one Spaniard was the pupil of the other.
Emiliano del Cerro's Imagen Contrapuesta was skeletal, rebarbative and
silly, and his teacher Luis de Pablo's Retratos y Transcripciones echoed
well-tried experiments from 20 years back.
The excuse for the recital-title came from a new Goyescas by the Flemish
Boudewijn Buckinx: 13 vignettes after Goya, almost innocent of compositional
technique but fluently pianistic, and often poignant in their
backward-looking, tonally disjointed way.
Later, the Almeida Cello Ensemble offered more grown-up stuff. If the
rock-oriented Ostinato by Ferrero and Takayuki Rai's slick Recursive
Figuration sounded like professional exercises, Henze's lovely 1962 cantata
Being Beauteous and Rupert Bawden's new Morike Lieder made bigger waves.
Both of those enlisted Skaila Kanga's high-definition harp and Sarah
Leonard's beautifully assured soprano, to irresistible effect: the first
work conducted by David Parry, the other by its composer.
Bawden's idiom here manages somehow to combine the ripe musical language of
Berg's Lyric Suite with the unmistakable tone of pre-war English pastoral.
It bypasses Britten (who nearly went to Vienna for lessons with Berg, and
was thwarted at the last moment), but its harmonic diction remembers the
Vaughan Williams of Wenlock Edge and the 'Tallis' Fantasia, and therefore
Brahms.
I predict a late, self-critical maturity for Bawden which should generate
serious rewards.

<TEXT>
painter, novelist, critc, polemicist, agitator - died in 1957 at the age of
74, his sight all but gone and, in his reputation, an acknowledged but
marginal figure. Yet through the second decade of the twentieth century and
up to the Second World War he had been one of the great men of the Modern
Movement, the embodiment of the avant garde.
Born in the US of an American father who abandoned his family, he was
brought to England as an infant by his British mother, and in England he
remained, apart from the period of the Second World War, which he and his
wife passed in Canada and New York.
Yet his provenance established in his character, not exactly a rootlessness,
but a certain distance and sceptical disaffection that throughout his active
life would put him at odds with British institutions and attitudes, social,
political and aesthetic.
He was never one not to make his presence felt, and perhaps his habitual
vehemence and asperity became a shade monotonous and predictable, and he was
not taken too seriously in consequence - only old Lewis sounding off again.
But in the vigour and confidence of his youth, in the years before 1914, he
was a true leader and inspiration to his generation.
He had been at the Slade around 1900, a student of Tonks, friend and
contemporary of Augustus John. He travelled wide and often, becoming the
familiar of the international avant garde, intimate of Pound and Eliot.
William Rothenstein remembered him in those early days as 'even then
(showing) signs of a formidable personality. He hesitated between writing
and painting. . . He liked to shroud himself in mystery. After hiding for
weeks, he would suddenly reappear, having been, he would declare, in Sweden,
or in some remote country. . . He certainly went later to join (Augustus)
John in Paris. . . (theirs was) an intimacy frequently disturbed by violent
quarrels and again renewed.'
His greatest public moment came in the year or so immediately before the
First World War, when his own familiarity with Cubism in France and Futurism
in Italy bore fruit in Vorticism, that was Britain's own, short-lived
equivalent.
A younger Sladeite generation was committed to the movement, that included
Bomberg, Epstein, Gaudier-Brzeska, Wadsworth, Roberts and Nevinson, but
Lewis was its prime mover, chief apologist and polemicist. The review Blast
was its banner and battle-cry, surviving for only two issues that challenge
us still.
Two samples: 'BLAST years 1837 to 1900. . . BLAST their weeping whiskers. .
. SENTIMENTAL HYGIENICS. . . ROSSEAUISMS. . . PURGATORY OF PUTNEY'. And
'BLESS ALL PORTS. . . RESTLESS MACHINES of scooped out basins, heavy insect
dredgers, monotonous cranes. . . BLESS ENGLAND, industrial island machine. .
.' This tribute was to the machine in a brave new mechanical age,
unsentimental and implacable, and one that all too soon was to achieve its
awful apotheosis.
But Lewis's disillusionment was to wait upon the long aftermath of the War.
Like so many of his artist contemporaries, and many more besides, he went to
War young and happy, excited and stimulated, and found in the extremities
and deprivations of the Western Front a kind of fulfilment. And his
artist-self went with him. He was a gunner, with the Royal Garrison
Artillery, and it is this close, oddly monastic community, the quiet and
steady hierophants of destruction at their altars that supplies the
essential subject of this exhibition at the Imperial War Museum.
The mood is reserved, detached, objective, the treatment formal in its
interest and mannered in its character.
'Whatever happens', Lewis had written in 1915, in his second Blast, 'there
is a new section. . . that is, for want of a better word, the Abstract.'
But by now, so strong was the immediate, phenomenal world, that theory and
principle had fallen, and abstraction long given way to the abstracted. And
indeed it is the conscious mannerism, the formal preoccupation with peculiar
rendering of the image, that gives the work its distance and cool reserve.
It is no unusual paradox that by being so, far from being callously
indifferent, the work seems to gain an added force and poignant humanity. An
officer lounges with studied languor as the men receive their rum. A single
gunner, a powerful silhouette against cadmium yellow, tugs at the lanyard to
fire the gun. Men heave on the ropes, dig their pits, lay their guns, hump
their shells, fire salvoes, go out on patrol, attack, dive for cover.
Just so, the mundane life of the trenches, goes on. And no anti-war tract or
polemical image, even Lewis's own symbolical compositions of later years,
could ever say so much and ring so true.
The Imperial War Museum is the repository of one of the finest public
collections we have of modern British art, notwithstanding its necessarily
specialised nature. Sadly, there is no longer any permanently changing
display of its riches, which makes these rarer treats all the more worth
savouring.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Murder by Misadventure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE IS an old-fashioned comedy thriller of a kind now seldom seen on the
West End stage. Written by Edward Taylor, veteran of radio and television
scripts including The Men from the Ministry, Murder by Misadventure has a
desperately slow start, but begins to come to life towards the end of the
first act and afterwards scarcely looks back. The production contains an
outstanding performance by Greg Hicks as Inspector Egan.
The Inspector does not appear until the second (and final) act is under way.
By then a murder has been planned, is thought to have been executed, but
turns out not to have taken place in the expected way. Hicks comes in to
sort it out, which is where the comedy begins. In the end it appears that
there may have been no murder, or at least of anyone in the cast, and Hicks
emerges not as a policeman, but only another actor/script-writer looking for
new twists in old plots. Meanwhile, he has done a marvellous impersonation
of a cynical modern, plain clothes Inspector.
The opening is banal. The script-writing team of Howard Kent and Paul Riggs
is breaking up because Kent, a former accountant, is fed up with the
drinking habits of his partner, and thinks he can do better on his own.
Riggs, however, provides most of the ideas and is aware of flaws in Kent's
accountancy past. Riggs (played by William Gaunt) threatens blackmail; Kent
(Gerald Harper) responds by arranging the perfect murder based on Riggs's
latest scenario. The method used is putting drugs in whisky and leaving him
to die of hypothermia on the Kents' balcony overlooking the English Channel.
When Kent and his wife return from a trip to the US, they expect to find the
body, but discover only bloodstains and a lady's jacket. That is really when
the piece takes off: enter Inspector Egan and the investigation begins.
Hicks plays the part as if he would never resort to bullying. It is only all
that police violence shown on television, he observes, that gives the police
thoughts of wish fulfilment.
Young, dapper, wearing a leather jacket and looking supremely
self-confident, he proceeds by asking questions and revealing the odd bit of
information. Note his dominant position when he sits on the centre of the
settee and knows he commands the stage. As for jokes, he produces: 'You
wouldn't be thinking of going to Spain, would you? There's been an
extradition treaty - the only good thing to come out of the EEC,' as he
calls the European Community. This is a splendid piece of acting, full of
menace.
There is a good set of the Kent's hyper-modern apartment designed by Tim
Shortall, as well as some intriguing but underdeveloped business of objects
mysteriously moving position. The role of Emma Kent, played by Angela Down,
is also curiously subdued. It is not the best thriller one has ever seen,
but I enjoyed the second half, and wish it well. Murder is directed by the
very experienced Val May: he deserves a slightly better script.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WERNER BAUER is light years away from most people's idea of an academic
scientist. A fast-talking 40-year-old who starts each day with a swim in
Lake Geneva, he bristles with get-up-and-go energy.
He is also a firm believer in decisive management and accountability. 'From
the beginning, I wanted strong managers in the lab who could influence
decisions and make things happen,' he says. 'I don't believe in
co-ordination. I believe in power. I'm a Bavarian.'
Yet, he has also exhibited a keen sensitivity and concern for the human
touch. Before taking up his job, he took extensive soundings among the lab's
researchers, interviewing 200 in two months.
To find out whether they were 'analysts', 'lateral thinkers' or
'implementers', he asked them questions such as whether they owned a
motorbike and how they serviced it. 'You can tell a lot about people's
skills from their answers,' he says.
Then he moved into action. About 30 older staff were persuaded to take early
retirement, and the lab's sprawling operations were grouped into seven
departments.
In choosing department heads, Bauer looked as much for administrative and
personnel management skills as for scientific ability. Each is expected to
act as a 'pusher', setting goals for members of his team and monitoring
their performance closely.
A hierarchy of priorities has been set for research, by dividing it into
four categories: basic science and technology; development of techno-
logical tools; projects sponsored by the SBUs; and short-term tasks closely
related to the market.
Bauer and Suter lay much stress on good communications and human
relationships. To build team spirit, Bauer has installed relaxation areas in
the labs, where researchers can meet and talk, and organises cultural events
such as musical evenings and art displays.
Though some old-timers have found it hard to adjust, Bauer insists most of
his staff have responded positively. 'Almost 100 per cent of them are now
really working for Nestle,' he says.
Bauer's next task is to integrate research with Nestle's network of
international development centres. The ultimate goal is to speed innovation
by synchronising R&amp;D more closely.
But changing such a complex set of relationships in a company Nestle's size
will be a gradual process, he says: 'We have to build up trust. That will
take some years.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Technology: Research comes back to the nest - Why Nestle is
taking a closer interest in the commercial side of R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS lunchtime at Nestle's gleaming laboratory high on a hillside above
Lausanne. Gathered round a canteen table, the company's top researchers are
rejoicing at their liberation from the past with the sort of bright-eyed
wonderment with which east Europeans greeted the collapse of the Berlin
Wall.
In the past two years a minor revolution has swept through the laboratory,
shaking its 600 researchers out of a cosy ivory tower existence and
propelling them much closer to the cutting edge of the Swiss food
manufacturer's global competitive strategies.
Nestle invests SFrs120m (Pounds 46m) a year in research - and SFrs500m in
development - making it the food industry's biggest spender on science and
technology. But until recently much of the lab's work was only tenuously
connected with the company's business.
'In the past, people here didn't get their hands dirty dealing with food,'
says Magnus Dagerskog, head of the lab's food technology department.
'Everybody was busy publishing papers. They were trying to compete with
universities.'
Indeed, Nestle researchers enjoyed an intellectual freedom which many
academics would envy. Says Herb Hottinger, head of bio-science research:
'When scientists joined the lab, they were told: 'Just work in this or that
area. If you work hard enough, we're sure you'll find something'.'
But the price the lab paid was to become a sterile backwater, cut off from
Nestle's global network of development centres and largely ignored by its
operating divisions. As a consequence, much research never found commercial
applications.
By 1990 Helmut Maucher, Nestle's chairman, had had enough. Deciding a
wholesale shake-up was needed, he recruited Werner Bauer, a German professor
of bio-engineering, to bring the lab firmly back into the corporate fold.
This has been achieved partly by establishing formal links with the
strategic business units (SBUs) into which Nestle's commercial activities
have recently been grouped as part of a wider corporate reorganisation. Each
SBU now includes a research co-ordinator, responsible for two-way
communications with the labs, which are encouraged to view the SBUs as
clients.
Bauer, who previously worked at one of Germany's Fraunhofer institutes of
applied technology, has reorganised the labs to focus their priorities more
clearly and enable them to respond faster.
The company's senior researchers, far from being resentful, seem exhilarated
by the fresh challenges they face. As Brian Suter, British-born chief of
Nestle's research and development puts it, they are full of 'boisterous,
exuberant, young ideas'.
He concedes, however, that the new system still needs time to bed down. In
particular, bridges are still being built with the rest of the company. 'We
have to get ourselves better known to the SBUs,' says Jurg Loliger, head of
the food science department. 'They know we have the technology, but they
don't yet realise our potential.'
None the less, the new approach is already yielding benefits. For example,
the lab took just two months to find a way to cut the salt in Lean Cuisine
dishes by 30 per cent without using substitutes or changing the taste.
Researchers say five years would have been needed in the old system, because
they would have gone right back to basic science. Instead, they devised a
simple analytical model to identify ingredients in which a lower salt
content would be least noticed by consumers.
Bauer has also expanded some areas of fundamental research, notably in
molecular biology, where increased attention is being paid to enzymology.
Overall, he aims for a 50-50 split between basic and applied research.
The trick is knowing where to draw the line: 'In research, there is always a
will to perfect. But a company can't afford that,' he says. 'Stopping at the
point where learning curves become incremental is what I see as my major
job.'
All the more so because the huge marketing costs involved in launching
brands are prompting Nestle to gear research increasingly to strengthening
established products, rather than inventing new ones.
The company points to Nescafe, its most profitable product, as a classic
example of the approach. The brand has dominated the soluble coffee market
for half a century, thanks to continuous up-dating of process technology and
the regular introduction of new variants, the latest of which is instant
cappuccino.
Yet the Nescafe formula also sprang from innovations in Nestle's
laboratories which broke completely new ground. By focusing research more
tightly in support of existing products, will the company not risk missing
out on similar world-beating breakthroughs in the future?
Suter replies that the world has changed radically since the 1930s, when
Nescafe was invented. Nowadays, innovations are much more expensive to
develop and are much more quickly matched by competitors. Still, he says: 'I
wouldn't want to exclude that one day we may come up with another
blockbuster like Nescafe - it may just be possible.'
