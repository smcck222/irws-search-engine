FT  14 JUL 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): The limitations of
computer prose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE DORNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Word-processing manufacturers are getting over-ambitious. Not content with
offering inventive features to make the mechanics of writing easier, they
are now providing language lessons on line.
Already half a dozen top word-processors have grammar 'checkers' built into
them, and this year a whole sweep of packages for polishing prose has
emerged. The latest programs aim to help people in business to produce good,
structured, accurate writing.
The theory is that there are identifiable steps to writing good prose which
software can make easier.
The first task is to choose a subject. The computer runs 'brainstorming
software' to help spawn the idea, followed by a 'writer's block evader' to
get over the fear of a blank screen.
The next stage is to outline a structure. By scanning business writing
advice programs, good letter writing plans, report writing skeletons or
random plot generators the user is offered a selection of templates.
Once the basic outline is ready the user begins to write. If stuck for a
word, a spicy quote or impressive fact, the requisite dictionary can insert
it into the text at the press of a button.
Also available for quick reference are thesauri, multilingual dictionaries,
usage advice, abbreviations and automatic hyphenators.
All this will occupy a sizeable chunk of the hard disk and active memory.
Finally, after the piece is written, correction programs sift through the
text, pouncing on infelicities of style, punctuation, grammar and usage.
There's almost nothing the software linguists haven't thought of to take the
pain out of writing. There are some 30-40 types of software beyond the
word-processor itself - all apparently selling well. It seems that Britons
and Americans are sufficiently insecure about their ability to express
themselves that they support an entire industry of computerised language
lessons.
This ought to be good news for managers who are anxious about standards of
English teaching in schools. Unfortunately, however, providing a suite of
writing tools for staff is only a palliative, not a substitute.
Programs that act as reference books on line are handy, but the user has to
know whether a problem exists in the first place. That's fine for checking
if Middlesbrough has one or two Os in it, but whether to put a question mark
before or after a closing quotation mark is a trickier matter.
The trouble is that the limitations on computer memory make it impossible
for a program to provide sufficient information about the intricacies of an
entire language. Language is too rich to be stuffed within the confines of a
personal computer program. Most advice is glib.
Programs that check for errors of grammar or idiom may be a boon to those
who recognise the error and can quietly put it right before the client sees
it. But they are no good for users who are unsure. Software analysis can
easily come up with an incorrect diagnosis or offer inappropriate comment.
Even if it does offer some useful learning points for the insecure writer
(when to use 'its' or 'it's') such programs are only worth their price to
those who can sort the wheat from the chaff. And those people trust their
instincts, not a number-crunching, pattern-matching system.
One has to admire the ambition of the software producers who have set
themselves the impossible task of taming language to fit computer
capabilities. The danger is that some users may depend too heavily on such
programs to mask their own shortcomings.
Style-checkers encourage deadened prose based on limited criteria of
excellence. Good, structured and accurate writing comes from practice, not
from software.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Britain to give medical help to
Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will give medical help to, or evacuate, children caught up in
fighting in Sarajevo, Mr Major told MPs.
The prime minister would also consider providing air cover if a land
corridor to the city could be established under United Nations' auspices. He
repeated that UK ground troops would not be sent.
However, when pressed for a pledge that the Commons would be recalled if
further British involvement was envisaged, Mr Major said: 'I would be most
unwise to give a blanket assurance to you, and I am unable to do so.'
Mr Major expects to meet the UN high commissioner for refugees later this
week.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: War rages for Treasury's ear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE heady days for Westminster backbenchers. After years as
inconsequential makeweights, an anaemic government majority and the presence
of Maastricht at the top of the political agenda, have contrived to give
them a modicum of real power.
Mr John Townend, the Conservative MP for Bridlington, demonstrated this
emphatically over the weekend, when he took the government unawares by
predicting on BBC television that there would be intense pressure to devalue
sterling if the economy was not showing signs of recovery by the beginning
of next year.
A majority of Tory MPs would now favour a general realignment of the
exchange rate mechanism, said Mr Townend, whose prime source of influence is
as chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, to which he was
recently elected, seeing off a challenge from Sir David Mitchell, a former
transport minister.
In this capacity, he will routinely represent Conservative backbench views
on the economy, being guaranteed the ear of the Treasury team whenever he
requires it.
His election has widely been regarded as evidence of a drift to the right
within the parliamentary party.
The presence in such a position of this outspoken and staunchly Thatcherite
Euro-sceptic will at least be helpful to chancellor Norman Lamont and his
Treasury colleagues in one key respect. He is as convinced as they are of
the importance of keeping spending under control. 'I strongly believe in a
balanced budget,' he says, remarking on the additional strain under which
falling Treasury revenues are putting public finances.
But his stance on interest rates may contribute to an uneasy second half for
Mr Lamont if the economic news does not improve.
In the continued absence of 'green shoots', a bluntly delivered message to
the effect that lower interest rates were necessary to kick-start a recovery
might come from Mr Townend - a successful small businessman - as soon as
November.
If achieving this meant engineering an upward revaluation of the D-Mark or
even ditching the exchange rate mechanism, this Hull-born wine merchant and
hotelier would shed few tears - as his weekend comments made clear.
He expresses doubt, however, that a unilateral rejection of the ERM would
actually achieve the desired objective. Britain is 'really hog-tied' to the
mechanism, he says, lapsing into the Humberside argot with which his
conversation is peppered: Bridlington is probably the only British
constituency in which pigs outnumber people.
A provincial Tory squire of the old school, Mr Townend holds the sort of
views on non-fiscal issues you might hear voiced a hundred times over at
Conservative party conference.
In favour of restoring capital punishment, he was one of 11 Tories to oppose
the government's 1990 bill to allow residence for 50,000 Hong Kong families.
'I was certainly representing the views of my constituents,' he says.
He is one of the true believers who still argue that the newly-elevated
Baroness Thatcher would have beaten off Mr Michael Heseltine's challenge had
she opted to run in the second Tory leadership ballot.
Among his less trumpeted achievements, Mr Townend is credited by Mr John
Prescott, the Labour deputy leadership candidate, with smoothing his path to
Westminster when Mr Prescott first contested the Hull East seat 22 years
ago.
As the Labour frontbencher recalls, popular disenchantment with local
housing policies adopted during Mr Townend's stint on Hull city council
helped him home with a comfortable 22,000 majority.
The defeated Tory candidate on that occasion was one Norman Stewart Hughson
Lamont.
Mr Tim Collins, press minder to Mr John Major during the general election
campaign, has been appointed Tory party director of communications,
succeeding Mr Shaun Woodward.
Mr Tim Smith, Tory MP for Beaconsfield, becomes a party treasurer in
succession to Lord Beaverbrook, and Mr Tony Garrett succeeds Sir John Lacy
as head of campaigning.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM urges swift Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL on the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks would make 'the
single biggest contribution' possible towards world economic recovery, Mr
John Major said yesterday.
Amid calls from many Tory backbench MPs for lower interest rates or a
sterling devaluation to revitalise the UK economy, Mr Major stressed the
importance he attaches to free trade when he reported on last week's Munich
summit of leading industrial nations.
He betrayed his frustration that a deal had not been possible last week and,
in a jibe at countries he believes are blocking a settlement, said: 'With
the right political instruction, the negotiators could very swiftly reach a
settlement.'
The stumbling block to a deal on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt) remains a dispute between the European Community and the US over farm
subsidies. France, in particular, wants the US to respond positively to
recent reforms in the EC common agriculture policy.
A settlement of the Gatt would 'give a sharp non-inflationary boost to the
world economy,' Mr Major said.
Shrugging off his failure to strike a deal, Mr Major said he made 'no
apology for putting it high on the agenda at Munich'. A Gatt agreement would
boost world annual income by Dollars 195bn (Pounds 101.4bn) of which more
than Dollars 90bn would go to developing and former communist countries.
However he faced ridicule from Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, for the
'ineffectual results' of the summit. Mr Kinnock said: 'It would be sensible
now to suspend G7 meetings until the leaders of the seven of the strongest
economies in the world are willing to take action which is significant
enough to live up to the splendour of the summit occasions.'
He complained there were no proposals for the co-ordinated growth policies
needed if the world economy was not to sink into prolonged stagnation.
Mr Major admitted that there had been 'some successes and some
disappointments' in Munich.

THE WELSH Office and the building management section of the Property
Services Agency are the worst government departments when it comes to paying
their bills on time, Diane Summers writes.
Less than 42 per cent of PSA building management bills are paid within the
contract terms or 30 days. The Welsh Office, meanwhile, pays 65 per cent of
invoices within the period, government figures indicate.
Top of the prompt payment league is the Inland Revenue, which pays 99 per
cent of invoices within 30 days.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Setback for MPs' Maxwell campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners suffered a setback
yesterday as it emerged that there is little prospect of an inquiry by the
parliamentary ombudsman into the conduct of the Department of Trade and
Industry.
MPs believe that the statement last week by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, was a signal that there is not enough of a case of potential
maladministration for the ombudsman to investigate.
He said claims that the DTI had failed to act on warnings from Imro, the
Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, did not appear to be
substantiated, and that the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) found
those legal uncertainties did not make any material difference to Imro's
regulation of the Maxwell pension fund companies.
Details of the argument against an investigation were set out in a Commons
debate by Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary.
He said that after Imro had passed to the DTI a report about the problems of
the law on pension fund regulation, the department had told Imro and SIB
that it was for them to devise adequate investor protection.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Senior Tories angry at committee
ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night ran the gauntlet of bitter criticism from some of
its most senior backbenchers as it succeeded in excluding its bete noire Mr
Nicholas Winterton from membership of the parliamentary select committees
which monitor its affairs.
After a noisy and bad-tempered debate, an amendment that would have
reinstated Mr Winterton, the Tory MP for Macclesfield, as a member of the
health select committee which he chaired until the election was defeated by
63 votes (147-210).
His exclusion followed a ruling by government business managers to the
effect that no Conservative MP could serve on a committee for more than
three consecutive parliaments.
The ruling also hit Sir John Wheeler, the scrupulously loyal Conservative MP
for Westminster North who had been a member of the home affairs select
committee since its inception in 1979.
An amendment effectively permitting Sir John's exclusion was carried by the
narrower margin of 21 votes (160-139).
An angry Mr Winterton took his revenge by accusing the government of 'an
arrogance that can lead to dictatorship.' 'An independent view and freedom
of speech is being gradually squeezed out in this House,' he said.
He was supported in his clear resentment of the government's elaborate
efforts to check parliament's right to scrutinise the executive both by Sir
John and Mr Terence Higgins, former Tory chairman of the Treasury and civil
service select committee.
Sir John likened the three-term rule to the experience of stepping on a
piece of bubble gum - 'tacky, sticky and lingers long after the event.'
Mr Higgins claimed that the rule had been 'invented at the last moment in
order justify a particular series of selection.'
In a direct attack on Sir Marcus Fox, the Tory MP widely credited with
masterminding the government's tactics, Mr Higgins said there was 'no such
rule' about the time an MP could serve.
Sir Marcus's rule was also condemned by Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of
the social security select committee in the last parliament, who said it
would 'deskill' the committee system.
Opening the debate, Sir Marcus, chairman of the committee of selection,
sought amid much heckling to justify the decision to exclude long-serving
committee members. 'There are many good reasons why we should say that 13
years is long enough,' he said.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Scots may export water to England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND may join other rainy areas of Britain in exporting water to
southern England to relieve the water shortage on a long-term basis, a
government minister revealed yesterday.
Mr Allan Stewart, the Scottish industry minister, said the Scottish Office
was examining a scheme drawn up by the construction industry for
transporting water from the southern uplands of Scotland. He said the
project would cost 'at least four figure millions' - at least Pounds 1bn -
and would be an important boost to Scotland's construction industry.
This is the first time Scotland has been mentioned as a possible source to
boost southern England's water supply. Up to now only Northumbria, Cumbria
and Wales have been considered. The issue is politically sensitive in
Scotland as it follows an announcement last week by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, that was widely seen as paving the way for privatisation of water
north of the border.
Mr Lang said he was appointing consultants to consider 'alternative forms of
organisation for water and sewerage services, including ways in which the
private sector might contribute enterprise and investment.' Water in
Scotland is the responsibility of the regional councils, but with these
likely to be abolished in the forthcoming Scottish local government
reorganisation the question of how water will be organised in future has to
be addressed.
It is understood that a Scottish-based construction company has drawn up a
scheme to transport water from rivers and existing reservoirs in the
southern uplands to England by means of pipelines and tunnels. The plan
would not involve the creation of reservoirs - which would require the
flooding of valleys.
The scheme depends on changes to laws preventing water sale between Scottish
regional councils and presumes that Scottish water will be privatised.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Rafidain Bank wins reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN APPLICATION by the Bank of England to wind up Rafidain Bank, the Iraqi
state-owned bank whose UK branch is in provisional liquidation, was delayed
for another year in the High Court in London yesterday.
Sir Donald Nichols, the vice-chancellor - the senior judge of the Chancery
division - ruled that in view of the continued freeze on Iraqi assets since
the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the application should be adjourned until
the first day of the Trinity legal term in 1993.
He also approved a plan for the creation of a nine-person creditors'
committee to liaise with the two partners at Price Waterhouse appointed as
provisional liquidators last year.
The Bank requested that Rafidain be placed in provisional liquidation on
February 21 last year. It argued that this would prevent a worldwide
scramble for the assets held in the UK branch of the bank.
The London branch of Rafidain is the only branch outside the Middle East.
Other branches within Iraq and the Middle East continue to trade.
The High Court was asked at a previous hearing to consider whether it had
the powers to wind-up a foreign, state-owned bank. Representatives of the
various interests in the case decided at the time that no further action
could be taken until a change in the political circumstances between the UK
and Iraq.
Sir Donald said yesterday that in the 'very unusual circumstances'
surrounding the status of the bank, 'the justification of the last 12 months
still holds good'.
The court was told that if Rafidain was placed in liquidation now, the
dividend to creditors would be less than one half of one pence in the pound.
A further deferment would be in the creditors' interest.
The creditors' committee will include the Deposit Protection Board, an Iraqi
creditor and up to seven other creditors including four of the largest who
are willing to serve.
Goodman International and Anglo Irish Beef Processors, two Irish beef
producers, agreed not to serve on the committee. As joint creditors for more
than Pounds 100m, they are taking legal action to recover their assets.
Separately, a circular from Price Waterhouse distributed to creditors last
month shows that the liquidators had been notified of worldwide assets in
Rafidain totalling Pounds 260m, against liabilities of Pounds 4.68bn by the
end of April this year.
The assets include Pounds 163.7m held in London and Pounds 96.3m overseas
about which the liquidators have been notified. Its liabilities in London
are Pounds 125.9m and those overseas Pounds 4.5bn.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Plea to Lang on Western Isles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has been recommended to surcharge two
former officials of Western Isles council who have been held responsible for
the council losing Pounds 24m in the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International a year ago.
The Commission for Local Authority Accounts, the equivalent in Scotland of
the Audit Commission in England and Wales, has told the Scottish secretary
that the two officials should be required to pay Western Isles council 'an
amount considered to be appropriate recognising that any sum to be paid can
represent only a nominal proportion of the loss'.
The two officials are Mr Donald MacLeod, who was director of finance for the
council, and his deputy Mr Brian Lawrie. Mr MacLeod has been dismissed by
the council while Mr Lawrie left the council shortly before the BCCI crash
and is now director of finance at North East Fife district council.
The commission says that the council lost Pounds 23m of principal and Pounds
1m of accrued interest when the Bank of England closed BCCI.
Western Isles was easily the biggest loser among British local authorities
from the BCCI closure.
The commission says that the council borrowed Pounds 5m from Scottish
Widows, the life assurance company, in 1985 to lend on to BCCI, in
contravention of the law.
The council also borrowed Pounds 11.5m in advance of need and on-lent it to
the bank, again illegally.
Further borrowings of Pounds 2m from Scottish Widows and of Pounds 4m from
Edinburgh district council were on-lent to BCCI 'without regard to any
requirements concerning the limitation to be placed on sums lent to a single
institution, or the need to ensure that the institution met any
predetermined ranking criteria'.
The commission blames Mr MacLeod for failing to provide proper guidance to
the finance department and for not setting up a proper monitoring system.
Mr Lawrie is blamed for failing to give the finance department proper
guidance in the absence of Mr MacLeod.
The commission criticises Mr George MacLeod, the council's chief executive,
and the councillors themselves, for failing to ensure that the council
complied with a 1988 report by the Controller of Audit on an earlier case of
borrowing and on-lending.
Mr George MacLeod was reinstated in February after being dismissed in
December but is seeking early retirement.
The commission asks the Scottish secretary to take into account the
financial circumstances of the officials involved, particularly that of Mr
Donald MacLeod who is out of work.
The surcharging of councillors and officials is relatively rare in Scotland.
In a recent case the commission recommended that Stirling district
councillors pay back Pounds 31,000 that they had borrowed in excess of their
borrowing limit, but this was reduced by the Scottish secretary to one-tenth
of that amount.

FT  14 JUL 92 / BCCI creditors' appeal case opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of individual creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International yesterday appealed against last month's High Court ruling that
sanctioned a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 885m) compensation package. The package
was negotiated between Touche Ross, the liquidators, and the bank's Abu
Dhabi majority shareholders.
The legal move follows the decision of the British creditors' committee not
to appeal when it was told that it might be liable for costs in the action
rather than being able to recover any appeal costs from BCCI assets.
Mr David Hunt QC, counsel for the creditors, argued in the Court of Appeal
that Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor who approved the compensation
package, had wrongly substituted his own commercial judgment for that of the
creditors.
The creditors' committee voted to recommend rejection of the deal by a 7-1
majority.
Sir Donald, giving judgment last month, said the proposals, which will give
creditors between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of their original investments,
represented the best option for the bank's 140,000 creditors in 70
countries.
Mr Hunt argued that the wishes of the majority of the creditors should be
paramount. 'Creditors can be expected to be the best judges of where their
own financial interests lie,' he said.
The creditors are headed by Dr Adil Elias, chairman of the BCCI Depositors
Protection Association, who claims to be a creditor for Pounds 1m.
He is supported in the appeal by the trustees of Film and Photo Design
Pension Fund, the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt and nine individual
Jordanian-based creditors. All will be at risk on costs if the appeal fails.
The hearing is expected to last until tomorrow.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Decay eats away at inner cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN YEARS of govern-ment initiatives have done 'surprisingly little' to
improve life in deprived inner cities, a Policy Studies Institute report
concludes today.
The report acknowledges that the most recent schemes - City Challenge and
the establishment of an Urban Regeneration Agency - have not yet had time to
prove themselves.
It says, however, that 'given the record so far, it is difficult to have
much confidence in more of the same or to feel at all hopeful about the
future prospects for deprived urban areas'.
Without more money and sound management, concludes the report, trends in
deprived areas will 'continue to disappoint the hopes of residents and the
aspirations of government'.
If no increase in government resources is possible, it urges redirection of
other funds to the most deprived parts of the country.
The PSI, a leading independent economic and social policy research
institution, bases its report on official statistics since 1977, when the
then Labour government published the white paper Policy for the Inner
Cities. This sought to reduce disadvantage in inner-urban areas.
It concludes that, while there have been some improvements, the gap between
deprived areas and the rest of the country in general remains as wide as it
was 15 years ago.
'In some respects the gap has widened,' says the report.
Its findings include:
The worsening of pupil-teacher ratios - against the national trend - in most
of the deprived local education authority areas studied. In general there
had been a worsening in examination achievements in deprived areas compared
with the rest of England.
With the exception of the north-west, fewer people from deprived areas than
expected were on Employment Training schemes.
People from deprived areas were more likely to remain unemployed after
leaving Employment Training and Youth Training schemes, with no evidence of
improvement in this position over time.
The proportion of families in poverty - measured in terms of those
qualifying for social security benefits - had grown. Premature death among
adults remained greater in deprived areas than elsewhere. While there had
been improvements in infant mortality rates throughout the country, most
deprived areas still had records that were worse than the national average.
Estate Action and other housing programmes had not resulted in
home-improvement and renovation schemes ing a higher priority in deprived
areas than elsewhere. The decrease in social housing meant that little new
low-cost property had been built to help ease the housing difficulties of
deprived areas.
While unemployment fell in a third of deprived areas between 1983 and 1991,
it had remained the same or increased in the other two thirds.
During the 1980s, says the report, grants from central government to local
authorities declined in real terms.
Although most deprived areas had lost proportionately less grant than other
locations, the bulk of recent available funding had gone to urban
development corporations, with London Docklands receiving the lion's share.
Spending on the mainstream urban programme in England outside development
corporation areas had declined in real terms during the 1980s.
'The decay at the heart of Britain's cities is one of the biggest challenges
faced by its government,' says the report.
Successive administrations had been trying to reverse negative trends by
stimulating environmental renewal, encouraging investment, creating jobs and
attempting to give residents a better quality of life.
The institute's conclusions are based on 36 urban areas which scored the
highest on the Department of Environment's deprivation indicators. These
indicators consider the extent of factors such as unemployment, overcrowded
homes and lack of amenities.
The report acknowledges that there is a 'fundamental difficulty' involved in
establishing the causes of the trends which it identifies. It was not
possible to tell whether, without the initiatives taken in the inner cities
during the past 15 years, the gaps between deprived areas and the rest of
the country might have grown still wider.
It also recognises that some innovative measures have been introduced only
recently. It had been suggested, says the report, that City Challenge -
under which local authorities compete for funding for specific schemes -
would focus resources more effectively and encourage local partnerships.
Likewise, in two years' time the proposed Urban Regeneration Agency might
have shown its effectiveness.
'There is something in all these points. Even so, the conclusion to which
our analyses lead is disturbing.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Early permission may be sought for Sizewell C
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned nuclear power utility, is likely to seek
planning permission for Sizewell C power station in Suffolk before the
government decides whether to approve further plants.
A formal application for the Pounds 3bn twin-reactor plan could be submitted
to the local authority later this year - two years before the outcome of a
ministerial review of nuclear power economics is known.
Even if planning permission is granted, a start to construction in late 1994
would still depend on a favourable outcome of the review.
Sizewell B, which was under construction before the government announced a
moratorium on nuclear expansion, is due for completion in 1994. It is
Britain's first pressurised water reactor (PWR) power station.
Planning permission has been granted, subject to the outcome of the review,
for a further PWR at Hinkley Point in Somerset, but Nuclear Electric would
prefer to build Sizewell C first.
Mr Brian George, Nuclear Electric's executive director for construction and
future projects, said yesterday the company would be taking a commercial
risk if it decided to proceed with a planning application for Sizewell C
before the outcome of the review was known.
He said granting of planning permission in advance would enable a start to
be made immediately in 1994 if the outcome of the review was favourable.
Considerable expertise had been acquired during the construction of Sizewell
B, and there would be advantages in transferring manpower to the C station
site.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, who was paying his first visit to the
Sizewell site yesterday, said that it was a matter for Nuclear Electric
whether or not it submitted a planning application. This would not influence
the outcome of the review of nuclear economics.

<TEXT>
ISSUES concerning the management of the Church of England's funds would be
'examined closely by the Church Commissioners and others concerned,' Dr
George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, said yesterday, Alan Pike writes.
'Over the last few days we have heard criticism of the Church Commissioners'
stewardship of resources,' Dr Carey told the church's general synod meeting
in York.
'Serious points have been made about the management of funds and about
judgments on investments. I want to assure synod that these will be examined
closely by the Church Commissioners and others concerned. We haven't lost
Pounds 500m.'
Dr Carey who, as archbishop of Canterbury, is chairman of the commissioners,
added that as someone coming recently to the life of the commissioners he
admired their conscientious work.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Blue Arrow trial unfair court told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR City advisers convicted of fraud over the Blue Arrow scandal were
denied a fair trial because of the length and complex nature of the legal
proceedings and the judge's late decision to cut down the case against them,
the Court of Appeal was told yesterday.
Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County NatWest chief executive, Mr David Reed, a
former head of corporate finance at County and Mr Nicholas Wells, a former
County director, were all given 18-month suspended sentences at the end of
the trial which lasted a year and four days. Mr Martin Gibbs, a former head
of corporate finance at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, received a one-year suspended
sentence.
All four men were convicted of conspiring to mislead the markets over the
result of the 1987 Blue Arrow rights issue by secretly buying shares
themselves to raise the take-up level announced to other investors.
All except Mr Wells were in court yesterday to hear Mr Anthony Hooper QC
open the appeals against their convictions.
'The weight, length and complexity was such that a fair trial was not
possible,' he told the three appeal court judges, Lord Justice Mann, Mr
Justice Buckley and Mr Justice Ognall.
The decision of the trial judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, to dramatically reduce
the size of the case against the four men after all the evidence had been
heard, and both prosecution and defence closing speeches made, was a
'material irregularity' in the proceedings, he continued.
During pre-trial hearings, defence lawyers had continually argued that the
prosecution's case was too large and would result in an unmanageable trial.
However, the prosecution had insisted that the case could not be cut back
and that the trial would last only between four and six months, Mr Hooper,
for Mr Reed, said.
Half-way through the trial the judge had said the prosecution had lost sight
of the limits of the jury system but that its case could not then be cut
back further. Later, in his summing-up he restricted the case to just the
'late take-up' issue, telling the jury to ignore 75 per cent of the
evidence. The evidence that remained had mostly been given at the start of
the year-long trial, Mr Hooper said.
Mr Vivian Robinson QC, for Mr Wells, said that in not cutting back the size
of the trial before it began, the judge had made a fundamental error from
which all other mischiefs followed.
It would be naive not to think the jury would be influenced by the months of
evidence they had heard but were later told to disregard, Mr Robinson said.
The appeal is expected to last between one and two weeks.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Careers Service is urged to raise its profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAREERS Service should consider launching a campaign to raise its
profile among employers, according to a report by the Institute of Manpower
Studies.
A survey of 2,200 employers showed that while the majority knew the service
existed, a much smaller proportion used it on a regular basis.
Only half of the employers who were active in the young persons' labour
market were involved with the service. The report says that if companies
knew more about the service and how it could assist them they might consider
using it.
Use was greatest among larger employers and manufacturing companies and
least among smaller companies and the service sector.
Those companies that did use the service were generally happy with it, most
using it as a junior Jobcentre to find young people to interview. In a
number of these cases the local service provided the additional service of
pre-selecting people.
It was in such screening that the survey encountered the highest level of
dissatisfaction among employers, with complaints about the inappropriateness
of the people put forward.
Some employers said they wanted to see the Careers Service expanding the
element of its activities aimed at the adult workforce. A small percentage
said they would be willing to pay for services such as aptitude testing and
potential assessment of their employees.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Lautro warns on pension switches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW RULES to be announced later this week will warn sales agents from life
insurance companies against encouraging members of occupational pensions
schemes to switch to personal pensions.
A draft of the document by Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life
insurance industry, says that the rules are likely to mean that after an
analysis of each potential client's situation, 'many' will be advised not to
make a purchase.
Personal pensions have been among the most significant sources of new
business for the life insurance industry, accounting for 39 per cent of all
new business underwritten in the year to March 31.
Lautro is to release an enforcement bulletin for sales agents because,
according to a draft document, it is concerned 'that adequate care was not
always being taken by company representatives in establishing whether or not
it was bona fide in the interests of members of occupational pension schemes
to transfer to personal pension plans'.
Mr Brian Sharp, secretary to the Association of British Insurers' Life
Council, said he believed the rules were already best practice within the
industry and were unlikely to cause a stir.
Mr Ron Spill, pensions manager at Legal and General, said the rules embodied
what was already followed at his company and would not force any change in
practice.
However, Lautro has noted a sharp rise in complaints from the public of
high-pressure sales tactics used to encourage workers to leave attractive
employer-sponsored schemes. For this reason it decided to make new rules.
Occupational schemes offer many benefits that personal pensions cannot -
such as additional contributions from employers, inflation-adjusted benefits
and survivors' benefits for death in service. Those who transfer out of
occupational schemes often receive lump sums worth far less than benefits
they would have been entitled to had they stayed in the scheme, even if they
had switched to a new employer and stopped contributing to the original
scheme.
The draft rules also suggest that companies receiving complaints from those
who have been urged to transfer out of an employers' scheme into a personal
pension scheme should consider whether the new guidelines were followed when
the sale was made.
In addition, the rules seek to limit the amount of commission that can be
charged to clients up-front.
Life insurance companies typically deduct up to two years premiums to pay
sales costs on long-term insurance contracts.
The new rules will limit commissions on personal pensions to a percentage of
each year's premium - typically 4 per cent to 5 per cent.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Names' leader to head new agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID Berriman, a prominent City figure and a leader of loss-making
Lloyd's Names, is to head a new agency at the troubled insurance market.
Sir David, a former merchant banker who holds a range of directorships, will
chair the agency - which has been formed by a merger between two smaller
groupings, Knightstone and Spratt &amp; White.
He is the latest of a number of Names - individuals whose assets support
underwriting at Lloyd's - to take a more active role in the management of
the market's businesses.
Sir David has assumed prominence at Lloyd's as chairman of the Rose Thomson
Young Action group, formed by Names who are members of Syndicate 255.
This syndicate ran up heavy losses as a result of its involvement in spiral
reinsurance, in which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's
exposures to catastrophe losses.
Sir David said: 'A lot of the failures of Lloyd's in the past have been
linked to the failure of managing agents to manage underwriters. We will
watch our syndicates like hawks.'
In a separate development the High Court will today hear a motion from
Lloyd's seeking to set aside a motion calling for a judicial review of the
market's authorities.
Six Names connected to the Gooda Walker Action group initially sought the
judicial review in May.
Judicial reviews are actions against public or semi-public bodies which are
alleged to have failed to observe their - often statutory - duties.
Meanwhile, Lloyd's confirmed yesterday that voting on the resolutions being
put forward at the society's extraordinary general meeting on 27 July will
be by postal ballot.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Golf driver sells for Pounds 92,400: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIMITIVE golf club fashioned from a lump of iron by a Scottish blacksmith
around 1700 sold for Pounds 92,400 at Sotheby's sale of golfing memorabilia
yesterday. The club was discovered in a garden shed in Edinburgh and the
long ash shaft has a grip which is still in good condition. The 42 1/2 inch
long club weighs 24 ounces - more than twice the weight of a contemporary
driver.
The price paid was way above the Pounds 40,000 estimate and set an auction
record for a golf club. The previous best was the Pounds 55,000 paid at
Christie's in 1990 for a rake iron club of similar antiquity.
The buyer at Loretto School in Musselburgh, Scotland, was the London dealer
Mr Titus Kendall who was bidding on behalf of the Valderamma Golf Club in
Sotte Grande, southern Spain. The club is setting up a golfing museum as
part of its strategy to attract the Ryder Cup tournament.
It acquired 13 lots at the morning session of an auction which Sotheby's
holds annually to coincide with the British Open championship, which starts
this week at nearby Muirfield.
Also going to Spain is a jeu de mail hardwood iron-bound club, made in
France in the mid 18th century, which sold for Pounds 10,450. Jeu de mail is
a game with close similarities to golf. It is believed to have been
introduced to Scotland by Mary Queen of Scots in the 16th century, leading
to the development of golf. The club also paid Pounds 8,800 for a feather
golf ball of around 1830, inscribed with the name of the maker AT Alexander.
The record for the golf club is some consolation to Sotheby's for its
failure on Friday to sell one of the finest pieces of English furniture to
be offered at auction in recent years - a library table made by Gillows of
Lancaster in 1778 to a design by Chippendale. It was bought in at Pounds
240,000, less than half the sum anticipated.
The library table was expected to do well because of its excellent
provenance. It was sold by a descendant of Sir James Ibbetson of Otley,
Yorkshire, who had paid Chippendale Pounds 551 for his contribution. It was
the only commission that Chippendale, a native of Otley, undertook in the
parish of his birth.
In general the furniture sale did quite well, totalling more than Pounds
1.4m. A pair of Gothic revival rosewood chairs, commissioned by King George
IV in 1828 for Windsor Castle, was bought by the London dealer Blairman for
Pounds 74,800, comfortably above forecast.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Accounting body hits Pounds 2m target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL Reporting Council, the UK's accounting standards umbrella
body, has achieved its target of Pounds 2m to cover legal challenges to the
rulings of its offshoots, its annual report and accounts revealed yesterday.
It said that would reduce its funding requirements for this year from Pounds
2.7m to Pounds 1.8m.
The accounts also showed that costs incurred by the investigations of the
Financial Reporting Review Panel, its watchdog and enforcement arm, were
Pounds 50,000 in the year to March 31.
The panel investigates deviations from accounting standards. It tries to
persuade any companies that breach standards to amend their accounts
voluntarily, but it has powers to take them to court if its rulings are
challenged.
Alongside the review panel, the council funds the Accounting Standards
Board, the Urgent Issues Task Force and the Public Sector Liaison Committee.
The accounts show an increase in contributions from sponsors to Pounds
2.67m, compared with Pounds 2.53m in the previous year.
Operating charges were up from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 1.89m, and there was a
surplus of Pounds 32,000 (Pounds 302,000 last year).
Funding for the council came from the Department of Trade and Industry, the
professional accountancy bodies, the London Stock Exchange, the Association
of British Insurers, the Northern Ireland Department of Economic
Development, the National Audit Office and eight London and Scottish
clearing banks.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Home loans face threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES may have to cut lending to first-time buyers because of
pressure from insurance companies, the chief executive of a leading building
society warned yesterday.
Mr Martin Armstrong, head of Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society, said
insurance companies were trying to impose terms on mortgage-indemnity
insurance that would depress the market.
'There is a strong likelihood that the maximum percentage on loans we can
offer borrowers will be reduced from 95 per cent to 90 per cent, harming the
first-time-buyer market,' Mr Armstrong said.
Insurers have been renegotiating contracts with mortgage lenders since the
end of last year.
Most existing contracts for mortgage-indemnity insurance, a one-off payment
insuring high loan-to-value mortgages, finish on August 31.
Insurance companies have made heavy losses in the mortgage indemnity
business in the last two years because of the squeeze on the housing market
and the fall in house prices.
Royal Insurance, one of the market leaders, faces losses of more than Pounds
400m from domestic mortgage indemnities.
It says it is trying to develop a proper trading relationship with its
clients.
Legal &amp; General, another large insurer, said it had stopped dealing with
several small building societies to concentrate on larger lenders.
Two small societies, Buckinghamshire and Kent Reliance, confirmed yesterday
that Legal &amp; General had told them it would no longer offer them
mortgage-indemnity insurance.
Both say their experience of bad loans has been very low and they are
negotiating with other insurance companies.
Mr John Wriglesworth, a housing market analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said
the insurance companies were operating a cartel in dealing with mortgage
lenders.
'All the new terms for the contracts are exactly the same wording,' he said.
'The insurance companies risk shooting themselves in the foot.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Unease at universities' pay deal signalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Education confirmed yesterday that it has convened a
meeting with university vice-chancellors and the Association of University
Teachers which almost certainly indicates government displeasure at the pay
deal that was agreed for university teachers in May.
The AUT and the vice-chancellors agreed a 6 per cent rise with a further 1
per cent to be distributed locally later in the year. With the delay in
implementing the award the AUT says the increase to the salary bill is about
5.75 per cent.
However, with the government keen to restrict public-sector pay rises to 4
per cent - as it did last week for the 2,000 top civil servants covered by
the Top Salaries Review Body - the lecturers' rise is regarded by ministers
as eating up too much of the overall university grant. By threatening to
alter the level of the overall grant the government is in a strong position
to force a reduction in the pay rise.
An AUT spokeswoman said that since 1979 average non-manual earnings have
risen 58 per cent in real terms while academic earnings have risen only 10
per cent.
Some vice-chancellors had indicated during the negotiations with the AUT
that they could not afford a pay rise higher than 2 per cent. However, the
AUT said that those universities with special difficulties had been taken
into account in the negotiations.
The House of Lords yesterday reserved judgment in a test-case appeal that
will decide whether senior university lecturers can count on keeping their
jobs until retirement without fear of being made redundant on cost-cutting
grounds.
Five law lords headed by Lord Keith heard 4 1/2 days of legal argument in an
appeal by Professor Edgar Page, a 61-year-old philosophy lecturer made
redundant by Hull University in October 1988.
The law lords' decision is not expected before the start of the new legal
year in October.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Nucor abandons Scottish plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST hope of reviving steel production in Scotland has vanished with the
decision of Nucor, the US steel producer, not to go ahead with a plan to
develop a steel plant at Hunterston on the Firth of Clyde, James Buxton
writes.
Nucor, which has pioneered thin slab casting technology in the US,
investigated the possibility of setting up a plant in Scotland after a
week-long visit by executives in April.
It rejected the idea of taking over British Steel's Ravenscraig complex
which closed last month, but was interested in the coastal site, and in
using some Ravenscraig workers.
Nucor has said it does not have the resources or the time to undertake a new
project at Hunterston. It believes development of the plant would be
economically viable and has not ruled out taking a minority interest in any
future scheme.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Van sales lift flagging sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMMERCIAL vehicle sales last month reversed 32 consecutive months of
decline. However, the slight increase in sales was concentrated in the vans
sector and manufacturers yesterday continued to show little optimism of an
early truck-market recovery.
At 16,176, total new commercial vehicle sales were up 5.16 per cent on the
15,382 sold in June a year ago. But sales for the first half of the year, at
102,507, were 8.64 per cent below last year's first-half 112,197.
The minor consolation for UK-based manufacturers was that, in spite of the
fact that imports increased their market share slightly in June, their
first-half share fell to 34.64 per cent from 35.47 per cent a year before.
Sales of light vans - mainly those derived from cars - rose by 9.61 per cent
in June to 5,363, up from 4,893 a year previously. In the first half as a
whole they are running nearly 10 per cent below last year's ago levels, and
the market appears to be on the brink of an intensified price war after Ford
cut prices of its Fiesta diesel vans by 7.7 per cent.
Sales of panel vans, typified by the Ford Transit, also rose in June, up
7.83 per cent to 7,246 from 6,720 a year ago. Here too, however, first-half
sales remained more than 7 per cent below last year's ago levels.
Sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes recorded yet another month of decline,
falling 3.82 per cent to 2,5443 from 2,614. For the half year, they remain
just over 10 per cent below last year's equivalent period.
It is in the heaviest sector of the market - trucks over 15 tonnes - that
there is most uncertainty. Sales of 38 tonnes-plus heavy tractor units have
been running about 10 per cent above last year's levels in each of the past
three months.
Even so, a spokesman for Leyland DAF, the UK truck-market leader, said sales
would have to recover by well over 10 per cent in the second half of the
year to attain even last year's severely depressed levels.
ERF, the UK's last independent heavy-truck maker, expects total UK sales of
trucks over 15 tonnes this year to be about 15,000 units for the second year
in a row, some 60 per cent below the 38,000 achieved in 1989.
According to Mr Rod England, ERF sales and marketing director, there remains
no sign of recovery.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Thai airline battle looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S cabinet yesterday decided on first steps to remove Thai Airways
International (THAI), the country's flag-carrier, from control of the air
force.
The decision was described as a matter of compliance with stock market law,
but it is clearly part of the proclaimed intention of the prime minister, Mr
Anand Panyarachun, to 'demilitarise politics' and 'decommercialise the armed
forces', after the shooting of scores of anti-military protesters in May.
One of the officers blamed for the shooting is Air Chief Marshal Kaset
Rojananil, armed forces supreme commander and therefore in charge of
internal security until last week.
Mr Anand still has several more sensitive steps to take in order to complete
the limited task he has set himself before the September 13 general
election. The most difficult will be the annual reshuffle of the top brass
that takes place on October 1 and is usually announced in September.
Air Chief Marshal Kaset could be promoted to a less active post in the
reshuffle which could force him to leave THAI's chairmanship before the
airline's new regulations take effect.
The cabinet's decision yesterday was to ask Thai Airways' board of directors
to amend the company's articles of association, a change that does not have
to be made for two years.
That is the deadline, under new stock exchange laws that came into force in
May, for companies whose shares are traded on the market to become public
listed companies. By law, these companies' directors have to be elected
freely by shareholders.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Putting the generals out of business / Examining efforts to
loosen the military's grip on Thailand's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S numerous generals have been uncharacteristically quiet since
troops shot scores of pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok in May, but
they now face a battle on two fronts.
Last week the government of Mr Anand Panyarachun, removed their authority to
deal with domestic unrest, used repeatedly to enhance their political power.
Since May, pro-democracy campaigners have been demanding the resignation of
senior commanders responsible for the shooting. Mr Anand has prefered a more
legalistic approach and last week's move is seen as a first step towards
reorganising the military.
Yesterday, Mr Anand turned his attention to loosening their grip on the Thai
economy by seeking to end the air force chief's automatic right to chair
Thai Airways International, the national airline.
Thai Airways International, the national airline, has become the focus of
this campaign, both because its chairman is Air Chief Marshal Kaset
Rojananil, the air force chief and supreme military commander, and because
its poor financial performance suggests soldiers are ill qualified to run a
modern business of such size and complexity.
The privatisation of Thai Airways and the impending flotation of 7 per cent
of its shares - along with a the decline in tourist arrivals resulting from
the violence, for which Air Chief Marshal Kaset is blamed - have also drawn
attention to the airline.
Suggested boycotts of Thai Airways and of the Thai Military Bank, a third of
which is owned by the armed forces, appear to have generated more talk than
action, but the technocrats have found a powerful advocate in Mr Anand, the
businessman appointed prime minister in June.
Mr Nukul Prachuabmoh, thetransport and communications minister, has ordered
an inquiry into seven allegations of corruption at the airline, including
one about the purchase of Rolls Royce engines for new Boeing 777s and
another about the planned purchase of a plot of land from a senior air force
officer's wife.
Thai Airways has long been the fiefdom of the air force, but Mr Nukul and
the finance ministry, which owns 93 per cent of the airline, have now agreed
to change the company's articles of association; at present the articles
give control of the board to the air force and stipulate that the air force
commander automatically becomes chairman.
The combative Mr Nukul has not restricted his efforts to Thai Airways. He is
also manoeuvring to dislodge the military from the Telephone Organisation of
Thailand and the Communications Authority of Thailand. The first is
responsible for the domestic telephone system and is controlled by the army,
while the second handles international communications and has until now come
under the air force.
Another minister, Mr Mechai Viravaidya, is attempting to reform the
state-controlled media to ensure objective news coverage. During the
violence in May, television and radio stations owned by the military were
sharply criticised for their biased coverage.
Although they intend to reduce the influence of the military in state
enterprises, Mr Anand and his cabinet know they will only be able to make a
start on removing the generals from their entrenched positions in the Thai
economy in the two months before elections in September.
Military commanders justify their dominance of communications and air
transport on the grounds of national security - an excuse which has looked
increasingly thin since the collapse of Soviet communism - but they are also
linked directly or through protection rackets to many different kinds of
legal and illegal activities with no relevance to security.
These include the border trade in gems and timber from Cambodia and Burma,
the coastal smuggling of diesel from Singapore, gambling, real estate and
golf course deals using state property, and the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly.
The Supreme Command declined to answer questions on military involvement in
business.
Senior military men have grown exceptionally wealthy from various business
interests, but Mr Anand, in trying to nudge them back to the barracks, has
deliberately avoided publicly antagonising them.
He warned civilians in a recent speech to realise 'that the strength and
organisation of the military is such that they cannot and should not be
excluded from all public affairs unrelated to defence.'
Mr Anand and supporters of the armed forces say soldiers play a vital role
in developing rural areas, but that is more a reflection of the weakness of
successive civilian governments than of the military's expertise in
dam-building.
Perhaps sensing that the violence in May has left the military businessmen
of the armed forces in a vulnerable position, a handful of officers have
recently spoken out in favour of a professional army which would leave
politics and business to civilians.
Thailand faces no perceptible security threat from abroad which could be
used to justify continued military control of strategic sectors of the
economy, and if there were such a threat, it would increase public demands
for a professional army.
The Thai security services are regarded as a poor fighting force - they were
humiliatingly defeated in a border skirmish with Laos four years ago -
because training has been neglected in favour of business, equipment has
been chosen on the basis of lucrative commissions rather than suitability,
and the top-heavy officer corps is splintered into political factions.
The armed forces have become adept, however, at staging coups d'etat, and
there are muted fears they will do just that if they object to the efforts
to curtail their business activities and attempts to punish them for the
deaths in May.

THE Iraqi leadership has decided to turn down the latest United Nations

energy newsletter Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Nicosia.
MEES said the decision was reached after several meetings in Baghdad between
Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister, and Iraq's negotiators headed by
Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari. Iraq's main objection was to the UN's insistence
that oil exports should be channelled through Turkey to the Mediterranean
terminal of Ceyhan, rather than through Iraq's Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr,
MEES said.

<TEXT>
TEN THOUSAND black South Africans yesterday marched peacefully on government
buildings in Pretoria as business leaders and trade union officials
continued efforts to defuse the country's political crisis.
In what turned out to be a muted step in the 'mass action' campaign intended
to force President FW de Klerk to give way to majority rule, several
thousand demonstrators gathered in the grounds of Union Buildings, the
government's administrative headquarters.
Mr Sam Shilowa, assistant secretary general of the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (Cosatu), handed over a memorandum on political demands and
working conditions to a senior civil servant.
But the modest turn-out and the low-key mood of the crowd will have
disappointed the African National Congress (ANC) and Cosatu, the
co-organisers. Their main efforts, however, are being directed towards a
general strike, planned to begin on August 3.
Representatives of the business community were last night continuing talks
with Cosatu officials in an effort to revive the stalled negotiating
process.
The South African Co-ordinating Committee on Labour Affairs (Sacola), made
up of 10 leading employers, is understood to have suggested that business
and labour could jointly convene 'assemblies for peace, economic
reconstruction and progress' on August 3.
Cosatu would suspend plans for a week of disruption and civil disobedience.
In return it would expect the government to implement a package of measures
to curb political violence, and agree to hold elections for a constituent
assembly by the end of the year.
Mr Jay Naidoo, Cosatu general secretary, said the Sacola meetings were an
attempt 'to break the political log-jam and get movement towards a political
democracy'.
Government thinking may be disclosed tomorrow when Mr Pik Botha, the foreign
minister, addresses the UN security council in New York.

FT  14 JUL 92 / New Delhi defied over Hindu temple

<TEXT>
MR S B Chavan, the Indian home minister, said yesterday the Uttar Pradesh
government had defied a directive from India's highest court by permitting
the start of construction of a Hindu temple near the site of a 16th-century
mosque at Ayodhya, located in the state.
Mr Chavan, who was forced to make a statement in the house, ruled out the
possibility of an immediate action against the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) whose government had flouted the ruling of the courts,
saying that 'the final decision of the Supreme Court would have to be
awaited.' BJP is the largest opposition group in the Indian parliament.
Last week, the supreme court admitted a writ petitioning against the
construction. A hearing is set to begin this week.
Hindu militants began building the temple last week, reopening a dispute
which has led to more than 2,000 deaths during the past three years. The
issue has been dormant for the past six months.
Mr Chavan, who visited Ayodhya at the weekend, told a noisy house that he
had offered Mr Kalyan Singh, the state chief minister, more security to
ensure that the disputed land was not encroached upon, but Mr Singh declined
the offer.
Paramilitary forces guarding the ancient Babri Masjid mosque have been
watching helplessly as hundreds of Hindu devotees continue to pour into the
town they believe is the birthplace of the god, Ram.
The Supreme Court had directed the central government and the Uttar Pradesh
chief minister to 'maintain status quo' in the disputed complex on November
15 last year.
Opposition parties accused the government of having no concrete plan to stop
the violation of the court order by Mr Singh's state government, which had
overtly allowed the construction to begin, amid elaborate rituals.
The BJP, which has used the temple issue to become the largest opposition
party at the centre and to wrest power in Uttar Pradesh, accused other
opposition parties of 'playing with the sentiments' of the minority Moslem
community.
Mr Ram Vilas Paswan of the opposition's Janata Dal party, demanded the
resignation of the Narasimha Rao government because it had failed to stop
construction on the disputed site and had therefore 'violated the
constitution'.
MPs earlier yesterday cast votes - all but 14 of the 710 members voted  - in
the tenth presidential elections to choose a successor to Mr Ramaswamy
Venkataraman. Counting will begin on July 16, and a new president named on
July 25.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Jordan dismisses Rabin's offer of regional talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN yesterday dismissed the offer by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime
minister, for talks in Jerusalem or neighbouring Arab capitals, saying there
must first be 'constructive success' in the formal Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations.
The country's chief delegate to the Middle East peace talks said the 'real
issue' was Israel's acceptance of United Nations resolutions calling on
Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories.
Mr Abdel Salam Majali said: 'I cannot see the point of inviting us to go to
Jerusalem before we really see constructive success in the negotiations in
the proper place in which we have all agreed to go to.'
He added: 'Israeli leaders have said this many times but one can see it is
just talk.'
Jordanian officials said King Hussein would maintain his position of
rejecting direct talks with Israel without a settlement on its withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza strip.
Palestinian officials also said they were disappointed by Mr Rabin's offer,
but said they hoped that the offer signalled that Israel might prove more
flexible during the next round of Middle East peace talks.
No immediate reaction was forthcoming from either Lebanon or Syria, but
President Hafez al Assad of Syria has also professed the utmost resistance
to visiting Israel.
The only Arab leader to have made the trip was President Anwar Sadat, the
assassinated Egyptian leader, in a gesture which helped forge peace between
Cairo and Israel, but which ostracised Egypt from the rest of the Arab
world.
Senior Palestinian officials in Amman claimed that despite Mr Rabin's offer
to seek a breakthrough in the peace process, the Israeli premier was
avoiding what they called the 'pre-requisites for peace'.
'Our problem with Rabin is that he wants to sell himself as a peacemaker,
but he has to prove himself with deeds, not words,' said one official.
He said that Palestinian delegation at the peace talks wished to see Israel
first accept in full the Geneva convention, which bans Israel, as an
occupying power, from changing the identity of the West Bank and the Gaza
strip.
The official said that if Mr Rabin wished to be serious about peace he must
show 'genuine readiness' to halt all settlements on the West Bank.

power plant deal

<TEXT>
A TURKISH group yesterday signed a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 886m) deal with the
government of Kazakhstan to construct a power plant, financing the project
by using export revenues from the joint development of a nearby oil field.
United BMB group, a privately-owned Turkish group, and the Kazakh Ministry
of Energy agreed a contract to build a 1350 MW combined cycle power plant at
Aktubinsk in north east Kazakhstan.
Under a countertrade arrangement, the Turks will supply a power plant under
turnkey terms, in exchange for the right to a share of the revenues from the
export of Kazakh oil. The agreement could set the pace for similar deals in
a region rich in resources but in desperate need of infrastructure.
The deal follows a visit by Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister,
to the region earlier this year, and is the first big break for Turkish
groups bidding to do business against competition from western and European
oil companies.
Officials confirmed the area under consideration contained recoverable
reserves of 600m barrels.
Under the deal, the Turkish group will export the oil using one of the
existing or planned pipelines to Europe. Under a production sharing
arrangement, BMB will be able to recover its costs of exploration and
development of the field. Any 'profit oil' which remains once the company's
costs have been deducted is to be used to finance the power plant.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US IMPORTERS and distributors yesterday told an interagency Bush
Administration committee that Dollars 1bn (Pounds 521m) in sanctions
proposed against EC products would cause widespread US job losses and injury
to the US economy.
The prohibitive duties were proposed by Mrs Carla Hills, US trade
representative, in retaliation for the failure of the EC to reform
'adequately' its subsidies programme for oilseeds.
Her office last month released a proposed 'hit list' of imports worth an
estimated Dollars 2bn - which includes wine, cheese, biscuits, gin,
liqueurs, and tobacco.
If the dispute is not settled in compensation talks - to be held in the
General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade through to August 18 - the
Administration has threatened to impose sanctions on Dollars 1bn-worth of
products on the list.
However, officials of companies which have long-established ties with Europe
yesterday made clear that any retaliation against the EC would boomerang.
The impact would be particularly devastating on the wine, beer and spirits
sectors, which are struggling to recover from two big rises in federal
excises taxes in the past seven years as well as new state and local taxes.
Typical of the testimony before the 'Section 301 committee' were the
comments by Mr Fred Meister, president of the Distilled Spirits Council of
the US.
New tariffs on wines and spirits would lead to a Dollars 1.2bn payroll
decline and total loss of 86,000 jobs in the industry, Mr Meister said.
Unemployment compensation would cost Dollars 84m; the gross domestic product
would fall by Dollars 4.9bn; and tax revenues would decline.
If the EC follows up on its threat to counter-retaliate, the US could lose
25 per cent of its total whisky exports.
Mr Gary Riedel, president of the American Soyabean Association, said he
regretted any injury to other industries. 'If we don't come to terms, than
those other industries would have no legitimate degree of certainty that
their rights might not be infringed upon in the future,' he said.
The controversy leaves the Bush Administration in a tough spot. Failure to
act if the dispute is not resolved would receive widespread condemnation by
the farm groups.
Mr Bush has already been warned by Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader,
and a group of other senators that any settlement must benefit the US
soyabean sector. They also insisted that the administration must not accept
any EC proposal which would put tariffs on EC oilseed imports.

FT  14 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Gatt row brews on Mercosur scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW is brewing in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) on how
it should scrutinise Mercosur, the Southern Cone Common Market grouping
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, writes Frances Williams.
Mercosur says its free trade arrangement should be considered under Gatt's
'enabling clause'. This allows preferential trade deals between developing
countries to be simply notified to Gatt's Committee on Trade and
Development, and protects them from challenge by other Gatt members.
But, at today's meeting of the Gatt council, the US will call for a working
party on Mercosur under Article 24 of the General Agreement on free trade
areas and customs unions. It argues that the size and potential importance
of Mercosur, with a population of 200m and an annual GNP of Dollars 500bn
(Pounds 260bn), merits a detailed examination by trading partners to check
its consistency with Gatt rules.
The EC yesterday proposed a compromise under which Mercosur would be
examined by a working party set up by the committee.
Mr Nunes Amorim, Brazil's ambassador to Gatt, said yesterday that Mercosur
members were prepared to provide full information on Mercosur to Gatt
members, and to enter into consultations with any country that felt its Gatt
rights were being impaired.
Mr Rubens Barbosa, a senior trade official from Braslia, said in an
interview that trade between Mercosur members had jumped by over a third
between 1990 and 1991, while Brazil's exports to Mercosur partners had risen
77 per cent.

FT  14 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Little sign of a sanctions dividend -
Exporters in South Africa will have to remain resilient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's renewed descent into political crisis is bad news for
exporters facing the prospect of customers and markets more interested in
the political, rather than the commercial, ramifications of doing business
with the country.
However, if the experience of the sanctions era is anything to go by,
political opprobrium is something South Africa's exporters do not find too
hard. Some is patriotic bluster, to tell the world 'you didn't harm us', but
there is little expectation of an immediate sanctions dividend. Taking
February 1990, when the African National Congress (ANC) was unbanned, as the
start of the post-sanctions era, South Africa's merchandise exports grew by
8.4 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively during 1990 and 1991, whereas
growth was 21-25 per cent in three of the previous four years.
Although South African exports may have done well despite the sanctions, the
figures do not reveal how much better they might have done under normal
circumstances.
The main products affected by sanctions were iron and steel, uranium, coal,
fruit and textiles. Most of these found alternative markets, affecting
prices, not volumes. About 65 per cent of South Africa's exports are
precious and strategic metals - gold, diamonds, platinum, chrome and
vanadium - which were virtually sanctions proof. Gold exports in 1991 were
R19.7bn, or 26 per cent of the total.
Even exporters of non-strategic goods, such as chemicals and steel, were
able to sell all their product during the period. They were not consumer
goods requiring conspicuous marketing, and their bulk form meant, if
necessary, that their origin could be disguised.
A spokesman for Iscor steel producer, which exports close to 50 per cent of
total sales, says that even with US and EC markets closed, it was able to
re-route sales to the Pacific Rim and South America.
The figures also reflect the slowdown in world economic growth over the same
period. Most South African exports are commodities and particularly
vulnerable to such a slowdown being susceptible to both volume and price
weakness.
Finally, they disguise an important upward trend in manufacturing exports,
especially in areas such as transport machinery and equipment. Reserve Bank
figures show that manufactured exports, about 20 per cent of total exports,
grew by an average 25 per cent per annum during the years 1984 to 1990, the
height of the sanctions period. In 1991 they rose by a further 21 per cent.
Initial reasons for this success include the sharp decline of the rand, an
average increase of 5 per cent per annum in world trade over the period
1984-90 and slow domestic growth encouraging producers to look for export
markets.
It also reflects burgeoning trade with the rest of Africa. Johannesburg
bustles with Kenyan and Nigerian businessmen and South Africans themselves
are much more welcome, as a recent trade fair in Kenya testifies.
Mr Bruce Donald, economist at the South African Foreign Trade Organisation
(Safto) says that although only 6-7 per cent of South Africa's total exports
(R75bn in 1991) are to Africa, 20-30 per cent of finished goods are exported
to Africa. The main African export markets are Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland - part of a customs union with South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and
Mozambique.
Continued growth is partly attributable to the success of the General Export
Incentive Scheme (GEIS), introduced in April 1990, which offers more
generous subsidies as products move up the value scale.
The trend in manufactured exports needs to be kept in perspective. Many of
South Africa's manufactured products are uncompetitive because the country
lacks economies of scale and has low labour productivity. For exporters,
this means finding niche markets, or selling to countries where South
African goods can compete.
Unsurprisingly, fruit products and wine, freed of marketing inhibitions,
have probably been the main beneficiaries of the removal of most sanctions.
Likewise, the discount of Dollars 3-Dollars 5 per tonne on South African
coal has largely disappeared, though the depressed state of the market has
overshadowed this benefit.
For commodity exporters the benefits of sanctions going will be felt in
lower distribution costs and in some cases through the removal of a
political discount on their products.
So far, most agree, there has been little direct financial benefit from the
lifting of sanctions. Many companies hope to return to their traditional
markets, but realise this process takes time. Relationships have to be
developed, or renewed, and new entrants, such as Venezuela into the coal
market, make competition fiercer.
The beneficial impact of sanctions being lifted may be evident initially not
so much in higher sales as in increased capital investment. Although current
political uncertainty mitigates against fresh investment, past experience
suggests exports will withstand renewed calls for sanctions.

<TEXT>
MEXICO'S centre-right National Action party (PAN) is set to win the
governorship of Chihuahua state, only the second time that the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has lost a gubernatorial election in
its 63-year history. Voting was quiet and relatively trouble-free.
Last night the official state electoral commission put Mr Francisco Barrio,
the PAN candidate, 15 to 20 percentage points ahead of the PRI with over
half the votes counted. According to the unofficial count of the PAN, which
claimed victory, Mr Barrio's party had an estimated 54 per cent of the vote.
Later, the PRI candidate in the largest and richest state conceded defeat.
However, the PRI appeared to be leading in the weekend's other gubernatorial
election, in the state of Michoacan, where the main opposition was the
left-of-centre Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). The PRI said it was
ahead by about two to one after counting 70 per cent of the votes - an
estimate backed up by early official returns.
In contrast the PRD estimated that it was narrowly ahead after counting
votes at around 20 per cent of the polling booths.
The contending claims could prepare the way for a tense post-electoral
period. The PRD is planning to hold a victory rally today, which may turn
into a demonstration against the government party.
The PRI hopes that a defeat for the PRD in the stronghold of its president,
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, would make it difficult for it to mount an effective
challenge in the 1994 presidential elections. For this reason the PRI
mounted one of the most expensive and sophisticated campaigns in its
history, spending Dollars 33m (Pounds 17.2m) in the state, according to
observer groups' estimates.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Bush still ahead on foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's aura as the victor of Desert Storm and the man who
presided over the western world as the Soviet Union collapsed may have faded
in recent months, yet the Democratic party has not yet succeeded in denting
voters' confidence in his foreign affairs expertise.
A recent Gallup poll carried out for CNN and USA Today showed that 62 per
cent of voters believe that Governor Bill Clinton, the Democrats'
presumptive presidential candidate, would be capable of defending US
interests abroad.
An overwhelming majority, however, still said that Mr Bush would be better
than either Mr Clinton or Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who seems
likely to run as an independent candidate, on foreign affairs  - the only
category in which the president still leads both his challengers.
Mr Clinton has set out to position himself as a serious student of foreign
policy with a series of speeches that have attracted favourable reviews from
Washington pundits.
The Democratic party platform, to be voted on at this week's convention in
New York, continues on the same lines with a generally middle-of-the-road
foreign policy plank, but with several differences from the Bush stance.
Attacking 'the corrosive effect of foreign policies that are rooted in the
past, divorced from our values, fearful of change and unable to meet its
challenges', the platform criticises the Bush administration for its
placatory approach to dictatorships and to regimes which abuse human rights.
Some criticisms may strike home. The recent call by Democrats in the House
of Representatives for the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into
the administration's role in the BNL Iraqi loan fraud seems likely to
maintain the spotlight on Mr Bush's policy errors over President Saddam
Hussein.
Apart from calls for a faster reduction in US forces and a more pro-Israeli
policy in the Middle East, the Democrats differ little from the Republican
administration in their desire for collective security arrangements,
multilateral peacekeeping and free trade.
In accusing Mr Bush of remaining rooted in the Cold war, however, the
Democrats underline their claim that Mr Clinton and his vice-presidential
running mate, Senator Al Gore, are the candidates of generational change.

THE White House yesterday announced that the US would no longer produce
plutonium or highly enriched uranium and that it would seek commitments from
other nuclear powers to halt production of key ingredients of nuclear
weapons, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
The statement, made as the Democratic convention was opening in New York,
was presented as part of a broad initiative to discourage the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
The US has not produced weapons-grade plutonium since 1988 or enriched
uranium since 1964. The US Energy Department said the significance lay in
the fact that it was the first time Washington had made a formal commitment
to ending production of these materials.
Mr Lee Feinstein, deputy director of the Arms Control Association, said the
move was long overdue and would focus on the prevention of production,
rather than elimination of missiles.
The initiative includes a number of proposals to strengthen international
actions against those who contribute to the spread of weapons of mass
destruction and the missiles that deliver them.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Cuban revolutionary in an army green business suit: Castro
is courting capital - not capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a man who built a revolution on the expropriation of foreign capital,
Fidel Castro has been demonstrating a surprising flexibility. Last month the
Cuban leader donned an olive green army suit and blue tie to welcome 125
potential foreign investors, many of them Americans, to dine at the
government palace.
Cuba, he declared, was open to their money. His message has just been
underlined by Cuba's National Assembly. On Sunday it effectively formalised
a growing practice and passed a new constitutional article to allow foreign
investment in state enterprises, to let Cuban companies import and export
without permission from central government, and to recognise foreign
ownership of property in joint ventures.
Mr Castro firmly denies that Cuba, in soliciting foreign investment, is
accepting capitalism. 'Capital and capitalism are not the same,' he insisted
last month. 'Capitalists will not be the owners of our country. The country
will continue to be socialist.'
'Our country', he said, 'knew capitalism before the revolution and does not
have kind memories.'
Underlining this, the new wording of the constitution's Article Three
contains a warning to all those who might dare to challenge Cuba's one-party
communist system. The clause reads: 'Against all those who try to overthrow
the political, social and economic order established by this constitution,
all citizens have the right to fight with any means, including armed
struggle, if other methods are not possible.'
The contradiction at the heart of Cuba's new economic reform is hard to
miss. Castro's plan is for a partially foreign-owned capitalist enclave in
Cuba to rescue a socialist economy from its own shortcomings.
Cuba is looking to foreign investment to provide capital, technology and
management skills at a time when the island is facing a deep economic
recession because of the collapse of its economic lifeline to the former
Soviet bloc.
The obstacles, however, are enormous. The US embargo on trade with, and
investment in, Cuba means the biggest source of money, and the largest
market for Cuban goods, is out of bounds. The success of the capitalist
enclave will depend on an adequate internal market for labour, energy and
raw materials, as well as bureaucratic goodwill, all of which could be
undermined by a weak domestic economy.
The fear that the Communist government will fall, following the collapse of
the Soviet Union, and the public opposition of exiled Cubans to foreign
investment in the island means that only the bravest businessmen will invest
in Cuba, typically expecting their money back in about three years.
Foreign investment is nevertheless one of the few cards Mr Castro has left
to play in order to sustain the economy. This continues to reel from the
disintegration of the eastern bloc, with which Cuba did 85 per cent of its
trade - much at subsidised prices - just three years ago.
The deterioration even since last October is palpable. The value of the peso
on the black market has fallen, from 15 to 33 pesos to the dollar, as fewer
and fewer goods are available at official prices. Black-market prices over
the same period have more than doubled. People face shortages of meat,
chicken, soap, detergent and cooking oil. At almost every corner in Havana
there are long lines of people waiting for food or for extremely infrequent
buses.
On top of that, the US administration has caved in to Florida's extremist
Cuban exiles and agreed to support the Cuban Democracy Act. This act, which
now has a chance of becoming law, would seek to ban the subsidiaries of US
companies from selling to Cuba.
Many of the businessmen on the investors' trip to Cuba were from US
subsidiaries of companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, American Express and
Philip Morris, and trade from all subsidiaries has recently been growing,
doubling between 1988 and 1990 to Dollars 700m (Pounds 366.4m).
Cuba's overtures to foreign investors are undoubtedly bringing in some
money. According to Mr Hector Hernandez, president of the central bank, Cuba
had signed 60 joint ventures with foreign investors by last year, and
another 100 were in the pipeline.
By far the most important are in tourism, with Grupo Sol, the Spanish
developer, leading the way. One-fifth of the 500,000 tourists expected this
year will be staying in hotels that are products of joint ventures.
After tourism, foreign investors have shown interest in mines and textiles.
Twelve Americans stayed on in Havana after the investor trip in an attempt
to clinch deals involving, among others, supplying food in Cuba's airport.
One executive from an international pharmaceuticals company left Havana
impressed by Cuba's biotechnology plant, suggesting that with the right
foreign partner Cuba could successfully penetrate some markets.
The Cuban government hopes that foreign investment will reach Dollars
400m-Dollars 500m a year, but even then it will at most form 2 per cent of
Cuba's estimated gross domestic product, and would not compensate for the
drastic losses caused by the end of subsidised trade with the ex-Soviet
Union. Cuba, for example, will be able to import only 6m barrels of oil this
year, against 13m in 1989.
For political reasons, Mr Castro has rejected moves to stimulate the economy
as China has done, by allowing a free market in agriculture. Cuban officials
say that such a market would create inequalities in income and thus threaten
social peace.
The government is concerned that freeing some sectors of the economy, while
leaving others controlled, would lead to a shift of resources and workers
into free markets, leaving the official sector to fall apart. Last month Mr
Castro warned that farmers caught selling their goods in the black market
would have their land confiscated.
The discontent caused by the worsening economic situation has provoked a
political crackdown, with leading dissidents being imprisoned or harassed.
Foreign journalists who ask Cubans about the current situation risk being
detained or, as happened recently to one, being beaten up.
For Cubans the repression is much worse. 'Rapid reaction brigades' of party
members have pounced on the few dissidents brave enough to display
opposition in public. Mr Raul Castro, defence minister and Fidel's younger
brother, threatened earlier this year to reconvene emergency revolutionary
tribunals - scrapped 20 years ago - to sentence opposition groups guilty of
violence against the state.
Such actions make substantial inflows of foreign investment unlikely for the
present. Many of the Cuban leader's guests last month said they had come to
look for opportunities on the assumption that Mr Castro would soon fall. Mr
Sais Gelrud, a Venezuelan oil engineer, caught their mood: 'This is all a
make-believe. Nothing is going to happen until that man goes.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Spanish inflation rate falls to 6.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S consumer price index was static in June, providing a welcome respite
for the country's hard-pressed economic managers, who are busy preparing a
series of tough measures to clamp down on public spending.
Last month's pause in inflation draws annualised inflation down from 6.5 per
cent to 6.2 per cent. The annual figure has risen as high as 6.9 per cent
this year, after ending 1991 at 5.5 per cent.
Nevertheless, the Finance Ministry said yesterday it was still concerned
that the underlying rate of inflation - which excludes energy and processed
foods prices - had fallen only slightly, to an annualised 6.7 per cent in
June.
The June figures, however, lend weight to the government's arguments that it
is, indeed, capable of slowing inflation despite the fast growth in prices
in the early part of the year. These were due partly to the imposition of
new value added tax charges in January.
Figures published late last week also show that unemployment dropped in June
to 14.5 per cent, the lowest for a year.
Nevertheless the government is likely to adopt measures before the end of
this month to combat a 55 per cent increase in the public-sector deficit in
the first five months of the year and a rise of more than 65 per cent in the
current account deficit.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, seems likely to bring forward a
VAT increase from 13 per cent to 15 per cent planned for next year and to
raise taxes withheld on income, as well as to make sweeping cuts in public
spending budgets not already committed for 1992. He is then likely to
produce a tight 1993 budget in the autumn.

FT  14 JUL 92 / German road users braced for new taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S car-centred, road-ruled society is working itself up into a state
of acute alarm over the prospect of some swingeing new taxes and tolls on
road users - regardless of denials by the government.
Shares of all the large motor manufacturers lost ground on the Frankfurt
stock exchange yesterday, as the rumour mill was kept working by newspaper
and television reports on the impending oil products tax increase, and a
national road toll.
Porsche lost DM14.50 (Pounds 5), Daimler-Benz DM11.50, BMW DM9.50 and VW
DM8.20.
The speculation has been brought to a head by the imminent decision in the
German cabinet on reform of the ailing railway system - the Bundesbahn in
the west and the Reichsbahn in the east - and the need to find an important
new source of finance to pay off its past debts and current losses.
In spite of the insistence by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, his
finance minister, that no new tax increases are planned before the next
election, press speculation is rife that a big increase in the oil products
tax is inevitable.
What is rather more likely is the re-introduction of a road toll, and an
autobahn permit for road users, following the rejection by the European
Court of Justice this year of a first draft to penalise foreign road
hauliers.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, insisted yesterday no proposals
for tax reform were on the agenda for the cabinet meeting tomorrow, when
rail reform plans are due to be decided. He underlined that Mr Gunther
Krause, the minister of transport, was personally opposed to any general oil
tax. That was supposed to scotch speculation about an oil tax increase,
which would put 10 pfennig on the price of a litre of petrol, according to
the mass circulation Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
That would be the equivalent of a 14 per cent rise in the price of the
lowest cost grade of petrol.
Mr Krause is on the record, however, as being in favour of re-introducing
some form of general road toll.
He said in a weekend interview with Der Spiegel, the news magazine, that an
autobahn toll for domestic and foreign lorries would probably be introduced
by 1993, and for cars by around 1995-96.
He said that the annual toll for lorries would cost up to a maximum DM9,000
as was already intended in the original 1990 proposal outlawed by the EC.
Other reports suggest a car tax of between DM200 and DM400.
The question is whether such proposals will come near to meeting the
extraordinary needs of the German Bundesbahn, which is this year expected to
show a loss of around DM11bn, much of it in interest payments on accumulated
debts of around DM45bn. The backlog amounts to twice the Bundesbahn's DM20bn
annual turnover.
The reform plan before the cabinet would turn the railways into an
independent shareholding company, Deutsche Eisenbahn AG, although not with
private shareholders to begin with.
As a result, its accounts would be more transparent, and its staff would
cease to be classified as civil servants.

MR Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, has made clear
he is not seeking a radical decentralisation of EC environmental policy in
the interests of subsidiarity, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
In a letter to Mr Ken Collins, the chairman of the European Parliament's
environment committee, Mr Delors explained that he believed member states
had a role to play in supervising implementation of environmental policy.
Some reports have implied that Mr Delors wants to go further and devolve
responsibility for other elements of environmental policy to member states.
But Mr Delors said in his letter that he thought he had been
'misunderstood'.
'As far as I am concerned, it is not a matter of calling into question the
Commission's right of initiative and Community competence in the
environmental area,' he added.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERB forces yesterday stepped up their offensive throughout Bosnia following
a promise by the Serbian prime minister, Mr Radoman Bozovic, never to cede
'one inch of territory' inhabited by Serbs.
At the same time, General Lewis MacKenzie, United Nations commander in
Sarajevo, warned of the perils faced by international relief flights into
the besieged Bosnian capital after three French aircraft had been hit last
week approaching the airport.
Italian warships taking part in an international naval operation to enforce
UN sanctions against Serbia have meanwhile begun interrogating freighters
entering the Adriatic. Admiral Achille Zanoni, commander of Italian naval
forces in the Adriatic, told reporters of the action as US and European
vessels approached the region to strengthen the patrol.
Despite the international pressure, Mr Radoman Bozovic, Serbia's prime
minister, indicated that his republic would continue to support Bosnia's
Serbs. 'Who has the right to call it aggression when citizens defend their
hearths, their homes and their villages?' he was quoted as saying.
'Serbs in Bosnia would never be forgotten,' he added, vowing that 'Serbia
and the Serb people could not by bought by blackmail or severe economic
sanctions'.
Serb forces continued to fight the mainly Moslem and Croat Bosnian forces
yesterday to try to cut a corridor linking Serb-controlled territories in
Bosnia with Serbia.
Belgrade radio said the Serbian army was within three days of capturing
Odzak, in northern Bosnia. Meanwhile, Serb forces were advancing in
Hercegovina, in the west of the republic, the radio said. Sarajevo radio
said Bosnian forces had launched a counter-offensive around Doboj in the
north.
In eastern Bosnia, houses were aflame and corpses littered the streets of
Gorazde, said Mr Zoran Pirolic, an editor at Sarajevo radio. For nearly four
months Serb forces have surrounded the town where some 30,000 people have
sought refuge from Serb militias seeking to drive Moslems out of eastern
Bosnia.
A mortar bombardment shook the headquarters of the UN force in Sarajevo
yesterday and the UN said the blasts killed one teenager and wounded at
least four in the street outside.
Thirteen mortar bombs landed outside the headquarters within four minutes,
the worst bombardment of the area since fighting flared in the Bosnian
capital last April. The UN Security Council yesterday approved despatch of
500 more peacekeepers for humanitarian aid work in Sarajevo, AP reports from
New York. The 15-member council unanimously approved a resolution endorsing
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali's request for 500 more troops -
beyond the 1,100 already requested and approved for Sarajevo relief
operations.
The peacekeepers are to operate the airport for relief airlifts, help
deliver aid and secure the heavy artillery of combatants around the airport.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Britain fails to restart EC's revenue debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S efforts to restart discussions from scratch on plans to increase
European Community revenue by nearly a third were rebuffed by its partners
yesterday.
Nevertheless, richer member states like Germany, which contributes most in
net terms to the EC budget, agreed with the substance of British misgivings
about the size of the rise sought by the European Commission.
Finance ministers of the 12, gathered at the first EC council meeting of the
British presidency, said the so-called 'Delors II' package negotiations
should build on the limited agreements reached at last month's Lisbon
summit.
Though the question of when and if the EC revenue base should be raised
remains open, a majority of ministers agreed that increases in Community
spending should not be tied arithmetically to levels of national public
spending, constrained as they are by slow economic growth and the tight
financial convergence targets for economic and monetary union later in the
decade.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, had sent a presidency letter and an
80-item questionnaire to his colleagues, implying EC spending should be tied
to national expenditure increases, and calling into question the need for an
increase in the revenue ceiling. Negotiations under the preceding Portuguese
presidency were dismissed as 'useful preparatory work'.
The Commission wants to raise the revenue base from a current 1.2 per cent
of EC gross national product to 1.37 per cent by 1997. This would increase
the budget from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.6bn) now to Ecu87.5bn in 1997 in
today's money. Half the increase would go to Spain, Portugal, Ireland and
Greece as part of the EC's 'cohesion' effort to help them catch up with
their partners' living standards and sharpen their competitive edge.
This level of increase is considered by these four states as pledged by the
Maastricht treaty. Cohesion, however, proved the most divisive issue of the
Lisbon summit. It nevertheless decided that the small 'Cohesion Fund' for
the four poorest states, created by Maastricht, could start early next year.
This would amount to less than a tenth of the fiscal transfers sought by the
Commission.
The UK questionnaire was virtually ignored by ministers. Mr Michel Sapin,
the French finance minister, congratulated the 'presidency's epistolary
imagination and zeal', before making clear that there could be no question
of further discussion on lowering the existing ceiling on farm spending,
ratified in Lisbon.
Mr Horst Kohler, the number two in Bonn's Finance Ministry, asked
tongue-in-cheek whether there could be a 'supplementary question' in the
presidency document on Britain's contested budget rebate - ignored by the
questionnaire.
Mr Lamont said he 'wouldn't dwell on' the rebate issue - as president of the
Council - but that 'the UK's position has always been clear'.
Britain refuses to countenance any change in the refund Mrs Margaret
Thatcher won in 1985, since when Pounds 12.5bn (Dollars 24bn) has been
returned to the UK.
Mr Jacques Delors said the Commission would bring forward proposals on the
Cohesion Fund and the UK rebate, either at tomorrow's or next week's
Commission meeting.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Carrington says his peace role continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor, and JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe
Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD CARRINGTON, the British chairman of the European Community's peace
conference on Yugoslavia, yesterday denied reports that he intended to
resign from his post.
The reports had been fuelled both by a declaration adopted by last week's
Group of Seven summit, suggesting that a broader international peace
conference might be desirable, and a statement last Sunday by Sir John Nott,
a former British defence secretary, that Lord Carrington's mission had
outlived its usefulness.
'I was asked by the European Community whether I would do this and I don't
think you give up because things have gone very badly, unless those who
appointed you want to,' Lord Carrington said. If the EC peace mission were
to be wound up and the whole process were to start again under the United
Nations or another authority, it would not make any difference, he added.
'The problem is that they (the warring parties in Bosnia and other parts of
the former Yugoslavia) do not want peace at the moment,' he said. Lord
Carrington has nevertheless invited leaders of the various factions to a
meeting in London tomorrow.
The heads of the G7 industrial nations and those of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) who met in Helsinki shortly
afterwards fully supported the EC conference as the right framework for
reaching a durable political solution in the former Yugoslavia.
However, their statement on the subject clearly hinted at growing
dissatisfaction with the EC forum.
France has been particularly active in canvassing an international peace
conference, to the irritation of the British government, which has remained
loyal to Lord Carrington's mission.
Sir John Nott added grist to the mill when he said that a single country
such as the US or France, with its historical links with the region, or
possibly the United Nations, would do better at brokering peace
negotiations, when the time was ripe. There is little consensus about the
usefulness of the Community peace conference among the governments of the
republics of the former Yugoslavia.

THE TRIBUNAL of inquiry into allegations of fraud, malpractice and political

September 2, pending the outcome of an appeal to the Dublin supreme court.
The appeal is being taken by Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney general,

scheme.
Mr Liam Hamilton, the tribunal's chairman, said yesterday it was 'unable to

The supreme court gave Mr Whelehan and lawyers for the tribunal seven days

FT  14 JUL 92 / Rabin asks Arab leaders for talks in Israel: Israeli premier
says he is ready to visit Mideast capitals in search for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK RABIN, the new Israeli prime minister, yesterday said he was
willing to fly to the capitals of neighbouring Arab states in the search for
Middle East peace. He also invited their leaders to Jerusalem.
His initiative was welcomed in Washington but treated sceptically in the
Arab world. President George Bush said he had invited Mr Rabin to the US
next month and would send Mr James Baker, secretary of state, to Israel and
its neighbours next week to spur along the peace process.
In his opening speech to the Israeli parliament, Mr Rabin said: 'In the
service of peace, I am prepared to travel to Amman, Damascus and Beirut,
today, tomorrow. For there is no greater victory than the victory of peace.'
He invited a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to Jerusalem for
informal talks and suggested that King Hussein of Jordan and the presidents
of Syria and Lebanon address Israel's parliament.
But his invitations were in large measure rhetorical flourishes which are
likely to be turned down by the Arabs. The Jordanian government last night
dismissed the invitation to Jerusalem as 'just talk'.
The Palestinians are wary of Mr Rabin, and Arab leaders will want to
continue the peace talks on neutral ground, in Rome, within the next two
months.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, a leading member of the Palestinian negotiating team,
said Mr Rabin's speech 'had important points and signals a willingness to
deal with issues seriously'. But she added: 'We need concrete proof of the
seriousness of their intent.'
In contrast to the uncompromising attitude of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his
predecessor, Mr Rabin called on Israelis to recognise that the world had
undergone profound changes which presented opportunities for peace.
'We must overcome the sense of isolation that has held us in its thrall for
almost half a century,' he said. 'We must join the international movement
toward peace, reconciliation and co-operation that is spreading over the
entire globe these days - lest we be the last to remain, all alone, in the
station.'
Mr Rabin, leader of the Labour party, which won last month's general
election, was presenting to parliament his three-party coalition, which
succeeds the two-year-old government led by Mr Shamir's Likud party.
Labour has been joined in government by Meretz, an alliance of pro-peace
groups, and Shas, an ultra-orthodox religious party, and is also supported
by two Arab parties. The coalition won approval in parliament with a
comfortable majority of 67-53.
The new prime minister, resuming a post he last held in 1977, reiterated the
coalition's commitment to accelerate the regional peace talks launched last
October in Madrid.
He urged the Palestinians to accept an interim period of self-rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, followed by talks on a final settlement.
'You will not get everything you want. Neither will we,' he said. 'Don't
lose this opportunity that may never return. Take our proposal seriously -
to avoid further suffering, humiliation and grief.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Pound falls to post-poll low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND fell yesterday to its lowest level against the D-Mark since the
day before the general election amid growing expectations that the German
Bundesbank would tighten monetary policy this week.
International investors ignored a strong statement by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, ruling out a devaluation of the pound, selling sterling in
large quantities and buying D-Marks.
The government insisted it would hold sterling's position against the D-Mark
in the European exchange rate mechanism even if other European governments
forced a realignment. But it could not halt a sharp fall in sterling's
value.
The foreign exchange markets were unmoved by Mr Major's promise to bring
down UK inflation 'to nil if possible'.
Instead they bid the D-Mark higher against most leading currencies following
reports that this week's meeting of the Bundesbank council was likely to act
to curb the strong growth in German money supply.
Sterling fell two pfennigs to DM2.8525 in London before dipping in late
trading to DM2.8489, a level last seen on April 8 when the market was
troubled at the prospect of a Labour victory in the general election. The
German currency gained against the dollar, which dropped 1.75 pfennigs to
DM1.478, and hit a 15-month high against the Japanese yen. In New York, the
pound closed at DM2.84 and Dollars 1.9295.
Unmoved by criticism from some Tory backbenchers, Mr Major said: 'It is
absolutely imperative that we do not duck the necessity of bringing
inflation down to a level below that of our competitors, as low as we can
get - to nil if possible - and seek to keep it there.'
The ERM, he added, provided the cornerstone of that policy.
Further cuts in rates would be linked to holding sterling's parity.
'When it is appropriate we reduce interest rates,' he said. 'It has to be
when it's appropriate - when we can sustain the exchange value of sterling
and still reduce interest rates.'
His remarks were later expanded by Downing Street to emphasise that the
prime minister regarded sterling's present central rate of DM2.95 as
non-negotiable.
Officials made clear that if other governments wanted to devalue against the
German currency, Mr Major would insist that the pound was held at DM2.95.
Speculation about a general realignment has been fuelled by intervention to
support the Italian lira. There are signs that the Bundesbank would regard a
realignment as an appropriate move for ERM countries that thought they were
suffering from German monetary policy.
But with France adamantly opposed to any devaluation of the franc, Britain
sees little prospect of a general realignment. In Brussels, Mr Piero
Barucci, Italy's new finance minister, said there was 'no consideration' of
devaluing the Italian lira.
EC economics and finance ministers, in Brussels for one of their regular
council meetings, expressed concern about Europe's high interest rates but
conceded that the level of rates was effectively in the hands of the
Bundesbank.
Members of the Bundesbank council will discuss on Thursday whether to raise
the German discount rate from 8 per cent or to limit the ability of
commercial banks to borrow from the German central bank against collateral
at the Lombard rate. Ministers in Brussels appeared to believe the
Bundesbank would not raise rates this week.
In a letter to The Times today, six leading monetarist economists, including
Lady Thatcher's former personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, warn of
'the serious risk that the present slump . . . will be deepened and
prolonged well into 1993 and beyond'. They criticise Mr Lamont's defence of
the ERM as 'brave but misguided'.
The six argue: 'Leaving the ERM for a properly constructed regime of
money-supply targets would certainly permit interest rates to drop
substantially below German rates. . . The pound would perforce fall, and
rightly so.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / OFT chief hints at action to regulate CD prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Bryan Carsberg, the newly appointed director-general of fair trading,
has raised the possibility of instituting regulatory action over the high
price of compact discs just three months after his predecessor rejected the
idea.
In a letter last week addressed to Mr Nigel Griffiths, a Labour frontbench
consumer affairs spokesman, Sir Bryan said he wanted to 'review the evidence
personally' before deciding on whether a case 'exists for additional work
and perhaps formal regulatory action'.
Mr Griffiths wrote to Sir Bryan last month requesting a new inquiry, saying
the investigation by Sir Gordon Borrie, the previous director-general, had
left consumers feeling dissatisfied.
Sir Gordon said at the beginning of April that an inquiry by the Office of
Fair Trading had found no evidence of collusion between record companies and
retailers.
Compact discs were more expensive than cassette tapes and vinyl records and
this could not be explained by differences in production costs, Sir Gordon
said.
He made clear, however, that CD prices were high because consumers were
willing to pay more for them. 'In other words, the prices of CDs have
settled around a level which, on the whole, the market appears willing to
bear.'
He added: 'There appears to be no action the office could take to stimulate
a sharper degree of price competition than our inquiries now suggest
prevails, however beneficial such competition might be to consumers.'
In his letter to Mr Griffiths, Sir Bryan, who took up his post last month,
says: 'There are some indications that the price of compact discs is higher
than it should be but the evidence so far is not clear-cut, and the
identification of causes of excessive prices, in the structure of the
industry, is difficult.'
The OFT said yesterday that Sir Bryan would examine the evidence already
collected before deciding whether further investigations should be carried
out.

FT  14 JUL 92 / IBM, Toshiba and Siemens in Dollars 1bn semiconductor deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE, STEVEN BUTLER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TOKYO, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines of the US, Toshiba of Japan and Siemens of
Germany are to develop advanced computer memory chips for the 21st century
in a joint project worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m).
The companies will develop 256 megabit dynamic random access memory chips,
two generations ahead of the highest capacity 16 megabit chips available
today.
The international alliance reflects a broad trend throughout the
semiconductor industry as costs of research, development and chip
manufacturing rise.
Separately, yesterday, Adva-nced Micro Devices, a Silicon Valley chipmaker,
announced plans for a joint venture with Fujitsu of Japan to manufacture
'flash' memory chips, devices that may eventually replace disc drives in
personal computers.
The IBM, Toshiba, Siemens alliance is, however, the largest of its kind to
date. It brings together three technology leaders that already have
well-established relationships and raises the prospect of a broad reshaping
of the Dollars 7bn global market for D-Rams, data storage devices that are
used in all types of computer equipment. Japanese and South Korean
manufacturers dominate at present.
However, IBM , which manufactures chips primarily for use in its own
computer products, is also believed by the industry to be one of the world's
largest D-Ram producers and has recently announced moves to enter the
merchant semiconductor market.
Siemens, which is Europe's only high-volume D-Ram manufacturer, is not
currently expected to expand its involvement in the memory chip market as a
result of the agreement. The German group said its interest was twofold;
development and manufacture of D-Rams and also future use of the technology
needed for 256 megabit D-Ram production to fabricate other types of
semiconductor chips.
Siemens recently announced it had cancelled plans for a D-Ram plant to make
64 megabit D-Rams in Germany.
Although the 256 megabit venture covers only research and development, an
IBM executive said that joint manufacturing might follow.
In contrast, the agreement between Japan's Fujitsu and Advanced Micro
Devices of the US is geared towards joint manufacturing.
The companies have agreed to set up a Dollars 700m joint venture in Japan to
produce flash memory chips. Each company will purchase a small equity stake
in the other.
The deals announced yesterday are the most far-reaching in a series of
cross-border semiconductor technology-sharing and development agreements
drawn up in recent months.
Mr WJ Sanders, chairman of AMD, said joining forces with Fujitsu would allow
AMD to save development and investment costs and turn a potential competitor
into a partner.
Partners thank each other for the memory, Page 17

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (12): Tempting carrot
for invaders - The Japanese 'spend' on components in Europe will be Pounds
3bn by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAZDA, Japan's fourth largest car maker, is preparing to announce before the
end of this year precisely how and where it will begin car manufacturing in
Europe.
It will be the seventh - and probably the last - Japanese vehicle maker to
do so, joining Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, Suzuki and Isuzu.
The combined production volumes involved represent important business to
those European component makers who have already secured contracts or are
competing for the newer projects.
Toyota is to start production of Carina saloons at its Pounds 700m Burnaston
plant in the UK in December, with engines supplied from a Pounds 140m
manufacturing facility in Deeside, north Wales. Burnaston is due to produce
200,000 cars a year by the mid-1990s. By then, EC content should be more
than 80 per cent, compared with 60 per cent next year. Many industry
observers, pointing to a precedent being set by Nissan, expect Toyota's
output to be nearer 400,000 by the end of the decade;
Nissan, whose plant at Sunderland is preparing to build a new version of its
Micra small car as well as the Primera range, this year unexpectedly
announced an expansion of its 220,000 capacity to 300,000 from next year. It
has already hinted that output will be 400,000 a year by the end of the
decade. Significant developments are also afoot at Nissan Motor Iberica,
Nissan's Spanish manufacturing centre, where a new 'multi-passenger vehicle'
(MPV), the Serena, is starting production alongside Nissan's Patrol
four-wheel-drive vehicle. Yet another 4wd leisure vehicle, developed jointly
with Ford, is also to be produced at the plant.
By late autumn, Honda's plant at Swindon, Wiltshire, will have gone on
stream alongside its engine plant which already produces more than 100,000
engines a year. Swindon is to produce the Synchro medium saloon at an
initial rate of 50,000 a year, to be joined by the successor to the smaller
Concerto from 1995. Motor industry analyst Professor Garel Rhys, of Cardiff
Business School, believes that Honda will be producing double its declared
target of 100,000 cars a year by well before the end of the decade.
Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's third biggest producer, has created a joint
venture with the Dutch government and Sweden's Volvo to produce 200,000 cars
a year in the Netherlands by the late 1990s.
Suzuki's European manufacturing operations are in Spain, where it builds
more than 20,000 SJ and Vitara 4wd leisure vehicles a year. However, it is
also setting up a joint venture plant to build its Swift range of small cars
in Hungary, with the long-term goal of 100,000 units a year.
Not least, IBC Vehicles, a UK-based joint venture between Isuzu and General
Motors, is producing light commercial vehicles and the Frontera, a leisure
4wd, with a capacity of 100,000 vehicles a year.
Nissan's expansion in the UK will lead to component purchases from European
suppliers jumping from Pounds 600m last year to Pounds 850m in 1993,
according to Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing
(UK). Of this, some Pounds 655m will be spent with 122 UK component
suppliers or UK subsidiaries of foreign-owned groups, including a handful of
Japanese joint venture concerns.
However, that leaves nearly Pounds 200m worth of business being placed
directly with Continental suppliers.
Suppliers from 11 countries have contracts with the Toyota manufacturing
operation, which embraces nearly 170 component makers - whittled down from
an original list of 1,850 applicants. More than half of them are based in
the UK. Toyota's declared annual spending with European suppliers will be
Pounds 700m in full production - but, like Nissan, is likely to move nearer
the Pounds 1bn mark on a 400,000 production level.
Honda has appointed 136 European and two US suppliers for its Pounds 300m
Swindon plant. The 89 UK-based suppliers include most of the industry's
biggest names, including BBA's Automotive Products division supplying clutch
assemblies and Lucas Automotive parts ranging from brake systems to wiring
harnesses. Honda has indicated that spending with European suppliers will be
Pounds 500m annually at the 100,000 cars-a-year level, but has also
indicated an eventual increase to Pounds 600m-Pounds 800m a year.
When all Continent manufacturing activities are included, it is likely that
the Japanese component 'spend' in Europe by the end of the decade will be
approaching Pounds 3bn. Surely a large enough carrot to entice Japanese
component suppliers in waves?
Nevertheless, Mr Yukihisa Hirano, Toyota managing director, has explicitly
rejected the notion that, over the long term, Japanese component companies
will move in to take more of the business, declaring that 'Toyota has never
asked any Japanese companies to set up in Europe'.
Indeed, according to a study of the European components industry by the
Economist Intelligence Unit published earlier this year, Japan's car makers
are specifically discouraging Japanese suppliers setting up shop 'as a
matter of policy'.
In opting for European suppliers, Japan's car makers have no intention of
settling for second best and have already proved relentless in their pursuit
of cost-cutting.
Nevertheless, the symbiotic manner in which, so far at least, they are
conducting it with their European suppliers is earning them growing, if
sometimes grudging, respect and sympathy within the components industry.
Indeed, some component group chiefs have begun to imply that indigenous
European car makers could do well to follow the Japanese approach more
closely.
Senior industry figures like Valeo's chairman, Mr Noel Goutard, and Robert
Bosch chief executive Mr Marcus Bierich, are among those protesting that too
many European car makers are paying ready lip service to the concept of
partnership between themselves and their suppliers, but in practice still
placing an excessive financial squeeze on their suppliers.
This contrasts with the undisguised enthusiasm some groups are displaying
towards the development of their Japanese 'transplant'-based business, and
the knock-on effect it is having in terms of improved productivity and
quality throughout their other business activities.
For example, the Unipart Group of Companies (UGC), the former components and
accessories division of the UK's Rover Group, is moving rapidly towards the
wholesale adoption of Japanese working practices and attitudes across all
divisions of the 4,000-employee company.
UGC increased its profits last year in the teeth of one of the most severe
UK recessions in history, and chief executive Mr John Neill depicts his
Japanese customer as tough but fair on pricing.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (13): Ready to supply
transplants - Profile of Nippondenso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Japanese automotive components makers are moving with far greater
caution to follow the country's vehicle makers into Europe than they did
into North America, some of the Japanese industry's leading players are
already establishing a substantial presence.
This month Nippondenso, Japan's biggest automotive components maker,
beginsproduction of air conditioners and heaters at its Pounds 65m UK plant
at Telford, Shropshire.
Production of ignition coils began at its Spanish plant in Barcelona last
year, while in September volume output will begin in the UK on a new
250,000-a-year radiator assembly line. The facility has been built with an
investment of around Pounds 16m at ND Marston, the former IMI Radiators
business, acquired by the Japanese group for Pounds 25m in 1989.
Nippondenso has established an important joint venture relationship in
Europe with Magneti Marelli, Fiat's 66.5 per cent-owned automotive
components subsidiary. The Italian company has taken a 25 per cent stake in
NDM Manufacturing, the Telford air conditioner and heater plant, and in ND
Marston. In return, Nippondenso has acquired a 25 per cent holding in the
Magneti Marelli Italian-based subsidiary Borletti Climatizzazione.
Nippondenso's latest move in Europe was to reach agreement last month with
the Champion spark plug division of Cooper Industries of the US to expand
the two companies' existing North American production link to Europe.
Champion Spark Plug Europe in Belgium will begin producing conventional
spark plugs designed by Nippondenso from August. The Japanese group will
supply some of the materials and will market the finished products under its
own brand name. Champion is expected to produce around 8m units a year for
sale by Nippondenso in Europe.
The build-up of Nippondenso manufacturing facilities in Europe coincides
explicitly with the development of Japanese-owned car production. When
Toyota and Honda, the Japanese car makers, begin production at their UK
assembly plants later this year, they will be the two main customers for
Nippondenso's UK-based air conditioner and heater plant.
Mr Michio Ohiwa, managing director of Nippondenso International (UK), the
holding company for the group's European manufacturing operations, says
Nippondenso had a turnover in Europe of around Pounds 170m in 1991 based
largely on imports from Japan.
By 1995/96 - when both the Toyota and Honda car plants should be reaching
their outlined capacities of 200,000 and 100,000 cars a year respectively -
Mr Ohiwa forecasts the company's turnover in Europe should have tripled to
more than Pounds 450m a year, of which local production could be around 50
per cent.
The local content of the UK-produced air conditioners and heaters is
expected to start at around 60 per cent (based on operating costs) rising to
75 per cent as volumes increase.
Mr Ohiwa acknowledges it is proving difficult to develop a new customer base
in Europe. Nippondenso has based its long-term European strategy, however,
on deriving half of its sales from the Japanese transplants and half from
the traditional European car makers (including Ford and GM).
Nippondenso has strong backing for its international expansion. It is firmly
anchored in the sphere of Toyota, financially probably the strongest of the
world's car makers, which holds a 23.3 per cent stake in the company.
Toyota, Japan's largest and the world's third largest vehicle maker, is
Nippondenso's biggest customer, accounting for around 50 per cent of its
turnover.
The company's main strengths are in car heaters and air conditioners, which
in 1990 accounted for 35.3 per cent of consolidated group sales of
Y1,511.6bn (Pounds 6.4bn), and in electrical automotive and electronic
control products which contributed 30.4 per cent of group sales. Fuel
management systems accounted for a further 15.2 per cent of sales and
radiators for 5.8 per cent. (Net profit peaked at Y63.1bn (Dollars 497m) in
1990, but pre-tax profits fell by around 25 per cent last year.)
The share of net sales accounted for by car heaters and air conditioners has
gradually fallen since the mid-1980s, as advances in electronics have led to
a growing importance for fuel management products such as electronic fuel
injection systems.
Nippondenso dominates its domestic Japanese market capturing more than 40
per cent of many of the product segments in which it manufactures including
55 per cent of radiators, 51 per cent of air conditioners and 52 per cent of
electronic fuel injection systems.
At the same time it claims world market leadership for 11 of its product
lines, including starters and alternators, radiators, car heaters and
air-conditioning compressors, and windscreen washers.
It is in second place in car air conditioners behind Harrison Radiators (a
subsidiary of General Motors), in windscreen wipers, and fuel pumps and
injectors for electronic fuel injection systems behind Robert Bosch of
Germany, and in ignition systems behind Delco (a GM subsidiary).
While Nippondenso's investment in manufacturing facilities in the US began
in earnest in the mid-1980s - within two to three around 60 per cent of its
North American sales will be derived from the local Japanese car plants and
40 per cent from the big three US car makers, GM , Ford and Chrysler - its
incursion into Europe began in 1989.
The first step was the announcement of an intended 50:50 joint venture in
Spain for distributorless ignition coils with Valeo, the leading French
automotive components maker. This was followed later that year by the
acquisition of IMI Radiators, now re-named as ND Marston. In 1990, it
disclosed plans for the Pounds 65m investment in the Telford air conditioner
and radiator plant.
The Telford plant is expected to have a workforce of more than 450 by 1995
when output is intended to reach 400,000 air conditioners and the same
number of heaters a year. ND Marston has a workforce of around 1,000
producing mainly radiators and oil coolers, while the workforce at the
Spanish ignition coil plant is expected to grow from 70 to 150-200 at full
production.
Nippondenso has tried all the obvious routes in Europe for foreign
expansion: investment in a green field site with the Telford plant,
acquisition with IMI Radiators, joint venture with Valeo in Spain and
contract manufacturing with Champion.
According to Mr Ohiwa the most favoured route remains the joint venture.
The joint venture with Valeo in Spain ended prematurely last year, even
before volume production began, because of Valeo's decision to pull out of
the ignition sector with the sale of its operations to Sagem, the French
electronics and defence group. The Spanish venture is now a wholly-owned
Nippondenso subsidiary.
Equally, the original takeover of IMI Radiators was dictated more by force
of circumstances than design. Nippondenso was well into negotiations about a
production agreement with IMI Radiators, when it was shocked to learn the
company was for sale, and for sale by auction, an unusual business approach
for Japanese. IMI Radiators was its first significant takeover worldwide.
The subsequent burgeoning of its relationship with Magneti Marelli allowed
it to get back on the favoured joint venture track, however, by bringing in
the Italian company as a minority partner.
Mr Ohiwa insists that Nippondenso is concerned not to create overcapacity in
its market sectors in Europe, and that joint ventures offer the best way of
establishing local production with the least disruption.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (10): Pressure tells
as anger mounts - Japanese debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE few more contentious trade issues between the US and Japan than
automobiles and automobile parts - a fact underlined by the industry's
strong presence on President Bush's controversial visit to Tokyo at the
start of this year, when he put pressure on Japan to buy more US vehicles
and parts.
The concern is hardly surprising, since the auto parts industry is the
largest manufacturing sector in the US, with sales of around Dollars 100bn,
and the automobile sector accounts for three quarters of the US trade
deficit with Japan.
The Bush visit was only one manifestation of a growing anger in the US over
this imbalance, and there are signs that Japanese automobile manufacturers
are beginning to respond to the pressures, showing a greater willingness to
consider buying parts from US suppliers.
A key question now is whether these gestures will lead to a significant
increase in actual purchases.
The pressures on the Japanese are taking several forms. In Congress, for
example, a trade bill was introduced in May, supported by Ford Motor and
Chrysler, which would have limited the sale of Japanese cars in the US -
both imported vehicles and those made at Japanese 'transplant' factories in
the US - to 1992 levels unless sales of American vehicles in Japan
increased. However, early in June these Draconian provisions were dropped
from the legislation.
Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce has found Japanese manufacturers of
mini-vans guilty of underpricing their vehicles in the US market; and the US
Customs Service has ruled that vehicles made by Honda in Canada do not have
a 50 per cent North American content, and that the company owes Dollars
16.5m in import duties.
These political pressures help explain why during President Bush's January
visit Japanese manufacturers agreed to increase purchases of US automobile
parts and help Detroit's Big Three sell more cars in their country.
A second meeting to discuss the issues was held by the Japanese companies
and their American counterparts in Chicago in May.
During the January meeting the Japanese agreed to increase purchases of US
parts to Dollars 19bn in 1994, from Dollars 10bn in 1991 and from a mere
Dollars 2.5bn five years ago. However, there has been confusion since then
over whether these totals were commitments, or merely targets.
Nevertheless, in a report to President Bush last spring Mr Jack Reilly,
chairman of Tenneco Automotive and head of an industry council, noted that a
straw poll of manufacturers showed increased Japanese interest in buying US
parts.
However, the main beneficiaries of such a move may well turn out to be the
US subsidiaries of Japanese parts manufacturers, whose products count as 'US
content', rather than their American-owned rivals.
Around 400 Japanese parts manufacturers have followed the Japanese
assemblers to the US, and American parts makers suspect them of bringing
with them the keiretsu system, involving extended families of companies
linked by cross shareholdings which prevent outsiders from getting business.
However, the Japanese industry says that the main stumbling block for US
parts suppliers has been an inability to compete on grounds of cost and
quality.
Mr Reilly replies that the US industry is more efficient than that of Japan
and adds: 'It is incredibly difficult to believe that the world's largest
parts supply base is competitive on cost and quality only on 16 per cent of
the transplant business.'
Whatever the truth, the Dollars 19bn figure is largely predicated on
increased production from Japan's US transplant factories, and that may well
eat further into the domestic market share of the Big Three, which use parts
made by US-owned companies much more extensively than their Japanese
transplant rivals. In other words, the US parts manufacturers might gain
Japanese sales, but lose more than that in sales to their traditional
American customers.
Nevertheless, the Japanese transplants are buying relatively more from
suppliers in the US (be they Japanese- or American-owned). Government
figures show that in 1991 the transplants bought Dollars 1.54 of US parts
for every Dollars 1 of parts they imported, up from Dollars 1.04 of US parts
in 1989.
Furthermore, the transplants have been putting considerable sums into US
design and development centres which will eventually generate demands for
purely American parts to go into vehicles aimed at the local market.
However, one US measure - the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) law -
actually discourages Japanese transplants from buying US parts. The law,
passed in 1975, mandates fuel efficiency levels for vehicles. When it was
going through Congress the United Auto Workers Union, fearing a flood of
imported fuel-efficient small cars which might cost jobs, pressured
lawmakers into forbidding companies to average the fuel economies of their
domestic (75 per cent local content) and imported cars.
The result is that several Japanese manufacturers are deliberately keeping
their US domestic content below 75 per cent so these fuel efficient vehicles
can be classified as imported for CAFE purposes, and thus offset the worse
fuel efficiency of their imported luxury models.
Industry pressure groups are calling for the CAFE rules to be amended to get
rid of this anomaly as part of the negotiations over a North American Free
Trade Area.
Precisely what constitutes an 'American-made' vehicle is also open to
endless debate. For example, the Transportation Department, which oversees
the CAFE rules, says that marketing costs can be included in domestic
content. However, the customs service, which recently ruled against Honda,
will not allow this in its definition, which is based largely on the origin
of the car's parts.
All this throws up some bizarre anomalies. For example, under the CAFE rules
Ford's Mexican-assembled Mercury Tracer is classified as domestic, while the
Cadillac Allante, built in Michigan, but with an Italian body, is an import.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (8): Buying policies
overhauled - Challenges mount as US vehicle makers face stiff competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE challenges facing the US automobile components industry were graphically
underlined recently when General Motors summoned some 600 of its suppliers
to a meeting in Michigan and spelt out a radical new approach to its
purchasing policies.
GM's new approach should mean significant sales opportunities for the
strongest, most efficient and most global components companies, but it is
also likely to drive smaller, weaker operations out of business.
It is therefore likely to accelerate the consolidation that has already been
taking place in the US parts industry over the past decade as companies have
come to grips with global competition, a growing Japanese presence in the US
market, profound changes in the way vehicles are made, and a severe North
American recession.
The recession has meant a sharp drop in US car and light truck sales - from
13.89m units in 1990 to 12.33m in 1991 - and this year is expected to
produce only modest recovery.
The Big Three automobile assemblers plunged heavily into the red in 1991.
Their components suppliers, thanks to rationalisation measures which cut
100,000 jobs from the industry in the 1980s, suffered less severely,
although many saw a sharp drop in profits, due to lack of demand and pricing
pressures from Detroit.
For example, GM saved Dollars 2bn in 1991 by demanding that suppliers cut
prices over three years - by 3 per cent in the first 12 months, then by 2
per cent in the next 12 and another 2 per cent in the final year.
Just as the industry starts to emerge from recession, GM is now asking for
more price concessions, under the new purchasing policy spelled out at the
Michigan meeting by Mr Ignacio Lopez.
Mr Lopez, who helped turn around GM Europe in the 1980s through his
innovative purchasing policies, has been given the task of doing the same in
North America, following April's coup by GM directors dissatisfied with the
pace of change inside the business.
According to the unhappy suppliers, Mr Lopez has asked them to rebid on
contracts they had already won for the 1993 model year and there are
suggestions GM will no longer provide up-front money for the tooling
suppliers need to make their components.
More positively for the supply industry, Mr Lopez also said that GM's own
huge, cossetted parts operations would henceforth have to compete for
contracts with outside, non-union shops. And he offered GM's help in cutting
suppliers' costs through a sharing of expertise and he held out the carrot,
for successful suppliers, of selling products to GM worldwide under
long-term contracts.
For the most efficient suppliers, the overall effect should be positive.
'The GM move has been heartening to the independent side of the business as
a whole,' says Mr Greg Macosko, an analyst in New York with Quest Advisory.
'It sees a real opportunity out there.'
The trend to global sourcing, and the use of fewer suppliers, linked closely
with the vehicle assembler in a long-term relationship, is hardly unique to
GM. It has long been common among Japanese manufacturers as a way of cutting
costs and increasing quality and has been adopted increasingly by assemblers
in North America and Europe.
The establishment by Japanese assemblers of plants in North America during
the 1980s, and their heavy reliance on US subsidiaries of Japanese parts
manufacturers, was a big setback to US-owned suppliers as the Japanese took
an ever increasing share of the US vehicle market.
However, several factors may now slightly ameliorate, though not remove,
this threat. First, statistics for the past few months suggest that Japanese
assemblers are finding it more difficult to gain market share. Second, there
are increasing political pressures for them to buy parts from American-owned
companies. Third, they seem a little more willing to 'buy American' from
companies which have convinced them of the quality of their products.
However, the opportunities for US suppliers making significant inroads in
this area seem limited. At the same time, the 400 or so Japanese parts
manufacturers which have set up in the US, and are often losing money in
supplying their compatriots, may try to bid aggressively for business from
Detroit.
An increasing number of the Japanese parts suppliers have set up joint
venture operations in North America with US companies, with the aim of
serving the Japanese and American assemblers.
Mr Macosko believes that over the long term many of the American companies
participating in these operations may simply lose their independent identity
and be absorbed into the joint ventures.
Most the the strongest US components suppliers have long had a substantial
presence in the European market, but most of them are now seeking to
reinforce this, through acquisitions and green-field investments, in
fast-growing sectors.
For example, Cleveland-based TRW is investing some Dollars 500m on its power
rack and pinion steering business to meet growing demand, much of it in
western Europe.
And Morton International, the Chicago-based group, recently announced plans
to invest in a joint venture with Robert Bosch, the German engineering
group, in a European plant to make emergency airbags for cars.
Morton has the biggest share of the US market for airbags, which is
expanding rapidly thanks to consumer demand and government regulation.
Morton sees big potential in the European market, where airbags are rare at
present, as does TRW, its main US rival in the business.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (11): Poised for a
smoother ride - New life is being pumped into world tyre industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOWLY and laboriously, new life is being pumped into the world tyre
industry.
The industry has had a bone-shaking ride since 1989, when it first developed
the puncture in its profitability caused mainly by the slide of large
original equipment and replacement markets into recession.
According to estimates in a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit,
this global industry which turns over close to Dollars 55bn a year has made
collective losses of more than Dollars 1bn in the two years up to early
1992.
It is an industry which has seen rationalisation on a scale matched by few
other industrial sectors. In the mid-1980s, 80 per cent of the market was
shared by 13 manufacturers. Now, 85 per cent of world sales are accounted
for by just six manufacturers. Had things turned out differently late last
year, the number would have been reduced to five. In what was generally seen
as likely to be the last of the big tyre industry takeovers, Italy's
Pirelli, the world's sixth largest tyres group with annual sales of around
Dollars 3.5bn, sought to take over rival Continental of Germany, ranked
fourth with sales of just over Dollars 5bn.
Had the bitterly contested bid succeeded, Pirelli would have created a group
close in size to the 'big three' of the tyres world: Michelin of France, now
marginally the world market leader with sales of more than Dollars 12bn,
Bridgestone of Japan and Goodyear of the US.
Instead, Continental dug in its heels, retained its independence and Pirelli
incurred substantial losses directly related to the failed bid. They formed
a significant portion of the Dollars 275m deficit reported for 1991 by
Pirelli Tyre Holding, the Dutch-listed company which controls Pirelli's
world tyre operations.
According to its board, however, Pirelli Tyre Holding will return to
break-even some time this year, with a full return to profitability in 1993.
Indeed, the opening months of this year indicate that the industry is at a
turning point.
It is still having a very hard time convincing car makers, themselves hit by
slumping markets and under massive pressures to reduce costs, that the tyre
industry needs price rises if research and development, and investment in
automated tyre- making facilities, is to be maintained.
But, led mainly by Michelin, it has managed to force through price rises of
7-10 per cent in the replacement tyre sector, which accounts for about
two-thirds of total unit sales volumes.
With the North American vehicle market, in particular, starting to show
signs of recovery, the other leading players are already reporting a return
to profitability.
According to Mr Philip Wylie, of Barclays de Zoete Wedd who is the author of
the EIU report, the combined effect of the price increases and North
American market recovery should more than offset expected declines in the
European and Japanese car markets this year.
As a result, he expects average operating margins to improve by about 1 per
cent this year. And with lower redundancy and other restructuring costs -
after the loss of tens of thousands of jobs over the past two years - he
expects the industry to generate Dollars 1bn profits this year. This is
still well short of the industry's peak year of 1988/89, when collectively
it chalked up some Dollars 1.5bn.
Certainly, 'this year has started better than the last one', according to Dr
Hubertus von Grunberg, chairman of Continental's executive board. He expects
the company to be 'well in the black' this year.
Without doubt, some of the tyre industry's wounds are self-inflicted.
Motorists everywhere are undoubtedly grateful to the industry for so
virtuously shooting itself in the foot and inventing the radial tyre,
capable of covering more than twice the mileage of the now almost obsolete
cross-ply.
But some analysts believe there is more to the vicious price wars of the
past few years, both in North America and Europe, than straightforward
competition. Two main theories are put forward:
That Michelin in Europe, and Goodyear in North America, led a downward
spiral in prices in the - ultimately unsuccessful - hope of persuading
aggressively expansionist Japanese tyre makers such as Bridgestone and
Sumitomor from seeking to acquire or otherwise set up manufacturing
operations. Instead, Bridgestone acquired Firestone - and its operations in
both North America and Europe - while Sumitomo is now the producer of Dunlop
tyres.
The other theory works on 'beggar-thy-neighbour' principles - that if prices
were kept low enough for long enough, there would be a further, perhaps
final round, of consolidation. Subsequently, as markets began to recover,
the industry's profitability would be helped by the reduced competition.
The jury is still out on the consolidation issue.
Between Pirelli and Continental there remains a wary, hostile stand-off.
They are still in negotiations over the possible sale to Continental of some
of Pirelli's non-tyre businesses - but face a potential court battle over
dividend payments for shares already owned by Pirelli in Continental.
Pirelli owns 5 per cent of Continental and has options over a further 34 per
cent. Under German law, however, individual shareholders are limited to a 5
per cent voting share, no matter how big their holding.
Whether, in future, Pirelli will seek to revive its bid, or itself become a
takeover target, remains an open question.
There is still a problem of over-capacity. Spurred by eight unbroken years
of growth in the world's main car markets during the 1980s, and in spite of
lingering memories of the savage job and capacity cuts after the 1979 oil
shock, the industry spent several billion dollars on new capacity in the
late 1980s, much of it coming on stream as vehicle markets turned down.
The reluctance of vehicle makers to concede any but the most grudging price
increases will also put a brake on profits expansion during the 1990s.
But the entire industry can take comfort in long-term growth projections for
the world car industry itself. By 1995, world sales are expected to be up to
25 per cent above 1991 levels.
The other plus point for the tyre industry is the prospect of substantial
advances in automated manufacturing technology, and the chance to make sharp
cuts in costs of what, by other industry yardsticks, remains a
labour-intensive process because of the complexity and variety of the
materials used, and the sequential processes of building up the tyre
carcass.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (9): Tomorrow's car
takes shape - A look ahead into the future of motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFF DANIELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proportion of a car's value represented by bought-in components is
steadily increasing although the basic pattern of car manufacture has
changed but little in recent years.
The vehicle manufacturer invariably produces the body shell, almost always
the engine (with its own proportion of bought-in parts) and more often than
not the transmission. All other components are purchased for direct
installation, and this is the area in which car value has been increasing
fastest.
The process will inevitably continue at a rate which will comfortably
outstrip the growth of car production measured in raw units. Consumer demand
for ever higher levels of comfort, performance and equipment have gone
hand-in-hand with legislation for more safety and cleaner exhausts to ensure
this.
A particular area of technology that has become the component suppliers'
preserve is electronically-controlled systems. While nobody should
underestimate the electronic expertise of the vehicle manufacturers
themselves, they are simply not in the business of producing electronic
components in large numbers - unless they do so via dedicated subsidiaries,
as do General Motors and Toyota, for example.
While the popular image of an electronic system is that of a 'black box'
computer which exercises control over the operation of some aspect of the
car, the reality is that the black box and its contents are the (relatively)
easy part. To exert control, the computer must first assess circumstances by
means of various types of sensor. It must then act to control the situation
by means of output devices or transducers.
It is in the area of sensors and transducers that some of the most intense
development of vehicle components is taking place, placing component-sector
companies with related expertise, such as Germany's Bosch and Japan's NGK,
in a very strong position.
The first serious application of electronic control systems to the car was
in the management of engine operation. It is now commonplace to have a
single computer controlling ignition and fuel injection, the latter
particularly with the aim of reducing exhaust emissions. New regulations
concerning emission control systems have placed extra demands on systems and
sensors: for example, US and Japanese legislation will shortly demand the
in-car monitoring of catalytic converter efficiency, calling for oxygen
content 'lambda' sensors to be installed upstream and downstream of the
converter.
The adaptability and availability of electronic engine control systems may
yet bring about a revolution in basic engine design: none of the development
teams now working hard on two-stroke engine projects would pretend they
could make their units work properly without the speed and precision of
electronic control.
Electronics has since migrated to the control of automatic transmission. No
designer of such transmissions would today contemplate any other approach.
Without electronics, the control mechanism of the latest five-speed
transmissions would be too heavy and complex to be seriously contemplated.
Nor would there be any question of systems which adapted their shift
patterns to the driver's own technique, as some of the new units do. With
automatic transmissions in Japan now making the breakthrough to American
levels of sales penetration, and with confident predictions that Europe will
follow suit, this will be an important growth area.
Another transmission-related area in which rapid growth is expected is that
of traction control systems, which operate to detect incipient wheelspin and
to prevent it either by cutting back power or by partial brake operation.
It is also expected that limited-slip differential units, with or without
electronic control, will become much more widely fitted.
The chassis is the part of the car most recently to have felt the impact of
electronic engineering. We have become more and more familiar with
electronic anti-lock braking but today's developments go further. More and
more up-market cars are now offered with electronic control of suspension
operation, adapting its stiffness to the road surface and to the car's
behaviour: soft when cruising on a smooth road, firm when driven briskly on
a rough or winding one.
Development in this area is rapid and the potential for expansion is huge.
Among other things, engineers have long since moved on from considerations
of mere ride comfort to study the subtle effects on car stability and
handling of varying suspension stiffness between the front and rear of the
vehicle. Further into the future, chassis specialists are examining the
possible advantages of electronic 'steer by wire' replacing mechanical
linkages.
The components industry has already greatly benefited from the much greater
amount of comfort and convenience equipment now fitted especially to
up-market cars. There has been a trend towards the power operation of almost
anything that moves. Electric windows and centralised locking have been
joined by power-operated seats, mirrors and sunroof.
Car manufacturers are beginning to count the number of electric motors
installed in luxury-level models in dozens. In spite of warnings from some
quarters that such developments are driving up the weight, the complexity
and the cost of cars to undesirable levels, the trend seems inexorable.
Serious consideration has already been given to multiplexing and 'databus'
systems to reduce the now huge amount of wiring in modern luxury cars.
Beyond the area of mere comfort and convenience, there looms the huge
potential market for equipment to link cars with each other and with the
environment - the kind of equipment beginning to emerge from the
pan-European Prometheus research programme, for example. It is now possible
to conceive of equipment which would enable a car to be precisely aware of
its position (and duly to inform its driver) and thus to be able to
calculate the shortest and quickest route to its pre- programmed
destination, taking account of any temporary delays and ensuring safety via
automatic vehicle separation and optimised road-space sharing.
Any such system would inevitably be a high-value item, and would certainly
be supplied by the component manufacturing sector. Virtually all the
necessary technology has already been demonstrated: the remaining problems,
not to be underestimated, involve its integration into complete systems and
more particularly, the standardisation of communications protocols and other
operational aspects.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (7): More efficient
look - French component groups still have a long way to go to catch up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S CAR component industry, Europe's second largest, has played an
essential part in supporting the campaign by Renault and Peugeot to reduce
their productivity gap with Japan.
Michelin, the tyre group; Valeo, the diversified components maker; the glass
maker, Saint Gobain; ECIA, the Peugeot components subsidiary; and
Hutchinson, the maker of rubber parts and sealants, have made significant
improvements in costs and quality in recent years.
This has been partly in response to pressure from their car-making
customers, seeking to improve efficiency at all stages of the process. But
it is also a result of the rigours imposed by the weakness of car demand,
down by 0.6 per cent in France in the first four months of this year,
according to the CCFA car makers' committee.
As a mark of just how far productivity has advanced, the French component
industry's output grew by 25 per cent in real terms in the four years to
1990, while the number of employees fell by more than 2.5 per cent,
according to a recent survey* by SAC Enterprises, the UK consultancy.
Yet, in line with their European counterparts, French component groups still
have a long way to go to catch up. According to France's Fiev, vehicle
component makers' federation, European companies' annual sales per employee
are still a mere FFr630,000 (Dollars 119,000), less than half their Japanese
competitors' equivalent of FFr1.33m.
Even so, France's largest components groups are significantly leaner and
more efficient than they were only a few years ago. Valeo announced a 30 per
cent rise in operating profits last year, reflecting productivity gains of 5
per cent. It was recently awarded top marks by Moody's, the rating agency,
which classed Valeo's treasury bills as prime one, and described the French
group's plants as 'among the most efficient in Europe's auto components
industry'. As a supplier to Nissan, Honda and Toyota, the company has shown
that it can match rigorous Japanese demands.
Michelin returned to operating profit last year, after having incurred heavy
losses in the downturn, worsened by the costs of having to digest its 1989
acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich. Since then it has trimmed stocks, made
heavy job losses and introduced production efficiencies.
French component makers have been helped by the fact that French car makers
have taken to buying in more of their components from suppliers, rather than
making them in-house. So it is that bought-in components have risen to just
over 60 per cent of total operating costs at Peugeot and 67 per cent at
Renault, a steep rise over recent years, and will go on rising in both
cases.
This is happening partly because Peugeot and Renault have both moved away
from their old strategy of integration, and instead see themselves primarily
as designers and assemblers of cars.
The rise in car makers' outsourcing also reflects their increasing demand
for high-technology components, such as anti-lock brakes and catalysers,
which they have no interest in making themselves. This means they need
suppliers that are prepared to design and produce a significant part of a
vehicle themselves, in return for a long-term contract. An example is Epeda
Bertrand Faure, asked to handle to whole of the seating of the Renault 19.
All this signals a rethink of the traditional adversarial relationships
between car makers and suppliers, in which pricing formed the most important
part of purchasing decisions. The battleground has now shifted, so that
French car makers have instead become more demanding on quality and delivery
times, to enable them to practise just-in-time stock control, an essential
part of their productivity gains.
Peugeot and Renault have, for example, for the past five years been running
joint audits to keep component suppliers' quality up to the mark, grading
them according to ability to do their own quality control. They are thinking
of extending this system to cover suppliers' productivity, too.
The winners in the shift towards quality and higher technology have been the
largest players, while smaller suppliers are increasingly being forced into
a secondary position, selling parts to the large component groups instead of
directly to the car makers. 'Not all of the French suppliers have the R&amp;D
resources to meet these requirements. Some . . . will become second-tier
suppliers,' says SAC.
Many already have. Renault plans to reduce its number of suppliers from
1,100 last year to around 600 or 700, while Peugeot has already cut back
from 1,700 suppliers in 1984 to 740 last year, according to the study. This
is still many more suppliers than Japanese producers tolerate - Nissan has
160, for example - which suggests that the shake-out has much further to go.
If the big players are doing well, the middle and lower ranks of the French
components industry shows worrying lack of dynamism, says SAC.
For one thing, the industry tends to be too centred on the French market,
with the obvious exceptions of the top players such as Valeo, Michelin and
Saint Gobain. This is a disadvantage when car makers are becoming more
global.
At the same time, French car component companies are facing increasing
competition in their own market. In recent years, several German companies
have set up in Alsace, to take advantage of the relatively cheap labour
costs, while ACG Europe, the GM subsidiary, has opened a chassis centre near
Paris.
In 1990, NGK, the Japanese spark-plug maker, announced plans to open a plant
in the Loire valley; and Koyo Seiko, a Toyota subsidiary, took a stake in
Renault's steering systems division. Given France's continuing sensitivities
over competition from Japan, observers do not expect a French repeat of the
invasion of the US car components industry achieved by Japanese suppliers.
For the moment, the French automotive component industry appears to be
holding its own internationally, as is shown by its continuing healthy trade
surplus. However, the SAC study argues that the international exposure among
medium-sized and small suppliers could be a serious handicap.
Crucially, the French industry is weak on electronic components, which form
a growing proportion of the market as cars become more sophisticated. New
products here are being increasingly developed outside France - and the
growing number of foreign competitors in France could suggest that French
suppliers are losing their technological edge, it warns.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (6): Partnership the
watchword - Few companies in Italy are escaping the shake-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE

<TEXT>
THE 15th Automotor international motor components, spares and accessories
fair opened at Turin's Lingotto site at the beginning of June with a
significant increase in the number of exhibitors.
More than 600 companies were looking to boost their business by being in
Turin, compared to 544 last year. Among the exhibitors were 90 from abroad,
who considered the commercial benefits of the week-long fair would outweigh
the costs.
The growing popularity of the fair is evidence of the increasing pressures
on the industry. The problems were underlined by Aldo Malandra, of
Associazione Nazionale fra Industrie Automobilistiche (ANFIA, the Italian
automobile industries association): 'These are difficult times for the whole
automobile industry. The components industry is having to tackle the
simultaneous challenges of a contracting market for new cars and weak demand
in the spares after-market.'
Original equipment makers in Italy have been unable to avoid being affected
by the drop of 10 percentage points in the share held by Turin automobile
group Fiat in its home market, from around 55 per cent to about 45 per cent
over the past two years. 'Companies dependent on Fiat have been badly hit,'
says Roberto Olivero, sales manager of Automotive Products Lockheed brake
plant at Cairo Montenotte, south of the Piedmont capital.
Fiat suppliers had to reduce their production levels in 1991, and the
situation will probably worsen this year. 'Much was expected from the Tipo,
but its sales have disappointed. Fiat's prospects will not get brighter
until its ageing model line gets new models.'
Moreover, Fiat is reducing the number of companies from which it purchases
components. 'Partnership is becoming the watchword in the changing
relationship between automobile maker and supplier,' says Mr Olivero.
Partnership is also the word that ANFIA's Mr Malandra uses to describe the
increasingly tighter relationship in which front-rank Italian components
firms are being called on to boost in-house capability for research.
'Automobile makers are delegating as they de-verticalise, and this requires
that components makers should be financially strong. The weakest are being
sorted out.'
As companies address a changing and challenging situation, they have had to
increase their use of the state Cassa Integrazione Guadagni (CIG) fund for
laying off surplus labour. Mr Malandra says that precise figures are not
available, but ANFIA estimates that about 10 per cent of the component
industry's total workforce of 140,000 is being paid by CIG. Lay-offs at
Automotive Products' plant have paralleled those at Fiat.
Few companies are unaffected by the present industry-wide shake-out, and
Italy's biggest components group, Fiat subsidiary Magneti Marelli, is
undergoing a big re-organisation. Last year this led to a reduction of 4,000
workers from a workforce that totalled about 30,000 at year-end 1990.
Magneti Marelli's 1991 accounts included expenditure of L255bn on
restructuring that has involved the closure of eight plants and
rationalisation of production aimed at cost containment. The group says
there is a 9 per cent improvement in productivity.
It notes that turnover rose 4 per cent in the first four months of this
year, and that operating margins have improved, confirming the validity of
the re-organisation. (Consolidated accounts recorded a loss of L144bn on
L3,287bn turnover in 1991, but the group expects a return to profit in the
medium term.)
In focusing on strategic businesses, Magneti Marelli has disposed of those
that do not fit into its newly-defined portfolio. Its cable activities have
gone to France's Labinal, seals to Britain's TI and horns to Fiamm, while
batteries production has passed elsewhere in the Fiat Group.
With more stringent environmental laws causing a significant drop in
carburettor production, Magneti Marelli's efforts are increasing in the
engine control sector which includes injectors and fuel pumps. The group's
other key sectors are cooling, heating and air-conditioning systems,
instrumentation, lighting and electro-mechanical equipment.
The main outlet for Magneti Marelli's production is its domestic original
equipment market, with Fiat Group's Italian operations taking 29 per cent of
the total. Automobile makers in France and Germany take 19 and 14 per cent
respectively, and Magneti Marelli points to its Q1 status as a Ford
supplier, Class A with Peugeot and Renault and Supplier of the Year with
General Motors. But Magneti Marelli's horizons extend to the emerging
markets in Turkey and Poland.
Foreign markets are important to a large part of the Italian automotive
components industry. Mr Malandra says that between 20 and 25 per cent of the
industry's total sales of L18,000bn last year were from exports.
Italian makers of brake components rely heavily on sales abroad, with these
accounting for more than half of aggregate turnover. 'Brake pads and linings
are subject to wear, thus creating demand for spares. The relative lack of
product and production sophistication makes market entry easy for small
business,' says Mr Olivero at Automotive Products.
Fragmentation between many small- and medium-sized companies is a
characteristic of production of brake parts in Italy. But, in spite of the
trend towards concentration, it continues to be a feature of the Italian
automotive components industry as a whole.
'Few of the 1,000 companies in the industry are large. But fragmentation is
not necessarily a weakness. The industry has the strength of flexibility.
And in terms of technology and innovation it does not lag behind other
countries,' says Mr Malandra.
Reviewing the bleak situation, in which volumes of original equipment have
been eroded by the fall in new car registrations and sales of spares
adversely affected by improved component reliability, Mr Malandra sees a
shaft of light ahead.
'At present cars in Italy are subject to their first official safety check
10 years after registration. A new highway code should reach the statute
book in January 1993 which will make the first check obligatory after four
years, with subsequent checks every two years. This ought to stimulate the
spares market,' he says.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (2): Sales
acceleration expected - World production expected to reach 40.7m vehicles by
1996
</HEADLINE>

WORLD CAR sales are forecast to grow by 1.3 per cent to 34.6m this year,
following a 2 per cent drop in 1991. The decline last year was the largest
reduction in sales volume since the 1980-81 recession.
According to DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive analyst, car sales are now
recovering in North America, the UK and Spain, and remain strong in Italy
and Latin America.
DRI is optimistic about the outlook for car sales worldwide for 1993 and
beyond, and expects demand to jump by 18.3 per cent in the five years to
1996, from 34.2m to 40.5m.
Sales in west Europe are forecast to rise to a record 15m in 1996, while car
sales in the US are expected to rise by 4 per cent this year to 8.7m, and to
recover to more than 10m by the mid-1990s. The US market fell last year to
its lowest level since 1982 at 8.4m.
DRI suggests that the fastest growing segment in the US from 1991 to 1996
will be luxury cars, helped by important demographic changes.
The growth in the number of affluent households in the US was an important
factor in persuading Toyota and Nissan, the Japanese car makers, to develop
luxury car ranges in the second half of the 1980s, aimed primarily at the
US.
These cars were launched under the Lexus and Infiniti names in the US in
1989. Now, another Japanese car maker, Mazda, is also planning to enter the
US luxury car market with a separate sales channel, to be called Amati, in
1994.
Mazda had been studying an entry into the US luxury car market for a couple
of years, and has concluded that the prospects are too attractive to be
ignored. It estimates that the number of affluent households in the US with
an income of at least Dollars 75,000 (Pounds 45,000) a year is set to
increase from 2m in 1988 to 2.5m in 1995.
In Europe, the German car market is forecast to fall sharply this year by
around 11 per cent, to 3.7m from the record 4.2m achieved last year in the
wake of reunification. Sales are also forecast to fall further in Japan this
year.
The decline in the German market will eliminate the volume gains achieved
elsewhere in Europe, leading to a 1 per cent fall in overall western
European new car sales in 1992 to 13.4m, according to DRI.
The downturn in Germany, the biggest single market in Europe, is forecast to
bottom out in 1993 at 3.5m, some 16 per cent or 700,000 cars below the 1991
peak, with demand recovering from 1994 to reach 3.8m in 1996.
In Europe, the tax payable on new car purchases has fallen in several
countries - as well as in Japan and Australia. The UK has halved the 10 per
cent special car tax, which is paid in addition to the 17.5 per cent rate of
VAT, while VAT rates have fallen in France and in Belgium. The French VAT
rate was reduced in April, to the standard rate of 18.6 per cent from 22.0
per cent previously, and has fallen sharply from the 33 per cent levied on
new car purchases in 1987.
The European Community has agreed a VAT floor of 15 per cent for cars for
the period from 1993 to 1998, but in the process of harmonisation of VAT
rates no ceiling has yet been set, says DRI. However, it expects the
Community to work towards a convergence of tax rates.
After growing by 38 per cent between 1988 and 1990, Japanese new car sales
fell by 5 per cent last year to 4.9m. The DRI report* forecasts that demand
will weaken further this year by 4 per cent to 4.7m, but will recover in
1993 to reach more than 5m again in 1995.
Despite progress made by car importers to Japan in recent years, import
penetration remains low at only 4.5 per cent of Japanese new car sales in
1991; and, as new car demand falls in Japan, import sales have been
declining at a faster rate than sales of domestically-built cars.
According to DRI, Japanese car sales weakened last year as a result of two
main factors: consumer confidence has been damaged by a deterioration in
growth prospects for the economy; while, at the same time, there is
widespread concern about the future of land and property prices following
recent falls. The tightening of parking restrictions has had a significant
impact on mini-car sales.
In the Asia-Pacific region, both the South Korea and Taiwan markets have
remained strong. South Korean new car sales have increased threefold since
1987, to reach 745,000 in 1991. DRI suggests that the economy will remain
strong with car sales, rising by a further 50 per cent in the next five
years to 1.13m in 1996.
New car sales in Taiwan were little changed in 1991, at 354,000, but demand
is forecast to strengthen in the next five years with sales set to reach a
record 500,000 in 1996.
According to the DRI study, new car sales in the European Community will
grow from 12.6m in 1991 to 13.9m in 1996, with Japanese car manufacturers
capturing around 30 per cent of the growth.
The Japanese share of EC car sales is forecast to rise from 10.9 per cent in
1991 to 12.5 per cent in 1996. Japanese penetration is expected to grow in
most EC markets, but above all in the UK, where the Japanese share is
forecast to rise from 11.6 per cent in 1991 to 16.9 per cent in 1996.
The capacity of Japanese car plants in Europe will probably exceed 700,000
units a year in 1996.
In the UK, the new Nissan Micra, Toyota Carina and Honda Synchro all start
production this year. DRI forecasts that Japanese car production in the UK
will rise to more than 600,000 in 1996, pushing UK car output to 2m, which
would be 60 per cent, or nearly 800,000 units, above the 1991 level.
DRI says that, after a weak recovery this year to some 1.7m from 1.59m in
1991, new car sales in the UK will grow more strongly in 1993, by 12 per
cent to 1.9m. The market is forecast to be above 2m again in 1994, but will
not have recovered its 1989 peak of 2.3m until 1996.
Overall, in the next five years, world car production is forecast to
increase by 6.5m vehicles to 40.7m in 1996. Some 2m of this increase will be
accounted for by western Europe - including, significantly, local Japanese
production - with 1.7m in North America, and only 500,000 in Japan.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (5): Hostile attitude
is fading - Japanese transplants drive UK component supplier standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BY THE mid to late 1990s, close to Pounds 2bn worth of UK and Continental
European-sourced components are expected to be flowing annually into the UK
car manufacturing plants of Nissan, Toyota and Honda.
Of this total, much the biggest proportion - around 70 per cent - is being
sourced from either British components groups such as Lucas Industries, GKN
and T &amp; N, or the UK subsidiaries of Continental European components groups
such as Robert Bosch of Germany and Valeo of France.
The situation is very different from the mid-1980s, when most chief
executives of leading British component groups shared with Ford and other
UK-based car makers an open hostility towards the prospect of Japanese car
manufacturing in the UK.
They believed Nissan and other Japanese car makers who might follow it would
bring in on their coat-tails their own components suppliers from Japan,
provoking a bitter fight for survival in the European components industry as
well as among its car makers.
Those most sceptical about the long-term intentions of the Japanese industry
suggest that this still cannot be ruled out. They argue that the influx will
simply take longer and be more subtle than in North America, where there are
more than 300 Japanese suppliers for the nearly 1.7m vehicles now built in
the US and Canada each year by Japanese 'transplants', from which the
indigenous US components industry protests loudly that it is being excluded.
Senior UK-based components group executives such as Sir David Lees, chairman
and chief executive of GKN, and Mr Bob Dale, managing director of Lucas
Industries' automotive division, are inclined to give such cynicism
increasingly short shrift.
They assert that even if Japanese suppliers were to start arriving in force,
they would find the leading players in the indigenous European industry much
more formidable opponents than in North America.
Remarkably, in the case of many of the several hundred UK and Continental
companies already supplying Nissan's Sunderland car plant, or preparing to
supply Honda's Swindon and Toyota's Derby plants when commercial production
starts later this year, this confidence is substantially due to their
fast-developing contacts with the Japanese 'transplants'.
They have come to realise that the Japanese manufacturers' stated desire for
long-term partnerships with their component suppliers represents
considerably more than lip service to an ideal.
Those who have survived the long, painstaking selection process have found
themselves adjusting to a relationship in which they have been faced with
demands for unprecedented quality and consistency standards - but given
close and continuing help and advice to achieve them.
The onus is being placed firmly on them, as suppliers, to undertake the
design and development of components - with assurances that having done so,
they will be long-term, sole suppliers.
They have had to adjust to the cultural trauma, for companies long used to
an adversarial, price-haggling relationship with western car makers, of
having to open their books to the Japanese companies to see how prices and
costs have been arrived at - and how both might be lowered co-operatively,
with car and component maker sharing the benefit.
As the Economist Intelligence Unit stresses in a new study* of the UK motor
components industry, already it is the Japanese UK transplants which are
driving the UK's component supplier standards.
And on the evidence of a study of Nissan's Sunderland suppliers published
last year by the National Economic Development Office, much of the
components industry still has a long way to go. It found Japanese component
suppliers to have achieved a rejection rate of 50 per million, while the UK
industry average is around one per 1,000.
Inevitably, the prospect of UK car production more than doubling compared
with early 1980s levels to comfortably exceed 2m by the mid- to late-1990s
(of which the Japanese 'transplants' will account for more than one-third)
has acted as a magnet for overseas components companies.
Some are indeed Japanese. Their principal ventures include a Pounds 65m
Nippondenso plant about to start producing air conditioning systems at
Telford, Shropshire, and in which Fiat's Magneti Marelli components
subsidiary is a minority joint venture partner, and the virtual takeover by
Nippondenso and Calsonic of all independent cooling systems manufacture in
the UK, through their respective acquisitions of the former IMI Radiators
and Llanelli Radiator.
However, the claim of Nissan, Toyota and Honda that only a relative handful
of Japanese-owned or joint venture companies are supplying their plants is
broadly correct. In each case, there are fewer than a dozen.
Robert Bosch of Germany and Valeo, the French components giant, are among
those contributing to what the EIU report describes as a surge of inward
investment 'the like of which has not been seen for 40 years'.
The tendency of new investments to be concentrated in specific areas is
having a profound impact on some UK regions which have been hardest hit by
industrial change and recession.
For example, they are transforming the economy and prospects of Wales, which
is fast becoming one of the UK's most important motor components centres.
According to figures from the Welsh Development Agency, Wales now hosts 150
such components companies, which between them employ 16,000 people.
'Flagship' ventures include Bosch's Pounds 100m green field plant to produce
alternators near Cardiff, which expects to be making 5m alternators a year
and employing 1,200 people by 1995. Output started last year. A few weeks
ago, Volkswagen of Germany, one of the plant's customers, took delivery of
the millionth alternator produced at the plant.
Meanwhile, Valeo has moved into a WDA plant in South Wales to produce air
conditioning and heating systems. But one of Wales' biggest motor components
projects is being provided directly by Toyota, through its Pounds 140m
engine plant at Deeside, in North Wales. The plant is to go on stream within
the next two months, and will eventually produce up to 200,000 engines a
year, some of which are destined for export to Japan.
GKN's Sir David Lees can point to surging supplies to Japanese car makers as
underlining his relative lack of concern about his company's ability to
compete. He expects such sales to top Pounds 120m this year and to continue
rising swiftly thereafter as Honda and Toyota output in the UK gets under
way.
GKN already supplies Nissan with all its driveshafts at Sunderland, and its
Hardy Spice facility in Birmingham will start supplying Toyota and Honda
later this year. It has already established supplies with Japanese
transplants in the US, its latest involvement contract being a Dollars
15m-a-year contract to supply constant velocity driveshafts for a new range
of medium saloons Mazda is putting into production at Flat Rock, Michigan.
T &amp; N, Lucas, Triplex, AB Electronics, BBA and BTR are among other groups
forging increasingly close contacts with the Japanese, not just in Europe
but in some other cases than GKN in North America, and even Japan, as well.
All the principal UK players recognise that, for survival through the 1990s,
even a European business perspective is no longer enough. They must be
capable of responding globally to a car industry which has already
globalised, and which has already led to T &amp; N chairman Mr Colin Hope, Sir
David and others leading their companies into joint ventures giving them a
presence in every developing marketplace, as well as in the established
car-producing regions.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (4): A rapid
transformation - Industries in eastern Europe come in from the cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUTOMOTIVE and components industries of eastern Europe, long neglected
by central planners, have been transformed with extraordinary rapidity in
the past two years by heavy western investment.
The biggest change has occurred in Hungary, which did not even have a car
industry in 1990. Comecon, the old Soviet-dominated trading bloc, had
decided 20 years ago that Hungary should specialise in producing buses for
the bloc, as well as related components such as heavy duty axles. For
Hungarian consumers, this left them with a choice between Fiat-Ladas from
the Soviet Union and Poland or Trabants from the former East Germany.
But in March, the first Opel Astra rolled off the new assembly lines at
Szentgotthard, near the Austrian border; and in August the first Suzuki
Swift will roll off equally new production lines at Esztergom less than 50km
away.
Initially, both the 15,000-a-year Astra plant and the 60,000-a-year Swift
factory will be 'screwdriver' plants, assembling parts and components
imported customs-free from GM's plants in Europe and Suzuki plants in Japan.
But this is expected to change fast, as both plants push to maximise local
content and take advantage of labour costs estimated to be only 10 per cent
of comparable German rates.
From the outset, however, the most important aspect of the Dollars 300m
investment by GM and the Hungarian government at Szentgotthard was not car
assembly but the much larger engine plant due to come on stream this month.
The new plant will have the capacity to produce up to 200,000 highly
fuel-efficient 1300cc and 1600cc engines for export to other GM plants
throughout Europe.
Suzuki, which intends to export most of its cars from the new Hungarian
plant, has started by importing engines and other parts worth almost 60 per
cent of total value from Japan. But the plant's eventual profitability
depends largely on its ability to raise the local content to 60 per cent by
1995.
Together, the two plants should provide a powerful incentive for
component-makers to build new factories in Hungary. Some have already done
so. Ford has just started production of fuel pumps, ignition coils and other
components at a new Dollars 60m plant at Szekesfehervar, near Budapest.
United Technologies, also of the US, has established a Dollars 10m plant at
Godollo to build electrical systems for cars, and plans to expand the plant
as output from new sites in Hungary and its neighbours rises.
It is a similar story in Czechoslovakia, where Volkswagen paid around
Dollars 600m for an eventual 70 per cent stake in Skoda and also built an
Audi assembly line in Bratislava, the Slovak capital. Over the next five
years, VW plans investment worth another Dollars 6bn at Skoda, to raise
production and introduce new models.
Investment on this scale is proving a powerful incentive to VW's traditional
suppliers to take similar advantage of Czechoslovakia's cheap, skilled
labour. Robert Bosch of Germany has taken a 76 per cent stake in the newly
privatised Motor Jikov components company of Ceske Budejovice. It plans to
build new production facilities and quintuple the 200-strong workforce by
1995. The plant produces carburettors and engines for small agricultural
machines, but the product range will be expanded to satisfy the more
sophisticated demand from VW-Skoda.
T and N, the UK motor components and engineering group, has also made two
strategic investments in the region, which it intends to make the
springboard of a fast-growing presence. In January T and N bought
Gleitlagerwerk Osterwieck, a small east German ball-bearing company which
used to supply bearings and other components to the former Trabant plant at
Mosel, near Zwickau, now transformed by Volkswagen into a Golf assembly
plant. In May, it completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Osinek,
the sole Czechoslovak producer of friction and braking materials. The UK
company plans substantial investment to raise output of brake linings and
other automotive and industrial components.
Rising output from the new VW controlled plants in Czechoslovakia and former
East Germany has also induced Sklo Union, the Czech flat-glass company now
70 per cent controlled by Glaverbel of Belgium, to raise output of
automobile glass from its plant at Teplice near the German border. The
Czech-Belgian joint venture expects to double its current deliveries to VW
of 200,000 automobile glass sets a year by 1994. Its low-cost, high-quality
production has also enabled Sklo Union to elbow aside St Gobain of France
and export auto glass sets to Fiat plants in Italy.
Fiat is also investing heavily in eastern Europe. It has retarded plans to
build a new car plant at Yelabuga, 850km east of Moscow, but recently agreed
to pay a total of Dollars 2bn for control of FSO, Poland's small car
producer. More than Dollars 1.2bn of the total will be spent raising
production and introducing a new model to flank the existing Cinquecento
model. Fiat's move is expected to be followed by an influx of Italian and
other component companies.
Farther east, Cummins Motor, the world's largest independent engine maker
has agreed a joint venture with Kamaz, the largest Soviet truck maker, to
build Cummins truck engines at Kamaz, in Nabarezhnye Chelny, 900km east of
Moscow. When complete, the new facility will have the capacity to turn out
50,000 engines a year. Some will be incorporated in Kamaz trucks built for
export to western markets, and others will be exported from the low-cost
Russian plant to Cummins' customers around the world.
After decades in the cold, eastern Europe is rapidly becoming a significant
player in the auto components business.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (3): Exciting but
testing times - Alarm signals in Germany heeded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S car producers are going through a highly unsettling time at the
moment, but the components manufacturers can already tell them what the
1990s have in store.
As German labour costs - well above those in any other European country,
except Sweden - continue to rise, the automotive industry is under
increasing pressure from competitors in cheaper countries such as France and
the UK which have made great strides in productivity in recent years.
At the same time, these and other countries such as Italy have experienced
sharp cuts in their labour forces as the drive for greater efficiency
gathers speed. Among the newer car-producing countries, Spain has also
developed rapidly, partly with the help of Volkswagen.
In spite of the undoubted quality, styling, and environmental appeal of
German cars, rising costs and increasing competition have put manufacturers
and components producers in a tight corner. An added threat is the highly
efficient Japanese production in the UK, with Nissan's plant in Sunderland
setting new efficiency standards for the industry.
Thus, states Mr Achim Diekmann, managing director of the German motor
industry association (VDA): 'Germany's automobile sites could be
particularly vulnerable as competition intensifies further.' Productivity
has not been rising fast enough, even though vehicle makers have been highly
innovative in other ways. 'The German automobile industry's production costs
are too high, not just in comparison with Japan, but also with its European
rivals'.
The components manufacturers have already had to react to these alarm
signals. To keep their own costs low, car and truck makers have put pressure
on parts manufacturers to supply at ever lower prices. This makes it harder
for German suppliers to earn enough profit in high-cost Germany and has
forced many of them to shift some output abroad. It has also led to an
increasing trend of concentration in the German parts industry, as companies
seek wider groupings to enable them to produce more efficiently and on a
larger and thus cheaper scale. The needs of the car makers, which
increasingly want whole systems developed and delivered rather than single
parts, are also met by this trend.
The German automotive components industry has an annual turnover of around
DM50bn (Dollars 32bn) and is the third biggest in the world after those of
Japan and the US. It is also the second biggest exporter. Thus its
performance is vital to the success of German car producers.
So, too, therefore is its cost structure and its capacity not only to make
technological advances but also to finance these. For as the sector comes
under a growing cost squeeze and vehicle makers' demands become tougher, the
shake-out is bound to become rougher. In a study of the German parts
industry, SAC Enterprises of the UK states: 'A period of rapid change should
bring with it more rapid restructuring and bigger winners and losers.'
This would take place as the industry underwent a speedier selection process
 -'selection in the sense of survival of the fittest'.
One big German engineering company which is determined to increase its
presence in the sector is Mannesmann. Last year, it not only bought control
of Boge, a maker of struts and shock absorbers, in a field where it already
has one subsidiary, Fichtel und Sachs, it also went on to acquire VDO Adolf
Schindling, the instrumentation and controls specialist.
More companies are likely to be snapped up in an industry which saw 50
take-overs between the start of 1988 and mid-1991 when the study - called
'The Outlook for the German Automotive Supplier Industry' - was produced. In
Germany, unlike Britain and France, medium-sized specialist companies are
predominant in the parts industry. But they are having to invest more
heavily to meet the demands of the motor industry at a time when financial
returns are falling and costs and foreign competition rising.
Thus, adds the SAC study: 'Many medium-sized companies in the German
components industry appear to be under considerable threat. They have the
largest changes to make and face the heaviest demands'.
Their customers, the vehicle companies, are increasingly going abroad for
their vehicle parts in an attempt to curb costs. So, to compete with foreign
parts suppliers, German companies have also started moving outside their
home base.
This trend is not being followed just to keep costs down, however. Big
components companies like Robert Bosch, whose products include anti-skid
braking (ABS) and fuel injection systems, have found it necessary to build
plants outside Germany to be closer to individual markets. Thus Bosch has
built a Pounds 100m plant for alternators in Wales to raise its share of the
developing UK market, where Japanese investment has led to a new lease of
life.
Among the vehicle makers, Mercedes-Benz is also looking towards the UK where
it sees the potential to increase purchases of components from local
companies offering competitive prices. In addition, a number of German
suppliers apart from Bosch, such as Siemens and VDO, have set up units in
the UK to sell to the revived car industry there; others are following.
The car makers themselves are also finding it increasingly necessary to move
abroad if they are to keep up with market developments. Hence the decision
of BMW, a rival to Mercedes in the luxury segment, to invest in a new site
in the US.
So while these may be exciting and fast-moving times for components and
vehicle makers, they are also some of the most testing the German automotive
industry has been through in the post-war period.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (1): Going gets even
tougher - As car and truck makers seek ways to shore up their sagging
profitability, the components industry is experiencing painful shock waves /
Assessment of the prospects for manufacturers facing up to an era of
restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE competitive screw is being tightened remorselessly on the world's
automotive components suppliers, as car and truck makers seek urgently for
ways to shore up their sagging profitability.
With bought-in components usually accounting for at least 50 per cent of the
costs of a car - Ford purchases alone totalled nearly Dollars 53bn in 1990 -
it is little coincidence that the vehicle assemblers look first to squeeze
their suppliers, when the going gets tough.
The resulting shock waves that pass through the automotive components
industry are being felt most painfully by the army of suppliers to General
Motors, the world's largest vehicle maker, who are still trying to come to
terms with the latest convulsions in Detroit, as GM seeks to staunch its
record losses. GM is looking to global components sourcing as one of its
main routes to short-term financial recovery.
Ominously for suppliers Mr Robert Stempel, GM's hard-pressed chairman,
warned recently that the group would 'use the global purchasing power of GM
to reduce material costs and accelerate the return of our North American
operations to profitability. We need to leverage the worldwide volume of GM
to buy our material and components at best prices.'
GM, the wounded elephant of the world auto industry, which last year
suffered a massive Dollars 4.5bn deficit, the largest annual loss ever
recorded by a US company, is finally being forced to take radical actions to
put its house in order.
Mr Stempel says GM is 'aggressively pursuing' five key business strategies
to try to bring its sprawling North American auto operations back into
profit. These include:
instituting global sourcing,
accelerating the implementation of lean production,
significantly reducing the number of GM vehicle platforms (the basic
underbodies that spawn a range of cars) with greater use of common
components between vehicle lines,
cutting back North American manufacturing capacity, and
putting into effect an aggressive new product programme.
Some of these strategies will take time to show through in the profit and
loss account, but the reduction of the purchasing bill can bear immediate
fruit.
In recent weeks GM has established a worldwide purchasing organisation,
headed by one of the key executives from its successful European operations,
Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Mr Lopez, GM vice-president in charge of
worldwide purchasing with effect from May 1, has also become a member of
both of GM's North American and European strategy boards.
He has already stunned the US component industry by indicating, at a meeting
last month with top executives of 600 suppliers and 200 GM purchasing
managers, that existing GM contracts are open to new bids. It is thought
that GM could be seeking more than the 7 per cent price cuts over three
years it had already begun to demand last year. The carrot Mr Lopez is
dangling is the opportunity to sell products to GM worldwide under long-term
contracts.
According to Mr Stempel long-term contracts, some for the life of a new
model, would provide suppliers with the necessary volume to support their
capital investments to reduce costs and improve quality. 'We're going to
concentrate on suppliers who meet our cost and quality standards.'
The pressures on GM are being felt by all vehicle makers, and the crucial
relationship between the vehicle producers and their suppliers is being
fundamentally transformed.
The leading vehicle makers are creating global operations, forcing the
component producers to match this international expansion if they wish to
maintain their central supplier roles. At the same time they are off-setting
research and development spending by globally sourcing their component
requirements, increasingly in the form of built-up systems.
The vehicle makers are using larger purchasing volumes - sometimes in
alliances as in the case of Renault of France and Volvo of Sweden - in order
to push down supply costs.
Renault and Volvo announced late last month far-reaching steps to achieve a
genuine joint purchasing strategy 'to control costs by reducing purchasing
prices' with the aim of bringing the proportion of the two groups' total
purchases from joint outside suppliers to 80 per cent from only 15 per cent
today.
The vehicle makers are also drastically cutting the number of their
suppliers to simplify their purchasing relationships and to delegate more
responsibilities to their main so-called first tier suppliers.
Ford has reduced its worldwide supplier base by more than half from 1980
levels and intends to reduce it by an additional third by 1995. Ford of
Europe has cut the number of its suppliers by 15 per cent to 900 since 1988
and plans to shrink the total to 600 by 1995.
In response, the component manufacturers are being forced into an era of
drastic restructuring. The market leaders are seeking to establish a
presence in all the principal vehicle- producing regions of the world with
global representation in terms of production plants.
According to Mr Noel Goutard, chairman and chief executive of Valeo, the
leading French auto components maker, 'We must migrate with our European
clients eastwards to countries such as Russia and China, and we must
accompany the Japanese in their incursion into the west, Europe and the US,
as well as build up our presence in Japan.'
The component makers are having to concentrate their R &amp; D resources to
establish a competitive edge in principal technologies, while also gaining
the necessary scale of production volumes to be able to compete on price and
to ensure financial survival.
It is a high risk business. 'Our fate as components and systems suppliers
depends on the capacity to survive of each of our customers. In the
merciless war being waged in the automotive industry, there are winners and
losers,' says Mr Goutard. 'When the losers fall, their suppliers frequently
stand to suffer heavy losses and the big investments made to serve the
customer are reduced to ashes.'
Leading component suppliers are taking on a considerably enhanced role as
the vehicle makers seek to delegate more component and systems research and
development work to the supply industry.
According to Mr Goutard, suppliers are 'no longer just producers of parts
for vehicle manufacturers. We have become providers of services including
the development of products and systems with a high advanced research
content. We supply manufacturers with logistics and we finance their
inventory.' He maintains that the financial pressures on the supplier sector
have greatly increased. 'Our customers make us finance inventory,
developments, heavy R &amp; D resources, tooling.'
Longer-term partnerships are emerging linking the vehicle producers with
favoured suppliers. Replacing the old adversarial relationships is not
always proving easy, however, and a wide credibility gap often yawns between
industry rhetoric and practice. 'Purchasing policies still vary enormously
from one manufacturer to another,' says Mr Goutard.
The era of global expansion by the Japanese vehicle makers has set fresh
challenges raising the vehicle manufacturers' requirements in terms of
price, quality and delivery.
The spread of Japanese vehicle production plants to North America and now to
Europe has also heralded an unprecedented level of direct involvement by the
vehicle producers in their suppliers' operations and businesses. The vehicle
makers take it for granted that they will share directly and immediately in
efficiency and productivity gains made by their suppliers. Increasingly they
are sending in their own advisory teams to work directly in suppliers'
plants.
The expansion of the Japanese presence is also creating a new wave of trade
conflicts, most importantly between the US and Japan. This year Washington
and Detroit have joined forces to an unprecedented degree - highlighted by
the acrimonious visit by President Bush to Tokyo earlier this year
accompanied by a business delegation including all the chairmen of the big
three US vehicle makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
The US initiative has brought fresh promises from the Japanese motor
industry to buy more US components both for use in Japan and in the Japanese
car plants in North America, but the recent concessions will scarcely dent
the chronic US automotive trade deficit with Japan.
Within North America, the US administration is using customs regulations on
local content to try to force Japanese vehicle makers to use more
locally-produced components - Honda's Canadian car production is the test
case - while a barrage of protective trade legislation has been proposed in
Congress aimed at limiting Japanese market share and vehicle production in
the US and at cutting the trade deficit.
To date, Japanese component makers have followed the Japanese vehicle makers
more into North America than into Europe, but the established North American
and European component suppliers must capture new business from the incoming
Japanese transplant operations, if they are to succeed and supplement
sometimes shrinking business with their traditional customers.
According to ELM, the US automotive analysts, Japanese automakers produced
1.62m cars, 295,000 light trucks, 321,000 transmissions and 735,000 engines
in the US and Canada in 1991. 'Each of these figures is expected to increase
substantially over the next five years. In 1991, 18 per cent of the cars
built in North America were built in assembly plants owned or controlled by
Japanese automakers.'
ELM claims that the number of Japanese parts suppliers with plants in North
America supplying the Japanese automakers' North American assembly plants
rose from 220 in 1990 to 276 in 1992. At the same time, the number of US
companies supplying these same Japanese automakers in North America rose
from 309 in 1990 to 372 by early 1992.
Auto components companies face, too, a difficult challenge from changing
technologies and must move quickly to adapt to the shift to electronics, the
move to lighter weight materials, and the impact of government regulations
requiring alternative fuel vehicles, and setting much tougher exhaust
emissions and safety standards. Almost all principal components are being
transformed through the introduction of electronics.
It is a daunting challenge for the component suppliers. According to Mr
Harold Poling, chairman and chief executive of Ford, one of the most
pressing objectives for the vehicle makers is to bring new products to the
market faster. 'We intend to reduce product development time by 25 per cent,
and our suppliers will play a key role in meeting this goal.
'We will need supplier partners who can commit early in the product
development cycle, work with us to better integrate design and manufacturing
requirements and be full-time, full-service participants in the process of
bringing a car or truck to market.'

WITH ALL eyes on Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council, many traders
in the derivatives market stayed on the sidelines and there were few
features to enliven a quiet session, writes Christopher Price.
The September contract on the FT-SE future opened at 2,499 and some early
buying interest saw the contract bid up to 2,507. This, however, turned out
to be its highest point of the day, as buyers turned shy, preoccupied with
weekend press speculation over the gloomy outlook for interest rates, a
possible sterling devaluation, and/or a realignment of the ERM. Inevitably,
the focus of traders' attention was this Thursday's Bundesbank meeting.
From the mid-morning, September drifted away in lifeless trading. A minor
lunchtime rally was quickly quashed and the afternoon session remained under
a cloud, as flat gilts, US bonds and short sterling added to the air of
despondency.
September closed at 2,492, down 17 from the previous session and at a
3-point premium to its fair value of around 13. Turnover was a meagre 5,441.
In traded options, only a big order in TSB enlivened an otherwise quiet
session. A total of 1,180 contracts was dealt, with the December 140 calls
accounting for 800 in one order.
Midland Bank recorded 921 contracts, as dealers sought to close positions,
and ICI managed 681. However, overall a lowly total of 20,613 contracts were
traded.

FT  14 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt tax fears join
dollar and interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
APPREHENSION ahead of the Bundesbank meeting on Thursday combined with a
weaker dollar to depress bourses yesterday. Paris was closed for the
Bastille holiday and will re-open on Wednesday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT added higher taxes to its fears, singling out carmakers after
weekend newspaper stories saying that driving in Germany would become 30 per
cent more expensive.
BMW dropped DM9.50 to DM571, Daimler by DM11.50 to DM746 and Volkswagen by
DM8.20 to DM373.70 as the FAZ index shed 6.78 to 687.08 at midsession, and
the DAX by 17.98 to 1,736.50 at the close. However, turnover fell from DM4bn
to DM3.9bn and dealers said that both investment thinking, and trading was
extremely short term.
Deutsche Bank made Daimler a trading sell yesterday. There was also a report
that slowing growth, more international competition and technological
advances could cause the German car industry to lose up to 200,000 jobs from
its current total of 780,000.
After hours, the transport minister, Mr Gunther Krause, denied a report that
he wanted petrol taxes raised, although he defended his call for the
introduction of motorway user fees.
Siemens fell DM7.10 to DM654.40 on talk was that Deutsche Bank was a seller.
In retailing, Massa followed its former major shareholder, Asko, into
troubled waters, reporting big extraordinary costs and halving the dividend;
its shares fell DM9 to DM190.
MILAN drifted lower after a quiet start but was enlivened towards the end of
the session when a domestic broker actively bought shares in Montedison and
Generali. The Comit index fell 1.2 to 441.05 in turnover estimated at less
than Friday's L117.6bn. Dealers said that 90-95 per cent of options were
abandoned when they expired yesterday.
Generali closed L215 down at L27,445 before rebounding to L27,800 while
Montedison closed L7 lower at L1,410 but reached L1,435 after hours.
In a generally easier telecom sector, Sip fell L23 to L1,175 on uncertainty
about the effects of the government's plans to freeze tariffs. But
Italcable, which manages telephone traffic between Italy and non-European
countries, bucked the trend, adding L90 to L4,530.
At a presentation in London yesterday, the company said that outgoing calls
rose 42 per cent in the last four months, which it attributed to the big
improvement in the network as a result of heavy investment by Sip and
Italcable. Regarding the current reform of the sector, the company forecast
that its turnover would double if it were granted the European traffic
previously managed by ASST. It estimated the cost of the transfer at roughly
1.6 per cent of its revenues for the first three years, plus payment for the
proportion of the assets it would inherit from ASST, which it would
depreciate over the next seven years. The big question mark, however, was
what proportion of ASST's 18,000 employees Italcable would have to take on.
ZURICH fell on interest rate fears, the SMI index closing 15.0 lower at
1,841.5. Adia, the temporary employment agency, plunged again, the shares
falling SFr27, or 9 per cent to SFr258 on a depressing interim report for
1992.
AMSTERDAM weakened on the dollar and interest rate uncertainty, the CBS
Tendency index closing 1.4 lower at 203.7.
News that Tandy was to cease selling Philips' CD-I system through its US
outlets contributed to a 40 cent decline in its shares which closed at Fl
28.80. Elsevier went against the trend, rising 60 cents to Fl 107.90.
BRUSSELS fell back with SGB losing BFr95 to BFr2,025 in volume of only
13,900 shares. The Bel-20 index ended 5.51 lower at 1,166.20 in turnover of
BFr507m.
Solvay was one of the few stocks to rise on the day, advancing BFr250 to
BFr12,500 in volume of just 4,575 shares.
MADRID gained ground with the general index advancing 0.5 to 235.75. Popular
rose Pta60 to Pta10,930 after reporting a 19 per cent increase in first half
consolidated net profit.
VIENNA continued to decline with OMV, the oil group, losing another Sch62 or
8.4 per cent to Sch675. The ATX index closed down 24 at 865.07, a fall of
2.7 per cent.
The weakness in OMV affected other stocks, with Creditanstalt preferred
shares declining Sch21 to Sch465 and Bundeslander preferred shedding Sch20
to Sch630.
STOCKHOLM fell back, reversing a two-day recovery which had brought the
market off its lowest level for the year which it reached last Wednesday.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 9.2 to 888.1, in thin turnover of
SKr289m after SKr280m.
Astra, the session's most active issue with turnover of SKr38m, saw its A
shares fall SKr4 to SKr546, while its B shares lost SKr5 to SKr527.
COPENHAGEN was shored up by shipping shares, selected banks and industrials
as the CSE index rose 0.33 to 318.47.
In shipping, AP Moeller's D/S 1912 rose DKr1,000 to DKr92,500, while D/S
Svendborg climbed DKr700 to DKr131,000. Among banks, Unidanmark rose DKr2 to
DKr175, although Den Danske Bank slipped DKr2 to DKr266.
OSLO's all-share index lost 5.84 or 1.5 per cent to 391.05 in turnover of
NKr138m. UNI Storebrand A lost NKr4 to Nkr28 on unconfirmed reports that the
insurer was to seek new capital through a planned share issue of NKr1.4bn.
Norsk Hydro fell NKr3 to NKr152.5.
ISTANBUL fell slightly in low volume. The 75-share index closed down 27.95
at 4,356.39.

FT  14 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Bundesbank keeps investors guessing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The weakness of the dollar and concern about the German economy subdued
European bourses last week, while South Africa and Mexico fell sharply on
local issues, leaving the FT-Actuaries World Index easier on the week.
Some analysts note that they expect activity in Europe to remain dull ahead
of Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank central council, at which it will
review its monetary target for 1992. There are expectations that the
Bundesbank will increase the minimum reserve requirements for German banks.
Austria was Europe's weakest bourse after Thursday's sudden resignation of
OMV's chairman, Mr Siegfried Meysel, and the announcement that the oil group
expected to report first-half losses of some Sch500m (Dollars 47m). This
news propelled the market to a low for the year.
Only Norway managed to resist the downward trend, although there was no
significant explanation. In its rec-ent review of the market, Kleinwort
Benson notes that shipping rates could pick up towards the end of the year,
helped by, among other factors, the larger than expected scrapping of old
vessels and increased western demand for oil.
The acquisition of a 54 per cent stake in Spain's largest cement
manufacturer by Cemex, the Mexican cement company, was poorly received by
foreign investors and the group saw its shares drop some 16 per cent. Latin
American Securities comments that the negative reaction was partly due to
the fact that Cemex intended to use cash from its recent equity issue to
make new acquisitions rather than reduce its debt load.
South Africa remained depressed by the uncertain political situation, while
Malaysia was the only Pacific Rim market to rise. Rumours that Magnum, the
Malaysian gaming operator, will be awarded lottery franchises in southern
China helped to boost activity.

FT  14 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rally in futures market
helps Nikkei advance 2.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RALLY in the futures market prompted small-lot index buying in cash
stocks, and the Nikkei average advanced 2.5 per cent, moving above the
17,000 level for the first time since June 12, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 418.01 to close at the day's best of 17,201.73, after a
low of 16,742.27 registered in the morning session. Volume, however, plunged
to 180m shares from Friday's 310m. Rises outnumbered declines by 622 to 265,
with 191 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks
improved 15.37 to 1,298.95. In London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
0.50 to 1,028.06.
In spite of the rise, traders were discouraged by the inactivity of
investors. Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg Securities said: 'It is like looking
into a cloudy crystal ball - you cannot read too much into price movements.'
He added that investors will not become buyers until 'fundamentally good
reasons appear'.
In contrast to the lethargic cash market, active buying supported futures.
'There was constant large-lot buying which seemed to be short-covering,'
said Mr Masa Sato, derivatives trader at Dai-Ichi Securities.
Due to the lack of news, dealers continued to target short-term theme
stocks. Taiyo Fishery, a leading fishery company planning to breed blue-fin
tuna, rose Y12 to Y495 and Meiji Milk Products, currently developing an
anti-Aids drug, climbed Y17 to Y987.
Low-priced high-technology and car issues, viewed as potential takeover
targets, were in demand. Fuji Heavy Industries, the car concern currently
restructuring itself, was the most active issue of the day and put on Y5 to
Y400. Ricoh, the office automation company, added Y9 at Y582.
Banks were firmer on small-lot buying by investment trusts. Industrial Bank
of Japan moved forward Y30 to Y1,700 and Sakura Bank Y18 to Y980.
Mazda Motor appreciated Y12 to Y475. Investors were encouraged by reports
that the company plans to tie up with Mercedes-Benz in the development of
anti-pollution cars.
Raito Kogyo, the civil engineering group, lost Y80 to Y2,050. The stock fell
by its daily limit last Friday on reports of alleged defective construction
on a dam project. Investors were further discouraged by reports that a
two-month suspension from public works has been placed on the company.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 229.15 to 19,599.17 in volume of 4.8m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y100 to Y11,300 as a
stabilisation in currency movements made some leading blue chip exporters
attractive.
Roundup
TOKYO'S recovery was not reflected elsewhere in the region.
HONG KONG saw heavy buying in HSBC as the bank replaced Midland Bank, its
long-sought acquisition, in the FT-SE 100 index. HSBC closed at a 1992 high
of HKDollars 52, up HKDollars 3. Brokers said HSBC's agreement to sell its
10 per cent stake in Cathay Pacific for HKDollars 3.39bn also encouraged
buying.
The sale also boosted Cathay's price, which jumped 70 cents to HKDollars
12.60. The Hang Seng index closed 104.49, or 1.75 per cent, higher at
6,085.85, with turnover up from HKDollars 3.34bn to HKDollars 3.64bn.
KUALA LUMPUR rose further in active trade. Volume rose to 89.2m shares from
95m as the KLSE composite index added 4.51 at 616.08.
Utility Tenaga, which sparked the current rally when fund managers bought
the stock aggressively last week, gained 10 cents to MDollars 10.10 after an
intraday low of MDollars 9.70. Volume was a heavy 4.7m shares.
AUSTRALIA lost ground on poor retail trade figures, the All Ordinaries index
slipping 5.5 to 1,638.9. Most retailers were hit, but QIW, embroiled in a
hostile takeover battle with Davids Holdings, was a notable exception,
rising 16 cents to ADollars 6.76 as two strong buyers bid up the market.
SINGAPORE was pulled down by selective blue chip selling, particularly of
Overseas Union Bank. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 4.17 to
1,482.88 in volume of 60.9m shares (51.2m). OUB fell 30 cents to SDollars
5.10 in brisk volume of about 3m shares.
Sembawang Shipyard declined 20 cents to SDollars 7.65 following a weekend
fire aboard a chemical tanker under repair at the yard. The fire killed six
people and injured 60.
TAIWAN fell in thin, nervous trade, the weighted index weakening 72.14, or
1.7 per cent, to 4,312.38 in turnover of TDollars 19.8bn, against TDollars
15.7bn in Saturday's shortened session.
SEOUL's index lost 6.96 to 512.54 on rumours that a second scandal was about
to break. MANILA's investors took to the sidelines as the composite index
retreated 31.55 to 1,444.73.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India's tea crop likely to
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA, THE world's biggest tea producer, is likely to harvest a crop of 730m
kg in the current year, compared with 741.7m kg in 1991, when production
increased by 27m kg.
In its annual review, J. Thomas &amp; Company, the tea auction house, says that
while north India could match last year's crop of 556.7m kg, a big
production shortfall in the south Indian estates is feared.
According to the review, India is unlikely to find export markets for more
than 200m kg of tea, against 203m kg last year, following the disintegration
of the Soviet Union, which used to account for more than half its overseas
sales.
India has signed tea export protocols with Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
for a total of 65m kg. But the review says: 'It is possible that the
Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) may import
similar quantities as in the previous year from the world market, with
Indian teas comprising a major share, but Indian exports to the CIS are
unlikely to be as dominant as in 1991.' J. Thomas believes, moreover, that
Russia and the other former Soviet republics will be operating in lower
price bands than in earlier years.
The situations in Iraq and Yugoslavia add to India's concerns. The UK,
Germany, Poland, Iran, Egypt and Japan are, however, expected to buy more
Indian tea this year. As for prices, the review says that good quality CTC
(cut, tear and curl) and orthodox teas should be commanding healthy
premiums, while poorer orthodox as well as plain and medium CTC 'may fall
into a high risk area due to more subdued operations by the CIS'.
In view of the disposition of quality conscious Indian consumers to pay
'premiums for good CTC teas', J. Thomas recommends that the industry should
concentrate on the production of quality tea to remain viable. Unlike the
other tea producing countries, India has a huge domestic market for tea, of
some 539m kg last year.
The sharp widening of the price differential between good and plain
categories since last year will encourage gardens in general to improve
their agricultural practices.
According to J. Thomas, Indian gardens are likely to concentrate on the
production of CTC tea, since no one is sure of the support to be lent to
orthodox tea by Russia and the other republics. Indian green tea production
will, however, remain at about 8m kg.

COPPER prices appeared to be consolidating at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday after the three months position was trimmed back from a morning
high at the equivalent of Dollars 2,510 a tonne, dealers said, adding that
the uptrend might be resumed later. The price ended at Dollars 2,493 a
tonne, up Dollars 23 from the pre-weekend level. In other LME markets the
trend was modestly downwards, notably in ZINC, where the cash price fall of
Dollars 10 to Dollars 1,292 a tonne widened its discount against three
months metal by Dollars 7 to Dollars 22 a tonne. Three months NICKEL closed
Dollars 80 lower at Dollars 7,515 a tonne after commission house liquidation
triggered stop-loss selling orders. Talk of an imminent 3-month closure of a
Chinese nickel smelter for maintenance had little impact. At the London
bullion market dealers described GOLD as subdued but steady and no further
attempt was made to breach upside resistance at Dollars 350 a troy ounce,
although healthy physical offtake from the jewellery trade was reported to
be lending extra support. The price closed 25 cents up at Dollars 348.70 an
ounce. Patchy buying on continuing South African worries helped PLATINUM to
gain Dollars 1.85 at Dollars 386.85 an ounce.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa prices slip back from 2
1/2 -month highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING halted the London cocoa futures market's bull run yesterday
after speculative and trade buying had pushed prices to fresh 2 1/2 -month
highs.
Early dealings saw a continuation of the almost uninterrupted uptrend that
had lifted the September position from the 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 509 a
tonne reached on June 25. But the profit-taking began when the Pounds
632-a-tonne level was reached and by the close the September position was
just Pounds 2 up on the day at Pounds 616 a tonne. There were also
unconfirmed reports of modest sales by producers, whose resolute absence
from the market over the past few weeks had helped to sustain the upward
move.
However, just as they had been reluctant to write off the preceding
downtrend when prices began rising in late June, dealers were unready
yesterday to administer the last rites to the recent bull run. Chart
patterns still looked constructive, they said, following the breach during
the morning rise of last week's September position high of Pounds 622 a
tonne.
The coffee market followed a similar pattern, with London's September
robusta futures position climbing to a 2-month high of Dollars 791 in the
morning. But volume was very thin and when selling began the market quickly
moved into the red. By the close, September coffee had slipped back to
Dollars 760 a tonne, down Dollars 16 on the day.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cornish mine has '20 years of
reserves'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNWALL'S SOLE surviving working tin mine, at South Crofty near Camborne,
which was almost killed off last year, should be able to continue well into
the next century, according to Mr Kevin Ross, managing director of Carnon
Holdings, the mine's owner.
'We currently have 20 years of reserves and I am very confident that we can
continue mining well into the future,' he said yesterday.
South Crofty was now operating profitably following the recent strong rise
in the international tin price, which has been at its highest level for 18
months. he said. The mine was not far off full break-even at present prices.
Mr Ross said break-even was at Pounds 3,750 to Pounds 3,800 a tonne. Last
night tin for delivery in three months closed on the London Metal Exchange
at Dollars 7,052.50 a tonne, equivalent to Pounds 3,715.
Mr Ross said South Crofty would produce about 2,000 tonnes of tin in
concentrates this year - all of it sent for refining to the DKS smelter in
Malaysia.
Carnon's Wheal Jane tin mine, near Truro, was killed off by the
extraordinary low prices in 1990. In February last year it seemed that South
Crofty was also doomed, when the UK government withdrew promised funding
without warning and refused to pay the final Pounds 1.7m of a Pounds 24.7m
interest-free loan.
Carnon had to make all its 415 employees redundant and covered the cost of
redundancy payments and other outstanding debts by selling equipment from
Wheal Jane, surplus land and processing 40,000 tonnes of stockpiled ore,
most of it underground at South Crofty.
Some 205 volunteers came back to work on new contracts - everyone, including
the managing director, worked for Pounds 4.25 an hour or about 60 per cent
of the previous average wage at the mine - which so changed the economics
that it became worthwhile mining again. As the tin price has risen, miners'
pay has been lifted to 'near the local average', said Mr Ross.
Carnon was bought by its managers from the RTZ Corporation, the world's
biggest mining company, in March 1988. Managers shared 80 per cent of the
equity and the rest was held in trust for employees. The company had a
Pounds 10m interest-free loan from RTZ as well as the government loan.
In July last year, Carnon won outline planning permission for a Pounds 35m
leisure centre on the Wheal Jane site. Mr Ross said this had been shelved
until the property market improved, but Carnon was continuing to go through
the planning process.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: English farm survey shows big
switch to contracting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 40 per cent of the farms in England's central counties have
embarked on programmes of diversification, but the most popular new business
is that which trades on existing assets: contracting for other farmers.
This emerges from a survey of more than 1,100 agricultural, horticultural
and other rural businesses in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and
Warwickshire. The survey was carried out for the local training and
enterprise councils, the Heart of England Agricultural Training Board and
the Rural Development Commission.
The results not only indicate the speed of change on British farms,
stimulated by European Community attempts to bring price support spending
under control, but also imply that the moves towards farm diversification
have made only limited progress towards stabilising the rural economy.
Analysis of response to questions, relating to business, the rural workforce
and training failed to establish the extent to which diversification
activities 'either increase employment opportunities or fully employ
existing labour'.
Nearly half of the diversified farms had become engaged in contracting, the
survey showed, as farmers sought greater use from existing investment.
Indeed, the report noted, 'the most popular diversifications appear to be
those trading on existing assets rather than those requiring high capital
outlay'.
Against the background of steady decline in the farm workforce - a 9 per
cent reduction over the last five years in the three counties - farmers are
using more outside labour.
The survey showed that over two-thirds of farms used contractors, just under
a half used casual labour and that a fifth used self-employed workers.
But Mr Nigel Gaynor, director of the Heart of England Agricultural Training
Board, has doubts about how far contracting can be taken as a
diversification. 'A big question arises: there must be a finite amount of
work that can be done by contracting,' he said.
More certain is the fact that farmers in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and
Warwickshire are engaged in a continuing search to reduce fixed costs. This
prompted the report both to predict an increase in the use of outside labour
and to note the introduction in the area of machinery rings.
After contracting, the most common farm diversification is retail outlets
(provided by 27 per cent of farms), followed by the provision of holiday
accommodation and leisure activities. But all these activities are at least
partially dependent for their success on consumer spending, which has been
flattened by the recession.

<DATELINE>
   PERTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN manganese producer Portman Mining says it has reached agreement
with the Ukrainian government on a joint venture to expand a large
underground manganese mine in southern Ukraine, reports Reuter from Perth.
Portman is to complete a feasibility study on the mine, at Stepnogorsk in
the Bolshoy-Tokmak area of the Nikopol manganese basin, before entering a
55:45 venture to develop the project.
Mr Brian Johnson, Portman's executive director, said that total ore reserves
of the Bolshoy-Tokmak deposit have been calculated at more than 1bn tonnes,
making it one of the world's largest known manganese ore bodies.
Portman is to earn its 55 per cent interest in the venture by providing a
plant with a capacity of 1m tonnes of ore a year.
It will also offer management, marketing and working capital to allow
production to be expanded to 1m tonnes a year, from 250,000 tonnes at
present, and will investigate the possibility of having the ore smelted at a
ferro alloy smelter at Nikopol.
The processed ore is used as feedstock by ferro manganese alloy producers,
mainly in Europe, Russia and China.
Mr Johnson said he would not disclose Portman's expected investment in the
venture until it is formalised later this year. 'But it is within the
company's ability to finance the project from existing cash flow and it will
not require external loans for development.'
He added: 'The Ukraine project should give Portman Mining competitive access
to sections of the European manganese market as well as potential large
volume sales to the Russian steel industry at a later date.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop breeders hail 'super
cassava' - An advance in the fight against famine in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROP BREEDERS are calling it 'super cassava'. A breakthrough in the breeding
of Africa's most widely grown staple food, cassava, has led to the
development of a high-yielding variety which could survive in drought
conditions and be the continent's most important hope for overcoming famine.
Cassava - which is known in some countries as manioc - is a root crop that
produces a tuber resembling a large potato. It grows in poor soils, does not
require chemical fertiliser and needs little rain. The plant's long roots
tap soil moisture deep in the ground; when drought strikes, cassava has a
'defensive mechanism' which causes its leaves to drop while the tubers
survive. This has led to the claim: 'Where there is cassava there is no
hunger'.
'In times of drought, cassava will survive when other crops wither, says Mr
Alfred Dixon, a crop breeder at the International Institute of Tropical
Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria. The institute - which celebrates its
25th anniversary on July 24 - is one of 16 worldwide centres belonging to
the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. It is trying
to increase the productivity of key African food crops, such as cassava, and
to develop sustainable systems that replace 'slash and burn' techniques.
Processed cassava is eaten daily by some 300m people in Africa, around
two-thirds of the continent's population, and also in parts of Latin America
and Asia - the largest producers are Nigeria, Brazil and Thailand. Although
it grows extensively across west and central Africa, the crop only grows in
small pockets in southern Africa, the region now affected by the worst
drought for 50 years.
About half of Africa's cassava is used for subsistence needs and half for
commercial purposes. The crop has the advantage that it can be stored in the
ground for over a year, giving farmers the freedom to eat or sell it when
the need arises. Cassava's disadvantage is that while high in calorie
content, it is low in protein. But its nutritional value can be increased by
adding protein-rich crops such as soyabean.
To try to develop high-yielding varieties of cassava, crop breeders at IITA
crossed cultivated species with a wild species of the plants, and say they
discovered spontaneous 'polyploids' with up to four times the normal number
of chromosomes. The more chromosomes there are in a plant, the more chance
of higher yields
When breeders tested the new polyploids at research stations in different
areas, they tried as far as possible to grow them in the conditions that
exist on farmers' fields. The results exceeded expectations. Whereas the
best existing variety of cassava - known as TMS 30572 - yields an average of
23 tonnes a hectare 'on station', the new varieties yielded between 50 to 70
tonnes per hectare. Cassava yields an average of 12 tonnes a hectare on
African farms.
The polyploids are now being tested on selected farms. Korean crop breeder
Mr Sang-Ki Hahn, who leads IITA's cassava programme, is hopeful of yields up
to 40 tonnes a hectare on farms, giving farmers two to three times more than
their existing harvests. This would mean substantially more food being grown
in Africa by Africans and would offer many countries the prospect of
reducing food imports.
'The polyploids offer the potential for a very significant breakthrough,'
believes Mr Lukas Brader, IITA's director general.
For southern African countries the availability of 'super cassava' could
lead to far-reaching changes in agriculture. Maize, the staple food across
most of southern Africa, is highly vulnerable to drought, and researchers
have been unable to develop maize varieties that can cope with drought. 'In
southern Africa there is now tremendous interest in increasing cassava
production,' says Mr Brader.
An Eastern and Southern African Root Crops Network was set up in 1977 to
help countries develop root crops. IITA officials say that Zimbabwe is
trying to start a large-scale cassava programme and that Zambia is
interested in extending its crop. In Uganda, a World Bank project is helping
to expand the area under cassava.
Like maize, a small proportion of cassava output is used for animal feed and
for industrial purposes such as making beer, cosmetics and starches.
'Cassava could be used instead of maize for such purposes,' says Mr Dixon,
'leaving more maize for food.'
IITA officials believe that the new varieties of cassava will make the crop
highly attractive to farmers across Africa, both for their own food security
and also as a profitable commercial crop. The continent's growing population
is leading to increased demand for cassava, which is reflected in
substantially higher prices in many areas. In Ibadan, it is fetching Naria
1,500 (Pounds 43) a tonne compared with N180 a year ago.
An IITA survey of cassava in Africa found that in 275 villages (in six
countries that had not experienced famine), cassava was grown as the main
crop in half of them. The survey revealed that in villages where cassava was
increasingly cultivated, 30 per cent of villagers said they were growing
more of the crop as a security against hunger and famine, 25 per cent said
it was because of growing population, while 20 per cent cited a good local
market.
Crop breeders are cautiously optimistic that the new varieties will give
Africa a long-overdue breakthrough to higher food output. 'Africa shall
survive,' believes Mr Hahn, 'because of polyploidy in cassava.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Turn of UK investors to
support gilts programme - Changes in funding patterns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE anecdotal evidence to the contrary, domestic institutions rather
than overseas investors are now supporting the UK government's borrowing
programme.
With a forecast public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 32bn, net
issues of gilt-edged securities are likely to reach at least Pounds 27bn by
March 1993. Many analysts expect net issuance to top Pounds 30bn as the
economy deteriorates through the second half of this year.
Substantial overseas buying is required to support new issuance of gilts on
this scale. UK investment institutions - mainly pension funds and life
insurance companies - are expected to receive cash inflows of around Pounds
38bn this year. Historically, they invest less than 10 per cent in sterling
bonds.
The evidence of 1991 suggested the international appetite for sterling bonds
was strong. With sterling linked within the European exchange rate
mechanism, the currency risk of holding sterling bonds is reduced for a
continental European investor. Overseas buyers took Pounds 6bn gilts in the
course of the year, against Pounds 9bn sold to UK investors.
The pattern continued in the first quarter of this year. Overseas buyers
took Pounds 1.8bn, domestic investors Pounds 3.1bn.
However, since the UK general election on April 9, the official statistics
have tilted in favour of UK investors. Gilts sales to domestic investors
totalled Pounds 7.6bn in April and May, against just Pounds 836m to overseas
investors.
Analysts point out the statistics are not wholly reliable. Mr Peter Fellner,
analyst at NatWest Capital Markets, estimated a Pounds 100m monthly margin
of error. For example, overseas funds managed by a UK fund manager may be
booked as a domestic sale.
The pattern of buying in April and May has also corrected an imbalance
accumulated in the run-up to the election.
'UK institutions went into the election very short of gilts,' commented Mr
John Kendall, UK economist at Barings. 'We saw a correction in the weeks
after April 9.'
The correction has been accentuated by the Bank of England's decision to
issue long-dated gilts, which do not usually attract overseas buying. The
last auction, Pounds 2.75bn stock maturing 2012, underlined the strategy.
Analysts link overseas buying of gilts to the position of sterling within
the ERM. Although the mechanism has moderated the risk of wild fluctuations
in the pound's value, investment returns are still subject to currency risk
while sterling is within a wide 6 per cent divergence band.
With sterling trading above its DM2.95 central rate, continental European
investors see little incentive to buy gilts. When sterling is near the
bottom of its permitted ERM bands - as it was in the first quarter of the
year - currency risk is far less.
On this argument, overseas buying will return if sterling falls on the
foreign exchange markets. The danger is that the weakness of sterling is now
kindling speculation about a devaluation within the ERM. This could
discourage overseas buyers.
The behaviour of domestic institutions partly reflects the poor performance
of equities. However, there is little evidence of switching out of shares
and into gilts.
According to gilts traders, most bond purchases have been funded out of new
money - other than some modest switching into index-linked gilts when
guaranteed real yields were around 4.25 per cent.
There is plenty of scope for purchases of gilts before portfolio weightings
are even back to the levels of 1980. For example, the average pension fund
had around 20 per cent in gilts in 1980 including index-linked paper,
against around 7 to 8 per cent currently.

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Matsushita prepares first Dollars 1bn
global launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA, the Japanese electronics group, was yesterday preparing to
launch a global bond issue of at least Dollars 1bn, the first global issue
by a corporation.
The deal has been expected for some weeks, but yesterday bankers met to
discuss the pricing and maturity, and the launched is likely today.
Global bonds are registered securities which trade simultaneously in the US,
Eurobond and Far Eastern securities markets. The style of borrowing was
pioneered by the World Bank and has been followed by other sovereign and
supranational borrowers, but never by a company.
The Matsushita bonds are likely to be launched at an indicated yield spread
over US Treasury bonds, with the issue price and coupon fixed after launch.
A 10-year maturity, priced to yield 42 to 45 basis points more than
Treasuries was anticipated. Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston
have been mandated to jointly lead-manage the transaction.
Matsushita recently lost its top credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the
US credit rating agency, but retains the top grade from rival agency
Moody's.
The US Treasury bond market retained a weak tone yesterday after falling
heavily on Friday. Heavy issuance last week in both the Eurobond and US
corporate bond markets has left unsold paper.
Against this, Matsushita will offer a wider yield spread than the World
Bank, which last week launched a five-year global bond yielding just 5 basis
points more than Treasury bonds.
Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank struggled to breathe life into the
Eurolire market, launching a L500bn 10-year issue, lead-managed by Banca
Commerciale Italiana.
The deal attracted buying from Italian investors, who pay no withholding tax
on bonds issued by supranational agencies, of which Italy is a member.
The 11.25 per cent bonds were priced at 101.875, but by the close in London
the paper was quoted at 99.88 bid, just outside full fees of 1.875.
Abbey National launched a Dollars 200m three-year issue, aimed primarily at
retail investors in Switzerland. The paper was price to yield 42 basis
points more than treasury bonds of similar maturity.
Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered National Westminster Bank's long-term debt
rating by one notch from AA+ to AA.

GLOBAL fund managers lack knowledge of risk management instruments and are
hesitant to use them, according to a survey by the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange (Phlx).
The study found that US fund managers have a poor understanding of
sophisticated currency products, while their European colleagues are not
confident about their knowledge.
European money managers are more likely to hedge currency risks than their
US counterparts. Nearly two-thirds of European money managers questioned
said they hedged, while less than one-third of US managers did so.
This is partly explained by the fact that almost half of the European
managers have 50 per cent or more of their holdings in foreign assets. Only
16 per cent of US equity fund managers and 31 per cent of US fixed-income
fund managers have portfolios with more than 50 per cent in foreign assets.

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Seagram goes hard on soft drinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEAGRAM, one of the world's biggest producers of hard liquor, has embarked
on an ambitious and aggressive drive to become a global player in the orange
juice business.
The Canadian company - best known for its Glenlivet, Chivas Regal and
Martell labels - got into fruit juice in a big way in 1988 with the Dollars
1.2bn acquisition of Tropicana, a leading US producer of orange juice.
The deal marked Seagram's first large foray into non-alcoholic drinks.
'It was seen as a longer-term strategic investment, broadening Seagram's
base in the beverage business,' says Mr Myron Roeder, president of Tropicana
International.
Fruit juices and juice-based drinks comprise the second largest grocery
category in the US, with retail sales growing by close on 50 per cent over
the past 10 years to Dollars 11.3bn last year. Orange juice is worth in
excess of Dollars 3bn a year.
Ten years ago, ready-to-serve juice accounted for 30 per cent of sales: the
rest came from frozen concentrate. Today, ready-to-serve juice has a 56 per
cent share of the US market, and Tropicana is the ready-to-serve brand
leader.
At the time of its takeover, Tropicana had annual sales of Dollars 700m,
mainly in the eastern half of the US. By the end of 1990 the brand was being
distributed nationally with sales running at about Dollars 1.2bn a year.
Tropicana leads the overall orange juice market in the US with an estimated
volume share last year of 22 per cent. It claims to buy a quarter of
Florida's orange crop. But the brand has been extended successfully across
other fruit drinks, notably a combination of orange with cranberry and
mango.
Latterly, Tropicana has been pushing hard into international markets with
aggressive sales drives into Japan and Canada. Tropicana has entered the
Dollars 1.9bn UK market and ventured into France, but a pan-European
framework has been established in anticipation of the single European market
next year. A headquarters team has been set up in Paris.
In France, Tropicana acquired Maxime Delrue, a company which has handled its
bottled juice exports for 25 years, and has signed a distribution agreement
with Cedilac, a leading dairy company.
Tropicana has high hopes for Europe: the market is generally fragmented and
unbranded, and annual consumption per head is barely half the 40 litres of
the US. Mr Roeder sees no reason why similar growth should not be secured.
'In every country we enter, our first aim is to be the leading advertiser in
the category.'
That makes Tropicana's expansion an expensive business and this is fully
reflected in operating profits. In spite of strong sales, profits have been
flat for the past three years. After restructuring charges of Dollars 24m
last year, Seagram's income from the total juices, mixers and coolers
operations amounted to Dollars 79m against Dollars 895m from spirits and
wines.

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Gold Fields of SA to merge units

<TEXT>
GOLD Fields of South Africa, one of the country's largest mining houses,
plans to merge the operations of two of its marginal gold mines, Libanon and
Venterspost, with Kloof, one of the richest mines.
The merger arises from the precarious financial position of the Venterspost
mine, which would otherwise have been forced to close with severe knock-on
implications for Libanon and Kloof. Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said:
'The race against time has been lost.'
The merger needs to be approved by shareholders.
Venterspost made losses of nearly R9m (Dollars 3.25m) in the year to June,
while its cash assets declined to R14m compared with R139m two years
previously.
Libanon made less than R0.5m profit compared with capital expenditure of
R6.4m in the year to June. Kloof is one of the richest mines in the world,
with an average grade of 13.5 grams per tonne in the year to June and
working profits of R388m.
The three Western Transvaal mines are contiguous, and closure of the
marginal operations would have created a serious water problem for Kloof. To
deal with this problem, Kloof would have had to make investments of about
R100m for new pumps.
It would have faced extra pumping costs of about R70m a year, and production
losses of about R1bn, said Mr Munro. Pumping at Venterspost and Libanon will
cost only about R48m a year.
The merger involves shareholders in Libanon and Venterspost being given
shares in Kloof at a ratio of nine Kloof shares for every 100 Libanon shares
and six Kloof shares for every 100 Venterspost shares. Kloof will issue 6.6m
shares, a dilution of about 5 per cent on the current issued share capital
of 121m shares. The deal places a joint value of about R165m on Venterspost
and Libanon.
Mr Munro said he was confident that the integrated operation could lift
profits by the necessary 5 per cent in order to maintain the dividend at its
current level.
If the deal gets shareholder approval the restructured Kloof will have three
operating arms: the existing Kloof division, the new Leeudoorn extention to
Kloof and a composite Libanon/Venterspost operation.
The new division will produce at a rate of about 145,000 tonnes per month -
significantly less than current joint production level of about 190,000
tonnes at the two mines.
The gold mines in the Gold Fields group lifted their average grade to 8.6
grams per tonne in the June quarter, from 8.4 grams in the March quarter.
This helped lift gold production by a tonne to 30.6 tonnes.
The gold price received dropped to R31,086 per kg from R31,911 per kg in the
March quarter. This saw working profit drop to R299m from R317m. A lower tax
bill, due to a doubling in the level of capital expenditure, and higher
sundry revenue helped push after-tax profit up to R287m from R208m in March.
Doornfontein Gold Mining, a company managed by Gold Fields of South Africa,
yesterday announced a net loss of R4.91m for the second quarter ending on
June 30, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
This is an improvement on the R7.01m net loss for the previous quarter. Gold
output rose sharply from just over 1 tonne in the first quarter to 1.534
tonnes in the second quarter.

net at Intel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday reported an 8
per cent drop in second-quarter net income as heavy marketing and investment
programmes ate into record revenues.
The company, which is facing increasing competition from chip 'cloners' such
as Advanced Micro Devices, has been spending heavily on advertising to set
itself apart from the crowd on a new generation of chips.
Intel reported net income of Dollars 213m, or Dollars 1 a share, compared
with Dollars 231m, or Dollars 1.10, in the second quarter of last year.
Revenues rose 5 per cent from Dollars 1.25bn to Dollars 1.32bn. The figures
were broadly in line with market expectations.
For the first quarter of this year, Intel produced net income of Dollars
184m, or 86 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.24bn.
It said business conditions were strongest in the US and Europe. Japan and
the Asia-Pacific region, which had been relatively sluggish in recent
quarters, improved from first-quarter levels.
It said its overall microprocessor business was 'quite strong' in the second
quarter, particularly in its newer products.
Revenues from the company's older 'first wave' 386 DX and SX chips continued
to decline as a result of the personal computer market's switch to more
powerful 'second wave' systems.
Revenues of standard semiconductor products and system-level products
exceeded expectations for the quarter. The book-to-bill ratio for the period
exceeded 1.0.

<TEXT>
HILTON Hotels, the California-based casinos and lodging group, reported
second-quarter profits of Dollars 32.4m, up from Dollars 23.6m in the same
period a year earlier. The result follows sharply higher results from its
Nevada gaming interests.
Total revenue was just 3 per cent higher at Dollars 294.8m.
Hilton saw markedly different performances from its two main business
segments. The hotels division saw a 10 per cent fall in operating profits to
Dollars 29.7m, while gaming reported a 49 per cent advance to Dollars 37.5m.
Hilton said that, on the lodging front, hotel occupancy was 69 per cent,
compared with 68 per cent a year earlier, but that the division was still
beset by 'sluggish economic recovery and excess capacity'.
Conditions in some key markets - such as New York, Chicago and Washington -
were described as 'difficult', with room rates remaining under pressure.
Hilton said, however, that all four of its Nevada gaming properties fared
well.
It added that it was still pursuing riverboat gambling plans in New Orleans,
and the Chicago gaming centre scheme. The latter proposal is for a Dollars
2bn complex - combining gaming and a high-tech theme park - which would be
built by a number of casino companies, including Hilton.

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Moody's upgrades Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has climbed a further two rungs up the ladder of international
respectability in the investment community, according Moody's Investors
Service, the US credit rating agency.
However, the country's large foreign debt and deteriorating current account
position mean it is still rated only a B1 risk by Moody's, four notches
below full investment grade.
Moody's also said it had no plans to review the ratings of other Latin
American countries, despite the debt accord reached last week between
Brazil's and its international bank creditors.
'Just a debt deal is not by any means sufficient,' said Mr David Levey, head
of sovereign debt ratings at Moody's. The agency did not expect any
improvement in Brazil's economic position in the near future, he said,
leaving it with a rating of B2.
Explaining the decision to lift the credit rating of Argentina's long-term
debt from B3, Moody's pointed to significant steps in dismantling
administrative and regulatory controls within the country. Also, Argentina
has linked its currency more closely to the US dollar and made efforts to
raise its tax revenues permanently .
Pointing to the country's current account deficit, and fears of a resurgence
of inflation, Moody's concluded: 'The potential for a reversal of current
positive trends thus cannot be ruled out . . . but the credit rating agency
does not expect a return to the chaotic conditions of the 1980s.'
Venezuela and Mexico remain the two most highly-regarded of the countries
with debt ratings in the region. Venezuela is rated by Moody's at Ba1 - just
below investment grade - and BB by Standard &amp; Poor's. Mexico is accorded Ba2
by Moody's.

<TEXT>
INLAND Steel, the large US steel producer, yesterday reported its first
quarterly net profit in two years, but only after taking a Dollars 15.1m
after-tax gain on the sale of an interest in a joint venture.
Inland was the first of the big, integrated US steel manufacturers to report
its second-quarter figures. Its results were line with with expectations of
generally narrowed losses as the US economy slowly improves.
Net income of Dollars 1.8m for the second quarter translated into a loss of
20 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends.
Excluding the joint venture sale gain, the net loss for the period was 69
cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 25m, or Dollars 1.07 a share,
in the second quarter of last year.
Sales rose from Dollars 864.8m to Dollars 909.4m.
Mr Frank Luerssen, chairman, said the results reflected the slowly growing
domestic economy. 'While shipments have increased modestly, prices remain at
unacceptable levels.'
The company's integrated steel manufacturing business reported an operating
profit of Dollars 13.3m after taking the Dollars 22.5m pre-tax gain on the
joint venture sale. That compared with an operating loss of Dollars 25.5m in
the second quarter of last year.
Steel sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 508.5m, with shipments totalling 1.1m
tons, up 3 per cent.
The company's steel service centre business reported operating profits of
Dollars 9.5m, up from Dollars 6.8m a year ago, on sales 3 per cent higher at
Dollars 434.3m.

BANCO POPULAR, the Spanish commercial bank, yesterday reported net income of
Pta27.8bn (Dollars 288m) for the first half of 1992, an 18.9 per cent
increase on the first six months of last year. Pre-tax income rose 13 per
cent to Pta43.9bn.
The bank said that, excluding an extraordinary gain of Pta1.6bn from the
sale of a banking subsidiary, ordinary net income had grown 12 per cent in
the first half.
Popular is recognised as one of the world's most profitable banks and the
relatively slow growth in profits, it said, should be seen in the light of a
sharp slowdown in the Spanish economy this year.
The bank said first-half net interest income had grown by 5.8 per cent to
Pta74.3bn.

<TEXT>
HAFNIA, the troubled insur-ance group which is fighting for survival,
announced that two of its banking subsidiaries will merge.
The group also announced yesterday the retirement of 10 senior managers,
including Mrs Jette Arnskjold, the chief executive at Hafnia Insurance, and
Mr H. E. Johansen, a member of the group board of management.
None of those to retire are associated with the irregularities which have
been revealed at the group over the past two weeks, Hafnia said.
The two banks to merge are Hafnia Merchant Bank, the investment banking arm
of the group, and Hafnia Trust &amp; Investment Bank, a portfolio management
subsidiary.
Last Friday, the Hafnia board decided to cancel a DKr8m (Dollars 1.4m)
'golden handshake' for Mr Per Villum Hansen, who was dismissed from his
position as group chief executive in April. Mr Hansen was responsible for
the strategic share investments in Danish group Baltica and the Swedish
insurance company, Skandia, which are at the root of the group's present
financial problems.
Chr. Hansen's Laboratorium, the biotechnology group which specialises in
enzymes for food production and anti-allergy preparations, is to acquire the
allergies subsidiary of Italy's Montedison for DKr305m, the group said.
The acquisition of Alergia e Inmmunologia Abello, which has headquarters in
Madrid and a turnover of about DKr200m a year, will make Chr. Hansen's
allergies subsidiary, Allergisk Laboratorium (ALK), the world's biggest
producer of allergen products in the world, the Danish company said.

FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: DAF in final talks to secure Fl
200m loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAF, the loss-making Dutch truck-maker in which British Aerospace has a 16
per cent stake, is in final negotiations to secure loans of Fl 200m (Dollars
110m) from a Dutch and a Belgian bank as part of efforts to strengthen its
balance sheet.
The company, which recorded a net deficit last year of Fl 394.5m, compared
with a loss of Fl 228m a year earlier, said yesterday it was also looking at
'various other opportunities' for additional financing, which could bring
the total injection of new cash to Fl 300m.
DAF is expected to conclude agreements with the Dutch National Investment
Bank and the NMKN commercial bank of Belgium within the next few weeks. The
National Investment Bank loan, for Fl 100m, is expected to be subordinated
from the Dutch government.
The NMKN loan, also for Fl 100m, will also carry some guarantees from the
Belgian government. The latter is concerned for the welfare of DAF's
manufacturing presence in Belgium, notably its Westerlo axles plant near the
Dutch border which employs 2,000.
With most European trucks markets continuing to be depressed, speculation
was being discounted last night that BAe might use any strengthening of
DAF's share price arising from the refinancing to dispose of its own holding
in DAF.
DAF's financial performance is the weakest of the leading European
truck-makers, largely due to its dependence on the UK truck market, which
has suffered the steepest slide into recession since 1945.

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Matthew Clark declines 19% to Pounds 4.55m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING recession and reduced margins were blamed by Matthew Clark, the
wine and sherry producer and drinks distributor, for a 19 per cent drop from
Pounds 5.62m to Pounds 4.55m in annual pre-tax profits.
The outcome was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 249,000 (Pounds
111,000) relating to restructuring and abortive acquisition costs.
Sales of continuing businesses increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 39.9m in
the year to April 30, boosted by new contracts and some trading down by
consumers.
However, Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive, said pressure from multiple
grocers and cash-and-carry chains had been unrelenting, squeezing the margin
from 13 per cent to 11.4 per cent.
Mr Aikens said the group felt profit margins could not fall much lower, but
he was not counting on any upturn in the UK economy before next April.
The company said it had gained significant share in the British sherry
market during the year. This had been complemented by the launch of a
premium range of Stone's sherries, capitalising on the strength of its
ginger wine brand.
Among its agency brands, sales of Taittinger were down 45 per cent in a
depressed champagne market. Grand Marnier gained market share in the
shrinking liqueurs sector while De Kuyper maintained its position as the
most widely distributed cherry brandy.
Clark paid Pounds 11m for Strathmore, the Scottish bottled water brand, just
after the April year-end.
Mr Aikens said: 'The coming year will be one of consolidation, ensuring that
both Strathmore and the company as a whole are well placed to develop the
markets that we are addressing.'
A new joint venture had begun with Inver House Distilleries to market and
sell its Scotch whiskies, gin and vodka. The company's sales force had been
reorganised to concentrate on key accounts and wholesalers.
Earnings per share increased to 33.6p (29.6p), reflecting the acquisition of
the minority interest in JE Mather. The final dividend is lifted to 9.25p
giving a total for the year of 15.75p (14p).
COMMENT
Difficult Christmas trading came as an unpleasant surprise to analysts at
the interim stage, so Mr Aikens was clearly determined yesterday not to
sound falsely optimistic about what is clearly a tough market. His strategy
of moving away from the low-margin multiples to supplying pubs, hotel and
restaurants makes sense, as does the focus on selling to wholesalers, rather
than individual outlets. The company will concentrate on bedding in
Strathmore, not least because other possible acquisition targets are only
available at fancy prices. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.2m put the
shares, down 4p yesterday to 450p, on a prospective multiple of 12.5. The
shares rose strongly after the Strathmore deal was announced, and seem
fairly valued until the bene-fits of that purchase are confirmed.

The offer comes in two parts - 38p for the first 60 per cent of Boustead

Boustead at Pounds 20.2m and each share at 30.8p, some 2.3p above

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: CU acquires control of Australian insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL UNION, the composite insurer, is stepping up its involvement in
the Australasian market by paying Pounds 23m to increase its interest in
National Commercial Union, Australia's third biggest non-life insurer.
CU already owns 45.67 per cent of the company and will increase its stake to
71.35 per cent by acquiring over half the shares currently held by The
National Mutual Life Association of Australasia.
Mr Peter Foster, general manager finance, said that the price of ADollars
1.28 (50p) for 46.5m shares was attractive and marginally below net asset
value.
CU will finance the deal by issuing new shares.
Although a number of other UK companies have recently reduced their
involvement in Australasia, CU's timing was influenced by evidence that the
insurance cycle is beginning to turn.
The company has a long standing involvement in the region, forming a listed
company, CU of Australia, in 1960 which in turn became NCU in 1982.
NCU's net pre-tax profit in the 12 months to June 30 1991 amounted to
ADollars 11.8m on net written premium income of ADollars 550m. Profits in
the six months to December 31 amounted to ADollars 14.6m. Net assets
amounted to ADollars 243m.

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: WPP board issues ultimatum over the
company's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in WPP, the marketing services group, have been offered a
choice between supporting a capital restructuring or being left with little
or no value to their shares.
The choice was put to them in a circular posted yesterday by the board. The
proposals will be put to a shareholders' meeting on August 5.
The circular also estimates profits of Pounds 14.2m for the six months to
June 30 before tax and exceptional items, compared to Pounds 13m in the
first half of 1991.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 12.7m (profits Pounds 3m) cut profits to
Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 16m).
The charges include Pounds 13.5m of costs relating to the restructuring
offset by asset sale profits of Pounds 800,000. Another Pounds 4.6m of
restructuring costs are being charged to the balance sheet.
Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, said the profit figures represented a
slight improvement though there was no significant upturn in economic
activity.
The circular urges shareholders to approve the plan. If it is not passed it
will constitute 'an event of default' leaving WPP dependent on the support
of its bankers. If this is forthcoming it is likely to be at terms which
leave little or nothing for shareholders. If bankers refuse their support
WPP said that shareholders would be left with nothing.
The plan involves the issue of 239.5m convertible shares at 60p each,
raising Dollars 272m (Pounds 143m). These shares will be bought by 24 banks
in WPP's banking syndicate. Proceeds will be used to repay about a quarter
of the group's Dollars 1bn debt.
Among banks subscribing to the issue are Bank of New York, which will buy
Pounds 11.2m-worth of the new convertible shares and have a 4 per cent stake
in WPP afterwards, Barclays, putting up Pounds 9.2m, and Midland, buying
Pounds 8.8m worth.
Existing WPP shareholders can subscribe for new ordinary shares also at 60p,
at a rate of 1,060 new shares for every 1,000 ordinary held already. To the
extent that shareholders subscribe, the issue to the banks will be reduced.
Holders of WPP's existing convertible preference shares are being offered
conversion into ordinary shares at a rate of 750 ordinary for every 1,000
convertible preference shares held and can also subscribe to the new issue.
Their stake in the group would increase from 23.1 per cent to 31.8 per cent
after the banks put in the new equity, without putting up any new money.
The circular gives details of the banking arrangements. WPP had net debt at
June 22 of Pounds 490.2m. An existing multi-currency term facility for
Dollars 430m and a working capital facility of Dollars 217m would continue
after the restructuring and a bridge facility of Dollars 150m has been set
up, which WPP has already begun to use.
The banks have agreed to delay debt repayments due from 1993 onwards, with
little to pay until 1997. The new facility will have to be repaid by making
disposals or issuing shares.
Interest on the existing facilities will accrue at 2 per cent above London
Inter-bank Offered Rate on the portion drawn, the rest paying a 1 per cent
commitment fee. The bridge facility will accrue at Libor plus 2 per cent
rising in steps after July 1 1992 to 4 per cent over Libor. The undrawn
portion will also pay a 1 per cent fee. The banks will be paid a fee of 1
per cent of the existing facilities left after the convertible issue and a 2
per cent fee on the bridge facility.

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Regalian sells Southwark asset for Pounds
5m below its book value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGALIAN PROPERTIES, the UK property company, yesterday announced the sale
of Red Lion Court, a large office building situated on the Southwark
riverside, for nearly Pounds 5m less than its book value.
The 128,000 sq ft building, adjacent to the Financial Times editorial
offices, was sold to an unnamed German investment company for Pounds 38.25m
cash, compared with a book value of Pounds 43m.
Mr Robert Perdeaux, finance director, said: 'We're not happy, but that is
the market price today. There was a lot of interest and that was the best we
could do.'
He said the company either had to sell or wait an indeterminate amount of
time for the hoped-for recovery in property prices.
Regalian will use the proceeds of the sale to reduce its borrowings from
Pounds 130m at the end of the last financial year.
It has also generated nearly Pounds 12m from the sale of other commercial
properties since that date.
Mr Perdeaux confirmed that Red Lion Court was the last commercial property
asset providing income for Regalian, but said the company still generated a
'fair cashflow' from residential property.
The property is let to Lloyds bank with 23 years remaining on the lease at
Pounds 34 per sq ft. Regalian said the sale will create no tax liabilities,
and the contract will be completed by the end of August.
Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the chartered surveyors, has reduced the Law
Society's rent in Chancery Lane from Pounds 690,000 a year in 1986 to Pounds
454,000 from November last year.
That has reduced the rent by Pounds 10 to Pounds 17.50 per sq ft, as a
result of the independent expert determination permitted under an rent
review clause in the contract for the property.

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: US buy helps Tomkins to Pounds 132m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the industrial conglomerate, reported an 18 per cent increase in
full-year profits to Pounds 132m owing to the increased contribution from
Philips Industries of the US which it bought in 1990.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of the company whose interests include
bathroom fittings, reinforced shoes, Smith &amp; Wesson hand-guns and mechanical
valves, said that while there were no signs of any turnround in the UK,
Tomkins had a low cost base and high level of operational gearing which
meant it would benefit strongly from the end of recession.
Pre-tax profits in the year to May 2 rose from Pounds 112m to Pounds 132m on
sales 22 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.27bn. Earnings per share increased by 5
per cent to 27.63p. An increased final dividend of 8.12p (7.06p) is
recommended, to give 11.34p for the year, up 15 per cent.
Tomkins has not made any substantial acquisitions since Philips and does not
need another sizeable acquisition to meet its target of out-performing the
UK market in earnings per share growth, he added.
The group ended the year with cash balances of Pounds 110m, up from Pounds
46m. This was achieved by squeezing cash from working capital at Philips and
strong cash generation from its operating companies.
Capital expenditure of Pounds 25m during the year fell below the
depreciation charge of Pounds 29m, although another Pounds 14m had been
approved and not spent.
The results highlighted the benefits of the Philips acquisition, not only in
terms of cash generation but also in having a spread of activities.
At the operating level Philips, which is now fully integrated and called
Tomkins Industries, contributed about Pounds 50m. This was almost double the
contribution in the 8 1/2 months for which it was consolidated the previous
year.
In particular, it had a surprisingly strong second half because US housing
starts grew substantially faster than expected and sales of recreational
vehicles increased.
The group also continued to enjoy strong growth in bicycle sales in the US,
partly as a result of the weak dollar and import substitution, and also
increased the exports of mowers to an all time record.
Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, said Tomkins had found many of Philips'
operational managers were of good quality, but there was sloppy financial
control, too much stock and antiquated computer systems.
The group's dependence on the US, which accounts for about 70 per cent of
sales but less pre-tax profits, has raised the possibility that it could hit
an advanced corporation tax problem in the UK.

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Stakis sells Aviemore leisure complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAKIS, the hotel and healthcare group, has sold the Aviemore Centre, a
leisure complex in the Scottish Highlands, to Berkeley de Veer, an unquoted
investment company based in Sheffield.
The sale is part of Stakis's disposal programme which is aimed at reducing
its Pounds 200m debt and slimming the company to its core businesses of
hotels, casinos and healthcare.
The sale, the value of which is not disclosed, involves 100 acres in
Aviemore and includes a conference centre, timeshare complex and development
land.
However, it does not include the Four Seasons and the Badenoch hotels which
Stakis will continue to operate, as well as the Coylumbridge hotel three
miles away.
Stakis bought the Aviemore centre and the hotels from House of Fraser in
1986 for Pounds 800,000 and had plans to modernise the entire complex. But
it never had the money to proceed with its plans.
In May it was expected that Stakis would sell the Aviemore centre to
Co-ordinated Land and Estates, the property company to which it has also
entrusted the management and disposal of its commercial property portfolio.

MFI FURNITURE Group, the kitchen and bedroom retailer, received applications
for about 44 per cent of the 137m shares sold through the public offer
portion of its flotation.
However, of these, applicants for 29 per cent were sub-underwriters who
could offset applications against their underwriting commitment. That leaves
only a 15 per cent take-up from outside buyers.
The group also placed 410.2m shares with institutions, and County NatWest,
the bank sponsoring the float, said that 86 per cent of the shares available
were placed or applied for in the offer.
A final figure for applications will be announced on Wednesday, share
certificates will be posted on Thursday and dealings are due to start on
Friday.
Brokers expect an opening price of about 105p compared to the 115p issue
price.

FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard hit by weak prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELLIS &amp; EVERARD, the chemicals distributor, yesterday announced a fall in
profits despite an increase in turnover, as margins in the UK and US
continued to come under pressure.
'It hasn't been the easiest of years,' said Mr Stephen Bentley, finance
director.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 12.6m as chemical prices
remained weak, especially in the US. At the interim stage turnover increased
10 per cent to Pounds 198m while profits fell 29 per cent to Pounds 7.5m.
Preymer (Spain), a 70 per cent owned subsidiary, the acquisition of which in
1990 marked the company's entry into continental Europe, continued to
disappoint and incurred a small loss.
But turnover increased to Pounds 383.4m (Pounds 357.9m), helped by
acquisitions and the dollar exchange rate. In dollar terms, US turnover
increased only 2.8 per cent while in sterling terms it increased 9.2 per
cent.
Gross profits increased to Pounds 90.6m (Pounds 86.9m). But higher
administrative expenses, including Pounds 1m of rationalisation costs,
dragged operating profits down from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 14.2m.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 9.1m at the end of the
period with gearing at 14.3 per cent (25.4 per cent). But interest costs
increased, partly due to short term cash flow needs, to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds
800,000).
Earnings per share fell to 11.5p (15.9p). An unchanged final dividend of
4.8p is proposed to make a maintained total of 7.05p.
COMMENT
Despite the obvious parallels with MTM, Ellis &amp; Everard's profits decline
was expected and the company has not been been dogged by questions about its
accounting practices. Trading this year has already shown some improvement,
especially from the swimming pools division which benefited from a warm
spring. Nevertheless, the chairman's departure cannot help the share price
of a company which could still be some way from recovery. Although this
year's results will be helped by cost savings and will not be held back by
discontinued businesses, last year's exchange gains will probably be
reversed and margin recovery in the UK and US may take time. Forecast
profits of Pounds 15m put the shares on 13.3 times, which is not expensive
relative to the sector. But until the controversy dies down, and a successor
to Mr Marshall found, the shares may go sideways at best.

FT  14 JUL 92 / BTR buys Pirelli units for Pounds 110m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the UK-based industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced a Pounds 110m
acquisition in Europe and a disposal worth Dollars 145.4m (Pounds 76m) in
the US.
The Pounds 110m deal covers the purchase of automotive and industrial rubber
products businesses in Germany, Spain and the UK from Pirelli of Italy.
BTR will pay Pounds 60m in cash and assume Pounds 50m of borrowings for the
businesses, which employ 4,600 people. Total sales last year were Pounds
285m, of which more than 80 per cent was accounted for by the German
companies.
The businesses include German-based Metzeler Automotive Profiles and
Metzeler Gimetall, Pendelastica and Perfiles del Automovil in Spain and
Metzeler (UK), based in Cambridgeshire. Last year they made a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 2.2m.
Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'The acquisition accords with
BTR's objective of strengthening its presence in the original equipment
manufacturing arena of continental Europe.' He believes increased
product-ivity could make these companies as profitable as BTR's Schlegel
business in the US, which last year had profit margins of 12 per cent to 14
per cent on sales of Pounds 300m.
This is Pirelli's second large divestment since the tyre company decided six
months ago to concentrate on core business, cut losses and reduce debt. The
group plans to sell a total of seven business units.
Pirelli said that since the end of 1991, it had reduced overall debt from
L3,700bn (Pounds 1.7bn) to L2,900bn. The remaining business units to be sold
cover activities such as hoses, leisure goods and defence. Non-core business
accounted for L1,700bn in annual turnover and the companies sold so far
represent 40 per cent of this. Pirelli claims these sales, combined with a
L500bn capital increase, have improved group finances and in the first five
months of the year operations showed a marginal profit.
BTR also announced a sale in the US by a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley, the
UK engineering group it bought for Pounds 1.55bn last year. Interests in
Richmond Power Enterprise, which owns a power plant in Virginia, have been
bought by Enron Richmond Power for Dollars 15.4m, together with the
assumption of borrowings worth Dollars 130m from BTR.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Isosceles agrees deal on refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the highly-indebted owner of the Gateway supermarket chain, has
reached agreement in principle with its creditors for a refinancing. The
proposals are being scrutinised by the credit committees of the 50 banks
involved in the negotiations and a final agreement may be reached next week.
Yesterday, however, Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, one of the
largest US supermarket operators and 53 per cent-owned by Germany's
Tengelmann group, joined the growing list of investment institutions which
have written off their equity holding in the company.
A&amp;P owns 7.2 per cent of Isosceles and is taking an Dollars 89.2m (Pounds
46m) provision to cover the potential loss.
Isosceles has long stressed that it is not looking for an injection of new
capital but requires a relaxation of its loan covenants to enable it to
invest in its new format Food Giant, Somerfield and Solo stores.
'Things have at last started to move, thank God, and that is a great help,'
said one party involved in the talks.
The company is technically in breach of its banking covenants and has been
rolling up the interest on its Pounds 300m of mezzanine debt, but it has
continued to service its Pounds 1.1bn of senior debt.
A&amp;P had previously valued its stake at cost - which, according to its recent
annual report, stood at Dollars 148m at end-February exchange rates. Tax
breaks mean the after-tax provision to cover a write-off is less than the
cost of the stake, but A&amp;P is now attaching no value to Isosceles equity.
The US company's move is the latest in series of write-downs by Isosceles
shareholders. Last week 3i, the venture capital group, wrote off its Pounds
45m equity holding. In May, Mercury Asset Management also cut the value of
its stake by an undisclosed amount. Murray Johnstone, which has a 1.3 per
cent stake, wrote down its holding by 44 per cent five months ago and will
review its position this month.
However, Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking business which is
Isosceles' largest shareholder with a 40 per cent stake, still carries the
holding at cost. Wasserstein said yesterday it would be unlikely to adjust
the valuation until calendar year-end.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Reservations over future of UK hotel group: Analysts are
split over Forte's direction / Analysis of the on-and-off love affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has the City fallen out of love with Forte?
Until recently, whatever the economic circumstances and the hotel and
restaurant group's performance, investors listened carefully to Forte's
plans and held on to its shares.
When, last April, the group announced 1991 pre-tax profits down 62 per cent
to Pounds 73m, along with a maintained but uncovered dividend, the shares
rose slightly. In the words of one institutional investor: 'No one ever got
fired for buying Forte.'
In the last few months, however, Forte's shares have dropped sharply
relative to the market. After out-performing the FT-SE 100 index over the
first four months of this year, Forte's relative share price has since
fallen more than 25 per cent.
It has shown a similar decline against the recession-hit leisure sector,
which it had consistently outperformed over several years. Since the
beginning of this month alone, the shares have fallen 29p to 170p,
representing 15 per cent of their value. 'The market seems to have lost its
patience,' says one analyst.
Some doubted Forte's wisdom when it said in May that it had decided to sell
its contract catering business to the Compass Group of the UK and ARA
Services of the US. When the proposed sale fell through earlier this month,
another question was asked.
Did the failure of the transaction indicate that Mr Rocco Forte, the group's
47-year-old chief executive, could not act without the say-so of his father,
Lord Forte, the company's octogenarian founder and current chairman? Mr
Forte takes this suggestion calmly, dismissing it as 'a little bit of
mischievous nonsense'.
He can probably afford to do so. Discussion of the market's disenchantment
with Forte should not be overdone. The shares have done no more than keep
pace with analysts' revisions of Forte's prospects.
A few months ago the City had been expecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 140m
for the current year. The group is now expected to make pre-tax profits of
Pounds 90m. With 1992 earnings per share expected to be 7p, the company's
prospective price-earnings ratio is still a hugely-expensive 24.3.
'It's still a blue-eyed stock,' says Mr Peter Joseph of Smith New Court.
Several large institutional shareholders appear to be sticking with Forte
and are unperturbed by the collapse of the contract catering sale. 'The fact
that they can afford to walk away from the deal shows that they were not
going to be messed around,' says a manager with one long-time holder of the
shares.
Forte says it still wants to sell its contract catering arm, allowing it to
concentrate on running hotels and restaurants and expanding on the
Continent.
Some followers of the company believe this is a mistake. The contract
catering business has withstood the recession better than any of Forte's
other activities. While hotel trading profits fell 53 per cent to Pounds 75m
last year and those from restaurants dropped 15 per cent to Pounds 63m,
contract catering profits rose 18 per cent to Pounds 47m.
Mr Forte argues that this is insufficient reason to hold on to the business.
'The idea that it has served us well in the recession is true, but it's such
a small proportion of our total results that it doesn't have that big an
impact,' he says.
Contract catering, he argues, does not fit in well with the rest of Forte's
activities. 'It has a very different customer base. In contract catering,
we're actually not dealing directly with the consumers. We're dealing with a
client. To a great degree we're in the hands of the client in terms of what
we can deliver.'
Mr Forte accepts that the failure of the deal is not good for the morale of
the managers, staff and customers of the business. On the other hand, a sale
to Compass and ARA would have meant splitting up the business between them
to comply with UK monopoly requirements. Managers had objected to that.
Mr Forte will now look for buyers who will keep the division together. He
would like to find a buyer for Gardner Merchant, which provides canteen
meals. He has different plans for Forte Airport Services, which provides
in-flight catering for airlines. When market conditions improve, he would
like to see this business floated, with Forte retaining a stake.
The sale of Gardner Merchant would allow Forte to cut costs substantially.
Mr Forte says the group last year reduced fixed and variable costs by Pounds
63m, but that the tenacity of the UK recession has encouraged it to go
further. 'We're looking at costs from head office down to unit level. We're
looking at whether there's a different way to run things. In our previous
approach we maintained our existing structure,' he explains.
He will not give details, but it is clear that the group is looking at the
usefulness of having headquarters for each of its businesses. Reducing the
role of divisional headquarters would inevitably focus greater attention on
Forte's group leadership and on Mr Forte himself.
It is not true, he says, as some newspaper reports have suggested, that the
contract catering deal fell through because of his indecisiveness. Compass,
he says, was not the ideal buyer because its existing UK catering interests
meant the business would have had to be split up. But when Compass and ARA
offered Pounds 560m, Forte felt duty bound to consider it. When Compass and
ARA dropped their offer price, Forte felt it had to walk away.
Company insiders say the decision to end negotiations was taken by the
entire board. Lord Forte was not at the meeting because he had broken his
ankle, and although Mr Rocco Forte asks his father for advice, insiders say
Lord Forte is too old to play a dominant role.
Because Mr Forte is the quietly-spoken son of a charismatic founder, the
company realises the whispering about his competence will probably continue.
There is little he can do except pursue his strategy of looking for
expansion opportunities on the Continent.
'Poor old Rocco is trapped,' says one City analyst. 'If things go well, it's
because of the company his father built up. If they go badly, it's because
Rocco cocked it up.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Civil servants to strike over proposed move to Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS over government plans to move civil servants to Docklands were
highlighted yesterday, as Downing Street pressed departments to look again
at whether more officials can be relocated and civil service unions decided
to stage a one-day strike tomorrow in protest at any move.
The Downing Street initiative is understood to stem from dissatisfaction on
the part of Mr John Major, the prime minister, at government departments'
paltry responses to a preliminary survey of what activities they might shift
to Docklands.
Despite organised coach trips for staff to the site to try to reduce
resistance to the move, the strike votes show that many officials remain
strongly opposed to going to Docklands because of the extra cost and time
they will face in travelling to work.
The 2,000 civil servants in the Department of the Environment are the only
officials definitely signed up to move to Docklands, though there is also
strong pressure on the Department of Transport, which is carrying out a
review of its office requirements, and the Department of Trade and Industry.
So far, the DTI has volunteered only the Radio Communications Agency.
The strike is part of a growing campaign among officials against the move
away from the area round Westminster.
It will coincide with a lobby of parliament tomorrow, when the issue is also
expected to be raised during questions to environment ministers in the
Commons. DoE union leaders are to meet Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, on Friday.
At the DoE, members of the NUCPS civil service union, which represents
middle-ranking staff, voted 60 per cent in favour of strike action while 62
per cent of members of the CPSA union, which represents junior officials,
were in favour of striking.
At the transport department, members of NUCPS voted 55 per cent in favour of
strike action.
The FDA and IPMS civil service unions, which represent senior and
professional staff, support the Westminster lobby but are not taking part in
the industrial action.
Mr John Delaney, NUCPS group secretary, said: 'Although it is a one-day
strike called at very short notice because parliament is adjourning for
three months, we intend to campaign throughout the summer.'
'Our members are not going to Docklands, to a place where there is no
infrastructure and inadequate transport. It is a political decision because
they cannot persuade their friends in the private sector to take up the
space.'

The Bank of Boston is doing its bit to encourage more voters to register
their preferences in this year's presidential elections - and, incidentally,
to boost new business at the same time. Yesterday, it introduced a
certificate of deposit - imaginatively entitled the 'Washington CD' - that
will pay out a higher return to holders if election day voter turnout in the
state exceeds 1988 levels.
The CD, which will carry a 5.25 per cent interest rate in December, will pay
out 5.35 per cent if more than the 82 per cent of Massachusetts-registered
voters who turned out at the last election make it to the polling booths on
November 3.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ken Schofield and Mike Marshall, two of the better known personalities in
Britain's chemical industry, have one thing in common. They both made a lot
of money selling their chemical companies and ending up as boss of the
company that bought them out. However, the similarities end there.
Yesterday Ellis &amp; Everard turfed 48-year-old Marshall out of his chair and
recalled a 64-year-old member of one of the founding families, Simon
Everard, who had been doing the job for eight years until 1990.
Ellis &amp; Everard is going through a rough patch but is not in as dicey a
position as Hickson was when Schofield took the helm. Perhaps that's part of
the problem, since Schofield saved Hickson and is now working his magic on
MTM. Marshall has had less time to prove himself.
Nevertheless, it's a bit of a surprise that Marshall has been shown the
door, especially since he owns five times as many shares as the rest of the
board put together. It all seems a bit odd since it was Everard who anointed
Marshall as his own successor.

It is illegal for South Koreans to buy bottled water. This little
infringement on their liberty is creating a ticklish problem. For pollution
is increasing in the river Han, the main source of drinking water for the
residents of Seoul.
The rationale for the 20-year-old law is that bottled water poses a threat
to social harmony; those who couldn't afford it would harbour ill-will
against those that could.
But that was two decades ago and South Korea has become a much more affluent
place since then. Are the authorities relenting? It doesn't appear so.
Although their product may be sold to foreigners, two executives of a
bottled water company have been arrested for illegally peddling the precious
liquid to fellow countrymen. The police say they are flushing out other
cases.

General Sir Peter de la Billiere, commander of the British forces during the
Gulf war, is trading in his beret for a bowler to become a director of
Robert Fleming.
Though best known for being on less than friendly terms with the Iraqis, it
is his close relationships with other Middle Eastern states, especially
Saudi Arabia, that is being sought by the merchant bank.
As a soldier, he acquired a close knowledge of the region over 30 years. In
1984, Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, hand-picked him for a special
mission to prepare for the Queen's visit to Jordan.
Robert Fleming is something of a haven for refugees from the forces and
prides itself on being managed along army lines - with the stress on
planning as much as flair.
It already manages billions of pounds of Arab money and won favour with Sir
Peter by showing a stiff upper lip during the Gulf war; it kept its Bahrain
office fully manned, while other western businessmen based in the Gulf
headed homeward.
Sir Peter is not planning to take up any other business appointments. Though
his main role at Fleming will be to advise on Middle Eastern politics, John
Manser, Fleming's chief executive, is also looking for some practical
advice. For example, how can Fleming executives negotiate the maze of Saudi
airport customs procedures in less than the traditional two hours.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Observer: No truck with Napoleon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a bunch of people most prominent recently for their anarchic siege of
their nation's infrastructure, it might seem uncharacteristic for the French
truckers to be taking their grievances to court.
The Federation Nationale des Transporteurs Routiers has asked the Conseil
d'Etat, France's top legal authority, to overturn the tough new regulations
that were at the heart of the dispute on the grounds that they came into
effect after they had already expired.
The new law, under which drivers can lose their licences after getting six
penalty points, came into effect on July 1. But, having been voted through
parliament three years ago, the points system was supposed to come into
effect by January 1.
Government officials claim that the imposition was postponed for six months
because the paperwork was not ready, though some unkind souls have suggested
that the delay might have been to avoid adding to the Socialists'
unpopularity before the regional elections in March.
But the government is standing firm. The word from transport ministry
lawyers is that the new law stands, whatever mistakes the state might have
made in applying it. For that, the truckers can thank Napoleonic law.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Letter: Only one measure of incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP CROFTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As one who has designed many top management incentive plans I was
interested to read ('Shareholder group calls for changes to stock option
plans', July 6) that the National Association of Pension Funds is studying
alternatives, such as share price, to the earnings per share (eps) criterion
used in many such schemes on the grounds that eps calculations are too
easily subject to manipulation by top management.
It is vital that any measurement standard used in determining incentive
awards is one that both management can influence by their efforts and whose
achievement will jointly benefit management and owners. Earnings per share
is the only criterion that meets these requirements. Share price certainly
does not and the relationship between corporate performance and share price
has long been established as a tenuous one.
As to the argument that it is too easy to manipulate eps calculations, while
this may be true, it merely reinforces the need for boards, remuneration
committees and shareholders to exercise judgment to ensure that this does
not happen.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK POPIEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If Ronald Dore ('Preaching pragmatism to free trade church', July 8)
thinks British bureaucrats have come up with something new in the way of 'a
sensible and pragmatic form of protectionism', he is sadly mistaken. What
does he think Japanese bureaucrats have been doing all these years? The
result is the world's biggest GNP per capita among the large industrialised
countries and virtually no unemployment.
Dore's proposals for a new concept on trade and investment are insufficient
without the highly trained and dedicated bureaucrats to implement it.
Therefore, what is needed is a transplant of the skilled Japanese
practitioners of the art to Britain. Mark Popiel,

FT  14 JUL 92 / Letter: New ways needed to support and protect Kurds in
northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL AARONSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Murray Brown reports the call by Bernard Kouchner, France's
minister of humanitarian affairs, for a new cross-border programme of
assistance to the Kurds of northern Iraq ('West faced with political
minefield over Kurds', July 9). Save the Children, which is rebuilding
schools and supporting agriculture in the region, believes the UN and
western governments should urgently consider such innovative ideas, as it is
clear that the current UN operation simply is not working.
The Kurds are suffering the effects of sanctions and an internal blockade
imposed by the Iraqi government as they struggle to rebuild their lives.
They need urgent help to reconstruct their communities in settlements which
have been bombarded, razed and looted over the past decade. The decision on
how to protect and support the Kurds in this crucial phase has been too long
delayed.
Now the Memorandum of Understanding which governed UN-led humanitarian
operations in Iraq has expired, and harassment of UN and aid agency staff is
escalating. Mrs Mitterrand and Mr Kouchner narrowly escaped death in a car
bomb attack on July 6 and there are daily hand grenade attacks on UN guards
in the main Kurdish towns. The Iraqi government is blocking the efforts of
UN agencies to improve water, health and primary education in the north.
Most crucially, no UN agency currently has responsibility for 'contingency
planning' against the possibility of a future large-scale evacuation or
displacement of the Kurdish population. Emergency supplies in the area are
being withdrawn to neighbouring countries, and UNHCT staff will shortly
leave.
It is time for the international community to acknowledge the failure of its
current approach and make strenuous efforts to find new ways of supporting
and protecting the Kurds of northern Iraq.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Letter: Government as an employer showing signs of confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS TRINDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Top public pay rises cut to 4 per cent' (July 10), the focus is on
the immediate consequences of the rebuff of the Top Salaries Review Body
recommendations, but the longer term significance of the government's
decision may be of greater importance.
The scale of the reductions and the decision to stage over several years is
not minor tinkering. So the 'signal' being sent out might this week embrace
the 120,000 police officers whose September 1 1992 pay rise under the
Edmund-Davies formula is triggered by the figures on the increase in average
earnings in May 1992 which are published on July 16 and are expected to show
a rise of 6.5 per cent.
Also, early in 1993, the review bodies on teachers, nurses, doctors and
armed forces will recommend pay rises for 1.5m other public servants for the
financial year 1993-94 and because they use backward looking comparisons,
average earnings figures of 6 per cent or more in 1992 will be a factor in
what they decide. So cutbacks here are likely too.
But it was only last year that the government set up the Teachers' Pay
Review Body, and, indeed, on the same day as they cut top pay, they
announced an independent review of dental remuneration.
So while the government has sent out a clear signal on its responsibilities
for 'managing the economy', confusion is beginning to develop on how it
intends in future to discharge its responsibilities as the single largest
employer. If the present arrangements are an anachronism, they need
replacing with something more appropriate.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From S J GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('A beleaguered government', July 7) seemed to share the
consensus view that German interest rates would be slow to come down.
Obviously, your leader writer had not read the reports of Volke Ruhe's
meeting with Conservative MPs in which he said that another 5,000 unemployed
in the western part of Germany was not significant in the context of 4m
unemployed in the eastern part. His figures on unemployment are almost
certainly more accurate than the more official statistics. Taken together
with the federal elections due in 1994, they provide a strong indication
that German interest rates will be cut sooner rather than later and that the
cuts when they come will be significant.

FT  14 JUL 92 / More deadly at the Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden appearance of Mr Paul Dacre as editor of the Daily Mail could be
tiresome news for Mr John Major. Let me explain. The prime minister was,
shall we say, assisted in his endeavours to win the election on April 9 by a
solid and unanimous Tory press which heavily outnumbered the few opposition
papers. All of it stuck to a script that I assume was written at Central
Office. The Daily Mail did its bit, con brio. The Conservative papers
rubbished Mr Neil Kinnock, and helped spread the idea that Labour would add
huge amounts to everyone's personal taxation. Mr Major duly won.
Since then, as is proper in a democracy, those same newspapers have been all
over the place. The prime minister still gets a good press, but no organ can
be relied upon to support the government, certainly not on every issue. This
is as it should be. I would not remark upon other publications at all, but
for the fact that the official opposition has been dormant since April 10.
The consequence is that the only significant alternatives to strategies made
in Downing Street have been put forward from the Conservative benches - and
in parts of the Tory press. The two wings of this internal opposition draw
natural support from one another.
Many of the Conservative papers have become either uncomfortable doubters or
hostile opponents of the prime minister's European and economic policies.
The Maastricht treaty has few friends. The maintenance of Britain's position
within the exchange rate mechanism is seen solely in terms of its upwards
pressure on interest rates. Maastricht and the economy have become bound
together. They are twin albatrosses slung around Mr Major's neck. The
significance of Mr Dacre's appointment is that the Daily Mail, which my
moles say was anyhow getting ready to move towards becoming an uncomfortable
doubter, may now be roughly manoeuvred into a stance of open hostility.
The evidence is to be found in the Evening Standard, a London newspaper,
which Mr Dacre edited until last week. He moved it steadily rightwards. He
featured Sir Alan Walters, scourge of the ERM and Maastricht, and the man
whose presence by Mrs Margaret Thatcher's side was given as a reason for the
resignation of Mr Nigel Lawson as chancellor. The treaty of which Mr Major
is so proud was referred to in editorials as the 'ex-Treaty of Maastricht';
just a fortnight ago the Standard devoted an entire editorial page to an
attack on Britain's membership of the ERM. Do not mistake me. It is a free
country. I merely note what happened. No criticism of Mr Dacre's editorship
is implied.
I cannot say whether the Daily Mail will be moved in the same direction now
that Sir David English has stepped down as editor and the man from the
Standard has moved in. Under Sir David, the paper was staunchly
pro-European, and pro-Major, although latterly it may have been getting
ready to wobble. It is not known how free the new editor will be; his
predecessor, a life-long hands-on operator, will sit above him as
editor-in-chief of the Associated Newspapers group. The likelihood is that
some turn against Maastricht and the ERM can be expected; the interesting
question is how much and how soon. This could be troublesome for the
government. The pulse of the Conservative party beats through the Daily
Mail, just as its heartbeat can be found in The Daily Telegraph.
The latter is also sounding an increasingly uncertain note. I have only once
heard its proprietor, Mr Conrad Black, speak on European Community matters;
my recollection is of a man who out-Thatchers Thatcher. His Sunday Telegraph
has become a last redoubt for her admirers. Meanwhile The Times, still under
the editorship of Mr Simon Jenkins, has been scornful of the Maastricht deal
('an invitation to an ever more interventionist bureaucracy'), while The Sun
has conducted a running campaign to get Mr Norman Lamont to cut interest
rates ('Do it, Norman'). In compensation, the Evening Standard may become
less rightwing under its new editor, Mr Stewart Steven, who until this
weekend ran a more or less loyalist Mail on Sunday. But a favourable London
evening paper would be no antidote to an unfavourable Daily Mail.
You may say that none of this matters - that it is just musical chairs at
the papers again. This could be so, but consider the government's position.
It has bolted itself in to a policy of ratifying Maastricht (unless,
blessedly, there is a French veto) and sticking out the recession for as
long as it takes. It needs all the public support it can get, at a time when
everyone who is in work knows of someone either out of it or in trouble
finding a job. Mr Major and Mr Lamont have recently started to try to talk
their own party, and the electorate as a whole, into an understanding of why
interest rates cannot be summarily lowered, and why it is necessary to
honour the Maastricht accord. They cannot rely on a docile press to assist
them. They will have to depend on the force of their arguments. Wonderful.

THIS is a bold, welcome staging by The Ten Trumpets Theatre Company of the
first Don Juan play to reach the English stage. Thomas Shadwell's work was
last performed in 1740 and it is easy to see why it has been resting for
more than 250 years; and easier to see why it should be staged again now.
Although it lacks dramatically, the 1990s make fertile ground for its
issues: misogyny and men's self-deceit.
The tragi-comic story is familiar enough. The Don's women turn either to
doe-eyed devotion or wide-eyed anger. His sidekicks wallow in his
miscreancies; all of them have a taste of hell - and the chance to repent -
before the statuesque dinner guest hauls them off.
The Don John character holds the play together, principally because Shadwell
wrote no other substantial part.
Jim McKechnie in the title role gives a remarkable performance. He manages
to be consistently vicious and libidinous, in touch with his conscience long
enough to enjoy ignoring it.
Marcus Goodwin's direction speeds the plot; and there are good cameo pieces
from Lia Zografou and Eddie Marsan.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Olof Baer recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE programme chosen by the Dresden-born baritone for his recital with
pianist Geoffrey Parsons at the Royal Opera House on Sunday night was
tasteful and chronological: a brisk survey of the Austro-German lyric art
(with a glance in the direction of Hungary), beginning with Mozart and
Beethoven, proceeding to Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms, and
culminating in Hugo Wolf, with encores from Liszt and Strauss.
Mr Baer's baritone is light and smooth and well-nigh perfectly formed,
projecting easily into the big auditorium while still sounding intimate and
suave. His enunciation of the German words was immaculate even to a fault -
his diction had a shapeliness that sometimes seemed self-regarding. Just as
his stage manner is sweetly pleasing, so his way with these Lieder too often
seemed like prettification rather than interpretation. His approach was
seldom searching and his considerable beauty of tone was more dutiful than
original.
The critic Roland Barthes listened always for the 'grain' of an art-singer's
voice, its trace of individuality or eccentricity, its cutting edge, even
its flaw. Mr Baer is a singer pretty well devoid of this quality, though an
occasional excess of vibrato in the voice might count as some kind of flaw,
while at the end of Schubert's haltingly rapturous Dass sie hier gewesen, on
the word 'Tranen' (tears), he wittingly or no came out with a quivering or
weakening of tone that had a certain 'granular' force.
But nearly all his items passed by as the merest diversions of a genteel
summer evening - Mendelssohn's Heine settings, Brahms's Hungarian folksong
adaptations, even Schumann's Widmung (Dedication). One did prick up one's
ears a little at Beethoven's Adelaide and a little more at Wolf's
Eichendorff settings, particularly Verschwiegene Liebe, in which Mr Baer
gave evidence of a more commanding artistry.
However, as is frequently the case with song recitals, it was in the very
last encore, Strauss's Zueignung (another Dedication), that the singer
really came into his own. This had abruptly gripping conviction and power.
Mr Parsons was more consistent: he had supplied accompaniments of quiet
mastery throughout.

THOUGH the drama series Boys From The Bush is set mainly in Australia, it
has many of the attributes of Minder: the same sort of rough diamond
characters, a similar semi-criminal sub-culture, and much of the comedy. In
today's episode, the last, the Toomers are back in Oz and Dennis finds that
while he was in Shepherd's Bush, Reg was heading for the Australian bush,
having sold his share of the business to his wife Corrie (9.30 BBC1).
At Lewisham borough council, host to BBC2's cameras in Town Hall,
procrastination among the Labour group in the setting of budgets finally
drives the professional staff to threaten legal sanctions. Deputy leader
Dave Sullivan, in charge while the Labour leader is on holiday, says he will
do all he can to confuse matters (9.45).
BBC1 repeats its startling documentary Marilyn Monroe: Say Goodbye To The
President (10.20). It throws doubt on her suicide, fingers the Mafia, and
investigates her affairs with Jack and Bobby Kennedy. The BBC asserts that
since its first showing in 1985 it has never been seriously challenged,
factually or legally.
Viewpoint 92 is about the pursuit of wealth (10.40 ITV).

FT  14 JUL 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: UK 'net book' agreement contravenes
EC law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Publishers' Association's system of resale price maintenance (RPM)
for 'net books' has been thrown into doubt by the Court of First Instance's
affirmation of a 1988 EC Commission decision that the net book agreement
(NBA) infringes EC competition rules. Implementation of the decision had
been suspended pending the outcome of the PA's appeal. The Court's judgment
will now preclude the application of the NBA to imports and re-imports from
other EC member states, and also casts doubt on arguments previously used in
the UK to justify the NBA.
The NBA requires UK publishers to impose uniform RPM conditions on
booksellers for the resale of 'net books'. The conditions also apply to net
books exported to or re-imported from Ireland and other member states, and
also to retail exports to other member states. The NBA had been approved in
1962 and 1968 by the UK's Restrictive Practices Court, as leading to lower
prices, more stock-holding bookshops and more numerous and varied titles.
The Commission held Article 85(1) applied to the agreements 'to the extent
that they cover the book trade between member states'. It rejected the PA's
request for an exemption under Article 85(3), as the restrictions on
competition were not 'indispensable' for achieving the benefits claimed by
the PA.
The Court confirmed that Article 85(1) applied, rejecting the PA's argument
that, for imported books, the NBA operated only after the books had been
imported and thus could have no effect on inter-state trade. It also
rejected the PA's complaint that the Commission had improperly changed the
basis of its objections during the procedure.
Significantly, the Court also specifically rejected the PA's four
substantive arguments on the 'indispensability' issue. The Court did not
accept that publishers would face substantial difficulties in notifying
individually fixed terms of trading to booksellers and others. Nor was it
established that booksellers would face an unmanageable burden if publishers
had different conditions as to discounts and other departures from the NBA
structure, particularly since computerisation was now widely available.
Third, claims that the NBA reassured booksellers as to their competitors'
conduct did not justify collective arrangements between publishers, since
enforcement was in practice a matter for the individual publisher. Last,
there was no necessity to allow monitoring by the PA of the common
conditions.
Case T-66/89, Publishers' Association v Commission, CFI 2CH, July 9 1992.
Sunday trading issue to be determined by member states
Clarification of Sunday trading rules and their compatability with EC law
may follow Advocate-General Van Gerven's latest opinion on three preliminary
references from the High Court, the Reading and Sonning Magistrates' Court
and the House of Lords. The Sunday trading issue has been the subject of
some considerable interest in the United Kingdom and other member states. In
spite of the fact that the ECJ has ruled upon Sunday trading rules three
times, there was still confusion over their compatability with EC law.
The Advocate-General explained first why there was no inconsistency between
Torfaen on the one hand, and Conforama and Merchandise on the other. All
three cases had found that domestic provisions restricting trading on
Sundays fell within the ambit of EC rules on import restrictions; the
question at issue was whether such domestic provisions could be justified
under EC law. In Conforama and Merchandise, the ECJ had all the necessary
elements to decide the justification issue, whereas, in Torfaen, factual
issues relevant to proportionality had to be dealt with by the national
court.
The Advocate-General then considered the criteria to be used to determine
whether such provisions could be justified and whether it was for the
national courts or the ECJ to apply such criteria. The issue of
justification fell to be decided in two tranches. First, it had to be seen
whether the measures pursued an objective consistent with EC law; this was a
task for the ECJ, having had the relevant policy objectives drawn to its
attention by the national courts. Second, the measures had to be relevant,
essential and proportionate to the objective pursued. Generally, it was for
the national court to decide these issues on the basis of criteria laid down
by the ECJ. However, the ECJ could itself apply the tests where all the
necessary information on the domestic measures had been provided by the
national court and was not in doubt.
Tested against these criteria, the Advocate-General confirmed that the UK
Sunday trading rules pursued an objective justified under Community law and
that, although, in his view, the restrictions were proportionate to their
objectives, the issue was in principle to be determined by the national
courts.

Students' residence directive annulled
Council Directive 90/366 on the right of residence for students has been
annulled on the ground of incorrect legal base. The European Parliament had
challenged the Directive, contending that the correct legal base should have
been Art. 7(2) EEC, which involves the 'co-operation' procedure with
Parliament. The Court however ordered that the Directive should continue to
have its effects (ensuring non-discrimination for students moving within the
EC) until the adoption of new legislation.
Case C-295/90, Parliament v Council, ECJ FC, July 7 1992.
In its final listed week before the summer vacation, the European Court
delivered 11 judgments as well as two important opinions in the Woodpulp and
Sunday Trading cases. This week, emphasis has been placed on the judgment by
the Court of First Instance on the net book agreement and the Sunday trading
opinion by Advocate-General Van Gerven. Those cases decided this week but
not examined today will be covered next week.

WPP, Martin Sorrell's marketing services group, is elevating David Ogilvy,
its 81-year-old chairman, to the title of President Emeritus. He will also
continue as a consultant to the group. His move will take effect after a
shareholders' meeting on August 5, called to consider a refinancing proposal
which will, bankers believe, either save or break the company which ran into
difficulties after borrowing heavily to buy companies - such as Ogilvy and
Mather.
Ogilvy's replacement as chairman is to be Gordon Stevens (right), who is a
mere 66. He is described as an energetic chap, known for making witty asides
during agm addresses - something WPP shareholders will appreciate, no doubt.
He joined Unilever, the consumer products group, as a trainee in 1949, and
became a director in 1976 when he was 'toilet preparations co-ordinator'. In
1978 he took charge of the marketing division, moving in 1983 to head
Unilever's North American business, succeeding Michael Angus (as he then
was) who had pulled that business out of losses. He retired in 1988 and
since then has become non-executive chairman of Scholl, the footcare
company.

FT  14 JUL 92 / People: Kenny joins Potter at Guinness Mahon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kevin Kenny, chief executive of fund management and financial services group
Tyndall Holdings in the difficult period before it was acquired by Jupiter
Tarbutt Merlin last summer, has resurfaced at Guinness Mahon, the small
merchant bank owned by Bank of Yokohama.
Kenny becomes director of international private banking, with the three
overseas operations - Guernsey, Dublin and Zurich - reporting for the first
time to a single board member.
Tyndall suffered heavy losses in the Australian market, with the then boss
Garnet Harrison subsequently resigning. Kenny, who had been in charge of the
Tyndall banking division, took over as managing director of the group in the
autumn of 1990. David Potter, chief executive of Guinness Mahon, was also
made non-executive vice chairman of Tyndall at the time, which was how the
two met.
Tyndall fell under something of a cloud as a result of the Australian
debacle. In the past few months there has also been an unseemly wrangle
between Jupiter and former Tyndall directors over the management of two
funds, Pacific Horizon and European Project.
But Potter says that he was impressed with Kenny's efforts to restructure
Tyndall: 'He did a great job keeping it moving through the water'. Potter
also contends that the banking side of Tyndall was, and is, very sound.
'When I knew he did not have a perch (after the Jupiter acquisition) I
naturally engaged him in conversation.' Kenny has been a consultant to
Guinness Mahon for several months: 'There is no better way for both sides to
do their due diligence,' according to Potter.
*****
Ever since Sir Gordon Borrie stepped down last month as Director-General of
Fair Trading after 16 years in the job, there has been speculation about
what he will do next. He is still only 61 and somehow it never seemed likely
that he would withdraw from the battle for consumers' rights to grow roses
in the Cotswolds.
Now comes news that he is to join the Council of the Ombudsman for Corporate
Estate Agents, a voluntary scheme set up two years ago to handle complaints
against the large chains of estate agents taking part in residential
property transactions. Few people have done more than Sir Gordon to change
the face of the industry. He was the driving force behind the 1979 Estate
Agents Act and the 1991 Property Misdescriptions Act which is about to come
into force. As Lady Ewart-Biggs, the OCEA Council chairman, said yesterday,
no one else knows as much as Sir Gordon about the regulation of estate
agents. Rogues had better beware.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Management: Key to future is nation of first-stop
shopkeepers - Plans to establish a network of advice centres for
entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain can no longer afford to waste its collective energy on 'turf
battles' between the different agencies delivering help and advice to small
businesses, according to Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade.
Heseltine outlined his views last week when he announced the establishment
of an initiative designed to bring greater coherence to the delivery of
advice and counselling services to small businesses.
A network of 'first-stop shops' is to be established, eventually totalling
200, which will bring together under one umbrella most of the existing
agencies that provide help to businesses. These include Training and
Enterprise Councils (Tecs), local enterprise agencies and chambers of
commerce.
Tecs will be responsible for getting the shops established. Introduced two
years ago to revolutionise training in the UK, Tecs also have some
responsibility for promoting the growth of small companies. Their brief
includes the development of business information and advice services,
administering the enterprise allowance scheme and providing training
provision for small businesses and support for exporters.
Tecs are also charged with bringing greater unity to the many strands of
help available and ensuring that any gaps in services are filled.
Resolution of this complex role in what is already a crowded area, has been
one of the critical issues facing the movement.
A number of Tecs have been skilled at working with the other agencies.
Barnsley and Doncaster Tec, for example, contracted with Doncaster
Enterprise Agency to provide its enterprise allowance scheme, which offers
unemployed people financial help to start their own businesses. Birmingham
Tec, with several partners including the City Council's economic development
department and Birmingham Chamber of Commerce has set up what it calls a
'one-stop shop' which has information about a wide range of services.
But Tecs have come into conflict with the existing providers, most notably
chambers of commerce, which are largely supported by voluntary
subscriptions. The chambers have been annoyed that some Tecs, supported by
public funds, have set up rival services and membership schemes drawing on
the same client base.
The problem was not helped by the fact that the activities of the
Departments of Employment and Trade and Industry were not co-ordinated.
But responsibility for a block of activities operated by Tecs, including
business skills training, has been transferred from the DOE to the DTI.
The DTI is vigorously promoting the new 'first-stop shops'. Over the next
few weeks, a working party will set-up models for the shops and the DTI has
hinted that if successful, the first shops could take on a number of its
responsibilities for giving business advice.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Management: When relations become strained - An informal
approach to hiring and firing staff often leads to trouble / Here is some
advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murder is commonly a family affair, as are numerous other unspeakable crimes
that human beings perpetrate against each other.
Any small business owner employing other people needs to bear this in mind.
The more a business can boast it 'is just like a family' as far as relations
between bosses and workers are concerned, the louder the alarm bells
probably ought to ring.
It could mean that little thought has been given to tedious matters such as
contracts of employment, personnel records and disciplinary procedures.
The informality is fine when times are good but potentially disastrous when
'family' members fall out, perhaps over redundancies, a dispute over pay,
hours or holidays. Problems may be compounded by the employment of actual
family members and the absence of professional personnel advice within the
company.
According to Acas, the conciliation service, the assumption is that because
lines of communication are short, problems will resolve themselves.
Acas daily sees the casualties of this approach; such a high proportion of
cases come from small businesses that the service's enquiry team focuses on
this sector.
In the London region alone, Acas becomes involved in 10,000 disputes over
employment rights each year - nearly 20 per cent of the total for the UK -
and deals with 80,000 enquiries.
About two-thirds are from employees and the rest are from employers and
organisations.
Top of the employers' list, making up 26 per cent of complaints and
inquiries, are issues relating to redundancies.
These are followed by disciplinary and dismissal problems (23 per cent) and
other contractual issues (18 per cent). Then follow a host of other issues,
including maternity leave, holidays and wages.
The first basic error made by many small businesses, which gives rise to
these problems, is failing to write things down, says Acas. This starts even
before an employee begins work - job descriptions and written details of
essential skills, qualifications and experience, will help to clarify
exactly what is required from the job and what sort of person will fill it
most successfully.
As Chris Jones, acting director of Acas in London, says: 'It's easier to
knock a square peg into a round hole than knock it out again'.
The law requires employers to provide written details of the chief contract
terms within 13 weeks of the person starting work (other rules apply to
part-timers).
These terms should include: employer's name; employee's name; date
employment began; job title; amount of pay and interval between payments;
hours of work; holiday pay and entitlement; sick pay and pension
arrangements; notice periods; grievance and appeal arrangements; and
disciplinary rules (where there are 20 or more employees).
As well as these 'express' terms, the courts have established that certain
'implied' terms are contained in all employment contracts. These relate to
co-operation, good faith and health and safety.
Additional statutory rights, which cannot generally be overridden by
contracts of employment, relate to sex and race discrimination, equal pay
and maternity benefits.
Some workers will be covered by wages councils, in which case they will be
entitled to minimum pay. Among other statutory rights are those covering
sick pay, time off for various (including trade union) activities and union
membership.
A company's own rules should also be written down to save arguments later
(see checklist). But what if these rules are broken and things have gone so
badly wrong that the employee needs to be disciplined or sacked?
According to Jones, the balance of power has changed over recent years.
'Some companies used to think you couldn't dismiss people at all,' he says.
Now employers are more assertive, but the rules still need to be followed
carefully if the dreaded industrial tribunal is to be avoided - the time and
trouble involved in a tribunal should not be underestimated.
A solid week's work, perhaps for the most senior person in the company,
could go into form-filling, communications between the parties, and
attending the hearings.
Average tribunal awards of Pounds 1,500-Pounds 2,000 may end up looking
trivial when compared with the other costs involved.
In summary, following investigations and informal warnings, a disciplinary
procedure will normally have the following four steps, says Acas:
Formal oral warning - in the case of a minor offence.
Written warning - for subsequent minor offences or a more serious offence.
Final written warning - for further misconduct.
Dismissal - with appropriate notice .
The fact that redundancy issues feature so highly among Acas' inquiries and
complaints is partly linked to the recession - some small companies will be
contemplating redundancies for the first time.
Selection for redundancy is a problematic area, particularly since the
practice of 'last in, first out' is in decline.
Acas warns against using criteria that are too narrow when it comes to
selecting for redundancy, like basing selection solely on how often an
employee is absent. Compulsory redundancies may be avoidable altogether  -
basic though it may sound, one employer recently in touch with Acas, for
example, had not considered asking for volunteers.
Salary, bonus and deductions problems, as well as arguments over alterations
to contracts of employment, are also more common since the onset of the
recession.
Pay may be composed of several elements, including, for example, use of a
company car outside work. An employee who is being paid off with a lump sum
in lieu of notice may argue the car should be kept for the notice period, or
may try to pursue additional compensation.
Bonuses and commission payments may also be a source of argument if the
basis on which they are calculated is not clearly defined.
When margins are narrow, the incentive for small businesses to tighten up on
timekeeping and cut down on waste will be even greater. However, Acas warns
against making unlawful deductions from wages, for example for lateness or
till discrepancies.
These sorts of deductions should not be made unless the employee's
permission has been given in advance.
Agreement, preferably in writing, should also be gained before changes are
made to contracts of employment.
An industrial tribunal may consider it reasonable for an employer to alter a
contract without consent, for example to make essential changes in working
practices resulting from developments in technology.
But Acas warns that proceeding without agreement is a risky strategy for an
employer and could end in claims for unfair dismissal and - in the courts -
wrongful dismissal.
Clearly, negotiating rather than imposing change will be likely, ultimately,
to lead to a more co-operative and flexible workforce.
Misunderstandings may be caused by not spelling out to someone exactly what
they are doing wrong; evading the issue or getting a third party to do the
dirty work can create similar confusion.
Avoiding a face-to-face discussion about a problem 'is in the British
character', says Jones. Simply failing to ask for, or listen to, an
employee's side of the story is a common root of subsequent tribunal action.
And when the firm that is 'just like a family' has a breakdown in
communications between family members, the ensuing feuding, ill-feeling and
emotional as well as financial costs may be every bit as high as they would
be in a domestic setting.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Setback for Maxwell MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN at Westminster on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners suffered a
setback yesterday, as it emerged that there is little prospect of an inquiry
by the parliamentary ombudsman into the conduct of the department of trade
and industry.
MPs believe that the statement last week by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, was a signal that there is not enough of a case of potential
maladministration for the ombudsman to investigate.
Mr Lamont said that claims that the DTI had failed to act on warnings from
Imro, the investment management regulatory organisation, did not appear to
be substantiated, and that in any event, the Securities and Investments
Board (SIB) had found that those legal uncertainties did not make any
material difference to Imro's regulation of the Maxwell pension fund
companies.
The pensioners' campaigners have regarded an investigation by the ombudsman
as critical to their argument for government compensation.
Mr Richard Page, the Tory co-chairman of the all-party group campaigning on
behalf of the pensioners, contacted Mr William Reid, the ombudsman, last
month, with details of Imro's representations to the DTI in 1987 and again
in 1990 about the difficulties of combining trust law and the financial
services act.
Though a decision not to launch an investigation will be a blow to the
campaign, the issue may not rest there. Mr Frank Field, a member of the
cross-party social security committee, has said that when the committee
begins its renewed inquiry into the Maxwell affair, it might consider
meeting Mr Reid. Mr Reid has already issued a statement outlining the limits
of his jurisdiction.
Details of the argument against an investigation were set out in a Commons
debate by Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary.
He said that after Imro had passed to the DTI a report by Professor Hayton
about the problems of the law on pension fund regulation, the department had
told Imro and SIB not to rely solely on trust law for regulating the
management of occupational pension schemes, and that it was for them to
devise adequate investor protection.
'Neither Imro nor SIB at any time advised the DTI that it disagreed with
this advice or was unable to deliver the degree of investor protection
required,' Mr Nelson said.

THE WELSH Office and the building management section of the Property

their bills on time, according to government figures, Diane Summers writes.
Less than 42 per cent of PSA building management bills are paid within the
contract terms or 30 days. The Welsh Office, meanwhile, pays 65 per cent of
invoices within the period, according to the survey.
Top of the prompt payment league is the Inland Revenue, which pays 99 per
cent of invoices within 30 days. Other swift payers are National Savings (93
per cent) and the Department of Energy (92 per cent). The DTI itself has an
80 per cent record.
The government has recently been exhorting the private sector to help small
business suppliers, in particular, by paying bills promptly.

FT  14 JUL 92 / High Court sets aside judgment against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUBLIC of Iraq has succeeded in having a judgment for more than
Dollars 500m (Pounds 260m) set aside by the High Court in London. The
judgment was obtained against it last year by Kuwait Airways Corporation.
In a ruling given in April, but only just made public, a judge in the
Commercial Court held that KAC's writ was not validly served. The writ was
served through diplomatic channels on the Iraqi Embassy in London in January
last year, with a request that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in Baghdad.
However, Mr Justice Evans said service on a state was deemed to have been
effected when a writ was received by its foreign ministry and there was no
evidence that the KAC writ was received by the ministry in Baghdad.
The judge rejected a claim by Iraqi Airways Company, against which KAC has a
judgment for nearly Dollars 490m, that the writ was not validly served on
it.
He also rejected IAC's arguments that it had state immunity from KAC's legal
action and that the English court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the
dispute.
Yesterday KAC's London solicitor, Mr Christopher Gooding, of Clyde &amp; Co,
said Iraq had won only 'a Pyrrhic victory' because the writ would eventually
be validly served on it.
The case concerns 10 KAC airliners which, after the invasion of Kuwait, were
flown to Iraq and handed over to IAC.
Six of the aircraft were later flown to Iran, where they were interned by
the Iranian authorities. The other four aircraft were destroyed in air raids
on Iraq.
In January last year KAC started legal proceedings in London and obtained
judgment for Dollars 515,274,988 damages against Iraq and Dollars
489,455,380 against IAC, neither defendant having taken part in the
proceedings.
The judgments were stayed last July when IAC and Iraq gave notice that they
wanted to contest KAC's claim and intended claiming state immunity and
challenging the High Court's jurisdiction to deal with the dispute.

PLANS for a Pounds 100m gas-turbine combined heat and power station on the
edge of Newcastle upon Tyne's city centre were yesterday given outline
approval by Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, Chris Tighe writes.
The station, intended to provide heating for big energy users in the city,
has been promoted as a showcase energy-efficient project suitable for a
heavily populated urban location.
The CHP concept has been championed by Newcastle City Council for more than
a decade. Forth Energy, which devised the plans approved yesterday, is a
consortium of the council, architects Couves and consulting engineers Merz
and McLellan, both Tyneside companies.
Although the project has outline planning consent, its high capital cost
means it will only get off the drawing board if other large energy-sector
companies become involved.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A MALAYSIAN court order suspending production at a joint-venture chemical
plant of Mitsubishi Kasei, the leading Japanese chemical maker, prompted the
Japanese government to warn yesterday that all factories abroad must do no
harm to the environment.
The Ipoh High Court decision, including an order to remove radioactive waste
from the site, embarrassed Tokyo, which wants to take a lead in
environmental issues and has denied claims that Japanese industry is
relocating allegedly hazardous factories in poorer countries.
Mitsubishi, with a one-third stake in the Asian Rare Earth facility
producing materials for the electronics industry, said it was surprised by
the finding and was 'studying what action we should take'.
Japan's ministry of international trade and industry (Miti) yesterday
discussed the case with Mitsubishi Kasei and issued a formal caution to the
company.
Miti officials said all Japanese companies would be again urged to ensure
foreign investments do not create environmental problems; they would study
the Malaysian court decision before deciding on further action in this case.
The court found that suspending production at the plant was necessary to
protect people in a village near Ipoh from the waste. Eight had demanded
damages and the suspension of production, though the judge rejected the
damages claim.
Renewed debate is now expected in Tokyo over legislation scrapped last year
that would have demanded Japanese companies abide by strict domestic
standards in running their foreign factories.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Japan's trade surplus heads for record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S TRADE surplus for June rose 24 per cent over a year earlier to
Dollars 8.97bn (Pounds 4.7bn), bringing the surplus for the first six months
to Dollars 49bn, the largest recorded for any half-year period.
With the surplus on target to surpass the record annual figure of Dollars
82.7bn in 1986, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) will
announce a new import promotion campaign later this week.
The campaign is a response to criticism from the US and EC about sluggish
Japanese imports. The trend was clearly shown in the first half, when
exports rose 8.6 per cent and imports fell 3.3 per cent, leaving a surplus
larger than the Dollars 48.5bn recorded in the second half of 1986.
In June, imports were 5.1 per cent higher than a year earlier at Dollars
19.12bn, while exports rose 10.5 per cent to Dollars 28.09bn, reflecting the
desire of Japanese companies to increase foreign sales to compensate for
lower ones in a slowing domestic economy.
The new import promotion campaign will have little immediate influence on
the surplus, as it is designed to encourage foreign investment in Japan and
increase imports by setting up provincial trade zones. But Tokyo hopes the
surplus has peaked, and pointed to an easing of the seasonally adjusted
surplus from Dollars 9.7bn in May to Dollars 7.9bn last month. Seasonally
adjusted exports rose 4 per cent on May, with imports 16 per cent higher.
Mr Russell Jones, senior economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the surplus
would remain large for the next 18 months or so, prompting an
intensification of international presure on Japan to stimulate a weak
economy.
'The key to the Japanese surplus is domestic demand. In recent years we have
seen the yen's adjustment has only had a marginal effect on the surplus. At
the moment, Japanese companies are turning to export markets.'
The import figure in June was bolstered by a 22.8 per cent increase in
textile imports and a 16.3 per cent rise in foodstuffs, but these increases
highlighted the continuing importance of primary or partly processed
products in Japan's import mix.
The most significant increase in exports were of transport machinery (up
16.4 per cent) and ordinary machinery (up 14.1 per cent). Japan's car makers
have increased exports to soak up excess domestic production lines' excess
capacity.
During the month, exports to the US rose 7.5 per cent on a year earlier to
Dollars 7.6bn, while imports from the US edged 0.8 per cent higher at
Dollars 4.44bn. Exports to the EC were up 10 per cent at Dollars 5.2bn;
imports from the EC were 8.3 per cent higher at Dollars 2.6bn.
Trade continued to expand rapidly with south-east Asian countries, while the
most notable leap was in bilateral trade with China. Imports from China in
June rose 33.1 per cent, while exports to China were 31.8 per cent higher
than in the same month last year.

<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of volunteers, supported by the New Zealand air force and army, are
mounting a big exercise to help farmers save more than 1m sheep, 10,000
cattle and thousands of farmed deer which have been caught in freak snow
drifts blanketing much of the central part of the South Island.
However the snow, said to be the worst since 1946, promises a break in the
power crisis, caused by a drought, which has led to concern about possible
job lay-offs.
The drought has caused nationwide power cuts, with Comalco, the aluminium
producer, shutting down a third of its giant smelter at Bluff, on the
southern tip of the South Island.
State-owned Electricorp says that provided consumers take care, there should
now be sufficient water in the lakes that supply the hydroelectric stations
to see the country through the winter months.
With no thaw in sight, the snow threatens the sheep, cattle and deer, most
of which are breeding stock, and the livelihood of farmers. Canterbury, the
worst affected province, is a centre of New Zealand's sheep industry, and
farmers say they expect a disastrous lambing season.
Air force helicopters are flying volunteers into mountainous areas to help
muster the animals and provide them with hay. Sheep are suffocating as they
try to stand on one another's backs in the four- to six-foot drifts, and
cattle are dying of thirst, because they appear unable to take moisture from
the snow.
Farmers have been told they will not get government assistance for the stock
losses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, is losing popularity, with
fewer voters seeing him as intelligent and capable as recession maintains
its grip, Reuter reports from Canberra.
Mr Keating's waning image was reflected yesterday in a Morgan Gallup poll,
which showed that his Labor government would probably be beaten easily by
the conservative coalition in an election, which must be held by May next
year.
Liberal leader John Hewson, long seen by voters as dull and unimaginative,
is reaping the benefits of Mr Keating's decline in popularity since becoming
prime minister in December after ousting Mr Bob Hawke in a party coup.
Mr Keating is seen as capable and intelligent by 30 per cent of voters,
compared with 37 per cent in June last year when he was treasurer, the
pollsters said. Mr Hewson's 'capable and intelligent' rating was 33 per
cent, down two percentage points.
The government is likely to wait for the last moment, hoping for an economic
turnaround, before calling an election, Labor sources said.
The nationwide poll of 3,170 voters indicated 57 per cent approved of Mr
Hewson as a leader, while 33 per cent approved of Mr Keating, with 10 per
cent undecided.
Mr Keating's approval rating in mid-March, soon after he stimulated the
economy with a ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 890m) job creation plan, was 40 per
cent, against 47 per cent for Mr Hewson. But much of the money, most to
improve infrastructure such as railways, has not yet been spent and the
jobless toll is growing.
The Morgan poll, taken in the week to July 4, indicated 36 per cent support
for Labor in an election against 44 per cent for the coalition.

<TEXT>
PALESTINIAN officials yesterday said the offer by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli prime minister, to meet Arab delegates either in Arab capitals or
Israel in the search for peace offered nothing new, but said they hoped that
the offer signalled that Israel might prove more flexible during the next
round of Middle East peace talks.
Jordan made no official response last night to Mr Rabin's offer to travel to
Amman for informal peace talks, or his invitation to meet King Hussein in
Israel.
However, the Jordanian ruler has previously refused all offers of separate
official talks with Israelis either in Jerusalem or in Amman.
No immediate reaction was forthcoming from either Lebanon or Syria, but
President Hafez al Assad, the Syrian president, has also professed the
utmost resistance to visiting Israel.
The only Arab leader to have made the trip was President Anwar Sadat, the
assassinated Egyptian leader, in a gesture which helped forge peace between
Cairo and Israel, but which ostracised Egypt from the rest of the Arab
world.
Senior Palestinian officials in Amman claimed that despite Mr Rabin's offer
to seek a breakthrough in the peace process, the Israeli premier was
avoiding what they called the 'pre-requisites for peace'.
'Our problem with Rabin is that he wants to sell himself as a peacemaker,
but he has to prove himself with deeds, not words,' said one official.
He said that Palestinian delegation at the peace talks wished to see Israel
first accept in full the Geneva convention, which bans Israel, as an
occupying power, from changing the identity of the West Bank and the Gaza
strip.
The official said that if Mr Rabin wishes to be serious about peace he must
show 'genuine readiness' to halt all settlements on the West Bank.
Palestinian officials said that Mr Rabin's offer to talk in neighbouring
Arab capitals echoed calls from the previous Likud government for a
normalisation of relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours.
However, Palestinian groups and the Arab governments participating in the
peace talks insist that Israel must first withdraw from the territories
occupied in 1973 before there can be any normalisation of relations.
The Arab delegations to the peace talks, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the
Palestinians, have consistently rejected Israel's call for the negotiations
to be conducted in the region.

MALAWI magistrates' court yesterday charged pro-democracy campaigner
Chakufwa Chihana with three counts related to sedition, his lawyer, Mr
Bazuka Mhango, said, Reuter reports from Lusaka. The case had been referred
to the high court for trial.
'He has been charged with offences relating to sedition, the first one of
importing seditious publications, second, being found in possession of
seditious publications and third, preparing an act with seditious intent,'
Mr Mhango said. The penalty was a fine equal to Dollars 770 (Pounds 403) or
a five-year prison sentence.
Mr Chihana, 52, chairman of the Lusaka-based Interim Committee for a
Democratic Alliance, was arrested on April 6 when he returned to Malawi from
meetings with pro-democracy exiles in Zambia and South Africa.
He was freed after a high court judge granted him bail, the first in
Malawi's history of political detentions. Western governments have been
pressing President Kamuzu Banda to allow opposition parties in Malawi.

THE 'dumping' margin between the domestic retail price of Japanese audio
cassette tapes and the price in the EC market continued to widen even after
protective duties were imposed by the EC, Brussels sources claimed
yesterday.
EC officials were responding to Tokyo's accusation that duties were unfairly
levied on Japanese cassettes in 1990. Last week's attempt by the Gatt
anti-dumping committee to reconcile the two trading partners failed. Japan
could ask the Gatt disputes panel to rule on the issue.
The difference between Japanese and EC prices was between 44 and 64 per cent
in the three years up to 1988, according to Brussels. The duties imposed on
four Japanese manufacturers ranged from 15 to 25 per cent. The EC says that
underpriced cassettes imported into the EC 'literally destroyed' the
Community industry - now with only one large cassette manufacturer - BASF,
the German chemicals group.
EC member states yesterday gave their formal approval to the agreement with
the US to limit direct and indirect government support for new commercial
airliner projects.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Efta set to flower, then fade away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are uncertain times for the secretariat of the seven-nation European
Free Trade Association (Efta). With the giant west European free trade zone
known as the European Economic Area (EEA) starting in January, Efta will
acquire hitherto undreamed-of powers over its members.
Its 150-strong staff and SFr50m (Pounds 19m)-a-year budget will double. Yet
within three to four years it may shrink to two tiny members, Iceland and
Liechtenstein, as Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and possibly Norway,
desert to the European Community.
Efta's machinery will include a surveillance authority, its powers equal to
those of the EC to regulate competition, subsidies and government
procurement within Efta countries, and a court of justice to ensure Efta
nations comply with EEA law. Each will have seven members, and their own
secretariats.
The court will be based in Geneva, where Efta has its headquarters, but the
competition section of the surveillance authority and some other Efta staff
will be in Brussels, better to swap notes with the European Commission on
applying EEA rules. Under the EEA accord of last May, these are basically EC
rules Efta countries are to adopt en bloc, except the Common Agricultural
Policy.
In addition to the SFr100m a year for the expanded Efta organisation, Efta
members are expected to spend another SFr600m in 1993 for the privilege of
joining a free trade area of 380m people. Some SFr400m of this will go on EC
programmes in which Efta countries will share, such as research and
development. A further SFr200m will go to fund aid for poorer EC regions.
Those countries aspiring to EC membership expect the expense and upheaval
entailed in implementing the EEA to pay off in a shorter period of accession
negotiations with Brussels, because 80 per cent of EC legislation will have
already been adopted.
The stage could then be set for Efta and the EEA to act as a 'training
ground' for other EC hopefuls from eastern Europe. Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia all hope to join. But Efta officials point out that joining
the EEA could prove almost as hard as negotiating EC entry. Meanwhile,
Efta's future beyond the mid-1990s must remain in doubt.

<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC vice-presidential candidate Senator Al Gore said yesterday there
were millions of jobs to be created - and stolen from Japan and Germany - if
the US led the way on the environment, Reuter reports from New York.
'This supposed choice between jobs and the environment is a bogus issue,' Mr
Gore, a leading environmental activist, said on television on the first day
of his party's election-year convention.
However, critics fear that his policies would put nature above people and
cost workers their jobs, at a time when US unemployment is already hovering
at an eight-year high.
President George Bush, the Republican incumbent, has been attacked as a
laggard on the environment who has failed to provide world leadership or
even keep up with the rest of the pack.
Mr Gore said Washington's main economic rivals realised there were big
profits to be made in exporting environmentally-sound products to the
developing world.
'Japan and Germany and others are gearing up to sell those products.
Millions of jobs can be created here in America if we are able to lead that
environmental revolution,' he said.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Unity and hope make a tentative appearance: Confidence has
been low at recent conventions. This one might be different
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two commodities with which the Democratic party has become unfamiliar
are hope and unity.  Both are present this week in New York, but both are
still fragile.  Storm clouds hover on the horizon as Democrats gather in New
York to pick their presidential candidate
Not since 1964 has the party held what might be described as a confident
convention. Even in New York in 1976, the precursor of the last presidential
election victory, the hierarchy's suspicions about the insurgent southern
candidacy of Mr Jimmy Carter were only partly allayed by the selection of a
party stalwart, Mr Walter Mondale, as running mate.
The 1968 convention in Chicago was a disaster. The assassination of Robert
Kennedy, the likely nominee, split the party and the anti-Vietnam war
protests in the streets outside were the worst backdrop imaginable.
In 1972 in Miami, procedural wrangling meant that Mr George McGovern gave
his acceptance speech in televised prime time only in Hawaii. Even the
selection of Mr Tom Eagleton for second place on the ticket turned out to be
disastrous when he withdrew shortly afterwards following revelations about
his health.
In 1980 there was a sense of doom about Mr Carter's chances of re-election,
exacerbated by the fact that the party's liberal establishment was
emotionally and politically committed to the cause of Senator Edward
Kennedy.
In 1984 Mr Mondale seemed destined to be defeated from the outset against a
popular incumbent. His choice of Ms Geraldine Ferraro as running mate was
eye-catching and perhaps salved the souls of the activists, but it did
little for the party's national credibility.
Mr Michael Dukakis went to the 1988 convention with hope, ahead in the
polls, but that was to prove illusory. Unity was wafer thin and fell apart
as soon as the Republican guns were turned against him.
Comparisons may be made this year with all the recent predecessors; some
work to Mr Bill Clinton's advantage while others do not. For example, it
probably helps that the party's activist wing, with a litany of liberal
causes that runs to pages, is not the force it was.
Only Mr Jerry Brown of the dissidents remains a non-convert, and even his
own powerful political family from California is urging him to come around,
partly for Mr Clinton's sake but also for the future political prospects of
his sister, Kathleen, now the state treasurer and likely gubernatorial
candidate two years from now.
Conversely, liberals have always been nothing if not enthusiastic, but
genuine exuberance for Mr Clinton is still not conspicuously present. The
enforced harmony of this convention, so Republican in its concept and
execution, may be politically necessary but it may also have the effect of
persuading would-be voters to stay at home in November, which is precisely
what the Democrats do not want.
Furthermore, the Clinton-Gore ticket is a southern one. This makes sense
because if the Democrats cannot break through in that part of the country,
now a solidly Republican stronghold, they cannot win in November. (Mr Ross
Perot's presumed presence in the race makes it even more vital that a
credible southern campaign be effected.)
However, the liberal establishment remains profoundly suspicious of
southerners, even though neither Mr Clinton nor Mr Gore can be described as
political outsiders.
The last successful regional ticket was that of Truman and Barkley in 1948,
a good precedent in one sense because it won, though it did so against all
odds.
The party will be concerned, as it was with Mr Carter in 1976, that a
southern-dominated campaign will lack sophistication and bite. The party
will seek to impose its values and insert its people into Mr Clinton's
organisation, which is still run from Little Rock and still dominated by
those without overweening national reputations. The potential for subsequent
infighting is great.
Nothing unsettles traditional Democrats more than an overt commitment to
traditional values - of religion, the family and the work ethic - all of
which are centrepieces of the Clinton movement. The implication is that such
a commitment leaves out society's less fortunate, most of whom the Democrats
have reckoned to be their own since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Such an approach, no matter how cloaked, appears to be borrowing too much
from Republican clothes, even though the Republican method has led to
victory in five of the last six presidential elections.
Of course, causes have changed. The great party commitment of the early
1980s to the equal rights amendment for women has been replaced by
determination to defend women's reproductive rights, a sentiment which is
certainly more popular in the country at large and which cuts across party
lines.
It is also a fact that the trade union movement, the underpinning of Mr
Mondale, for example, has lost political clout. Yet it can still turn out
the vote better than most (even Reverend Jesse Jackson) if it is turned on.
Mr Clinton, coming from a state in which unions are not favoured, has still
to prove he can do this.
Democrats have also been comfortable traditionally with activist economic
policies, partly to promote their causes and partly in reflex opposition to
Republican alternatives. The decay of the social infrastructure in the last
12 years, many still feel, vindicates these beliefs.
But Mr Clinton is not a conventional 'tax and spend' Democrat and, while
there may be an appreciation of the fact that this makes him a less easy
Republican target, it leaves the question of where his heart really lies.
All these factors, present and sometimes dominant in recent conventions, are
still clouds over New York this week. They may not appear as great as the
fundamental question of Mr Clinton's 'character' and fitness to be
president, but in the months ahead, if not in the enforced harmony of New
York, they will drop their rain on him.
After all, Democrats would not be Democrats if they did not fall out from
time to time. It is a characteristic that makes the party more interesting -
and so difficult to put in the White House.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Clinton sets out policy of bargain with citizens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton's call for a 'new covenant' between the US government
and the American people has left its mark on his party's policy platform.
Echoing the language Mr Clinton has used throughout his campaign, the
platform seeks a bargain in which the government promises to expand
opportunity but insists that its citizens accept greater individual
responsibility.
The covenant would:
Invest more in education, training and child care for people needing welfare
support, but insist that everyone able to work must do so, either in the
private sector or in community service;
Offer all students automatic loans to pay for their college education,
regardless of their family income, but require them to pay them back either
with a percentage of their future income or through some form of national
service;
Support family leave legislation and expanded child care facilities but
crack down on 'deadbeat parents' who do not meet child support obligations;
Raise teachers' pay but require them to maintain and prove classroom
competence.
In its rejection of 'both the do-nothing government of the last 12 years and
the big government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and
spend our way to prosperity', the platform represents an attempt to appeal
to the centrist Democrats and independent voters who have deserted the party
in the last three presidential elections.
The platform also carries a message of 'no pain, no gain' in its warning
that the massive and rising federal government deficit will require 'fair
and shared sacrifice of all Americans for the common good'.
Dominated by Clinton supporters, the platform committee rejected specific
proposals from Mr Paul Tsongas, Mr Clinton's principal challenger in the
spring primaries, that would have expanded on the theme of necessary pain by
calling for a cap on federal spending and an increase in petrol taxes.
It does, nevertheless, insist on the need for an effort to address the
budget deficit by tackling discretionary spending, reforming entitlement
programmes and raising taxes on the wealthy - even though the platform
relies heavily on the assumption that its economic growth strategy will
generate more tax revenues.
In the critical area of health care system reform, the Democratic platform
falls well short of specifics. The Democrats have not resolved their
disagreements on the best way to overhaul a system in which costs are
spiralling far ahead of inflation, even though their commitment to reform of
some sort is stronger than President George Bush's somewhat half-hearted
tinkering.
The platform does not attempt to decide between the pay-or-play approach, in
which employers would be required to provide their workers with health
insurance or else contribute to a state fund, and the Canadian approach, in
which the government would take over as the sole payer.
Instead, it calls for a 'uniquely American reform' that will provide
universal access to quality, affordable health care as a right.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Mexican ruling party heads for state poll defeat
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S centre-right National Action party (PAN) is set to win the
governorship of Chihuahua state, only the second time that the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has lost a gubernatorial election in
its 63-year history.
Mr Francisco Barrio, the PAN candidate, declared victory early yesterday
morning, with an estimated 54 per cent of the vote, based on his party's
unofficial count.
The PRI had 41 per cent of the vote, and appeared ready to concede.
However, the PRI appeared to be leading in the weekend's other governorship
election, in the state of Michoacan, where the main opposition was the
left-of-centre Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). The PRI estimated that
it was ahead by about two to one after counting 70 per cent of the votes.
In contrast the PRD estimated that it was narrowly ahead after counting
votes at around 20 per cent of the polling booths. An exit poll put the PRI
well ahead.
The contending claims could prepare the way for a tense post-electoral
period. The PRD is planning to hold a victory rally today, which may turn
into a demonstration against the government party.
The PRI hopes that a defeat for the PRD in the stronghold of its president,
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, would make it difficult for it to mount an effective
challenge in the 1994 presidential elections. For this reason the PRI
mounted one of the most expensive and sophisticated campaigns in its
history, spending Dollars 33m (Pounds 17.2m) in the state, according to
observer groups' estimates.
The voting was quiet and relatively trouble-free in Chihuahua, partly
because the government and PAN worked together to ensure a peaceful process.
The PAN's victory reflects its support in northern, better-off and
relatively industrialised states. It won its first governorship in 1989 in
Baja California, another border state.
In a 1991 election in the state of Guanajuato, the PRI candidate resigned
and admitted charges of vote fraud, after which President Carlos Salinas
named an interim governor from the ranks of the PAN.
The PAN's victory in Chihuahua may actually benefit Mr Salinas's government.
It will be used as evidence of the PRI's commitment to greater democracy,
and further strengthen the hand of the conciliatory faction in the
pro-business PAN, thereby widening the gulf between it and the more
hard-line PRD.
In Michoacan the election was much calmer than the municipal elections in
1989, but Mr Ricardo Pascoe, the PRD spokesman, claimed the process was
'fraught with irregularities - some of them very serious'.
He claimed that multiple voting was widespread, electoral rolls were changed
at the last minute, and voting urns were stolen.

FT  14 JUL 92 / European Diary - France: Paris cinemas fear new wave of
competition - The expansion of French cinema chains is posing a threat to
the independents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE past few weeks the film buffs of Paris have been queueing patiently
 -and not so patiently - on the Place d'Italie to visit the Gaumont Grand
Ecran, the city's newest cinema and the biggest single screen in the French
capital.
There will be yet another brand new cinema to try out from tomorrow when Le
Dome Imax opens its doors at La Defense in western Paris. At a time when the
Hollywood studios are struggling and the British film industry is on its
knees, the launch of not one but two new screens in Paris could be seen as a
symbol of French cinema's success.
But the expansion of the big French cinema chains, notably Gaumont, the
Grand Ecran's owner, poses a growing threat to the dozens of tiny
independent cinemas that have turned Paris into one of the world's liveliest
film centres. The Grand Ecran's opening could come to be seen not as a
success symbol, but as a milestone in French cinema's decline.
Anyone glancing at this week's Paris film listings could be forgiven for
thinking that decline is a long way off. Paris is still a dream city for any
cineaste, with a wider choice of films than anywhere else in the world. The
city is plastered with posters for the latest Hollywood blockbusters showing
at the big commercial chains. Night after night the dozens of tiny
independent cinemas in the Latin Quarter play crackly prints of esoteric art
films to packed houses. This summer's retrospective of the films of John
Cassavetes, the US director, is the most successful revival ever in Paris.
The reason why there are so many films is simple - Paris has lots of
cinemas, 450 to be precise. The proliferation of independents means that
even the most obscure new movies usually open on at least three screens. The
purist film fiends rarely stray from the Latin Quarter art houses. The less
ascetic are tempted away to more exotic screens such as La Pagode, a
Japanese pagoda imported to France in the 1890s and converted into a cinema
in the 1930s, or Le Grand Rex on Boulevard Poissoniere, where images of
clouds are projected on to the star-spangled ceiling.
For years the art houses have co-existed comfortably with the big commercial
chains, thanks to the support of the sympathetic Socialist government, whose
long-serving arts minister, Mr Jack Lang, is an ardent cinema fan.
Mr Lang has long believed that it is impossible to have a healthy domestic
film industry without an adequate distribution system. One of his first
initiatives as arts minister in 1982 was to split up GIE, then France's
biggest single cinema chain, into two networks, Gaumont and Pathe.
The two new chains, together with UGC, the other big French network, have
since been forced to compete for films.
Given that there is only a limited number of Hollywood movies to go round,
this competition has created more room for independent productions on the
commercial chains and has alleviated the pressure on the art houses.
But earlier this year Gaumont struck a deal to swap a string of its
provincial cinemas for the Paris screens owned by Pathe. This means that
Gaumont, which now has 19 cinemas with 79 screens in the capital, is once
again the dominant chain in the capital, with UGC as its only serious rival.
The cynics in French film circles claim that Gaumont's growth has already
had an effect. Gaumont and UGC, they say, are allocating too many screens to
Hollywood blockbusters. The most widely distributed films in Paris this
week, Basic Instinct and Beethoven, are both from the US and both showing on
almost 20 screens. There are fears that this situation will worsen next year
when Gaumont starts to act as the exclusive French distributor for Disney,
the US film studio.
Another concern is that distribution is becoming increasingly difficult for
independent film makers. Mr Serge Toubiana, editor of Cahiers du Cinema, the
film magazine, recently wrote an article in Liberation newspaper describing
the problems faced by Mr Daniele Dubroux, a young French director, in
finding a cinema to show Borderline, his latest film.
Mr Lang's Arts Ministry has voiced its concern, as has the French film
producers' association.
Mr Michael Sapin, the finance minister, last week took action by referring
the Gaumont/Pathe deal to the Conseil de la Concurrence, the competition
authority, for retrospective investigation.
He also warned that he would be keeping a sharp eye on similar transactions
in the future.
Meanwhile, the big French cinema chains are intent on becoming even bigger.
UGC is now building the capital's first multi-screen cinema complex.
Gaumont is renovating four of its Paris cinemas as part of a Pounds 20m
programme. For better or worse, the era of the Grand Ecran has begun in
Paris cinema.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Wholesale prices show slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNUAL RATE of increase in German wholesale prices slowed further in
June, reinforcing expectations of a fall in consumer price inflation in late
summer.
A month-on-month drop in prices of 0.1 per cent translated into a rise in
the wholesale price index of only 1.2 per cent, the federal statistics
office said yesterday. This followed increases of 2.3 per cent in April and
1.7 per cent in May.
Although welcome, the news failed to override adverse reactions in stock and
capital markets to the possibility of further tightening in the Bundesbank's
monetary policy later this week.
Concern over runaway money supply growth has for the moment replaced
inflation as the main talking point in business and financial circles.
Mr Friedel Neuber, chairman of the WestLB bank, the biggest public sector
bank in Germany, said yesterday that a 'clear statement' from the Bundesbank
after its council meeting on Thursday would help to calm markets. He said he
was doubtful that the central bank chiefs would decide to tighten monetary
policy, although some council members are lobbying strongly for moves to
deter demand for credit. The DAX stock market index lost almost 18 points to
close at 1,736.50 and the Rex bond index ended the day at 96.51 (96.78).
Immediate prospects suggest inflation will fall this month to below 4 per
cent, compared with 4.3 per cent in May and the 10-year high of 4.8 per cent
recorded in March. The expected drop will result mainly from the effect of
higher duties on oil and tobacco, imposed 12 months ago, falling out of the
year-on-year prices calculations.
However, 'home-made' inflationary pressures are still strong, according to
the HWWA economics institute in Hamburg. The main source is high wage
settlements in this year's round, which is currently showing through in a 6
per cent rise in the costs of services and repairs.
The housing shortage is also forcing up rents at an annual rate of more than
5 per cent, and car running costs are up more than 7 per cent.
Main contributors to the downward trend in wholesale price rises were fresh
vegetables, 4.2 per cent cheaper than a month earlier, and heavy heating oil
(off 3.6 per cent).
However, the picture was marred by an 18 per cent rise in the cost of fresh
fish and increases in men's clothing and frozen meat.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Brussels to speed anti-trust probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is planning to speed long-winded anti-trust
inquiries by introducing new internally binding deadlines.
Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, said yesterday that a new
accelerated procedure for investigations into joint ventures would be
introduced from next January 1 at the latest.
Brussels competition authorities are also trying to accelerate state aid
inquiries and are considering how to introduce public deadlines for other
anti-trust cases, including investigations into cartels and abuses of a
dominant position.
As part of what Sir Leon described as a 'wide-ranging review of procedures',
the Commission will commit itself to sending at least a preliminary opinion
on joint venture cases to the companies involved within 'a few months'.
Under 1990 rules, Commission inquiries into large EC mergers have to be
completed within five months. If Brussels fails to meet the deadline then
the merger has to be approved. But the speed of EC merger inquiries has only
underlined the sluggishness of other investigations, which sometimes last
for years rather than months.
Sir Leon was addressing the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy
Studies on the future of competition policy. He said he could 'conceive of
no development, be it political or economic, that could change our view that
(anti-competitive agreements) are contrary to the fundamental aims of the
Treaty (of Rome)'. But he added that Community competition policy should
remain flexible to changing circumstances.
Looking ahead, Sir Leon said he believed many member states would find
themselves obliged to reduce direct subsidies to business because of the
constraints of European economic and monetary union.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Russia seeks western help to break privatisation log-jam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is turning to the west in an effort to breathe some
life into its plans to privatise enterprises and industries still
overwhelmingly in the hands of the state.
An announcement is likely soon that a consortium of western companies and
banks, led by the accountancy and consulting firm Deloitte Touche Thomatsu,
will advise on different aspects of the process.
The privatisation programme has become bogged down in wrangles over
legislation and in disagreements within the Russian cabinet about the mode
and pace of selling off the state bodies. However, decrees on privatisation
and on bankruptcy are now in place, and a programme has been passed by
parliament.
Privatisation, seen by the government and foreign experts as the core of the
reform programme, has not put down deep roots in any one of the former
Soviet republics, in part because of lack of capital, but mainly because of
resistance by management and workers, and government fears of unemployment.
However, all large enterprises (employing more than 1,000 workers or with
more than Rbs50m capital) are now obliged to submit plans by the end of
October for transforming themselves into joint stock companies, with their
shares initially owned by the state.
Goskomimushchestvo, the Russian state property agency which is overseeing
privatisation, has already prepared model plans for more than 8,000
enterprises, It is also rushing to introduce vouchers allowing Russians to
take shares in the companies to be privatised.
Once the plans have been approved by the local property committees, the
workers and managements of the enterprises must vote on how they wish to be
privatised, and what share of the assets they will take for themselves.
Foreign investors will be allowed to bid for part of the assets.
It is planned to extend the privatisation of shops and small enterprises,
which began early this year in Russia's third largest city, Nizhny Novgorod,
to other cities soon, beginning with the southern town of Volgograd. Other
cities have been slow to follow the Nizhny experiment - under which shops
were auctioned to the highest bidder - but a few have been cajoled into
experimenting with at least small scale capitalism.
The Russian government now claims it will press ahead regardless of
resistance and fears, foreshadowing a prolonged struggle in industry in the
second part of the year.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Carrington denies that he is intending to resign: Leader of
EC peace conference says effort goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor, and JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe
Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD CARRINGTON, the British chairman of the European Community's peace
conference on Yugoslavia, yesterday denied reports that he intended to
resign from his post.
The reports had been fuelled both by a declaration adopted by last week's
Group of Seven summit suggesting that a broader international peace
conference might be desirable, and a statement last Sunday by Sir John Nott,
a former British defence secretary, that Lord Carrington's mission had
outlived its usefulness.
'I was asked by the European Community whether I would do this and I don't
think you give up because things have gone very badly, unless those who
appointed you want to,' Lord Carrington said. If the EC peace mission were
to be wound up and the whole process were to start again under the United
Nations or another authority, it would not make any difference, he added.
'The problem is that they (the warring parties in Bosnia and other parts of
the former Yugoslavia) do not want peace at the moment,' he said. Lord
Carrington has invited the leaders to a meeting in London tomorrow, though
they have yet to respond.
The leaders of the G7 industrial nations and those of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) who met in Helsinki shortly
afterwards fully supported the EC conference as the right framework for
reaching a durable political solution in the former Yugoslavia. However,
their statement on the subject clearly hinted at growing dissatisfaction
with the EC forum.
France has been particularly active in canvassing an international peace
conference, to the irritation of the British government, which has remained
loyal to Lord Carrington's mission.
Sir John Nott added grist to the mill when he said that a single country
such as the US or France, with its historical links with the region, or
possibly the United Nations, would do better at brokering peace
negotiations, when the time was ripe.
There is little consensus about the usefulness of the Community peace
conference among the governments of the republics of the former Yugoslavia.
Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, while supporting the Community's
efforts, has rejected the plan drawn up in March by Portugal - at that time
holding the EC presidency - to divide Bosnia-Hercegovina into cantons.
The Moslem community, which makes up 44 per cent of Bosnia's 4.3m
population, and which is concentrated in the urban areas, argues that this
scheme is a prelude to dividing Bosnia along ethnic lines.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has welcomed the EC's efforts largely
because his republic has now been recognised and the peace conference has
not yet come to terms with tackling Croatia's involvement in the war in
Bosnia, or its treatment of its Serb minority.
Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, believes the EC peace plan for
Bosnia-Hercegovina will eventually lead to the annexation by Serbia of
eastern Bosnia.
Slovenia, for its part, supports the EC conference on the grounds that it
could help resolve disputes over the share of the internal and unallocated
debt accumulated by the former Yugoslav federation.
The Macedonian minister of information, Mr Martin Trenevski, said in London
yesterday that 'the longer the EC puts off recognising the republic of
Macedonia, the greater the risk of instability.'
The EC recently met Greece's demands that it would recognise the republic
only if it did not call itself 'Macedonia.'

FT  14 JUL 92 / Tough Italian package impresses currency markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets yesterday reacted positively, if cautiously, to the
Italian government's emergency austerity budget announced late on Friday.
The lira improved only slightly against the D-Mark, being quoted at L757.2
against Friday's L757.4. However, it recovered more ground against the other
main European currencies. Dealers said they would have liked more concrete
moves to cut public spending but were impressed by the fact that the
measures were coherent and non-inflationary (inflation is running at an
annualised 5.7 per cent) and had been put together quickly by Italian
standards, in less than a week.
The speed and decisiveness with which Mr Giuliano Amato's government has
acted seems to have caught Italians by surprise even though they had been
aware tough measures were essential to curb the public sector deficit. The
Socialist prime minister has also tried to head off union protest by
presenting a socially equitable package. Even so, the net effect of new
duties and taxes on property and bank deposits will mean an average increase
of L120,000 (Pounds 55) per month in tax for each household.
The package has sought to find an extra L30,000bn to hold down the public
sector deficit to L128,000bn as planned in the original 1992 budget. This
will be split more or less equally between cuts and increased revenues. On
revenue, the government has opted for measures which are easy to effect and
which tax identifiable assets. Thus L11,200bn is expected to come from the
unprecedented and one-off tax of 6 per 1,000 lire on bank deposits and Post
Office savings. The remainder will come in increased property taxes, higher
stamp duties and such measures as raising annual gun permit prices (from
L200,000 to L400,000) for Italy's 8m hunters, passports and driving licences
(renewed annually).
On spending cuts, more than L1,700bn will come from the defence budget.
Other savings will come in freezes in public sector employment, lower
transfers to local authorities and reduced calls on social spending via
increased employee contributions. Pension reform, gradually raising the
retirement age to 65 for men and women through incentives, announced as part
of the budget, is likely to have only limited impact this year. The
government will also save money by the removal, effective this week, of
guarantees on foreign exchange risk on all public (and some private) foreign
loans.
The main uncertainty involves the extent to which privatisation plans can be
accelerated to generate income within 1992. As of yesterday IRI, the main
state holding company, ENI, the state oil concern, ENEL, the state
electricity authority, and INA, the insurance institute, formally became
joint stock companies under the tutelage of the treasury as a prelude to
privatising up to 45 per cent of their shares. The government hopes to raise
L4,000bn through privatisation by year-end but this may have to come via an
advance from a consortium of banks formed to guarantee the share issues.
Before the measures, the public sector deficit was already set to rise to
L175,000bn, nearly 11 per cent of GDP. Even if the budget succeeds, it would
be surprising if the deficit can be held down to L128,000bn. Also, many of
the measures used to generate extra revenue are one-off. To retain
credibility, they will have to be part of larger structural reforms
attacking the overblown public sector and tax evasion.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRIBUNAL of inquiry into allegations of fraud, malpractice and political
favouritism in Ireland's beef-processing industry has been adjourned until
September 2, pending the outcome of an appeal to the Dublin supreme court.
The appeal is being taken by Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney general,
against a ruling by the high court last Friday which allowed questions to be
put to witnesses about cabinet discussions on the export credit insurance
scheme.
Mr Liam Hamilton, the tribunal's chairman, said yesterday it was 'unable to
continue its inquiries' until the supreme court's decision was known.
The supreme court gave Mr Whelehan and lawyers for the tribunal seven days
to make written submissions before it could hear the appeal. A date for the
hearing is expected to be set next Monday. At issue is whether cabinet
discussions are confidential or can be revealed at the tribunal, an
important constitutional point.
Opposition parties have accused Fianna Fail, the senior partner in Ireland's
coalition government, of being behind Mr Whelehan's move and of trying to
undermine the tribunal.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (6): The bright lights beckon - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAHRAIN's biggest tourist attraction dare not speak its name.
However hard the island markets its virtues as a tourist destination - and
the government is marketing these more vigorously than ever - it will not
advertise its liberal drinking laws as being among them.
Islamic propriety prevents the government from selling Bahrain on the basis
of its bars. But since Bahrain's neighbours prevent the selling of alcohol
altogether, little selling is required.
More than 1.4m people arrived in Bahrain last year for tourism or recreation
 -75 per cent of them fellow Gulf Arabs. An average of around 160,000 of
these visitors a month arrived over the 25km causeway which links Bahrain to
the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, which is very strictly teetotal - 'the
Saudis, very bluntly, come here for R and R,' says one official.
It would not be entirely accurate to claim that these visitors all crossed
into Bahrain just for a weekend drink (by far the majority cross only for
the day and a half of the Moslem weekend) - although numerous expatriate
workers with Saudi Aramco, the kingdom's giant oil company based over the
causeway in Dhahran, make no bones about the fact that they do.
Whatever Bahrain's additional attractions, and these include a good number
of Arab and western-style nightclubs, several top-of-the-range hotels and
restaurants and a generally accommodating atmosphere, Bahrain's weekend
popularity adds up to an industry worth, by government estimates, more than
Dollars 1bn a year - more, if the figure is correct, than its aluminium
smelter, for instance.
It also adds up to a growing and labour-intensive industry which the emirate
is, given its acute need to create jobs for young Bahrainis, exploiting to
the hilt.
According to government figures, the hotel industry in 1990 employed just
656 Bahrainis out of a total workforce of 3,249. However, Mr Tariq Almoayed,
the minister of information who is responsible for tourism, believes that as
many as 10,000 Bahrainis could eventually be employed in the sector.
On the path to that, as yet far distant, dream, Bahrain has set up a hotel
and catering training centre, which injects 200 Bahrainis a year into the
industry and which this year will add a year-long course in travel and
tourism to its curriculum.
The island is also adding fast to its hotels, particularly those of two- and
three-stars which cater for the bulk of visiting Saudi and other Gulf
families, on the basis that each new room equates roughly to one new job.
Bahrain already has 23 two- and three-star hotels and an additional 10 are
being built. 'With relatively small investment, you can create very large
opportunities for employing Bahrainis,' says Mr Almoayed.
The government's Tourism Development Company is also expanding - to the
extent that it can afford - the range of attractions offered on what is, to
be honest, a fairly small and featureless island. The company has set up bus
tours, dhow trips to nearby Dar island and has just completed an
impressively housed Arabic restaurant, in full wind-towered Gulf style,
beside the equally impressive new museum on the emirate's north coast.
The company also helped establish the island's first beach club at Al
Bander, which gathers an excellent fish restaurant, bars, holiday
apartments, a swimming pool and tennis courts round a small, man-made cove.
But the Al Bander development, to be followed shortly by the opening of a
new Meridien resort hotel - the island's first such - on a spit of land off
Bahrain's northern shore, points up some of the limitations the island faces
in promoting itself, as it is also seeking to do, as a rounded, upmarket
tourist spot.
To begin with, the island is acutely short of beaches. In fact, Bahrain at
present has only one public beach to speak of - the Emir's beach to the
island's south. The Al Bander beach has been hewn and sanded out of
otherwise rocky coast, and the Meridien will also have to create its own
sandy shores.
Moreover, much of the country's coast will be impossible to develop for
tourism - the east coast houses most of the island's heavy industry, much of
the west coast is taken up by private villas and the dagger-tip south coast
embraces the island's main airbase and is thus firmly out of bounds.
The government hopes, nevertheless, that the Meridien and Al Bandar will
create what one official calls a 'small critical mass' to pump-prime further
private sector investment into developing upmarket tourist features. One
hope is that the island's five five-star hotels will loosen out of being
purely business hotels into providing a bit more tourist fun.
But in aiming further upmarket and away from purely causeway-fed tourism,
Bahrain suffers badly from comparison with Dubai, its go-getting United Arab
Emirates rival further down the Gulf. Dubai's aggressive bid for the same
tourist market is already supported by three large resort hotels, one grassy
golf course, with another on the way, long stretches of sandy beach and,
most important, by something in the region of 10 times Bahrain's oil
revenues with which to invest further in tourist attractions. A large theme
park, for instance, is already well into planning.
Bahrain's hope is that visitors will include the island as one stop on a
regional Gulf tour - though at present, inter-Gulf co-operation on tourism
is as fraught with rivalry as other areas of regional economic endeavour.
Nevertheless, the island's promoters have persuaded the South African
airline Flitestar to open weekly flights to Bahrain later this year carrying
what, for the most part, will be tourist passengers.
In the end, though, it will be the bright lights visible from Saudi Arabia,
promising Egyptian and Filipino nightclub entertainers, a small feast of
Italian, Greek, Arabian, Chinese and Indian restaurants and, of course, the
odd glass of Johnnie Walker, which will keep Bahrain's future hotel and
catering school graduates busy on a Thursday and Friday evening.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (8): Tensions below the surface - Foreign
Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the leaders of the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC)
gathered in December 1990 in Doha, the capital of Qatar, it was obvious to
an non-participant what was going to dominate the agenda.
Kuwait, one of its members, had been invaded and annexed by Iraq four months
earlier. Despite efforts at mediation and a desire to find an Arab solution,
the military build-up headed by the US was going on apace. Although few
governments then believed that President Saddam Hussein would not extricate
himself at the last moment from the threat of war, the affluent states of
the Gulf faced, none the less, their most serious challenge since
independence.
Perversely, the GCC members found they had a more pressing issue to discuss.
While the rest of the world struggled with the ambitions of President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, the Doha summit was largely preoccupied by the dispute
between Qatar and Bahrain over the border between the two GCC neighbours.
Eighteen months later - with Saddam's forces driven from Kuwait, the
al-Sabah family restored to power and the oil fires extinguished - Bahrain
and Qatar are still at loggerheads.
The argument between the two ruling families and governments is one of
several left behind by Britain when it withdrew from east of Suez. Kuwait is
in the process of winning back some territory absorbed, since the 1970s, by
Iraq; Iran appears to be trying to wrest from the United Arab Emirates total
control of Abu Musa island at the mouth of the Gulf; Saudi Arabia and Yemen
are exchanging angry words over oil exploration along part of their disputed
border, and elsewhere there are several other territorial issues which could
flare up again at any time.
These arguments are not easily susceptible to mediation. First, they often
involve strongly held beliefs and intense personal and tribal rivalries.
Second, there is invariably an economic aspect - in particular, the right to
explore for hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the parties involved in the dispute
may well suspect each other of pursuing an unseen agenda, perhaps involving
more powerful players in the region.
Such suspicions have contributed to the disappointing performance of the GCC
as an effective political and economic organisation - a failure particularly
regretted by Bahrain.
In part, it reflects the GCC's difficulty in finding a role for itself among
the region's competing forces. In the four-way pugilistic context of the
past decade, Saudi Arabia and its five smaller partners have occupied one
corner, with Iraq in another, Iran in the third - and the fourth occupied by
the US, which until recently viewed the Gulf as a crucial area of superpower
confrontation. The only overall winner from this complex mesh of conflicts
appears to be the US, with its military mastery of the region and its
parallel grip on an important part of the world's oil supplies.
The benefits, beyond the removal of an Iraqi military threat, are less
obvious for small nations such as Bahrain. Ministers who expected greater
regional harmony in the wake of the Iran-Iraq war and the Kuwait crisis have
been disappointed. Worse: they see the resumption of old rivalries - with no
apparent attempt by the remaining superpower to resolve them.
Bahrain's rulers remember all too well that not until 1975 did Iran agree
not to pursue its claim to their country. Four years later, Iranian designs
on Bahrain re-emerged as part of the revolutionary fervour orchestrated by
Ayatollah Khomeini. Some Manama residents sense in the present Iranian
ambassador an extension of that proprietorial attitude.
Qatar is also pursuing its claim to part of Bahrain, while seeking to
improve relations with Tehran. Such a rapprochement can be seen as an
entirely sensible move by Doha - given that Tehran also has access to its
huge offshore North Field structure, containing one of the world's largest
gas fields. However, several Arab commentators have already sounded the
alarm, warning Qatar of 'opening a door to Tehran that it would not later be
able to close.' They have also speculated that Qatar is using its closer
ties with Iran as a way of increasing pressure on Bahrain.
Officially, little of this breaks the surface. Statements by Bahrain are
couched in conciliatory language; Mr Tariq Almoayed, the minister of
information, says the government is more disappointed than irritated at
Qatar's decision to go alone to the International Court of Justice rather
than to make a joint application - as had been agreed by the two countries.
He adds that there may be a need to look at the entire border between the
countries - a reminder, perhaps, that historically Bahrain has laid claim to
Zubara, part of mainland Qatar. Bahrain's renewed plea for a joint approach
to the international court was again rejected by Qatar at the beginning of
this month. Foreign diplomats in Bahrain are confident that the argument can
be resolved amicably. But they recall that in 1986 the two sides came close
to blows, when the Qatari navy seized foreign workers constructing a
coastguard station for Bahrain.
Bahrain's call for better relations with Iraq is officially placed within
the same broad context of its desire for greater Gulf harmony. It is a
policy development which will be interpreted differently in various
capitals, but it broadly represents Bahrain's frustration at its inability
to plan a more secure economic future, and its sensitivity to continuing
claims to its territory. If the US State Department was at all surprised by
Bahrain's more flexible attitude towards Baghdad, it may be because
Washington has yet fully to appreciate the longer term consequences and
responsibilities of having demonstrated so emphatically its capacity to act
as the Gulf policeman.
Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the Emir, rarely misses an opportunity
when in the presence of Britons to express both his appreciation for the
British government's military contribution during the Gulf War and his wish
to see London playing a more vigorous and visible role in the region.
It is a message heard elsewhere in the Gulf, and it has a greater emphasis
now that Washington's influence is so much less qualified throughout the
Middle East. Keeping a sense of balance can apply almost as much to friends
as it does to enemies.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (7): Economic changes add to the strain of
adaptation - The prospects for political change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN ideal world of petrodollar surpluses and friendly neighbours, the need
for change would not even be raised. But ruling families along the western
shores of the Gulf are increasingly having to face the same broad issue of
how much or how little political adaptation may be required to meet a
markedly new set of economic circumstances.
The fact that new political structures are being erected, albeit at a
snail's pace, reflects the impact of unfriendly neighbours, flat oil prices,
a high level of defence expenditure and the prospect of persistent budget
deficits.
Oman now has a consultative council which has been asking ministers some
hard questions. Saudi Arabia, after more than a decade of waiting, is to
have its own consultative body - but with powers and membership still to be
defined. Kuwait goes to the polls in October to elect a national assembly.
If it is anything like its predecessor, forcibly dissolved in 1986,
ministers may again be in for a rough ride.
It would be wrong to conclude from this that the Gulf is in the first flush
of a democratic experiment. On the contrary: the experience of Algeria will
have confirmed governments in their view that political liberalisation is a
topic to be approached with the greatest caution.
Bahrain was seen, in the years immediately after independence, as a
democratic model for the region. But in 1975, after clashes with the
government, the national assembly was dissolved, never to be resurrected.
Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the prime minister, is not unhappy
with the concept of a consultative council for Bahrain, but has said that
his country will not lead the region on this issue - 'we cannot be singled
out to be the good Samaritan,' he said, during an interview. There is
particular reason for the prime minister's caution. There are 336,700
indigenous Bahrainis and more than 60 per cent of these are Shia Moslems.
The ruling family is Sunni. After the revolution in Iran in 1979, and the
creation of an Islamic republic under the spiritual guidance of Ayatollah
Khomeini, the export of militancy became one of the central aims of the
regime.
Bahrain, with its majority of Shias (many are of Iranian descent), was a
ready target. The Tehran government urged Bahrain's Shias to demonstrate
against their rulers; from 1979 until 1986 a series of incidents on the
island ranged from demonstrations to discoveries of arms caches. The
efficiency of Bahrain's well-staffed and British-advised security forces
contained the threat until the exhaustion of the revolution in Tehran.
However, the Iranian political establishment is far from monolithic.
Whatever the protestations of President Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani,
Bahrain will remain watchful both of Tehran and of any militant tendency
within its own borders.
This situation easily explains why Bahrain is not tempted to make even
modest political experiments. The foundations on which the existing system
rests, however, must eventually become less secure as, in common with
governments throughout the Gulf, Bahrain finds itself unable to provide all
the benefits to which its citizens have become accustomed. The overall rate
of population increase is estimated at 3.4 per cent; job creation is already
one of the government's main preoccupations.
Unemployment is officially put at 6.4 per cent, but western embassies
believe it may be much higher; some estimates show it running at up to 20
per cent. (In part that might reflect the local distaste for particular
forms of employment, and for less secure private sector jobs.)
The squeeze on government finances also places additional strain on the
provision of free public services such as health and education. Some modest
 -and heavily disguised - attempts have been introduced to boost tax
revenues, but more direct methods, such as an income tax, are deemed to be
politically impossible.
It is hardly surprising that the efficient management of the economy is
coming under closer scrutiny, especially by Bahrainis who have been educated
abroad. Their comments on the lack of co-ordination between ministries, the
allocation of resources, the competence of some senior officials and the
dispensation of patronage are a strong counterpoint to the official mood of
self-confidence and economic optimism. But even that appears to wear a
little thin when conversations turn to the commitment and competence of the
younger generation to assume political responsibility.
It should also be remembered that Bahrain is where other Gulf Arabs come to
relax. Bars, discotheques, uncensored news, some of the best restaurants in
the region and the cabin crews of Gulf Air International give Manama an
atmosphere not found anywhere else in the region. Bahrain comes
better-prepared than more rigidly controlled societies to accommodate the
political changes which eventually will have to be made.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (5): Cheap power sets the pace - Aluminium
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE aluminium industry in the Gulf is fast coming to rival the trendy status
of the cement industry in the region - a development which, apparently, no
self-respecting state can be content without.
Bahrain set the pace by establishing its Alba aluminium smelter in the early
1970s. Dubai followed with its own smelter a few years later.
Iran began work on one this year, and the Saudis are still investigating
whether they can build an aluminium plant with the help of one of their
offset investment programmes. Even Qatar is said to be thinking of joining
the fray.
The compelling logic behind these moves is cheap power, derived particularly
from the region's huge supplies of gas. 'Our energy costs are not quite as
low as those from, say, a Canadian hydroelectric plant  - but they are not
much more expensive,' says Mr Gudvin Tofte, chief executive of Alba.
Moreover, although Bahrain has only about 10 years' worth of oil reserves
left, gas supplies are expected to last another half century.
The rash of Gulf smelters also reflects the fact that environmental
opposition to setting up big aluminium plants is far less of an impediment
in the industry-hungry Gulf than in Europe or North America.
For such reasons, Mr Tofte sees no reason for Bahrain's smelter to fear its
new local competitors - 'it won't matter,' he says. 'Particularly with the
shutdown of aluminium capacity in Europe.'
Where other regional smelters could pose some threat, though, is to
Bahrain's downstream aluminium sector; the government has high hopes that
this will suck in foreign investment and offer just the sort of
labour-intensive growth the island needs to hire job-seeking Bahrainis, who
now make up about 85 per cent of the up and downstream industry's workforce.
The more Gulf countries which can offer potential investors the advantage of
a smelter on their doorstep, the more thinly spread any downstream
investment will be in Bahrain.
But the island has had some early post-Gulf war successes. Reynolds, the US
metals group, has committed itself to a Dollars 40m (or so) joint venture
with local investors to build an aluminium foil plant, and Alcoa, the US
aluminium giant, is also planning a smaller aluminium bottle closure plant
on the island, also with local investors.
Local downstream industries are also seeking to expand - to head off
regional rivals, and to absorb the new supplies of metal coming from Alba's
expansion programme.
'It's a question of survival,' says Mr Mahmoud al-Soufi, general manager of
the Bahrain Aluminium Extrusion Company, one of the island's four main
first-tier downstream operations. 'To be competitive we have to expand, be
more efficient and start recycling metal.'
By October, a month ahead of schedule, Alba expects to have completed its
Dollars 1.5bn plan to raise production capacity to 460,000 tonnes a year.
The smelter, which is 77 per cent owned by the Bahrain government, 20 per
cent by Saudi Arabia and 3 per cent by Breton Investments, a German company,
will then be considerably the Gulf's largest, and the third biggest
single-site smelter in the world.
Dubal, Dubai's smelter, also completing an expansion, now produces 240,000t
a year. The Iranian smelter (being designed and built with help from Dubai)
is expected to come on stream in 1994 with output of 220,000 tonnes later
rising to 350,000 tonnes.
ABOUT half of Alba's present output of 250,000 tonnes a year is absorbed
locally; once the expansion is complete industries in the area are expected
to purchase about 150,000t tonnes of ingots. The remainder will earn Bahrain
in the region of Dollars 600m a year in export sales at present prices.
Most of the domestically-consumed metal will go to Bahrain's four main
downstream operations: the 51 per cent government-owned Bahrain Aluminium
Atomiser Company; the private Midal Cable company; the state-controlled
Balexco and the Gulf Aluminium Rolling Company (Garmco), owned jointly by
Bahrain and a string of other Gulf governmental shareholders.
Each, now, is either considering or finalising expansion plans. Perhaps the
most ambitious of these will be at Balexco; late last month it concluded
agreement with Finleader, the Italian group, to build a new extrusion and
recycling plant in an investment worth about Dollars 35m. The joint venture
company, in which Finleader will have a 49 per cent interest, will be called
Gulf Aluminium Industries Company. It will nearly treble Balexco's original
design capacity to about 18,000 tonnes a year.
Balexco, which was established in the 1970s to provide building materials
for the Gulf's then booming construction sector, has seen this market
dwindle with the recession of the mid-1980s; it has only begun to recover in
the last year or so.
Its Finleader joint venture is designed to enable Balexco to start
manufacturing large transportation and structural extrusions, using the
Italian company's marketing arm to attack the European market.
Balexco is also well ahead with plans to join Samsun, the South Korean
group, in a joint venture to produce aluminium wheels, possibly with two
local private investors. The wheels would be largely for export to the US
and Europe, in a five-year investment plan likely to cost about Dollars 24m.
Balexco is also going ahead with projects to make small, high added-value
aluminium accessories such as door knobs, and to upgrade its 15-year-old
original plant. The company turned in a Dollars 2m profit in 1991, on
turnover of Dollars 33m.
Down the road from Balexco, at Bahrain's Sitra industrial area, Garmco is
also looking to raise output from its rolling mill to 110,000 tonnes a year
by 1995, from the present 65,000 tonnes, in a Dollars 75m investment
provided largely by its main shareholders, the Bahrain, Saudi and Kuwaiti
governments. Qatar, Oman, the Gulf Investment Corporation (a GCC-owned
investment vehicle) and Iraq also have holdings in the venture.
Garmco's intention is to shift focus - from selling mainly construction
products into the competitive furnace of the US and European markets - into
developing higher added value can-stock and lithographic plates to the
Middle and Far Eastern markets.
After expansion, Garmco expects to be producing 30,000 tonnes of can-ends
and tabs and up to 10,000 tonnes of lithographic plates.
It also hopes to raise profitability, from levels about which - given its
private, sovereign shareholders - it is now silent, by boosting output with
a minimal increase of 60-70 workers.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (2): Long-term strategy is set to evolve -
The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheerfully, Mr Ibrahim Abd al-Karim, minister of finance and national
economy, accepts that Bahrain is at a critical moment in its economic
development. But he insists that he is not in the least pessimistic about
the future.
For an economy recovering from the regional impact of an eight-year war
between Iran and Iraq, followed by President Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait, the headline figures as presented by the minister do not look at all
discouraging: real growth this year should reach 2.5 per cent, inflation
will be less than 2 per cent, unemployment is between 1 per cent and 6 per
cent, depending on how it is calculated, and oil prices continue to look
reasonably firm.
It is against this background that Bahrain will attempt to evolve a new
long-term development strategy over the next few years, as against the
short-term responses forced on it by the past decade of regional conflict.
'Instead of having to apply doses of morphine, the cabinet can now really
begin to develop a strategy for the future,' says Mr Abd al-Karim.
Some elements of that strategy are in place. For example, Bahrain allows 100
per cent foreign ownership of companies, permits overseas consultants,
engineers and other professionals to establish themselves without local
sponsors, has launched an industrial development bank, and as a reaction to
the number of offshore banking units leaving the island set up a promotional
unit designed to stem its decline as a financial centre.
Under consideration or in the pipeline is a board of trade that will promote
the country's private sector and a cautious programme of privatisation. Mr
Abd al-Karim says that a start has been made by selling some shares in hotel
companies and this may be expanded to take in shipyards, dairy products and
date processing. After that, the government's 40 per cent stake in the
national telecommunications company may be reduced, as well as the
shareholding in the National Bank of Bahrain. 'However, the approach will be
slow. It will take time,' says the minister.
Two closely related factors appear to have determined Bahrain's shift of
economic emphasis. First, the growth in the size of the budget deficit and
second, the need to find alternative sources of revenue to offset the
inevitable decline in the contribution from oil.
Private sector economists in Bahrain claim to have difficulty in making the
published government figures add up, especially in relation to the budget,
but according to Mr Abd al-Karim the gap between revenue and expenditure in
the last financial year was BD65m, somewhat better than the forecast BD100m.
Although the government has no trouble in meeting the deficit through local
borrowing, mostly by issuing short-term treasury bills, it is anxious to
ensure that it is capped at no more than BD100m, and then progressively
reduced as a percentage of gross domestic product.
PRIVATE sector sceptics remain unconvinced that the government can meet this
target while financing key development projects and maintaining free public
services for a growing population - 'there's no way that these figures can
be made to add up,' says a prominent local businessman. 'Either there have
to be some large hand-outs by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, or even more projects
will have to be postponed or cancelled.'
The cabinet has been looking, in conjunction with the International Monetary
Fund, at possible measures to increase revenues which could be introduced
without risking political stability. Most traditional western methods appear
to have been ruled out, such as a tax on incomes or a value-added tax.
Charging anything more than a nominal amount for utilities would be another
politically adventurous step to make. Import duties on items such as alcohol
probably have scope for further increases and modest amounts can be raised
through property and licensing.
'The other real snag for Bahrain is that it cannot get seriously out of step
with its neighbours. People here will not accept a significantly different
system from the one that operates in, say, Saudi Arabia. If it is free in
Riyadh then it has to be free in Manama,' says a diplomat.
Under the traditional system of government patronage it is difficult to see
great scope for improvements on the revenue side. But there is an
inevitability about the decline in revenues provided by oil which currently
provide 65 per cent of the total. Mr Abd al-Karim says he is grateful that
production techniques have been able to check the decline in output at the
level of 42,000 barrels a day as that provides a breathing space for the new
policies to be implemented.
Government spending, of course, is another matter and outside official
circles there is critical discussion of priorities, waste and the
dispensation of patronage. Mr Isa Abdullah al Borshaid, under-secretary for
finance and national economy, says there are three criteria for investment
decisions: economic viability, job creation potential and the ease with
which new projects can integrate with existing industries. Of those
requirements there is no doubt that the government is increasingly looking
at the potential for creating jobs.
The need is threefold: first to mop up some of the pool of unemployed, to
provide work for the increasing number of young people coming on to the
market each year, and to check the increase in the size of the expatriate
workforce. Because of budgetary constraints, the government has imposed a
ceiling on the numbers of public sector employees, still the preferred
occupation for the majority of Bahrainis, and is funding training schemes in
such areas as banking and hotels. It realises that there are unlikely to be
enough suitable opportunities on the island to meet future demand and is
therefore pushing the other members of the GCC to accept greater labour
mobility. The private sector is also well aware of the relative
attractiveness of employing expatriates who, in general, are willing to work
longer hours for less pay than Bahrainis and can be dismissed more easily.
Officials say that far more nationals are to be found in a greater variety
of jobs than 10 years ago, but there is a lack of enthusiasm for some types
of work and unrealistic expectations on the part of some returning
graduates. The evolution of Bahrain's economy could depend as much on
changes in personal attitudes as it does on the strategy mapped out by
ministers and their expatriate advisers.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (4): A lot of brave faces - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAHRAIN's tight banking community has never been short of brave faces, nor
of recent reasons to don them - not least because this community has
tightened somewhat over the past few years.
In the oil-booming early 1970s, when international and Arab bankers
converged on the island to recycle the region's sudden petrodollar riches,
75 offshore banks made their base in Bahrain. An oil price slump and two
Gulf wars later, the figure now stands at 48; and it is falling.
Bahrain Arab International Bank is liquidating assets in readiness to close.
Question marks hang over others - such as Kuwait Asia Bank - which have been
unable yet to claw back into profit, despite huge retrenchments. Other small
Bahraini Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) which have returned to the black have
done so modestly, and some, such as Bahrain Middle East Bank, are
energetically putting down roots overseas. Some have slimmed their
operations down to a very bare minimum.
The emirate's contraction as a banking centre is as much a natural
consequence of the region's banking and economic evolution as any response
to the series of political shocks which have buffeted the region - most
recently, of course, the Gulf war, which shattered confidence in the OBUs
and sliced their net assets to a record low of just over Dollars 48bn. (They
have since recovered to Dollars 55bn, but remain well below 1988's record of
Dollars 68bn).
The honey which drew the world's bankers to Bahrain was the servicing of
Saudi Arabia's sudden wealth in the 1970s; in project lending and treasury
operations beyond the sophistication of the insular banks in Riyadh and
Jeddah, while offering international expertise and connections to recycle
petrodollars.
Today, Saudi's fast-matured banks can manage all these tasks profitably and
without assistance. Furthermore, the kingdom's growing domestic capital
market, fuelled by the government's thirst for budget deficit finance, has
reduced the need for Saudi banks to place money offshore in Bahrain.
The liquidity of Saudi government instruments during the Gulf war contrasted
with Bahrain's short period of banking isolation, as foreign banks ran
scared and cut off lines to the island's bankers.
The upshot has been to sow disarray among the smaller OBUs, as project
lending, interbank markets and even a large portion of trade finance have
all fallen. Much of it has moved south to Dubai, with the growth in the more
southerly emirate's trade - particularly with Iran.
Allied to this is the diminution of Bahrain's role as a foreign exchange
market stopover between the US, European and south-east Asian markets; a
role Bahrain has seen eroded by technology and the increasing overlap of
trading hours between dealing centres.
A second wave of closures and cutbacks among the international banks on the
island is therefore under way, following that of the mid-1980s, occasioned
by the bad debts caused both by the oil price slump and intemperate Latin
American and other sovereign lending.
A concomitant of this is to leave the field more profitably open for some of
those banks which have survived. As a rule, the best placed of these are
banks either with strong shareholder support, with a clearly defined market
niche or with a head office overseas prepared to retain a commitment to the
area. Of the locally-incorporated OBUs, three in particular stand out: Gulf
International Bank (GIB), Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) and Investcorp.
They have always been the strongest performing trio on the island.
None has been immune from the recent shocks, although Investcorp, which
plugs the wealth of 'high net worth' Gulf locals into direct investments in
the US and Europe, has been affected more by depressed markets there than by
shocks in the Gulf. Its net profits last year shrank to Dollars 52.2m from
Dollars 66.3m - but 1991 was the bank's second best year.
Neither GIB nor ABC survived the Gulf war without losses, but both returned
to the black in 1991, with GIB turning around a loss of Dollars 422m, after
restructuring, into profits in 1991 of Dollars 46.5m. ABC steered from a
loss of Dollars 91m to pretax profits of Dollars 45m.
GIB has undergone the most convulsions, having shed a large tranche of what
included (its managers now admit) some very good assets to stay liquid
during the crisis. It has cut staff by a quarter and trimmed costs by
Dollars 17m a year, to Dollars 40m. To shake off its awkward Iraqi
shareholding, the other bank's other six owners, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
Abu Dhabi Investment Fund, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, this year approved the
bank's takeover by the Gulf Investment Corporation - in turn owned by the
Gulf Co-operation Council states, which injected Dollars 450m to
recapitalise the bank after GIB's original shares were written off.
Thus restructured, Mr Peter Sura, the bank's assistant general manager, is
predicting 'a very good year' for GIB, based particularly on the bank's
potential pickings in regional syndicated lending for the numerous oil, gas
and power projects, along with corporate lending to the buoyant Saudi
private sector and strong local trade and treasury work.
Mr Abdulla Saudi, ABC's president and chief executive, has led the bank
overseas in search of profitable growth; in 1991 it established ABC
International to consolidate its large European operations.
ABC is now turning its attention back to the Arab world. Mr Saudi says he
wants ABC to develop a retailing presence in as many Arab countries as
possible; in the last 18 months, in spite of unpromising economic
circumstances, he has opened seven ABC branches in Jordan. Algeria is ABC's
next likely target, and, possibly, the Gulf - though Mr Saudi says he would
prefer to establish a retailing operation in more than one centre at once,
possibly through acquisition. Political developments in Algeria may put that
project on hold.
ABC and GIB are Bahrain's biggest banks, and best known internationally.
They are sanguine about their immediate prospects, given the present
relative buoyancy of oil prices, booming private sectors in Saudi Arabia and
the UAE, and the appetite among the region's governments for borrowing to
fund their biggest projects.
These factors are putting good business in the way of those few foreign
banks, many of them American, which have retained a substantial presence in
Bahrain through the thinner years. Chase Manhattan, for instance, is
optimistic about the outlook for lending to government and parastatal
institutions, while Citicorp retains a substantial treasury operation in
Bahrain, putting Dollars 170bn through its dealing room monthly - 'I
wouldn't write this place off,' says one local banker. 'There's just too
much money in the region.'
However optimistic these institutions are about banking prospects, Bahrain
is unlikely to blossom afresh as an international banking centre.
As the Gulf's - indeed, the Middle East's - banking hub, Bahrain has no
immediate peer, in spite of the Saudi banks' strength and liquidity and
Dubai's flourishing trade business.
Neither the kingdom nor the UAE offers the strength of financial regulation
offered by the Bahrain Monetary Authority (advised by the Bank of England),
nor do most bankers based on the island feel that Riyadh, Abu Dhabi or Dubai
can offer the same attractive mix of good communications, congenial working
environment and breadth of associated financial services.
But further growth in Bahrain's financial sector would seem to depend on the
island's becoming the centre of a bigger, better co-ordinated and more
sophisticated capital market in the Gulf. This is an ideal the six Gulf
Co-operation Council (GCC) states (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar) have long espoused, but never embraced.
Bahrain's determination to foster regional developments along these lines
has led it to create a new unit in the finance ministry, advised by Mr
Michael Lee, a former senior director at Dean Witter Capital Markets, to
promote the idea, both locally and to international bankers.
'I see opportunities everywhere,' says Mr Lee. 'The question is, whether
there will eventually be a logical financial centre, or will the market
place fail to come about for artificial reasons.'
Two factors in particular have conspired to prevent the GCC from developing
into a single capital market. One is the region's corporate culture, whereby
most large enterprises are privately (and jealously) held firms; financed
privately, and without any apparent desire on the part of most owners either
to sell shares or to look for finance.
The second is the ambition of each Gulf state to develop its own capital
markets, even if such developments run defiantly against any logic of scale.
Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman all have their own stock markets of
varying degrees of activity.
Until such sovereign pride is overcome, and a Gulf-wide capital market given
a political push by the GCC, Bahrain's aspiration to become the Gulf's
booming capital markets centre will remain just that.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (3): New decade ushered in with a spring
clean - Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Gulf crisis blew a chilling gust through the offices of Bahrain's
economic decision makers, but it appears to have had a galvanising effect.
In the 16 months since Kuwait's liberation, and a war which temporarily
rocked financial and economic confidence in Bahrain, the government has
launched a slew of initiatives to sell itself as never before to foreign
investors; created a body dedicated to strategic thinking; started applying
a scalpel to off-putting bureaucracy, and has bound its new marketing effort
in glossy covers to mail to the world.
There is nothing new in Bahrain's strategy; since the late 1960s this has
been to encourage any new industries on the island which will wean it from
dependency on oil reserves that are set to run out early in the next decade.
Nor is there anything new in what Bahrain is advertising: its role as a
trade and industry 'hub' for the Gulf and Middle East.
What is new is the hardness of the sell. 'After the Gulf war it was like a
spring clean,' says Mr Ahmed Hubail, assistant undersecretary for commerce.
'We decided to enter the 1990s on a commercial basis.'
The Gulf war shock was not the sole catalyst for Bahrain's sudden
promotional drive, though many locals suggest that the war's sharp blow to
the banking sector helped to persuade the government that, to generate
growth, it cannot forever rely on Bahrain's regional pre-eminence as a
financial centre.
Another factor was the disappointing part Bahrain played in the post-war
reconstruction of Kuwait, and the subsequent realisation that the eventual
rebuilding of Iran, and perhaps also Iraq, both of which have also been
touted as potential prosperity for Bahrain, might in fact lie forever over
the horizon.
But a third spur to Bahrain's decision makers has also been the success of
Dubai, its richer and, to date, more energetically self-promoting rival down
the Gulf, in selling itself as the region's natural hub for trade and
industry. 'What's got them going is jealousy of Dubai,' says one diplomat.
'They've seen Dubai getting everything.'
Dubai, which is also hell-bent on diversifying its economy from oil, set up
the Jebel Ali free trade zone and port in 1985 which, thanks to a
heavily-financed marketing drive and a crack at cutting traditional
Gulf-style bureaucracy, has attracted 410 new companies and has room for
about 7,600 more. The main draw to Jebel Ali was its unique offer (in the
Gulf) of allowing foreign companies 100 per cent ownership of their
interests in the zone.
Unique, at least, until Bahrain picked up the gauntlet earlier this year and
decreed that 100 per cent foreign ownership would be permitted on the island
too - subject to these companies undertaking to 'use Bahraini resources and
be in the country's best economic interests.' This single step, which
abandoned normal Gulf practice of limiting foreign investors to a 49 per
cent share of any local company, is the focal point of its new
investor-friendliness.
Next, the government set up the Bahrain Marketing and Promotions Office
(BMPO) - itself closely modelled on Dubai's Commerce and Tourism Promotions
Board - to put in one office the responsibilities for company registration
which could previously have taken a prospective investor around two, three
or even four separate ministries.
The BMPO also offers seven-day registration for big-name companies,
hand-holding through the early stages of an investment and a collection
point for all Bahrain's previously scattergun promotional efforts.
Furthermore - and this measure is more softly spoken by officials - the
government also appears to be taking a more relaxed approach to
Bahrainisation - the desire for companies to hire as high a proportion of
Bahrainis as possible.
Although the greatest aim of attracting foreign investors to the island is
to assure employment for young Bahrainis, a big percentage of whom
(unadmittedly) are presently jobless, the government appears to have decided
that it should not allow Bahrainisation to be an obstacle to attracting
companies in the first place. 'Bahrainisation is not meant to be penal,'
explains one official.
It is early to assess the success of these new measures; the BMPO, for
instance, is only 9 months old, and presently has a staff of just three.
Nevertheless, the moves have already attracted Ericcsson, the Swedish
multinational, to set up a regional headquarters in Bahrain, while Digital,
the US electronics group, has also decided to establish its regional base on
the island, complete with a bonded warehouse and distribution centre. Mr
Tony O'Riordan, adviser to the BMPO, says a 'good dozen other companies' are
set to follow.
On a smaller scale, the government has also established the Bahrain
Development Bank, with initial capital of BD10m, to foster small local
businesses by offering loans, venture equity stakes and management
consultancy. Last month the bank approved its first four loans, worth a
total of BD500,000, and is processing applications from a further 90
businesses and individuals.
The bank is not only Bahrain's first development institution - something all
other Gulf states possess. It hopes also to become a semi-independent
repository of economic and financial advice on the island. Most other
sectors of the economy have also geared up behind Bahrain's new drive. The
airport, for instance, last year added nine new carriers to the 29
previously using the island in what its officials describe as a new 'open
skies policy with a touch of common sense.'
Multinational aluminium companies are being courted, with some success, to
develop the island's industry downstream of Alba, its large smelter. Travel
writers are being flown in to help crank up Bahrain's embryonic
international tourism industry. In fact, the government is candid about
being open to almost any offers.
'We are trying to develop any angle of anything that can be developed,' says
Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the prime minister, straightforwardly.
The trouble is, as Bahraini officials will grimly concede, so too is Dubai.
Although Bahrain is promoting its location as a hub, its congenial and
liberal atmosphere, its good communications systems, so is its rival emirate
to the south - with some justice.
Bahrain certainly has some edges over Dubai, particularly in its better
developed legal system, more developed financial services industry, and
higher standards of financial regulation. Against that, though, Dubai has
more money and more free land.
These latter advantages make it the galling fact that Bahrain's best ideas
can be, and often are, snaffled and duplicated by Dubai - or indeed by other
Gulf states. Dubai, for instance, has followed Bahrain in building an
aluminium smelter; Iran is now building another, and Qatar and Saudi Arabia
are also bearing the idea in mind. 'I believe we have good ideas, we have a
good basis for development,' says Sheikh Khalifa. 'But business goes mostly
to where there is more liquidity.'
The difficult truth for Bahrain (a truth the government well knows) is that
the poorest of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) states (the members are
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain) is
always the one to suffer most from the six countries' predilection for
duplicating each other.
'There is simply no recognition here of the division of labour,' reflects Mr
Hubail.
Until the GCC puts more emphasis on its middle initial, therefore, the
success of Bahrain's new marketing drive will depend largely on factors
outside its control.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (1): Quest for greater economic diversity
 -Bahrain has only modest oil reserves, but it has become an important
financial and trading centre in the Gulf. Now the island-state is seeking an
even more diversified economic future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor

<TEXT>
LAST year's great escape by the Arab nations of the Gulf from the predatory
grasp of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is not providing the long-term
relief that seemed probable at the time. Official optimism abounds, but
there is also a growing appreciation that the American-led military victory
has done little to resolve the economic, financial and political tensions of
the region. Bahrain has more reason than most to regret the failure.
With a population of 518,000 - 35 per cent of whom are expatriates - and
limited natural resources, it relies heavily on international confidence,
relative regional stability and a measure of neighbourly co-operation.
Bahrain's economy is underpinned by a modest 112,000 barrels of oil a day;
just 42,000 barrels of this produced onshore, the rest coming from an
offshore sharing arrangement with Saudi Arabia.
Since independence in 1971, the most obvious of Bahrain's economic
characteristics has been that it will be the first Gulf nation to face a
future substantially without oil. At current rates of extraction, its
onshore field will cease pumping early in the next century.
That mattered less before the Gulf war. Now that its wealthiest neighbours
have used most of their financial reserves to fund the international war
effort, Bahrain has less of a safety net and an even greater need to plan a
more diversified economic future.
That imperative goes some way to explain the apparent contradiction of
Bahrain simultaneously providing base facilities for the US Navy, while
urging better relations with Iraq. The paramount need for military security
is dealt with by the US, but Iraq and Iran (neither noted, in the past, for
kindly intentions towards Bahrain) are inescapably part of the Gulf's
economic future.
Those most involved in planning Bahrain's future talk most about Singapore:
'a model for small, island nations,' as one senior official put it. Bahrain
would like to see itself fulfilling, within the Gulf Co-operation Council
(which includes Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and
Bahrain), several of the roles which Singapore has developed within the
Association of South East Asian Nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
Philippines, Brunei and Singapore).
For example, Bahrain wants to expand further as an offshore banking centre
offering an increasingly sophisticated range of services. It wants to become
the principal tourism destination in the region, serving local markets,
especially Saudi Arabia, while forming part of multi-destination
international tours.
It also aims to attract more international companies to establish their
regional headquarters and supply centres; to dominate the local conference
and exhibition market and, by offering 100 per cent foreign ownership, to
persuade more private investors to look at opportunities for longer-term
industrial development.
THESE aims are a not a fanciful strategy, even if, on closer examination,
several of its concepts appear difficult to develop. Those difficulties are
exacerbated by the unco-operative aspects of the GCC.
Formed in 1981, in direct response to the war between Iraq and Iran, the six
GCC members initially denied any military or defensive purpose. It was, they
insisted, primarily a trading and economic organisation. In 1990 its
military role was forced into the open by Iraq but, to Bahrain's great
disappointment, this has still not been matched by greater enthusiasm for
regional economic agreements.
The dilemma for Bahrain is acute. It has been running a budget deficit for
more than six years; projected last year at 9 per cent of gross domestic
product.
On present revenue estimates it will need to borrow or (better) to be given
most of the capital for the development projects required both for
diversification and to create new jobs.
But Bahrain's capacity to borrow is limited, and support from other Gulf
countries is running at only a third of promised levels. Of the annual total
of Dollars 150m pledged to Bahrain, no payment has been received from Abu
Dhabi since 1982, and Kuwait stopped paying in 1990.
'We are grateful to Saudi Arabia for being the one country to meet all its
commitments,' says Mr Ibrahim Abd al-Karim, the minister of finance and
national economy.
Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the prime minister, emphasised in an
interview that Bahrain had not sought compensation from its wealthier Gulf
partners for the serious losses it had suffered during the crisis; neither
had any been offered. What was more important for Bahrain, he stressed, was
long-term economic regional agreements, especially those which aimed at
preventing duplication of effort.
In the absence of such agreements, Bahrain hesitates to embark on projects;
their viability could be undermined by its neighbours. The prime minister,
choosing his words with care, says that business tends to go where there is
most liquidity. (In other words, to countries with more money than Bahrain.)
To offset this tendency, Bahrain would like a commitment from its GCC
partners not to compete in specific areas.
Its chances do not look good. While international military intervention has
blunted the aggression of Saddam Hussein, it has done nothing to defuse
other, lesser, regional sensitivities.
In the wake of the Gulf war a rash of border disputes has resurfaced,
including Qatar's claim to sovereignty over the Hawar islands, an area close
to one-sixth of Bahrain's total land area.
Bahraini officials were dismayed by Qatar's unilateral approach to the
International Court of Justice and by its declaration of territorial waters
stretching close to Bahrain's beaches. (Why Qatar chose this path is not
understood in Bahrain, but the possible interpretations of Doha's motives
make fertile ground for conspiracy theorists.)
The resurgence of Iranian influence in the Gulf, under what is supposed to
be an emphatically more pragmatic leadership, has created economic
opportunities and political anxieties. Bahrain's bankers travel hopefully to
Tehran; in the meantime its internal security forces keep wary eyes on
hundreds of Iranians attending the biggest trade fair in Manama since the
overthrow of the Shah.
SHEIKH KHALIFA, while stirring up regional sensitivities by discussing
relations with Iraq, also includes in his long-term vision the possibility,
one day, of Iraq and Iran joining a GCC which has sorted out its present
internal difficulties. Bahrain wants a continued American military presence
in the Gulf, but it does not want Syrian and Egyptian forces to be deployed
in its defence; it protests at what it sees as western attempts to divide
Iraq into three.
Having to face in different directions simultaneously may be the fate of
small nations in conflict-prone parts of the world. But it also provides a
convenient shield for deflecting other unappealing suggestions. One idea
taken from Singapore is round-the-clock broadcasting by the British
Broadcasting Corporation. The uncensored provision of international news
helps to promote Bahrain's image as an information centre, but the official
who, memorably, saw 'the breath of fresh air blowing through our antenna,'
did not suggest that this would have domestic political repercussions. On
the contrary, the prime minister is emphatic that Bahrain, once the standard
bearer of democratic institutions in the Gulf, will not try again to set the
pace for political liberalisation. Sheik Khalifa praised Saudi Arabia's
announcement of a consultative council (its members have still to be named),
and said that anything which helped to form opinion was useful.
On the other hand, security was a life and death issue for Bahrain. It was
difficult to be a good democrat if that meant sacrificing security, he said.
Recent events in Algeria will have reinforced that view.
The absence of greater public accountability, however, does limit the
effectiveness of Bahrain's search for a more broadly based economic future.
Studies of Singapore will have revealed other, perhaps more pertinent,
reasons for that country's economic achievements. Singapore has a
functioning if rather regimented parliament. Singapore ministers and senior
civil servants are well paid, but face severe penalties if found guilty of
any financial impropriety. Singapore's working population accepts taxation;
enforced savings are deducted at source; there is a national acceptance that
the state provides nothing for free.
Few of those items are likely to figure on the agenda of either government
or governed in Bahrain. On the contrary, the traditional, family-oriented,
paternalistic style of national management shows every sign of persisting.
After the successive Gulf wars of the past decade, it can be argued that
Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the Emir of Bahrain, has guided his
country with admirable steadiness and that there is little demand for
change. Neither, perhaps, will there be, while the national exchequer is
sufficiently well funded to maintain popular expectations.
With over 60 per cent of government revenue coming from oil, limited
opportunities for reducing recurrent expenditure and the population
increasing at about 3.4 per cent annually, the Bahrain government is aware
that something will have to be done.
Its strategy for facing a future without oil may not appear entirely
convincing, but perhaps it need not be, given the relatively small
contributions required to put the national finances on a more even keel. No
country in the Gulf sees a greater need for regional stability, prospering
local economies and - critically - open-handed friends.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Oil industry refines its operations: A look at structural
change in the US energy sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US oil and gas industry will this week begin reporting mainly lower
second-quarter earnings against a backdrop of dramatic reductions in capital
spending and job numbers at many companies.
The cuts are more than a cyclical reaction to the weakness of US demand for
petroleum products and crude oil prices that are well below levels seen just
before the Gulf war in January, 1991.
Instead, industry experts say the US sector has begun a structural change
that could ultimately shift much exploration and production away from the
United States while raising energy prices for retail and corporate
consumers.
The challenges facing the US energy industry are several:
Congressional and local restrictions on drilling in places such as the
waters off the coasts of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska are causing many companies to
redirect their exploration efforts away from the US.
The sputtering US recovery and increasing price competition are keeping
marketing and distribution profit margins under pressure. The industry has
also concluded that the medium-term outlook is for only slightly improved
crude oil and natural gas prices.
The cost of modernising refineries and developing cleaner, reformulated
petrol - as dictated by environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act - will
be tens of billions of dollars during the next few years.
The consensus view is that the industry's operating cash flow will decline
by 10 per cent this year, to about Dollars 44bn (Pounds 23bn). Net profits
of the energy sector, which fell by an aggregate of more than 50 per cent in
the first three months of 1992, are expected to drop by at least 10 per cent
in the second quarter and by almost as much for the whole of 1992.
The result is that many companies are slashing operating costs. That means
sharp reductions in capital spending budgets, selling non-strategic assets
and saving money by redundancies that on average will eliminate up to 15 per
cent of the workforces of several big US companies.
Although the restructuring process has been underway for more than a year,
last week saw several announcements that are typical of the trend. Last
Monday, after a survey of 247 companies, Salomon Brothers forecast a drop of
nearly 20 per cent in 1992 spending on North American exploration and
production. Spending by these same companies outside the US was projected to
rise by 9.5 per cent.
On Tuesday, Mobil, the second biggest US energy group, said its 1992 capital
appropriations budget would be Dollars 1bn less than previously predicted.
The company's payroll was forecast to decline by 10 per cent by year-end and
the disposal of more than Dollars 600m of assets was forecast.
Wednesday saw Amoco, the fifth biggest US energy company, unveil plans to
take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to
reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or nearly 16 per cent, by the end
of next year.
On Friday, Mr Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute
(API), complained that lower crude prices, the sluggish economy and drilling
restrictions had caused the loss of 63,000 US energy jobs over the past year
and could lead to another 50,000 redundancies over the next 12 months.
In New York, Mr Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation, reckoned the US sector was facing 'major structural
changes,' including a dramatic shift in exploration budgets from the US to
places such as republics of the former Soviet Union, Colombia, Yemen,
Algeria, Venezuela and Indonesia.
Mr Goldstein said spending cuts had 'decimated' the US exploration and
production infrastructure of so many companies that the ability of the
industry to respond in a timely manner when the economic recovery eventually
strengthened was now in question.
In Houston, Mr Roger Frey, an energy sector loan specialist at Chase
Manhattan, attributed the structural changes to both mounting environmental
costs and the fact that 'the industry can no longer bank on steady price
increases'.
He said there was a realisation by the industry of the need 'to adjust to
only moderate oil and natural gas prices in the foreseeable future'.
Mr DiBona of the API argued that while the US energy sector would eventually
be leaner and more competitive, the shift away from exploration and
production in the US could be permanent and could affect the US balance of
payments in the 1990s.
Compounding the outlook is the fact that US refinery capacity is forecast by
analysts to drop by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent during the next three
years, while the nation's proven reserves continue to decline over time.
The implications of the US energy sector's restructuring were summed up two
weeks ago by Mr Victor Burk, managing director of the oil and gas industry
services division of Arthur Andersen, the consultancy. Although Mr Burk said
the shift away from US exploration would continue, he noted this did not
mean the US would be abandoned. Rather, the industry would enter a new era
when exploration would be pursued on the basis of geographical, operational
and technological niche opportunities.
Mr Paul Ting, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, concluded that
while 1991 was a bad year, with net income down by 21 per cent for the top
10 US energy groups, profits in the current year would also decline,
although less sharply.
With refining and marketing margins under pressure, much of the earnings
sweepstakes in the latter half of 1992 will depend upon the price of crude,
which is not expected to rise in a significant way.
Earnings could improve again next year, thanks partly to the lower operating
costs being wrought by restructuring. But neither US job levels nor
exploration activities are expected to return to past levels for quite some
time.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Slovaks inch towards independence from Prague
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SLOVAKIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Slovak nationalists who dominate the newly elected Slovak National
Council are expected to endorse a declaration of Slovak sovereignty when the
new session opens in Bratislava tomorrow. For many Slovaks, irked by a
1,000-year history of subservience to Hungarians or Czechs, the symbolic
declaration will underline Slovakia's right to run its own affairs.
Despite its long political subservience, Slovakia's wealth of fine Gothic
churches bears witness to a culture which many Slovaks feel has been
underrated. Bratislava's Catholic churches are packed for evening mass,
unlike the the more sceptical Czech lands cities, where church attendance is
low and protestant traditions live on. Differences are likely to widen if
the federal relationship with the Czech lands is broken as expected later
this year.
Under the communist regime Slovakia was industrialised with huge arms
factories, steel works and engineering plants which either exported to the
east or delivered components to finishing plants in the Czech lands. After
the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia many Slovaks, such as the former
president Gustav Husak, were promoted to top positions.
Traces of that recent past remain. The taxi drivers with brand new Peugeot
cars who lurk outside Bratislava's high-tech Hotel Danubia have the
unmistakable air of former secret policemen. Frontier guards who check
passports on internal flights still treat passengers like potential
defectors.
That is certainly the fear of the losers from the recent elections - the
Christian Democrats led by Mr Jan Carnogursky; the Greens, whose vote was
negligible despite the environmental degradation left by the communists; and
the Civic Democratic Union, which, as Public against Violence, held the
first street demonstrations against the communist regime.
But the clearest sign of nervousness about the future of an independent
Slovakia can be seen in the way the Hungarian minority voted on ethnic
grounds for the three Hungarian parties who form a compact bloc, despite big
political differences.
For nearly 1,000 years Slovaks were dominated by Hungary. Mr Gyorgy Halasz
of the Hungarian Civic party fears that if Slovakia, under the leadership of
Mr Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), breaks its
federal ties with the Czech lands, it will be the turn of Hungarians and
other ethnic minorities such as Gypsies, Ukrainians, Poles and Germans to
become second-class citizens.
'Meciar is angry with us because we were part of the coalition which ousted
him from government last year. We fear that Slovak will become the only
official language and we will be discriminated against. We intend to form a
united opposition with the right-wing parties and the Christian Democrats,'
says Mr Halasz in Kosice, Slovakia's second biggest city, near the Hungarian
and Ukrainian borders.
The presence of nervous ethnic minorities and strong Catholic traditions
kept support for the HZDS to 28 per cent of the vote in Eastern Slovakia
compared with 51 per cent in central Slovakia and over 35 per cent
nationwide.
Eastern Slovakia has suffered less from unemployment than central Slovakia
with its heavy concentration of arms factories. Thanks to some adroit
managerial footwork and federal assistance several thousand new jobs have
been created over the past year by VSZ steelworks, the largest employer in
the Kosice region.
It is a different story in central Slovakia, where thousands of workers have
been laid off from plants which supplied the former Soviet market. It is in
towns such as Martin that resentment against Prague and support for the
former communists and the pro-independence parties is strongest. But the
sense that Slovaks should take their own future in their hands and break
away from what is seen as Prague's insensitivity to Slovak interests is
strongest in the Bratislava-based ministries.
Mrs Dagmar Repcekova of the Economy Ministry's foreign trade department
approves of the emerging alliance between Mr Meciar, a former communist
secret policeman, and the 'Democratic left' reformed communists led by Mr
Peter Weiss. 'The Democratic Left is full of people who have a lot of
experience in planning and decision-making. Both Meciar and Weiss accept the
market system. But we feel that in the common state things will only get
worse while they (the Czechs) will get better,' she says.
Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel said yesterday he would be willing to
become president of an independent Czech republic if Czechoslovakia split
up, providing the conditions were right, Reuter reports.
Mr Havel failed to be re-elected as Czechoslovakia's federal president
recently after his candidacy was blocked by Slovak parliamentarians. He said
he would only accept nomination for a post of active president.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Justinian: The appealing laws of cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sport and the law are not natural bedfellows. Where they do meet, in the
enforcement of the rules of the game and codes of conduct, they need careful
nurturing, as the public row between the umpire and the Pakistan captain in
the third test match at Old Trafford with England amply demonstrated.
When the administrators of a game stray from imposing instantaneous
decision-making on the field of play according to simple rules, they
flounder in providing any kind of satisfaction to players, the instant
audience and the wider sport loving public.
Traditionally, all sports have been controlled by a referee or an umpire
(two in cricket) who interpreted the rules of the game with an unfettered
discretion and without any questioning from those ruled upon. Until
recently, a batsman given out accepted his fate gracefully and departed the
crease instantly; the most that he might do would be to stand his ground
while umpires conferred on whether a catch had been made.
Nowadays, however, dissent creeps into the game. Modern technology in the
form of action replay on a television screen provides the instant or delayed
opportunity for demonstrating the incorrectness of an umpire's decision. And
the commercialism of the sport, upon which so much depends for individual
players, serves only to feed the appetite for challenging the verdict. Since
the umpire's decision cannot sensibly or in practice be reversed, any
injustice of a palpably wrong decision rankles and causes friction both on
and off the field.
Alongside the heightened importance of winning and not losing is the
complication of the rules under which the game is played. The interpretation
of rules about bowling bouncers led the Pakistan fast bowler, Aqib Javed, to
exhibit petulance towards umpire Roy Palmer. The umpire had warned him, as
he was empowered to do, for intimidatory bowling at Devon Malcolm, his
opposite batsman.
In days gone by, any such impetuous dissent would have been passed off as of
no moment or the bowler's captain would have intervened - not as Javed
Miandad did, to take up his team mate's cudgels - to administer a friendly
warning that untoward behaviour on the field was not tolerable. Any
disciplining of a player by his captain or team manager would have been
dispensed later, off the field.
But cricket captains nowadays are sometimes less commanding figures than of
yesteryear. We may mourn the passing of the days when umpires and captains
were able to maintain order on the field, and players contained any
frustration they might have felt at wrong decisions. For there is usually a
law of averages operative in which one player given out is likely to be
balanced by a team mate being lucky to survive a just appeal.
Those halcyon days can be revived only if the administrators of cricket
stand firm and proclaim that the umpires have absolute control of the game,
including if necessary, the power to send the player off the field for any
serious infringement of the rules of the game or other misbehaviour.
But, alas, cricket administrators have responded predictably to some process
of adjudication external to the play. In doing so, they have failed to
appreciate what regulations and rule-enforcement can usefully provide to
assist an orderly game. They have not heeded the advice which lawyers could
give. The international cricketing authorities have adopted a familiar
technique of appointing a match referee who may conduct a post mortem on
some incident that has not been immediately resolved on the field. Hence
Conrade Hunte, a well-respected West Indian cricketer of the past, had to
pronounce on the propriety of Roy Palmer's umpiring decision on intimidatory
bowling; Aqib Javed's unseemly outburst at being warned; and at Javed
Miandad's undiplomatic intervention. The match referee's verdict was almost
wholly un-satisfactory. The bowler was deservedly fined. His captain
inexplicably escaped unscathed with merely a pointed request to exercise
leadership in the field in the future. Unaccountably, a request in similar
vein was made to England's captain. Worse followed. Pakistan's manager,
Intikhab Alam, responded to the situation by making an unwarranted
allegation that the umpire, at the end of the over, had thrown, not handed,
Aqib Javed's sweater to him, suggesting 'persecution' of the Pakistan team
by an English umpire.
If it is considered sensible to inject a post-match system of regulation,
much more attention needs to be paid to procedures and the mode of
decision-making. Cricketers who are subjected to this off-the-field process,
involving potential criticism and even disciplining, will rightly call for
proper avenues of representation before the match referee gives his verdict.
And the referee's decision must be properly reasoned if satisfaction to
those involved is to be achieved. This means that match referees will need
to be appointed according to their abilities as adjudicators as well as for
cricketing expertise, and not solely for their past cricketing prowess.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Monday Interview: Keeper of Germany's peace - Gen Klaus
Naumann, first head of the nation's armed forces since unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Klaus Naumann, the first man to be appointed Inspector-General of a
united German Bundeswehr since unification, is acutely conscious that his
most immediate challenges are social and political, as much as military.
Other countries, such as Britain or France, may take their armed forces for
granted. Germany does not.
'Germany is living in a special situation which many people do not quite
understand,' he says. 'In the 1950s, the reason for re-armament so shortly
after the war, and after the misuse of military power by a totalitarian
government, was the Warsaw Pact. The threat was obvious. And now it does not
exist.
'You British do not have such dramatic demolitions in your history. You have
always grown up with the idea that there are British forces. But there is a
great hole in our history about what constitutes a 'normal' military force.
'It is not a question which interests the simple man in the street, but is
rather for the intellectual upper classes. They have a rather idealised view
of international politics, that you can somehow tackle all problems without
using military force.
'I understand these people, but it does not correspond to the reality of
this world. I would say rather that those who are unarmed, and have no
defence policy, cannot pursue any policy at all.'
Two months ago, at a convention in Leipzig of more than 400 of his most
senior officers, Gen Naumann delivered an extraordinary speech.
Parts of the German military had become infected with 'idleness, paralysis
and even arrogance', he charged. There was grumbling in the ranks. Others
had succumbed to 'whining and despondency'. It was intolerable, and it had
to stop.
If the Germany armed forces were asked tomorrow to take part in a major
international peace-keeping exercise, he said, they would not be ready to do
so 'from a standing start'.
'Haven't we allowed ourselves over the years to put on a bit of fat, to grow
a little rusty?' he demanded.
It was a devastating performance, by a normally most mild-mannered man.
Gen Naumann was catapulted into the position of Inspector-General last
October after only six months as a corps commander and ahead of several more
senior men.
He is quite unlike any caricature of a Prussian army officer one might
expect from the German military. He is a slight man, soft-spoken, with
rimless spectacles and alert, friendly eyes. He is obviously intelligent,
and certainly not very frightening. At least, not until he spoke in Leipzig.
He was the personal choice of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who came to know him
as his main military adviser during the two-plus-four negotiations between
the two Germanies, and the four wartime allies, which led to German
unification in 1990. At that time he impressed with his grasp of the issues,
but also with his willingness to speak out.
He was also adviser during the Gulf war, when German prevarication over the
use of force against Iraq, and its inability to participate in the
operation, was widely seen as very damaging to the country's international
credibility.
Gen Naumann made no secret of his concern to the Chancellor. Germany could
not go on 'paying but not participating', he said. It clearly struck a
chord.
He has taken over the top position in the Bundeswehr at an acutely sensitive
moment. The immediate problems are three, but behind them lies another, much
more fundamental. The first is to reduce the size of the armed forces to
370,000 men, compared with 495,000 in the West German military alone before
unification. The second task is to dismantle the former National People's
Army of East Germany and integrate its remnants into the Bundeswehr,
including some 2,000 of the officer corps. And the third is to carry out
both those actions at a time of hefty budget cuts.
It is perhaps no wonder that there is grumbling in the ranks. More
important, however, and an issue of which Gen Naumann is acutely aware, is
the loss of the Bundeswehr's sole raison d'etre: to defend Germany against
the visible threat of the Warsaw Pact on its borders.
Gen Naumann knows that he has to persuade not just public opinion, but also
his own officers and men, that they have a vital and valid role in the
post-cold war world.
There is a strong neutralist tendency, albeit a minority one, within the
German body politic. It is the reason why the German constitution is
interpreted as forbidding the use of German troops outside the Nato area.
'Everyone seems to have the idea that the constitution forbids the use of
German troops outside (the Nato) area. It is not true,' Gen Naumann says.
'But it is a political reality.' He is seeking to define a new role for the
Bundeswehr which would include out-of-area operations.
His speech at Leipzig was far more than a reading of the riot act to his top
commanders. It was also a far-reaching attempt, from a military perspective,
to redefine the strategic priorities for the German armed forces.
They must no longer think in terms of confrontation, he said. The collapse
of the Communist empire meant that the immediate threat of attack on Germany
had been removed. But the uncertainties, and the instability in
nearly-neighbouring countries to the east, had increased enormously. He
believes that Russia will not succeed in destroying its arsenal of chemical
and tactical nuclear weapons before the year 2000. Nobody can be sure that
Russia will remain politically stable for that long.
'In this new situation, the role of the German military should not be seen
as an answer to an obvious threat,' he says. 'The task which has been set
politically for us soldiers is to provide an instrument for the politicians,
so that they can overcome the risks to the external security of the country,
and prevent or limit any external conflicts.'
Gen Naumann sees the Bundeswehr undertaking peace-keeping and peace-making
operations. He is convinced that peace can only be restored if peace-making
forces carry an adequate threat of force.
Within Nato, he is involved in the controversial debate over strengthening
the 'European pillar' of the alliance. He believes that not only Russia, but
the US too, will be increasingly concerned with domestic issues in the
coming years, and Europeans must take on a greater burden within Nato.
'The US as an ally and powerful economic partner will continue to find it
easy to influence Europe as a friend, but no longer with such a decisive
influence,' he says. Nato has a transitional strategy but still has to work
out a lasting strategy, he says. That means developing a balanced
relationship with the European Community and the Western European Union, the
forum within which the EC members of Nato are seeking to develop a separate
European defence identity.
The WEU, he says, should remain a bridge between Nato and the EC (as the
British would like to see it). But it should also provide Europe with the
means to act militarily if the US, or Canada, are not ready to do so. Hence
the need to allocate forces at its disposal, headed by the Franco-German
idea of a Euro-corps, whose first purpose will be to serve the WEU, and only
secondarily to serve Nato.
That is a very sensitive point, above all for the US. Gen Naumann insists
there should be no conflict. 'Everything we do should be directed to
strengthening the European effort, complementary to Nato and compatible with
Nato. We don't want to build any separate armed forces.'
He is equally adamant on the question of setting up a new German national
military command structure, in the unified and now sovereign Germany. It is
a reorganisation which may even do away with his own title of
Inspector-General and make him a 'Chief of Defence Staff' like his Nato
colleagues.
The process, he says, will leave Germany still totally integrated in the
Nato command structure. 'The name is not important,' he says. 'It is just
like changing the label on a bottle of wine. The contents will remain the
same.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / International Company News: Eastern German distribution
group to be privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER biggest distributor of electrical equipment, tools and materials
to east German industry is to go on sale this week, at a price expected to
be over DM150m (Dollars 98.60m).
At this level, which is based on previous deals involving purchases of
European building products wholesalers, it would make the price paid one of
the biggest for a privatisation in the former communist-controlled republic.
Maschinenbau-und Technikhandel (MBH), which once had a turnover of DM10bn,
has been slimmed down substantially and now concentrates mainly on selling
tools and components to the region's fast-growing construction industry.
Sales last year were DM436m from 65 outlets in 32 cities, making it easily
the region's biggest wholesaler of building products. These include lighting
and electrical supplies, plumbing, heating and sanitary equipment as well as
woodworking and metalworking tools and accessories.
Competition to MBH will come from subsidiaries of several large western
German public companies which have established operations as well as some
smaller privately-owned family businesses.
Construction output is eastern Germany is forecast to rise by one-fifth this
year, with DM500bn expected to to be spent during the next eight years on
building and repairing the region's housing, infrastructure and industry.
The Treuhandanstalt, the privatisation agency established to sell former
state-owned assets, has appointed Merrill Lynch in London to advise on the
sale of MBH, which has already attracted some international interest.
Companies from 10 countries, including Britain, France, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Switzerland, Austria and the European subsidiary of a Hong
Kong-based group, have expressed interest in acquiring MBH.
MBH owns 120 properties, including the 65 active trading outlets. The
purchase price could depend upon which of these properties are to be
included in the sale.
Merrill Lynch earlier this year arranged the sale for DM90m to Thames Water
of the Mitteldeutsche Wasser-und Umwelttecnik (UTAG) the former East German
water supply and sewerage treatment engineers.

FT  13 JUL 92 / International Company News: Restructuring and consolidation
keep generating large bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING and consolidation continue to generate large international
bids and deals, writes Brian Bollen.
The biggest of the week by far was the agreed bid by Cementos Mexicanos for
Valenciana de Cementos, Spain's biggest cement group. This continues the
rapid consolidation of Europe's troubled cement sector and reverses the
long-standing trend in the sector for European companies to invest in North
America.
Moody's Investors Service, the US debt ratings agency, appeared less than
impressed: it placed the Cemex rating under review for possible downgrade,
saying such a large acquisition might indicate a more aggressive growth
strategy than previously thought.
Cemex decided in 1988 to concentrate on its core business.
That one company's non-core disposal is another's growth opportunity was
underlined again by British Petroleum's latest disposal, of its Germany
subsidiary Globol. The transaction takes the buyer - the Jeyes cleaning
products group bought out from Cadbury Schweppes and BP in 1986 - further
into continental Europe and increases its sales by more than one-third.
Debt claimed another prominent victim, forcing French businessman Mr Bernard
Tapie to sell off yet another business, the German sporting goods company
Adidas. Pentland Holdings of the UK thus adds another top-brand name brand
to the portfolio assembled with the proceeds of its enormous profits on its
Reebok investment.
Niche markets continue to be fashionable. Specialist chemicals group Hickson
International of the UK is moving into the supply of fine chemicals to
pharmaceutical groups by buying Ireland's Angus Fine Chemicals.
Simon Engineering of the UK said its purchase of the marine seismic data
division of Teledyne Exploration of the US makes it the world's
fourth-largest in that specialised sector.
The week saw much speculation about further restructuring of international
airlines, but only one small transaction emerged, the purchase of 26.5 per
cent of Austria's Lauda Air by German flag-carrier Lufthansa.

FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pioneering social audit from Traidcraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAIDCRAFT, the Gates-head-based distributor of third world goods, has
published a pioneering social audit of the company to accompany its accounts
for the 1991-92 year.
Including redundancy costs of Pounds 45,000, the pre-tax loss for the 12
months to end-March was reduced from Pounds 118,000 to Pounds 23,000.
The social audit was a preliminary document attempting to assess the wider,
non-financial impacts of the company on its customers and employees which
should be ready by the time of the next annual report, according to Mr
Richard Evans, external affairs director.
While a growing number of companies are producing statements on
environmental policies and impacts, the Traidcraft report attempts to go
much further in analysing the company's impact.
The audit - which was prepared by the directors - shows that 68 per cent of
total sales of Pounds 5.39m were of goods from the third world last year,
compared with 98 per cent of total sales of Pounds 830,000 in 1982.
It reports a planned 10 per cent reduction in gas consumption during the
current year and discusses its use of recycled materials.
The audit also shows a staff turnover of 4 per cent, excluding 16 of the
redundancies from the workforce of 134 at the beginning of the last
financial year. It says there are no employees from ethnic minorities, but
two registered disabled staff.
It also lists 65 working days for executives and managers taken up with
training.
There are about 3,750 non-voting current shareholders.

The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is

on October 15.
Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said: 'Given the high level of
volatility in EuroSwiss interest rates, there is a need for an instrument
which provides additional hedging and trading opportunities.'
The three-month Euro-Swiss futures contract, launched in February 1991,
recorded an average daily volume of 8,000 contracts in June.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rothschild Bank, the Zurich-based private bank controlled by NM Rothschild &amp;
Sons, has dissolved its hidden reserves to make provision against possible
loan losses.
Sir Evelyn Rothschild, chairman of NM Rothschild, said the bank had decided
to dissolve hidden reserves of SFr63.5m (Pounds 24.3m) as a safety measure.
'The bank is very conservative and we feel that it is right to make the
transfer from reserves as a safety measure,' said Sir Evelyn. He added that
Rothschild Bank was doing well and had had an exceptionally good 1991-92
year.
Rothschild made a net profit of SFr24.4m in the 12 months to March 31.
Depreciation, provisions and loan losses rose to SFr99.8m (SFr24.3m).
The decision to make provisions followed a review of the bank's credit
exposure at its recent annual general meeting, which found that some credits
were not fully covered.

Sales improved to Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 2.99m) but gross margins fell from
30.4 per cent to 26.3 per cent. Earnings declined to 2p (5.8p) but the
dividend is a same-again 0.5p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
T Cowie, the motor trader which is bidding Pounds 26.7m for rival Henlys
Group, has had to make a second clarification over the status of its offer.
It said it wanted to remove any impression that its offer may not be
revised. It also referred to its offer document which said the offer was
'generous'.
The first clarification came on Thursday after a newspaper article seemed to
suggest that Cowie's offer was final. Under takeover rules, once a bidder
has said an offer is final it cannot increase the offer unless another
bidder comes in.
Cowie said that a second newspaper article had misquoted a Cowie
representative saying 'this is the best offer'. Cowie said the Takeover
Panel had advised them to clarify the matter.
With Cowie's shares standing at 141p the 1-for-2 share bid is worth 70 1/2
p, against Henlys share price of 72p. That suggests the market does not
expect the Cowie offer to succeed at this price. Some shareholders are
believed to want a cash alternative to the all-paper bid.

FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Etonbrook plans cash repayment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of Etonbrook Properties amounted to Pounds 182,000 pre-tax for the
year to March 31 after taking account of an exceptional provision of Pounds
400,000 for property write-downs.
The previous year's profits totalled Pounds 1.63m and included a development
profit in excess of Pounds 2.5m and an exceptional debit of Pounds 1.45m.
Earnings worked through at 1.3p (34.2p) and the dividend is a same-again
2.75p.
With a view to reducing the discount between the year-end net asset value
per share of 117p (118p) and the current 68p share price the directors are
proposing a capital reorganisation in order to pay ordinary shareholders 25p
cash per share. This will be achieved via the return of surplus proceeds
from property sales.
They are also proposing to repay the redeemable preference shares which is a
pre-requisite of any capital repayment or payment of an ordinary dividend.
Both proposals will be put to an extraordinary meeting next month.
In addition, the directors have formulated a strategy for the future
development of the company which they say 'could include utilising
Etonbrook's stock exchange listing by merging with a trading company so as
to achieve a higher share rating'.
Notice has been received from Multitrust, a 10.05 per cent shareholder in
Etonbrook, that it intends to propose at the annual meeting resolutions for
the appointment of Mr A. Perloff and Mr M. Block as directors and for the
removal of Mr J. Harris and Mr W. Moss as directors.

FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional profit boosts Peter Cox
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Helped by an exceptional profit of Pounds 477,000, Peter Cox, the building
preservation company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 904,000 on turnover
of Pounds 30.5m in 1991.
Mr John Wilson, chairman, said the result was creditable in the economic
gloom.
The previous period was for 14 months following the purchase by its
management from John Mowlem in which pre-tax profits were Pounds 933,000 on
turnover of Pounds 34.3m.

FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Lister falls deeper into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.78m for the year to March 28 were
announced by Lister &amp; Co, the textile products group which also has
interests in property investment, engineering and insurance broking. Losses
last time were Pounds 1.71m.
The directors said that action taken during the year had resulted in two key
parts of the business, Joseph Hoyle and Lister Yarns, returning to current
profitability. The weakness of the home furnishings and domestic textiles
markets had led to a fundamental reorganisation of that part of the
business, they said.
Turnover fell to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 34.7m). Losses per share increased to
17.11p (10.94p) but the proposed final is maintained at 0.1p after the
interim payment was again passed.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 531,000 (Pounds 2.06m) relating
to costs associated with the development of the Manningham Mills complex in
Bradford.

FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: NMC to pass final dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NMC, the packaging company, is passing its final dividend for the year to
March 31 because of uncertainties about the timing and proceeds of its
planned flotation of a stake in Universal Packaging, its US offshoot.
Mr Norman Gordon, chief executive, said dividend policy would be reviewed
when the situation had been resolved.
He added that almost all the group's profits arose in the US and existing
financing arrangement restricted their repatriation. The flotation was
intended to improve this structural imbalance.
The company, which last year failed to take over API, a rival packaging
company, suffered a downturn in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.39m to Pounds
5m. The passing of the final dividend leaves the total for the year at
1.25p, against 3.55p.
Universal increased profits as a result of a strong rise in sales in the
second half. UK businesses had a difficult year with losses in the point of
sale activity.
Turnover for the year declined to Pounds 93.6m, against Pounds 110.8m which
included a Pounds 17.3m contribution from property and finance. The figure
included Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 5.04m) from Hobbs Packaging which was sold in
January.
Earnings per share were 2.76p (7.07p) basic or 5.91p (8.61p) fully diluted.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 615,000 relating to costs of its
failed API bid.

FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fund managers switch to bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUND managers are looking to increase their holdings in bonds, especially UK
gilts, at the expense of equities, according to the July monthly survey by
Smith New Court and Gallup.
Managers planning to invest in UK gilts outnumbered those planning no such
move by 32 per cent, the highest level for two years and double the June
total. Interest in index-linked gilts, overseas bonds and deposits increased
at a similar rate, the survey said.
A balance of 10 per cent of managers said they would lift exposure to UK
equities. This is the lowest figure this year, but the UK is still seen as
more attractive than the US and Japan, where managers remain negative.
However, forecasts for UK earnings-per-share growth have been marked down.
Managers expect earnings to grow 6 per cent this year, compared with 9 per
cent forecast last month. For 1993, forecasts have been cut from 12 per cent
to 10 per cent. Dividends are expected to grow 3 per cent this year and 5
per cent next.
Over the next 12 months, 86 per cent of institutions are optimistic about
the FT-SE index compared with 72 per cent for continental European markets.
Only 56 per cent are hopeful about Japan.
A special question in the survey asked managers their favourite and least
favourite sectors for the coming year. Health and household, water,
industrial materials and banks were most favoured while contracting and
construction, property and building materials found least support.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S main investment body yesterday responded to claims that it had
mismanaged a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio in Spain by leaking a
lengthy defence of its actions to the official Kuna news agency, Reuter
reports from Kuwait.
An 'official source' at the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) blamed other
investors for the collapse of a chemicals company, Ercros, in its portfolio,
and said KIO was happy to pay out a Pounds 100m Eurobond if nervous
investors demanded it.
It was the first official response to reports that the KIO, known as one of
the world's most powerful investors, may lose hundreds of millions of
dollars and damage its international credibility through the partial
collapse of its Spanish portfolio, put at about Dollars 7bn.
Western diplomats and economists say the KIO's worldwide portfolio may have
sunk to below Dollars 40bn from a pre-Gulf war total of about Dollars 100bn.
At some stages in the 1980s, Kuwait was earning more from investments than
from its oil exports.
Kuwaiti investment officials in Kuwait have declined to comment. The
al-Watan newspaper reported yesterday that the KIO's deputy chairman, Mr
Khaled al-Sabah, had tended his resignation but it had not so far been
accepted.
KIO's Spanish portfolio has come under scrutiny after Ercros announced 10
days ago it was due to file for court protection on its Dollars 302m debt.
Ercros' bankruptcy allows investors in a Pounds 100m bond issued by the
KIO's main investment vehicle in Spain, Grupo Torras, to redeem the bond
early, which would be a serious setback to the Kuwaiti fund's reputation.
In the statement to Kuna, a senior unnamed official said the KIO was trying
to negotiate with the Spanish government and Spanish creditors to share
responsibility for refloating Ercros, which the KIO had borne alone in the
past.
'Torras is obviously sorry that one of the companies it holds shares in
could reach this stage . . . but in the end it considers itself an investor
looking for profit and avoiding loss,' the official said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAMALEA, the debt-burdened developer controlled by Toronto's Bronfman
family, expects to withdraw from the North American industrial property
market and retain only a handful of its Canadian office buildings as part of
a last-ditch effort to maintain the confidence of its lenders.
Mr Marvin Marshall, president, said that the company expected to present a
new business plan to lenders later this month and hoped to complete
negotiations by the end of August.
Bramalea, which has debts of CDollars 4.9bn (USDollars 4bn), defaulted last
month on interest payments on a debenture issue, and its financial problems
are widely viewed as being at least as serious as those of Olympia &amp; York.
But, unlike O&amp;Y, Bramalea has the advantage of a powerful shareholder and
has up to now convinced its lenders that it is doing its utmost to raise
cash through asset sales.
As part of the restructuring, Bramalea also plans to sell its US shopping
centres, to reduce its Canadian mall portfolio, and to concentrate on the
residential market in Ontario and California.
Bramalea has raised CDollars 573m since it began selling properties last
year. It expects total proceeds to reach about CDollars 2bn by 1997. Several
of its assets have been bought by Trizec, its controlling shareholder. But
Trizec, which itself has debts of more than CDollars 9bn, has indicated that
it is nearing the end of its willingness to provide support to its
subsidiary.
Bramalea's shares closed at 80 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange on
Friday, down 7 cents on the day. The shares were trading at close to
CDollars 5 at the beginning of this year.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Lord King likely to step down at BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG-EXPECTED top management transition at British Airways will be
announced tomorrow at the airline's annual general meeting when Lord King,
BA's 75-year-old chairman, is likely to indicate his intention to step down.
But Lord King, who was brought in by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime
minister, 12 years ago to reshape the airline and privatise it, is expected
to maintain close connections with the BA by becoming its honorary chairman
for life.
Lord King is expected to indicate at the annual meeting his intention to
relinquish his post as chairman this year or next.
In spite of his appointment as honorary life chairman or president, the move
will mark an end of a significant era in the history of the UK flag-carrier.
Under Lord King, BA was transformed from a loss-making state-owned carrier
popularly known as 'Bloody Awful' into one of the world's most profitable
and successful private airlines.
BA recently reported a 120 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
285m for the financial year ending March, bucking the trend in the airline
industry, which has seen many leading carriers reporting heavy financial
losses because of the recession and the air travel slump caused by last
year's Gulf war.
The airline is currently negotiating an alliance with USAir, the
sixth-largest US carrier, as part of its efforts to strengthen its global
presence and competitiveness. Lord King recently said his airline was
interested in forging alliances with carriers in the US, Europe and Asia.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, is widely
expected to take over as chairman. Lord King recently indicated BA was not
looking outside the company for his successor. Sir Colin has also been
deeply involved in the restructuring of BA. Many in the industry believe
that one reason for BA's success is the strong management team led by Lord
King and Sir Colin.
However, Lord King's departure as chairman is likely to lead to other
changes at the top of the company. Apart from the appointment of a chairman,
BA is likely to appoint a chief operating officer to flank the chairman and
chief executive.
One candidate is Mr Robert Ayling, the company's former secretary and legal
adviser who recently made his mark as head of marketing and operations.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Bonn to sell Airbus holding to Daimler ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government has agreed to sell its remaining 20 per cent stake in
Deutsche Airbus, the German partner in the European Airbus consortium, to
Daimler-Benz, four years ahead of the agreed date.
In exchange, Daimler-Benz has accepted the cancellation of its lucrative
currency insurance deal with the government, which protected Deutsche Airbus
from excessive currency fluctuations.
The agreement means Daimler-Benz, the largest industrial group in Germany,
will own 100 per cent of Deutsche Airbus through its Deutsche Aerospace
subsidiary. The company is planning a further reorganisation of all its
aerospace interests by October and Deutsche Airbus will now be fully
incorporated into financial results.
Cancellation of the currency insurance deal, which cost the German
government DM580m (Pounds 200m) in 1990, will remove the grounds for the US
complaint of unfair subsidy to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
upheld by a Gatt disputes panel in January. A further DM640m had been
allowed for in the state budgets up to 1996, when Daimler was originally
expected to take 100 per cent control.
The currency deal meant that the German government covered potential
exchange rate losses on Airbus sales, if the dollar fell below DM1.60,
without charging any premium for the insurance. The US government alleged
that the payments amounted to a subsidy of Dollars 2.5m per Airbus delivered
in 1990.
The German government agreed in January this year to change the agreement,
and the latest announcement says it has been suspended with effect from
January 1.
The agreement with Daimler was disclosed by Mr Erich Riedl, state secretary
responsible for the aerospace industry in the Bonn economics ministry. He
said it should be signed by the end of September, thus completing the
privatisation of the German aerospace industry.
Meanwhile, the European Community is today expected to ratify the
long-awaited EC-US deal to limit direct and indirect government support for
new commercial airliner projects.
Finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, should rubber-stamp the agreement,
which was reached on April 1 after some six years of on-off talks between
the two sides. In spite of early rumblings of discontent in Washington,
Brussels officials now believe the accord is safe from political tampering.
The EC's ratification will come less than a week after United Airlines, the
second-largest US carrier, placed a Dollars 5bn order with Airbus Industrie,
for up to 100 A320 jets. There were fears the deal might revive controversy
over government subsidies to the Airbus Industrie consortium.
Disputes between the US and EC have centred on accusations that Airbus
receives direct development aid from EC governments, and that US
manufacturers benefit from support disguised as military or space research
grants.
Details of the trade accord, which have not yet been officially released,
should emerge today.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Italy to reorganise public sector: Radical changes by
government to speed up privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S overblown public sector holdings are to be radically reorganised to
accelerate privatisation.
IRI, the main public sector holding, ENI, the state oil concern, ENEL, the
national electricity company, and INA, the national insurance institution,
will today become joint stock companies under the guidance of the Treasury.
Their total assets have been put provisionally at L60,000bn (Pounds 28bn)
and the new Italian government of Professor Giuliano Amato intends to sell
off an initial 45 per cent to the public.
This promises to be the most far-reaching change in the nature of state
ownership since Mussolini created IRI in 1933 to act as the motor of public
sector driven development. IRI companies alone account for more than 4.5 per
cent of GDP and they cover activities from agriculture, banking and
construction to defence, information technology, the media and shipbuilding.
The announcement at the weekend came in the wake of Friday's emergency
budget for the remainder of 1992 which is aimed at finding an extra
L30,000bn through spending cuts and increased revenues. The move should add
greater credibility to the budgetary measures which were criticised for
failing to make more significant spending cuts.
'We are on the edge of a precipice,' said Prof Amato commenting on the
measures in the budget.
His sense of urgency was underlined by the speed his government intends to
tackle privatisation. The four state entities will have only 10 days to
approve their new statutes.
The previous Andreotti administration spent more than a year arguing over
how and what to privatise, while optimistically writing in a total of
L21,000bn from privatisation income for 1991-92.
Until now the main block on privatisation has come from politicians who have
encouraged state ownership as a means of continuing political patronage. The
management of all state groups is politically appointed.
Prof Amato has also decided to wind up Efim, the industrial state holding
whose debts of L8,000bn are nearly double its annual turnover. Its situation
has long been one of the most blatant examples of political patronage
determining industrial strategy.
Foreign creditors account for L3,500bn of the debt and talks with them could
determine how many of its activities such as the heavy loss-making aluminium
sector will be closed down, or merely transferred to IRI.
By placing the four public entities under the tutelage of the Treasury, the
government intends to signal to the markets that it is seeking serious
financial solutions to the complex issues that privatisation has raised.
The Treasury has the best technical team and has been working exhaustively
on privatisation schemes over the past year.
It is expected to create two further holding companies at least temporarily:
one will hold the shares of IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA; the other will handle
its existing financial holdings in BNL, the state commercial bank, and in
IMI, the financial group.
One of the main issues will be the capitalisation of the new companies and
how their existing debts are treated. IRI has no formal capital, merely a
small trust fund, while its state-backed debts amount to more than
L55,000bn.
Before this government move, ENI had been planning to sell shares this
autumn in Agip, the oil exploration subsidiary, and Snam, its gas company.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA was last night engulfed in fresh fighting just hours
after a United Nations relief convoy for the first time brought food into
the Sarajevo suburb of Dobrinja, besieged by Serb forces for three months.
As soon as the supplies were delivered to the 40,000 inhabitants trapped
between the airport and the Serb-controlled western suburb of Ilidza, the
ceasefire broke down.
The renewed shelling of Dobrinja, an ethnically-mixed suburb giving direct
access from Ilidza to the airport, coincided with an escalation of fighting
throughout the republic.
In the eastern town of Gorazde, Serb irregulars stepped up their 90-day
siege by sending in tanks and heavy artillery. The aim is 'ethnic cleansing'
of the town's 35,000 inhabitants, 70 per cent of them Moslem, to make it
part of the Serbian-dominated region of eastern Bosnia.
Elsewhere Belgrade radio reported that Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy
Bosnian army, had regained control of the northern town of Odzak, which
forces from Croatia had captured a week ago. Croatian radio denied the
report.
Belgrade radio also reported that Serb forces had started to attack Mostar,
the capital of the largely Croat-inhabited region of western Hercegovina,
which last week was declared 'a state within a state' by Mr Mate Boban, head
of Bosnia's Croats and an ally of Croatian president Franjo Tudjman.
Mr Tudjman last night called on the international community to intervene,
while Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic again said food relief convoys,
while welcome, would not stop the killing, or stop the republic from being
divided along ethnic lines.
Western diplomats said ships sent by Nato, or backed by the Western European
Union, to control the Adriatic as a means of tightening sanctions against
Serbia would 'not have the slightest effect'.
'The killing is getting worse. There is no political will to stop the
fighting,' a senior US diplomat said.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Old age threatens to clip Concorde's wings: The next
generation of supersonic airliners will require an unprecedented level of
international co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the British Airways headquarters at London's Heathrow airport,
mechanics could be seen examining the rudder of a Concorde sticking out of
the big hangar known as Technical Block B.
The rudders of each of BA's seven Concordes, the flagships of the airline's
fleet, are normally inspected after every 50 to 100 flights. But BA is now
subjecting this section of the aircraft to minute checks after every five
flights. This follows a series of incidents in which parts of the rudder
have fallen off in supersonic flight, although none represented a serious
risk to the aircraft.
For BA, the UK airworthiness and air accident authorities, and the
manufacturers, Concorde's rudder problems have been an embarrassment. They
have also raised questions on how much longer the world's only supersonic
passenger jet, which entered regular service with BA and Air France more
than 15 years ago, can continue flying and whether a new generation of
supersonic aircraft will eventually be developed to replace it.
Since 1989, three BA Concordes have lost large sections of their rudders in
mid-flight, most recently on March 21, when a New York-bound Concorde lost
most of the upper section of its two-piece rudder while flying at 56,000 ft
at Mach 2, or roughly 1,300 mph.
In all three cases, the aircraft, which yesterday completed 250,000
supersonic flying hours in commercial service with BA, flew safely to its
destination. 'It's not critical, but the fact it happened more than once
makes it serious,' says Mr Alistair Cumming, BA's director of engineering.
To leave nothing to chance, BA has now asked British Aerospace, responsible
for the original rudder design, to manufacture a new series of rudders for
its Concordes for a total cost of about Pounds 5m.
Although the new equipment is expected to resolve the fault, the rudder
failures are signs that the aircraft is showing its age. BA said the
supersonic hours flown by Concorde now totalled more than the supersonic
flying hours completed by the combined air forces of the west since the
introduction of supersonic combat aircraft. And unlike subsonic jets,
Concorde has had to operate in more stressful conditions with the aircraft
subjected to more intensive and frequent changes of temperature when flying
at Mach 2.
Each Concorde is at present cleared by the UK and French airworthiness
authorities to fly a total of about 7,000 supersonic flights. BA's
supersonic jets have already completed about 4,000 flights and are expected
to reach their current operational limit by 1998-99.
BA and Air France, together with the airframe manufacturers (BAe and
Aerospatiale) and the engine suppliers (Rolls-Royce and Snecma), are working
to try to extend Concorde's life into the next century. The airlines hope to
stretch the life of Concorde until 2010.
This will require design adjustments and improvements on which the airlines
and the manufacturers are already working. Mr Cumming said BA would be
fitting one of its operational aircraft with instruments to measure the
stress on the airframe structures to provide the information to tackle any
structural weaknesses and potential areas of distress.
'It could involve lots of small things like changing the radius of certain
components facing high stress or polishing a surface,' he said. On older
subsonic aircraft, airlines and manufacturers usually wait until a crack
appears on the airframe before taking action. But Mr Cumming said it would
clearly be unwise to adopt the same procedure for Concorde.
The airlines expect the cost of improving the Concorde structure to be
relatively small since adjustments would be phased in during the already
exhaustive maintenance programme of each aircraft. Averaged out over a year,
every Concorde undergoes 22 hours of maintenance for every one hour of
flight compared with seven hours of maintenance for a Boeing 747 jumbo.
Although it was hit last year by the slump in airline traffic and the
general squeeze on first class travel, Concorde in recent years has operated
profitably for BA and Air France. Apart from regular transatlantic services,
the two airlines have also developed successful charter businesses for their
supersonic jet.
But for all its technical achievements, Concorde remains an economic
failure. The profits BA and Air France make on their supersonic operations
include no depreciation charge on the aircraft's Pounds 1.2bn development
cost. And if the cost of keeping Concorde in service should suddenly jump
and huge sums be necessary to refurbish and re-equip the aircraft, the
airlines would have to re-examine the economics of their Concorde
operations.
Apart from modifications to stretch the aircraft's working life, spare parts
are likely to pose another big problem. Scores of different small components
from a myriad of suppliers will have to be manufactured, redesigned or
replaced. Careful planning, according to Mr Cumming, will be critical to
avoid the risk of spares running short and eventually grounding the
aircraft.
The challenge for the manufacturers and the airlines is to keep Concorde
flying until a second-generation supersonic airliner is ready to replace it.
The aerospace industry has already begun preliminary studies on developing a
supersonic aircraft about three times the size of Concorde. It would carry
up to 300 passengers, compared with the 100 carried by Concorde, at Mach 2
over longer ranges.
But such an aircraft is unlikely to be developed before 2005-2010 at the
earliest. It is expected to cost more than Dollars 10bn at 1992 prices and
will need an unprecedented amount of international co-operation.
All leading airframe and en-gine companies agree to co-operate. 'It would be
very difficult for one company or one country to develop such an aircraft
because of the big market and financial risks involved,' said Mr Mike
Henderson, head of the supersonic research team at Boeing.
The project faces a series of daunting questions: can international
co-operation on such a scale work; will the manufacturers overcome hugely
complex environmental issues to ensure no perceptible sonic boom over
populated areas and no significant ozone depletion; can such an aircraft
ultimately be economic?
'We are going to have to demonstrate that the aircraft is environmentally
safe and show it is not just a toy for the rich,' Mr Henderson said.
The industry is relatively confident it can overcome all the technical
challenges of developing a new supersonic airliner. But Boeing research has
shown that passengers appear willing to pay only relatively modest
surcharges for supersonic flights of 10-20 per cent over subsonic fares.
'Concorde was a technological success but also a good example of something
possible but not very useful for the market,' Mr Henderson said.
The message is clear. The industry is unlikely to develop another
technological showpiece that makes little commercial sense. Instead, the
market will decide when and if a new supersonic airliner is built.

<TEXT>
Sir, His being a professor of political science at MIT does not ensure that
Prof Dore has a firm grasp of basic economics.
He concluded his article by asserting that the case for free trade requires
the '. . .assumptions of competitive markets and undistorted prices'.
Every discussion of free trade, from David Ricardo to Paul Samuelson (to
note only the most famous) has shown that mutually beneficial trade requires
only differences in prices. Why the prices differ, and how these prices were
determined is, so far as the trade discussion goes, immaterial.
Further, Prof Dore's assertion that the benefits in the form of lower prices
which accrue to the consumer from free trade would be 'mopped up in
unemployment pay' rests of course on the assumption that when workers have
became unemployed in one activity - any activity - they are totally
unemployable for ever more. That is not likely.
Prof Dore's arguments are as misleading as his recommendations would be
damaging.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN THOMSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prof Ronald Dore's prescriptions confuse the benefits of inward
investment with the disadvantages of trade barriers (Personal View, July 8).
While the gains from such investment are tangible, the harm inflicted on the
local economy from the coercive policies designed to attract that investment
is often more obscure.
Inward investment is to be welcomed, but tariff-jumping operations are no
better than the protected local firms that they replace. Governments can
only coerce firms to invest by maintaining high tariff walls against
imports. Without such a protected market, they are unlikely to be willing to
incur the higher costs of producing locally.
As with old-fashioned protectionism, Prof Dore's neo-mercantilist policies
fail to address the likely effect on world economic welfare when all
countries are playing the same game. As more and more countries compete for
the same efficient Japanese factories, the only beneficiaries are likely to
be the Japanese firms themselves. The greater costs of production from
foregone economies of scale from too many plants in too many countries will
be incurred by local consumers who must face high prices in order to sustain
local production.
Hence, to pretend that investment-inviting import quantity restrictions are
somehow economically justifiable while protectionism is not is fatuous. The
outcome is the same except for the fact that monopoly profits accrue to a
foreign firm rather than to local shareholders.
Prof Dore might also want to reflect on whether the disappearance of the
British motorcycle industry in the space of a decade is a testament to 'the
bankruptcy of the comparative advantage paradigm', or a tribute to its
success.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Letter: No massive state support for Air France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANCOIS ELDIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We were most surprised to read a letter from Mr Thomas McDonogh (June
24), chairman of an Irish transport users' committee, stating, quite
erroneously, that Air France was one of roughly seven airlines in Europe
that are 'technically bankrupt'. He also added, erroneously, that 'these
national airlines receive massive support from the various governments, a
support which is denied to the private sector'.
All of this is nonsense. Air France is in no way technically bankrupt.
Neither does it receive more support from the French government that any
private company would receive from its shareholders.
Last year, the French state, which owns 99.4 per cent of Air France shares,
decided to participate in a FFr2bn (Pounds 205m) increase of Air France
capital as a shareholder's contribution to an Air France Group three-year
investment programme worth FFr40bn. This capital increase was reviewed in
depth by the European Commission, which ruled that it was not state aid. In
other words, it is the normal contribution of a shareholder to the
development of his company.
FT readers will, I am sure, be interested to know that Air France had not
received a capital injection from its shareholders since 1985. On the
contrary, since 1984, the airline has paid out FFr1bn to its shareholders in
dividends on profits.

Georges Ghosn, the latest mogul to strut the French media stage, is a
relatively unknown quantity even in France. He first popped up three years
ago when he and his partners bought La Cote Desfosses, one of the bibles of
the French stockmarket. Now he has acquired the loss-making La Tribune de
l'Expansion, the country's second biggest financial daily.
A 38-year-old Lebanese-born journalist, Ghosn came to Paris to study and
soon afterwards began editing and publishing various newsletters
specialising in Africa and the Arab world, for groups such as Kol-Al-Arab or
Panarab Medias. For a while he published a newsletter in association with
the Middle East Economic Digest.
His latest move is his most ambitious to date. He plans to merge La Tribune
with La Cote, which publishes all the stock market prices, and produce a
full economic and financial daily. But making it financially viable will not
be easy, as the demise of La Tribune has indicated. And it might be
difficult to merge the conservative editorial style of La Cote with the more
aggressive style of La Tribune.

Andre Agassi, the 22-year-old tennis champion, was wearing a wrist watch

So why isn't Ebel highlighting the fact in its advertising campaign? An
advert in last Friday's Independent focused on Agassi's victory in an
obscure Frankfurt tennis tournament in November 1990 and mentioned a few
other events which Agassi had failed to win. But no word of the most famous
victory of all.
Perhaps Ebel's advertising agency should be sent to the menders.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Warburg, which has been advising Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligungs - Germany's second largest insurance company - in its battle
with Assurances Generales de France is putting a brave face on its client's
sudden rapprochement with the French insurance giant.
'A compromise rather than a climbdown,' is how Warburg's Piers von Simson
describes last week's outbreak of peace between the two feuding insurers.
However, it is yet another reminder of how difficult it is for even a top
London merchant bank to win its spurs overseas.
For a start, banks like Warburg are making a living in Germany defending
what would be indefensible at home. They are good at advising their
Continental clients on relative values, but twisting arms behind Germany's
corporate scenes is a different task altogether. Hence, it is hard to
measure their effectiveness in the recent spate of German bid battles.
By contrast, there is little doubt that the end of hostilities is a defeat
for AMB's fiery chief executive, Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl. He had staked a
great deal of his credibility on fending off the French. Like Horst Urban,
whose robust defence of Continental Tyre against the Italians cost him his
job, Baumgartl's days at the top of AMB seem to be numbered.

FT  13 JUL 92 / A European spark for Marks: M and S is stepping up its
international expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a curious fact that at this time of year Marks and Spencer's store in
Boulevard Haussmann, in the heart of Paris, sells more muffins than all its
280 UK stores combined.
Other quintessentially British products, such as crumpets, pies and sliced
white bread, as well as les slips, les boxer-shorts and les twin-sets en
lambswool, also 'just walk out the door' - as retailers are fond of saying -
helping to make Paris the second biggest selling store in M and S with
annual sales of more than Pounds 80m.
After 17 years of experimentation, M and S's 18 stores in four countries in
mainland Europe are conspicuously coming good, vindicating the company's
decision to expand its business overseas and prompting a further increase in
its investment programme.
At this week's annual meeting, M and S's directors will no doubt highlight
the strong performance of its European operations, which, in spite of heavy
opening costs, in-creased pre-tax profits 13 per cent to Pounds 23m last
year on sales of Pounds 193.7m. They will also point out the potential they
still see in mainland Europe, and their target of opening another 20 or so
stores by 1995.
M and S aims to build its European sales to Pounds 1bn in Europe by the end
of the decade, producing profits in excess of Pounds 100m. Although this
will still represent a small proportion of its total business it will be a
crucial element in sustaining its growth momentum. 'We simply see faster
sales growth overseas than in the UK,' says Mr Nigel Colne, the board
director in charge of European operations.
M and S's success at expanding in Europe and the Far East - where it runs
four highly profitable stores in Hong Kong - contrasts sharply with its
experience in North America. Its three Canadian businesses, acquired in the
1970s, have lost CDollars 50m (Pounds 22m) over the past four years and are
now being severely pruned. Its two US companies, Kings Supermarkets and the
Brooks Brothers clothing chain, which between them cost it Dollars 866m have
 -as yet - failed to produce a return.
M and S's varied international forays therefore provide a good illustration
of the possibilities and pitfalls of expanding a retailing business overseas
 -a task that an increasing number of UK retailers are attempting in the
face of saturated home markets and the slowly evolving reality of the single
European market.
UK retailers need few lessons in how difficult it can be to follow the
management maxim of the moment, 'think globally, act locally'. Over the past
decade, scores of UK retailers, including Dixons, John Menzies and Sock
Shop, have bought businesses in the US, having been seduced by the seemingly
similar business culture and language. In 1980-88, UK retailers accounted
for almost 60 per cent of the Dollars 14.8bn invested by foreign companies
in the US retail sector. With a few exceptions, these investments have
produced dismal results.
Of course, the depressed market conditions for all retailers in North
America have checked the progress of many UK companies. But there is also a
more general management lesson to be drawn from their collective experience:
that it is exceptionally hard to make overseas retail acquisitions work,
especially when they are more than 3,000 miles away. Organic expansion in
nearby countries - often facilitated by joint ventures or franchises - can
be a far safer, if less pansion.
M and S is certainly now convinced of this. With almost no debt and a
triple-A credit rating it would be easy for the company to gear up to make a
big acquisition in Europe - assuming one could be found. But so far at least
it has chosen not to. 'I strongly believe in our current strategy of growing
the business on an organic site-by-site basis. It may be relatively slower
but it does enable us to learn as we go, to limit our mistakes and have a
more profitable business at the end of the day,' says Mr Colne.
Yet it has taken M and S a long time to be persuaded by its own success. M
and S opened three stores in Europe - in Paris, Brussels and Lyons - in
1975. This early involvement, says Mr Colne, owed more to gut feel than
science. 'In the early 1970s, the then chairman, Lord Sieff, instinctively
thought that we ought to test ourselves internationally,' he says.
The European stores initially encountered many problems: their products were
panned for their high prices and poor style, and some of their trading
policies - such as accepting returns of ill-fitting clothes - were simply
not understood by customers. The absence of fitting rooms particularly
rank-led the French, who insisted on trying on goods before they bought them
even if it meant stripping down to their bras on the salesfloors. M and S
was forced to install them.
Most French retail outlets are either bazaars or boutiques; M and S is
neither. It took shoppers a long time to understand what the company was all
about. 'Our reputation for quality and value went before us in the UK as a
result of our 100-year history. Here, we have had to earn it,' says Mr Jim
McDonald, manager of the Boulevard Haussmann store.
As a result of the initially poor investment returns from Europe, the head
office's attention wandered across the Atlantic in the 1980s. But by the end
of the decade, frustrated by the vagaries of the US marketplace, and with
the European business beginning to post significant sales improvements, the
board decided to make a greater commitment to mainland Europe.
The rate of expansion has now accelerated. In a two-month period at the end
of last year, M and S opened five new stores in mainland Europe, in Seville,
Nantes, Toulouse Amsterdam and Liege, and completed a big extension. In the
previous 15 years, M and S had opened just seven.
Most of the outlets it has opened are wholly owned, but this policy is
adapted to meet the needs of specific markets. For example, in 1989, M and S
concluded a 60:40 joint venture agreement with Cortefiel, one of Spain's
largest retailers. This led to the opening of one M and S store in Madrid
and another in Seville.
Cortefiel, which runs its own fashion chains and a clothes manufacturing
business, had a deep knowledge of the fast-moving but relatively
under-developed Spanish retail sector.
M and S has also been rapidly expanding its network of franchises in small
markets which do not justify the full M and S 'treatment'. The company has
built up a franchise network in 17 countries, from the Bahamas to Norway,
from Israel to Singapore with almost no capital investment on its part.
Further franchising opportunities exist in eastern Europe and the Far East.
One of the great advantages of having stores in Hong Kong, according to Mr
Colin Buchanan, Far East manager, is to keep an eye on the 'huge demographic
and economic shift' that is taking place towards Asia. 'It would not
surprise me if we were trading in mainland China in five years,' he says.
But in the immediate future the priority markets are France and Spain.
Another Paris store in the Rue de Rivoli is planned, while Valencia, Nice,
Rouen and Marseilles are also on the opening list.
Further out, the company believes there will still be great scope for growth
in Europe. The total clothing markets in the UK, France, Spain, Holland and
Belgium - where M and S runs its wholly-owned stores - are worth about
Pounds 70bn. The German and Italian markets combined are worth the same.
M and S stresses that the creeping internationalisation of the business does
not just bring in extra sales, it also strengthens its UK operations. By
moving abroad, its management expertise improves, its retailing skills are
more rigorously tested, and its buying knowledge becomes more sophisticated.
M and S says the investment returns from Europe are comparable to those
obtained in the UK although the financial profile of its continental
operations is very different. Prices are up to 25 per cent higher than in
the UK but then management and distribution costs are also greater.
Sales intensities are lower because of the lesser number of customers. M and
S obtains sales per square foot in excess of Pounds 500 in the UK  -
considerably higher than all but the best of its European stores.
Its mainland European stores also act as a test bed for its latest fashions,
as the seasons start slightly earlier than in the UK. New concepts,
materials and styles are quickly assimilated into the central buying
information pool.
But a vast melange of commercial and cultural differences continues to make
international retailing a demanding business; M and S readily admits it
still has much to do to improve the way it communicates with customers.
The store's managers in Hong Kong were horrified to learn that the local
Chinese were eating the pot pourri displayed in the stores, believing it
must be some delicacy. Spanish customers discovered that brandy butter did
not taste good on toast. The French did not appreciate Christmas puddings
until they learnt they had to cook them.
But successful as its European operations have been, they have not yet fully
benefited from what in the UK is M and S's greatest source of competitive
advantage: its dominant size. M and S's purchasing power concentrated on a
relatively narrow range of goods, its 15 per cent share of the clothing
market, and a constant flow of 14m regular customers enable it to derive big
economies of scale.
Although the European stores can feed off some of these strengths, they
still lack the necessary support infrastructure to offer the full M and S
catalogue of goods. In foods, for example, the company has not yet made the
investment it needs to build a chilled distribution chain for its short
shelf-life products.
But there are signs that M and S is close to reaching critical mass in
Europe, enabling it to broaden its appeal and become a true mass market
retailer. At present, M and S's gross profit margin in Europe is 10
percentage points higher than in the UK, partly as a result of the higher
prices charged overseas and the different product mix: the balance between
sales of the higher-margin clothing and lower-margin food is 60:40 in the
UK; 90:10 in Europe.
'Our philosophy for the years ahead will be to drive down margins to
increase volume,' says Mr Colne. 'I would like to think that in five years
we will have far more customers and so be able to reduce prices. We will
then be able to repeat the virtuous circle we achieved in the UK both of
improving value and increasing market share.'

Why Frank McGuinness's new play should take its name from a verse-line of
the Gershwins' song (used here to cover most of the scene-breaks) instead of
its real title, 'Someone to watch . . .', is the least puzzling thing about
it. Doubtless that simply avoided some hassle about copyright. Everything
else about the piece - a chamber trio for three Western hostages in a Beirut
cell - is more tantalising. ('Huis clos with jokes,' said my companion.)
The more tantalising, because it is manned by a dream cast that couldn't
imaginably be bettered. Hugh Quarshie, Stephen Rea and Alec McCowen inhabit
their characters completely. If there are any lapses in the script, they
conceal them with shining conviction.
Obviously the play was prompted by the plight of John McCarthy and his
cellmates. No less obviously, McGuinness has no intention of re-telling
their story. Instead, he gives us a different kind of story: 'There were an
American, an Irishman and an Englishman . . . ' The Arabs don't get a
look-in, either as wicked captors or as ideologues. Nobody discusses
geopolitics; none of the prisoners is beaten or tortured. One does die - but
the guards are said to be embarrassed and sorry about that.
This is hardly a hostage-play at all, but a Shavian conversation-piece for
national stereotypes, highly self-conscious ones. Quarshie's calm, stoic
American doctor works relentlessly at keeping himself in shape. (It is
piquant that nothing is made of his being black: did McGuinness really write
the role with a black actor in mind?) Rea lavishes all his wry, vulnerable
charm on the Irish newsman. As the elderly, prissy English professor,
McCowen is of course immaculate, and of course he gets to recite bits of
'The Wanderer' in the original Old English.
McGuinness seems deliberately to have given no overt structure to the piece.
There aren't even any surprises to speak of - just the endless conversation,
articulate, searching and frequently witty. Unlike most Shavian ones, it
does have moments of intense feeling; but they are held within careful
restraints, as if to insist that individual pain and despair are not what
this play is chiefly about. Robin Lefevre has directed the proceedings with
perfect tact.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: Terrible Mouth - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The premiere of Terrible Mouth, with music by Nigel Osborne to a text by
Howard Barker, establishes Almeida Opera as a genuinely credible replacement
to the much missed Almeida Festival.
While it does not attempt to match the sheer scope and ambition of its
predecessor, this season's programme, with the Osborne opera as its
centrepiece and flanked by the British premiere of Oliver's Mario and the
Magician (already reviewed here by Max Loppert) and a double bill of
Vigeland and Krenek, gives a good sense of its distinctive direction.
It underlines, too, the potential of further collaborations between the
Almeida Theatre and English National Opera's Contemporary Opera Studio.
Terrible Mouth is built around a critical episode in the life of the painter
Goya. The initial impulse for the piece was Barker's; his libretto dates
back to the mid-1980s, was written unprompted and subsequently taken up by
Osborne in a commission from BBC Radio 3.
In a Guardian article last week, Barker described the background to his Goya
text, the derivation of his title (from the leering grin of a self-portrait)
and its exploration of the painter's ambivalent attitude to the events he
recorded and satirised, characterising him as 'a man as much fascinated as
repelled by disorder and sudden death'.
The six tightly-constructed scenes portray events in 1792 at a Spanish
country house, where the reverberations from the French revolution are
destabilising society.
The house has been transformed into a military hospital, and when Goya
arrives with his mistress, the Countess of Alba, he is confronted for the
first time with the realities of war, with the blood and the suffering that
has fuelled his art.
The events force him to realise his complicity in these atrocities; the
opera ends with Goya, in Barker's words, 'painting himself into oblivion',
as he begins a neutral, formal portrait of the Man Without a Conscience, the
owner of the house.
Fundamental to the conception is a division of the part of Goya between an
actor and a singer.
Barker created the spoken role for Ian McDiarmid, the Almeida's artistic
director; Omar Ebrahim takes charge of the vocal lines.
They create a powerful dual image at the centre of the piece: the one deaf,
raving and incoherent, the other all vision and lyrical articulacy.
The other principal roles are sung, but the interplay of actors and singers
is carried over into the six-strong chorus, the Chorus of the Maimed, which
creates the vocal background against which the main events are etched, a
soundscape of guttural sounds and whispers, explosive horror and menacing
gestures.
This is Osborne's third opera, and by some way his most consistently
satisfying. After the miscalculations of the Opera Factory Hell's Angels in
1985, and the intermittent success of The Electrification of the Soviet
Union for Glyndebourne in 1987, Terrible Mouth has a high musical specific
gravity and tight dramatic coherence.
It lasts barely 80 minutes, yet delves deeply into its subject matter; there
are wonderful tensions between lyrical beauty and grim reality, some
sonorous vocal lines and a harmonic scheme that plots the course of the
opera with confidence.
Osborne uses an ensemble of cellos perched high upstage as the basis of his
musical structure; the remaining instruments, wind and percussion, provide
local colour and sudden expressive effusions.
David Pountney's production sustains and reinforces these nightmare visions
and passing moments of lucidity. It is spare and direct, with the minimum of
scenic clutter (design by Nigel Lowery) and gives free rein to McDiarmid's
vivid performance.
Ebrahim's intense Elizabeth Laurence is the Duchess of Alba, seductive and
unfeeling by turn, Richard Van Allen the reptilian Man Without a Conscience.
Neill Archer doubles the role of servant and revolutionary Captain; Clive
Bayley is the sadistic surgeon, a sibling to the manic doctor in Wozzeck,
while Anna Steiger is the Hooded Figure, the image of death and destruction
whose rapt utterances articulate Goya's voyage of psychological revelation.
They all contribute to a demanding piece of music theatre which may be short
on compassion but is consistently absorbing and most eloquently argued.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: The Television Programme - London theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main point of interest about the new production at The Gate is that this
is the first play I have seen that discusses the problems of long term
unemployment. If the theatre in the mid-1990s is to tackle serious social
questions, this surely must be one of them. Even in France, a country whose
economic performance is generally praised, unemployment has remained close
to 10 per cent for almost a decade. And it is appropriately from France that
The Television Programme comes.
Michel Vinaver's piece is not a particularly good play, or at least not in
this translation by David and Hannah Bradby. It attempts to combine too many
themes and dots about too much. In just over two hours, we go through the
corruption of the French system of justice, the corrupting effects of
television programme-making and an unresolved murder, as well as the effects
of redundancy on the middle-aged. Nevertheless, it has its striking moments.
Three aspects stand out. The first is the method of the interrogations
conducted by the magistrate Phelypeaux, played by Guy Burgess. The French
approach to justice is sometimes said to be superior to the English because
it tries to establish what happened before putting people in court. Here
Phelypeaux asks questions, then produces a statement which the interrogated
duly sign. The statements are by no means complete fabrications, but they
are at best inaccurate summaries. If that is indeed how the French system of
justice works, Vinaver is to be congratulated for illustrating it.
The second and more familiar aspect is how television programmes can have an
exaggerated idea of their own importance. Here the search is on to find a
member of the long-term unemployed, persuade a company to give him a job and
put the story on film as a topical human interest programme with the TV
channel getting the kudos for exploiting it. The competition among the
programme-makers leads to tears and possibly murder.
The third aspect is simply middle-aged unemployment itself. Vinaver had
nearly 30 years' experience of business with Gillette International and
presumably knows all about the three 'R's: rationalisation, restructuring
and redundancies. 'You're a civil servant,' says the 50-year-old victim to
the magistrate. 'What happened to me will never happen to you.' And again:
'With unemployment, your memory goes.'
The Television Programme, like most television programmes, does not go into
the subject in any great depth, but at least it registers that here is
something worth writing about and which is unlikely to go away in the near
future. British playwrights could do worse than pick up the theme.
The piece is directed by Kim Dambaek and is the first of a season of Six
Plays for Europe under the Gate's new artistic director, Laurence Boswell.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Paint sales point to low industrial activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SALES OF paint
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one of the more certain indicators of industrial activity - plunged in May
and June, suggesting that a significant economic upturn may not be evident
before next year, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The Paintmakers Association annual conference in Torquay at the weekend
heard that an uplift in sales in the first quarter of this year was a false
dawn. Figures have not yet been collated, but companies described May sales
as 'grim' and those in June as 'dire'.
If the economy falters and fewer things are being made, paint sales dip,
usually faster than gross domestic product, as manufacturers stop buying and
use up stocks. Conversely, recovery sees paint orders pick up at a faster
rate than GDP as restocking takes place alongside growth.
The conference was also told that some companies have needlessly committed
themselves to extra costs by pre-empting environmental law.
The standards are for emissions of volatile organic compounds - mainly
solvent from industrial paints and coatings - and are to be enforced by 405
councils. If a company commits itself to tighter controls than those
required by law, it must adhere to them and cannot revert to legal limits.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Financial services expect upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE financial services sector may be about to pick up, according to a report
published today. However, it warns that business volumes remain well below
normal and says that improved profitability has been won partly through job
losses and reduced costs.
For the only the second time since December 1989, the report - prepared
jointly by the Confederation of British Industry and accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand - records an upturn in business confidence.
According to the 333 companies surveyed, business confidence in many UK
financial services strengthened in the second quarter of the year, even
though business levels remained well below normal.
There was also a slight rise in business volumes during the quarter, the
first since June 1990. Total operating costs were down for the third quarter
in succession.
The most optimistic financial services are general insurance, fund
management, venture capital and finance houses, but banking and building
societies still report a weakening in their confidence.
Less than a third of financial services companies expect business volumes to
rise in the quarter now under way, and only 4 per cent think there will be a
drop in business.
The survey says that uncertainty about business prospects is still holding
back investment plans and that spending by financial services companies on
information technology over the next year looks like falling for the first
time since the survey began.
Companies are planning to curb spending on land, buildings, vehicles, plant
and machinery in the drive to control costs. They are also cutting spending
on staff training.
With operating costs down and wider margins on their business, the
profitability of companies surveyed is expected to rise still further over
the next three months.
In the life insurance sector, business volumes are still depressed and
expectations of a recovery have been unfulfilled. The CBI says companies
that sell products through brokers fared markedly better than those which do
not.
Building societies were among the sectors that did worse, with demand
shrinking and no signs of improved margins or fee income.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Yorkshire women fight on home front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN God told Moses that male workers were worth 50 shekels but female
workers only 30, He perhaps thought that women's household responsibilities
left them poorly qualified for work.
Employers who have traditionally followed such divine guidance may wish to
reassess this received wisdom now that 15 Yorkshire women have gained
vocational qualifications recognised by employers across the country -
largely on the strength of their household skills.
Two of the 15 now have jobs and all the others are on work placements after
completing a groundbreaking course devised Kirklees and Wakefield Chamber of
Commerce and funded by Barnsley and Doncaster Training and Enterprise
Council.
One of the graduates, Ms Sue Lawson, 37, lost her factory job because of
illness and did not realise that during more than a year unemployed and at
home she was gaining skills that could count towards a National Vocational
Qualification (NVQ) Level ll in business administration - equivalent to
about four GCSEs.
Ms Lawson saw the scheme advertised in her local paper. She said: 'I could
never have imagined myself working in an office. I have got a job as a
receptionist now and it is an absolutely wonderful experience.'
She was able to use her experience of home budgeting, preparing letters to
tradesmen, receiving visitors and making and receiving phone calls as
evidence of skills learned outside the workplace that each woman was
required to compile.
Other women could call upon experience of voluntary work. One farmer's wife
managed the farm accounts, while a publican's sister ran the pub when her
brother took holidays and another woman helped out at her local Citizen's
Advice Bureau.
The course also involved computing skills, self-awareness and
decision-making.
The organisers say the project breaks the vicious circle of 'no job-no
qualifications, no qualifications-no job', which affects women returning to
work.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Ford unions in Europe join forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS representing Ford workers across Europe are combining forces for the
first time to make representations to the company.
They believe Ford management in the US has taken a strategic decision to
sub-contract an increasing number of production processes and fear thousands
of jobs are at risk in the long term.
The move comes in spite of the unions' continuing difficulties in forming a
European works council at Ford, designed to give a collective voice to
workers from all six European countries where Ford has a presence.
German union leaders want Euro-works council representatives to be elected
from Ford employees only. The British want some full-time union officials on
the proposed 20-member council.
This week, however, negotiators from Britain, Germany, Belgium, Spain and
Portugal will ask Ford of Europe management for a meeting to request
assurances that no core processes will be sub-contracted within the next
five years. They also agreed to contact the US Union of Auto Workers for
more information.
Unions believe the proposal to put seat production at Ford in Britain out to
tender will lead to 800 job losses and heralds a move to increase
sub-contracting. Ford is due to decide on that proposal later this year.
Ford has little choice but to buy in more component systems and processes
from outside suppliers if it is to remain competitive with the leading
Japanese vehicle makers on costs.
On average more than 60 per cent of the value of Japanese vehicles is made
up of externally supplied components.
Western carmakers, like their Japanese counterparts, can cut costs
substantially by forging long-term partnerships with a relatively small
number of key suppliers. These suppliers are required to bear all the big
costs of research and development in exchange for long-term supply
contracts.
Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union who
attended a meeting of all Ford European unions in Geneva this month, said:
'Ford unions without exception do not agree to out-sourcing without
negotiations and agreement on items to be out-sourced.'
Ford denied that it plans to sub-contract core businesses. The company said:
'Out-sourcing of some work is an on-going process. We have looked at
peripheral areas for a number of years. We are always asking whether someone
can do the work better than we can.'
It added that any substantial increase in sub-contracting would be a matter
for long-term discussion with unions.
European Community trade unions have united with employers' organisations in
an appeal for governments to support a co-operative growth strategy for more
employment.
The two sides have called for the rapid reduction of interest rates in an
eight-point statement timed to coincide with a meeting of EC finance
ministers today.
ENGINEERS at Ford's research and development plant in Dunton, Essex, are to
stage a one-day strike tomorrow in protest over the company's plan to
relocate 300 jobs to Germany.
Members of the MSF technical union voted almost two to one in favour of the
action which will be the third stoppage in the dispute that began in May.
The relocation is part of the company's strategy of 'co-location' that
involves bringing together staff working on similar activities. The company
has said nobody will be forced to move to Germany, and that with the
co-operation of employees compulsory redundancies can be avoided.
Ford believes that the current multi-site structure of its technical
operations puts it at a competitive disadvantage. It plans to consolidate
technical operations into two sites in Europe, one in Britain and one in
Germany.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Renewal of dialogue raises spirits at Tecs: The new
consensus on training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN STARK contrast to just three months ago, chairmen and chief executives of
Training and Enterprise Councils were talking last week as if Tecs had a
future.
In April a confidential memorandum from Tec leaders to Mrs Gillian Shephard,
the new employment secretary, claimed that the initiative was in danger of
collapse.
Last week more than 500 representatives of the employer-led movement, which
was set up two years ago with the ambition of revolutionising training, were
talking at their annual national conference about a five-year agenda.
What, if anything, has changed? Behind closed doors, Mrs Shephard was left
in no doubt about the damage that would be inflicted by additional spending
cuts - as suggested in her speech to conference.
For a start, Mrs Shephard, a woman with considerable inter-personal skills,
raised Tecs' expectations that she would bring a new momentum to training,
and she received an enthusiastic welcome at the conference. Prior to the
general election, Tecs had been demoralised by a brutal round of spending
negotiations, preceded by 18 months of government inertia on training
issues.
The conference revealed the new thinking on both sides since the election.
Mr Nigel Chilcott, head of the small secretariat which services the Tecs,
said after the conference: 'We are drawing up an agenda of what Tecs believe
they want from government and it, in turn, is making explicit what it wants
from Tecs.'
The government offered a mixed bag of policies, a few of which could make
Tecs' financial situation sounder.
Mrs Shephard hinted at possible financial sweeteners - she would try to
persuade Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, to accept
that Tecs needed three-year funding commitments on the lines of National
Health Service hospital trusts. This would help them and their providers of
training to plan more effectively. She also said she wanted more
result-based payment to Tecs. These are both strong ambitions of Tecs, but
are likely to be resisted by the Treasury which prefers finite funding over
a single year. Although Mrs Shephard is a junior cabinet member, she has
experience of the Treasury and is a personal friend of the prime minister.
The secretary of state invited Tecs to join two working parties on help for
unemployed adults and education and training for young people.
While this gesture of partnership was warmly received by Tecs, they will
have to make contributions quickly. The Department of Employment has been
reviewing both areas and the Treasury has intervened considerably in the
debate.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced that he wanted
Tecs to contract with his department and to be the lead strategic body in
the creation of 'first-stop shops'. These will group the different agencies
providing advice to business, including chambers of commerce. He hinted that
the DTI might place some of its small business initiatives with the shops if
they were successful.
Although Tecs are pleased with the new relationship with the DTI, they
understand that they will have to work quickly to bring sparring parties to
one table. Mr Heseltine admires Continental-style chambers of commerce, and
could ask chambers to be the lead bodies if Tecs are slow.
While the government lobbed a couple of balls into the Tecs' court, they
showed they were becoming more effective at returning them. The government
was asked, for example, to give a lead on Investors in People (IIP), the
scheme to improve training of people in work, by introducing it into all
government departments.
Tecs have been starved of resources to promote the scheme, and at the
conference they decided to sponsor research into how different time-limited
incentives - such as levies, tax and national insurance options - could
stimulate the take-up of IIP. Such a study could be a powerful tool in their
fight to get the scheme more widely accepted.
Representatives also showed growing sophistication in discussing what they
wanted in training programmes and the relative cost-effectiveness of
different programmes. In the lively debate over Employment Training, the
training scheme for long-term unemployed, Tec directors said the argument
with the government should not be over who was trained, but over training
quality.
But if there was a new mood of consensus, there was also a strong
demonstration of the division which might hinder the development of the Tec
movement, whose 82 members are fiercely independent.
The argument was over whether they should press for a new intermediary body
between them and the government - which advocates believe would give Tecs
more political clout and greater freedom from government interference. The
debate ended in disarray, although members agreed to consult on the issue.
The conference may have illustrated that Tecs were putting more forcefully
their own agenda to the government. But they need a more effective national
umbrella body.
As one observer noted: 'This is the first time Tecs have publicly confronted
the fact that there are major divisions. The next stage in the maturing
process will be for Tecs to realise on this issue it might have to come to a
vote.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / Council appeals on dinner ladies' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fate of 1,300 dinner ladies' pay could affect the ability of local
authorities to compete with the private sector to provide services.
North Yorkshire County Council is to appeal to the Employment Appeal
Tribunal against an industrial tribunal ruling that it treated the women
unfairly by cutting their pay and working conditions to win a competitive
tender for school meals.
EAT has high-court status so its decision will set a precedent although the
losing side may go to the Court of Appeal.
The industrial tribunal ruled last month that the council was wrong to cut
the women's pay by 30p an hour because predominantly male groups of council
workers had won contracts without cuts.
Councils provide a range of services employing men and women at nationally
negotiated pay rates. This makes it easier for women in the public sector to
show they are earning less than male colleagues.
The council argues that if EAT upholds the dinner ladies' claim then
private-sector employers will underbid councils by paying women less. Women
in the private-sector companies would have no recourse as they could not
compare their pay to that of men employed by the council.
The public-sector union, Nupe, which is backing the women, believes a
private-sector employer could not pay women less because this would be
illegal victimisation of people pursuing their right to equal pay.
The council says it will have to pay the women more than Pounds 1m,
including back pay if EAT upholds the women's claim.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Managers support investment in railways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS managers are strongly in favour of investing in the railways, a
survey disclosed yesterday.
But while they back the railways, few travel by train, with 82 per cent of
those questioned driving to work and only 10 per cent using the train. The
survey of more than 1,000 British Institute of Management (BIM) members
found:
Three-in-five managers favoured more rail investment and only one in three
supported more spending on roads.
Nearly three quarters thought British Rail investment levels were too low.
Only 15 per cent wanted more motorways built.
Eighty eight per cent thought more freight should travel by rail.
Forty three per cent opposed BR's privatisation.
Fifty one per cent thought privatisation would improve services while 36 per
cent said it would not.
Overall, while managers thought more should be spent on the railways, they
found car travel more comfortable, although rail was perceived to be better
value for money.
Mr Roger Young, director-general of BIM, said: 'Continued emphasis on the
primacy of private transport will eventually work against the interest of
the majority of users - and of the efficiency of the UK as a whole.'
Unless the government acted to implement a national transport policy, the
roads would 'become ever more congested as organisations and private
motorists take to their vehicles,' he added.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Tube extension plan to be revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Underground is to revive plans to double the length of the East
London line by extending it at surface level northwards to Highbury and
Islington and southwards to East Dulwich.
This autumn it will seek government permission to build the extensions at a
cost of Pounds 100m.
It hopes at least some of the cost will be met with contributions from the
private sector, local authorities and the government.
London Underground wants to extend the East London line to take it into
areas at present badly served by public transport.
A longer line would also help to regenerate some of London's less well-off
inner-city areas.
The scheme is said to offer exceptional value for money because nearly all
of it can be carried out by using existing railway alignments, either
derelict or in use. It would involve almost no property demolition.
London Underground last sought permission to build the extensions at a cost
of Pounds 121m two years ago when the developers of the former Bishopsgate
goods yard offered to contribute Pounds 50m towards the scheme.
In return, the developers wanted a station next to their planned
development. This time London Underground is going it alone with a cheaper
scheme.
If permission is given, London Underground hopes to start construction in
1994 and open the first stage northwards to Dalston in 1996.
The other stages would follow over the next year and a half.
Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, emphasised
that the project was not a substitute for the planned extension of the
Jubilee line, at present blocked by the private sector's failure to deliver
a promised contribution towards the construction cost.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey case may go to Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT INSURANCE, an insurer that provides professional indemnity
cover, may petition the House of Lords after losing a landmark court case
over the supervision required for trainee surveyors.
The Court of Appeal last week overturned a ruling that an unqualified
surveyor always needed on-site supervision from a professional to validate
the terms of the surveyor's professional indemnity cover.
Independent had won a judgment in June last year under Judge Fox Andrews in
the official Referee Users Court, which is widely used by the construction
industry, against Congrave Horner, a firm of chartered surveyors.
The case arose after a trainee surveyor with Congrave Horner failed to
discover the extent of dry rot in a house. The firm paid more than Pounds
100,000 in compensation to the house owners, but Independent, its insurer,
refused to pay up on its policy.
Judge Fox Andrews backed Independent, ruling that attendance by a qualified
surveyor was required at each of four stages of the survey: preparation,
visual inspection, evaluation, and the final report. The trainee had been
supervised only at the final stage.
The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Congrave Horner, arguing that the
level of supervision required would vary according to how skilled and near
to qualification the trainee was. It also said that the terms of supervision
were very vaguely drawn up.
Mr Keith Rutter, Independent's assistant general manager, said: 'Our view is
that we have a valid case. We maintain that view. We may well seek a
petition for leave to appeal.'
He added: 'I've been doing this too long to get disappointed about losing
court cases.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / Housebuilders warn Lamont of crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Britain's larger housebuilders are expected this week to write to
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to warn him of the deepening crisis in the
industry.
The group, which is thought to contain most of the 20 largest housebuilders,
is concerned at the continuing low level of sales, which they say are
impeding recovery in prices. These have fallen on average by between 25 per
cent and 30 per cent in southern England and East Anglia since the end of
1988.
The largest companies are also considering seeking a meeting with Mr John
Major, the prime minister, so grave do they believe conditions have become
in the construction industry generally.
The letter to the chancellor is expected to urge the government to take
measures to stimulate the economy, which many builders fear is moving from
recession to slump. It is also likely to raise concern over people trapped
in homes that are now worth less than the mortgages raised to pay for them.
Builders are also unhappy at the Treasury decision to reimpose stamp duty
next month on house purchases under Pounds 250,000. They regard the move as
unhelpful at this point in the housing market.
They say that sales have become increasingly difficult during recent months,
in spite of the outcome of the general election which had been expected to
encourage greater confidence among purchasers by the removal of political
uncertainty.
Instead, sales have continued to languish during what is normally one of the
busiest selling periods of the year, before the school summer holidays.

FT  13 JUL 92 / MMC may judge BT and Oftel price row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LACK of progress in talks between British Telecommunications and Oftel, its
regulator, over a tighter price-control regime means that the issue could be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
One consequence of the dispute is that BT is delaying the announcement of
more than Pounds 100m in price cuts scheduled for the autumn. It is
concerned not to make price changes this year that would have to be reversed
next year.
When Oftel unveiled its new pricing scheme last month, it gave BT until the
end of the month to accept it.
Not only has that deadline lapsed, but the most recent talks between the two
sides last Thursday have been described as 'frosty'. Both sides, which only
a week ago expected to reach an agreement, now talk privately about the
possibility of referring the matter to the MMC, which has the power to
impose a solution.
However, given that BT and Oftel have threatened to go to the MMC several
times in the past, the present dispute seems to point to the two sides'
tough negotiating stances rather than a total breakdown of talks.
Oftel, which is being led by Mr Bill Wigglesworth in an interim capacity
following the departure of Sir Bryan Carsberg to the Office of Fair Trading
last month, is sticking to the line that its new regime is not up for
negotiation.
Oftel has told BT to agree to cut the price of a basket of its basic
services each year by inflation minus 7.5 percentage points, compared with
6.25 points at present. The company has also been told to make sure small
retail customers share in the price cuts.
BT, whose negotiations are led by Mr Jonathan Rickford, government relations
director, seems to have accepted that Oftel will not change the main
elements of the regime, but hopes that detailed matters of interpretation
can be resolved in its favour. 'The devil is in the details,' a BT executive
said.
Oftel's new regime would require BT to cut connection charges sharply. If
the company agrees to do this, it might make sense to start the process this
year instead of continuing its practice of increasing connection charges.
Another issue concerns special discounts for businesses and heavy
residential users of the phone, which at the moment count towards the
overall price cuts BT must make. They would not, under the new regime,
meaning BT might have an incentive to introduce more generous discounts this
year before the regime is changed.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Not quite running like clockwork: On the eve of the white
paper on BR's future, Richard Tomkins discovers why privatisation might be
slow to bring improvements to some lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 100MPH, to parody the famous Rolls-Royce advertisement, the only sound
you can hear in the driver's cab of a London-Birmingham InterCity express is
the ticking of the clock.
Apart, that is, from the roar of the 4,040 horsepower electric traction
motors, the ferocious rattling of the windows, the howling of the wind, the
ear-splitting clanging of bells and whooping of Klaxons indicating
favourable or adverse signals, and the sound of your own voice bellowing
faintly ridiculous questions at the driver.
'Do you enjoy your job?'
'Yes, I like driving trains,' shouts back Euston-based Mr Harry Finn. 'I
always have done. But I was much happier in the steam days. It was a
different job then.'
'Why?'
'It's hard to explain,' he yells. 'In those days, with the steam engines,
you made your own power. Now it's just handed to you.'
This locomotive, number 86248, is more comfortable than any steam engine can
have been. Even so, it is a draughty, battered old thing. Built 27 years ago
by English Electric at the Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside,
it is nearing the end of its working life. At 100mph, its bucking and yawing
puts the quality of the ride in the white-knuckle league.
It is not just the locomotive. Everything about the west coast main line
from London Euston to Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester is clapped out.
There will be no private-sector interest in running a line like this in its
present state. So, with or without privatisation, InterCity is going to need
Pounds 750m of government money to put the line back to rights: and it is
trying to draw attention to its cause.
Seen from this perspective, the morning has started well. This particular
train was supposed to have left Euston at 08.10. However, the carriages of
the previous Birmingham train turned out to be defective and ours have been
hijacked to replace them.
Another set of coaches is found for the 08.10, but not in time. We leave
eight minutes late, and having missed our departure slot we have to take a
slow line out of Euston, costing us another minute or two.
Inside the cab Mr David Teasdale, a Euston-based traction inspector who is
acting as guide, is not optimistic about making good the delay. 'The timings
are so tight these days that you've virtually got to go flat out all the way
just to keep up,' he says.
There is no chance of that for the 08.10. Normal top speed on the west coast
main line is 110mph, but much of the rolling stock on the route is too old
to go that fast. In our case, both locomotive and coaches are limited to
100mph.
Worse, we have not been going many miles before we run into the first of
several speed restrictions: a long stretch of 60mph running at Watford
because of signalling repairs and track relaying. Theoretically, the
timetable allows for this sort of setback.
'But there's so much engineering work on this line that you need more
recovery time than they allow,' says Mr Teasdale.
By the time we pull into Milton Keynes we are 13 minutes behind schedule.
The passengers have been getting restless. A railman comes up to the cab
window and shouts: 'Here's a silly question: someone wants to know why
you're late.' Mr Finn delivers an earthy riposte. 'Typical,' he says
afterwards. 'It's never the driver's fault, but we always gets the blame.'
In the end, an unusually smooth passage through the busy lines into
Birmingham New Street enables the 08.10 to claw back some of the lost time.
We arrive six minutes late - enough to irritate the passengers, but not
enough to count in the statistics. The minimum for an official late arrival
is 10 minutes.
At the west coast main line headquarters outside New Street station, Mr Ivor
Warburton, route director, says delays like this - and often worse - are
symptomatic of the ageing infrastructure. The line from Euston to
Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester was modernised in the early 1960s.
Thirty years later the equipment is at the end of its expected lifespan.
Signal failures, for example, are commonplace, causing failsafe systems to
halt the trains; overhead power cables are worn down to a third of their
original size; the power supply system, originally designed for 90 mph
running, is at the limit of its potential; the track is worn out; and the
1960s rolling stock is due for renewal.
If the government would just let Mr Warburton have Pounds 750m, he would not
only fix the line but upgrade it. By straightening out some of the curves,
relaying the track, installing a modern signalling system and buying new
trains, he could raise the line speed to 125mph and cut the
London-Manchester travel time of 2 1/2 hours by 40 minutes.
That would give the airlines a run for their money, without the need for
spending up to Pounds 5bn on a French-style high-speed line.
Afterwards we go to look at the signal box at New Street station. It is one
of the busiest in the country, controlling the network of InterCity and
suburban lines converging on Birmingham. But like everything else about the
west coast main line, it is of 1960s vintage. Most of the equipment would
look more at home in a science museum.
The main feature of the control room is a vast panel carrying a diagram of
the railways running in and out of Birmingham. It is covered with buttons
and flashing lights. Some of the lights show where the trains are; numerical
codes light up to describe which train is which; and the buttons enable the
controllers to send the trains in the right direction.
Ludicrously, we have only been there for a few minutes when the train
describers fail. This sets the scene for rich farce, since it leaves the
controllers with no way of knowing which train is supposed to go in which
direction. The controllers, however, have evidently been here before:
grabbing pads of yellow notelets, they hurriedly scrawl the numerical codes
on them and start sticking them up on the board next to the appropriate
trains.
Soon, the diagram is covered with confetti. Calm is restored: but it would
only take one good puff of wind through the open window to blow all the bits
of paper away and paralyse the Birmingham rail network. Suddenly, someone in
blue dungarees appears from behind the panel. 'Sorry about that, lads,' he
says, 'one of the power supply transformers has blown up.' Nobody looks
surprised.
It has all been very effective from a propaganda point of view. But the
morning ends disastrously. The return train to London arrives on schedule;
the carriages are clean and comfortable; lunch in the restaurant car is
courteously served and delicious; and the train arrives precisely on time at
Euston.
That's just the trouble with the west coast main line; these days, you can't
even rely on it to let you down.

STRIKE action by civil servants protesting over government plans to move

Staff at the environment and transport departments oppose the planned move
because it would mean extra travelling and disruption for a workforce
already under pressure from staff cuts, unions say.
The strike, by members of the CPSA and NUCPS Civil Service unions, which
represent junior and middle-ranking staff, is timed to coincide with a lobby
of parliament. The FDA and IPMS, which together represent senior and

FT  13 JUL 92 / Smith set for decisive victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH is set for a crushing victory over Mr Bryan Gould in this
week's Labour leadership contest with the support of up to 90 per cent of
the party's electorate, Philip Stephens writes.
The shadow chancellor's campaign advisers predicted yesterday that his
overwhelming support in all three branches of the electoral college that
chooses the leader - the unions, parliamentary party and constituencies -
would give him unprecedented authority as leader. In 1983 Mr Neil Kinnock
secured 71 per cent of the vote.
Mrs Margaret Beckett is expected to beat off comfortably challenges from Mr
John Prescott and Mr Gould when the votes in the deputy and the leadership
contest are counted on Saturday. Her team is confident that she is already
assured of well over 50 per cent of the vote. Mr Prescott is expected to win
second place, with Mr Gould trailing in third.
Mr Gould's team yesterday conceded defeat in both contests with a call for
the new party leadership to acknowledge the role he had played in ensuring
the 'genuine' choice of leaders. Mr David Blunkett, who has led the Gould
campaign, said that once the result was announced the candidates should put
behind them the 'harsh words' spoken during the campaign and Mr Gould should
be given a 'major role' in the leadership team.
Mr Smith's aides indicated that there would be no attempt to 'punish' the
challenger by giving him a low-profile post in the new shadow cabinet.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Ulster weighs its balancing act: The recurring charges of
human rights abuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMNESTY International, the human rights organisation, last week again
documented lengthy allegations of abuse in Northern Ireland. It is a
perennial charge against the UK government which has to tackle, in the IRA
and loyalist paramilitaries, some of the world's most experienced
terrorists.
This year, though, there is perhaps more reason to suggest that tougher
measures to prevent abuse may be implemented. All the Northern Ireland
parties taking part in 'round-table' talks on the province's future support
a bill of rights, or incorporation of the European convention on human
rights into UK law. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said
he would not oppose such a move. If the talks collapse, it is one element
that might be salvaged.
Allegations of the sort listed by Amnesty International are common in the
republican heartlands and Roman Catholic-dominated towns of Northern
Ireland. But unionists are also worried about possible abuse.
Few argue that abuse is avoidable in an undeclared war against
paramilitaries. The worst atrocities are committed by terrorists; ministers'
prime concern has to be preserving the right to life of the province's
population.
It is a difficult balance, but the security forces are often distrusted by
the minority nationalist population - and sometimes by unionists as well.
There is a widespread perception that checks on the security forces are
inadequate.
'There is no law here,' says Father Denis Faul, principal of St Patrick's
Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and persistent campaigner for human
rights.
'The British give us money for leisure centres, they give us the small
liberties but they will keep all the big ones. They are a bit inclined to be
bullies.'
Allegations of human rights abuse lowers Britain's esteem abroad, adding to
Northern Ireland's grim image in the eyes of possible investors.
'In Northern Ireland you have much greater pressure on human rights but the
pressure takes place in the part of Europe which has the least safeguards,'
says Mr Colm Campbell, chairman of the Belfast-based Committee on the
Administration of Justice.
Particular anxiety has arisen in the past year over the treatment of
suspects at the RUC's Castlereagh holding centre in Belfast. The Northern
Ireland emergency provisions acts allow suspects to be held for up to seven
days without being charged. Access to a solicitor can be delayed for 48
hours after arrest.
Amnesty International last week detailed allegations of confessions obtained
under duress and of physical intimidation of suspects. Last year it
complained to the United Nations' Committee against Torture.
The RUC says there is no policy of abusing prisoners and its investigations
rarely find conclusive evidence to substantiate the allegations.
An independent commissioner for holding centres is to be appointed but
complaints will continue to be investigated by the RUC itself - either under
the supervision of the new commissioner or the existing Northern Ireland
Independent Commission for Police Complaints.
Lack of adequate safeguards is a recurrent theme of the Standing Advisory
Committee on Human Rights (SACHR) - an independent body set up by the
government in 1973.
Sir Oliver Napier, who stood down as chairman of the SACHR at the end of
last month, says the government is extremely slow to accept its
recommendations.
The Northern Ireland Office argues that it strikes the right balance between
tackling terrorism and protecting human rights.
But, as has become apparent during the inter-party talks, unionists and
nationalists accept that a formal mechanism for ensuring a proper balance
may be needed.

THE two paramount leaders of Algeria's major Moslem fundamentalist party,
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), were committed to trial yesterday at the
military court in Blida, south of Algiers, writes Francis Ghiles.
Mr Abassi Madani, 61, and Mr Ali Benhadj, 35, face the death penalty if
convicted on charges alleging conspiracy against the state.
They, five other FIS officials and their lawyers, walked out of the court
after failing to obtain permission for the trial to be transferred to a
civil court. Foreign journalists were banned, as they were two weeks ago
when the trial was initially due to start.
Mr Madani and Mr Benhadj, who was renowned for his fire-and-brimstone
speeches, were arrested in June 1991 after FIS-led riots protesting against
alleged constituency gerrymandering stalled plans for Algeria's first
multi-party elections.

FT  13 JUL 92 / World steel output and use 'to fall for third year running'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD production and consumption of steel will fall in 1992 for the third
year running, but the decline will be checked by a second-half recovery in
some economies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
The OECD's forecast for 1992 is further evidence of the worldwide recession
in the steel industry, which many producers are saying is the worst and most
protracted on record.
Prices in the European Community have been falling in recent weeks after
increases earlier in the year, and most analysts do not expect any
substantial recovery in steel demand until next year.
The OECD forecast offers some solace to hard-pressed producers. World steel
demand is forecast to fall 1.5 per cent this year to 606.8m tonnes, after a
steeper 4.6 per cent decline in 1991.
The main problem is in Japan, the world's biggest consumer of steel, where
the OECD expects demand to fall 10.6 per cent to 83.2m tonnes, from a record
93.1m tonnes in 1991.
Another big decline is expected in the former Soviet Union, where
consumption will fall 8.7 per cent to 89.7m tonnes after a 12.9 per cent
drop in 1991.
US demand is expected to rise 4.7 per cent this year to 78.5m tonnes, a
significant turnround from the 12.6 per cent fall recorded in 1991, and sign
of a slow recovery in US manufacturing industry.
World steel production is expected to decline more slowly this year, falling
1.2 per cent to 723.2m tonnes, after a 5 per cent fall in 1991.
Once again, the biggest fall will be in Japan, where production is expected
to drop by 8.2 per cent to 100.7m tonnes.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Sheikh 'wanted BCCI control': How the bank was helped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHEIKH Khalid Bin Mahfouz, whose family controls the National Commercial
Bank (NCB) of Saudi Arabia, planned to gain control of the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International during the mid-1980s, according to court
documents filed in the US by the Federal Reserve Board.
The documents, filed in a series of actions that have led to the freezing of
the sheikh's US assets and a Dollars 170m (Pounds 89m) fine, show the extent
to which, according to the Fed, Sheikh Khalid helped to prop up the ailing
BCCI when it was facing a liquidity crisis. They also show how the sheikh's
apparent co-operation enabled BCCI to dilute some of its worst debts using
depositors' money, thereby appeasing its auditors.
Negotiations on the takeover plan were held with Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's
founder, in the spring of 1986, according to the documents. When the talks
reached an impasse, Sheikh Khalid was persuaded to settle for the
acquisition of 30 per cent interests in both BCCI and in CCAH, the holding
company of First American Bankshares. This would give him holdings in BCCI
roughly equal to those of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, the largest
shareholder.
Sheikh Khalid struck a deal that would give him the shareholdings for
something over Dollars 1bn. According to the documents, 'Mahfouz regarded
his purchase of both CCAH and BCCI shares as a single transaction.' The
holdings were acquired through a series of deals and arrangements designed
to help BCCI overcome its financial problems. The deals were arranged
because the bank was not ready to issue new shares or capital notes and
Sheikh Khalid was unwilling to inject new capital without them.
In the first of these arrangements, he agreed to borrow Dollars 270m from
BCCI's Bahrain branch, secured only by the as-yet-unissued shares and notes.
Against the loan he deposited the same amount in BCCI, thereby helping to
improve the bank's liquidity. Mr Haroon Rashid Kahlon, one of his
assistants, working with a firm of lawyers, drew up the procurement deed for
the shares, to be held by five Bermuda Khalid. In the deed the shareholdings
were to be sold over three years.
The first tranche of CCAH shares acquired by Sheikh Khalid was bought for
Dollars 135m in July 1986 from Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed al-Sharqi, the
ruler of Fujeirah, one of the United Arab Emirates. The ruler had given Mr
Abedi and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's chief executive officer, power of attorney
over his CCAH shares held in a company called Mashriq.
Sheikh Khalid had transferred a further deposit of Dollars 485m to his own
account at BCCI, adding to the earlier Dollars 270m. Both payments were
recorded on the books of NCB as an NCB deposit at BCCI in London. When the
procurement deed was executed, Mr Khalon directed four separate
disbursements: Dollars 300m for BCCI Holdings capital notes; Dollars 183m to
repay the loan from BCCI Bahrain; Dollars 135m to the account of Wabel
Pharaon at BCCI, the brother of Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi businessman (paid as
consideration for Pharaon-held shares in BCCI); and Dollars 135m for the
CCAH shares.
The following September NCB paid Dollars 256m for a further tranche of CCAH
shares, giving him a 28.7 stake in the holding company. The same month NCB
transferred Dollars 160m to BCCI to buy 4m shares in BCCI Holdings. The CCAH
transaction later appeared on NCB's books as two loans, one to Mashriq and
one to Faisal Saud Al-Fulaij, a Kuwaiti businessman. The Fed contends these
were sham loans used to shield Sheikh Khalid's CCAH holding from US
regulators.
By April 1987 Sheikh Khalid was told by NCB's external auditors that the
bank could no longer account for the Dollars 755m purchase of BCCI and CCAH
securities merely as a deposit with BCCI and must show it as a share
purchase. In response Sheikh Khalid directed that the amount should be
re-characterised, partly as a loan to his wife and children and partly as an
investment by NCB in BCCI capital notes.
Later the same month Sheikh Khalid told Mr Abedi he wanted to divest his
holdings in BCCI and CCAH, for which he had negotiated a buy-back agreement.
The BCCI shares were all sold to ICIC Overseas, the Cayman-based BCCI
affiliate. The Fed says that while he insisted in disposing of his holding,
he agreed to keep his decision a secret and to remain as a director of BCCI
until July 1989.
By the time the Bank of England moved to close down BCCI in July 1991,
Sheikh Khalid was no longer a BCCI shareholder but NCB was still holding
Dollars 330m of virtually worthless capital notes from BCCI. While the NCB
itself may have been a loser as a result of the deals, the Fed contends
Sheikh Khalid made a personal financial gain from the whole episode of
Dollars 120m. The documents also outline other occasions where Sheikh Khalid
used NCB funds to get BCCI out of trouble when BCCI faced concerns from
auditors.
Sheikh Khalid, who resigned last week as chief operating officer of NCB to
fight the charges, has called them 'unwarranted and ill-advised'. In a
statement last week he said that 'at all times I acted on advice and with
the assistance of respected legal counsel to ensure that I complied with US
laws and regulations in regard to my investments in BCCI and First
American'.
The sheikh said he had voluntarily met all officials he was asked to, had
been 'forthright' in answering their questions and supplied them with
'thousands of pages' of documents. 'The ill-founded allegations made against
me are based on forged documents and the actions of others. Further, they
are based on unreliable, and possibly even compromised, witnesses.' The bank
itself also called the charges 'devoid of any substance' and denied NCB at
any time owned or bought any shares in CCAH.

FT  13 JUL 92 / How regional trading blocs can damage world trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THEIR summit last week in Munich, the leaders of the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries failed to give any impetus to the Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade negotiations. Some, notably in the US, will shout even
more loudly: 'Global multilateralism is dead; long live regional trading
arrangements.'
Whether regional blocs are in the interests of those who create them can be
questioned. Still more questionable, however, is whether regional trading
arrangements are an alternative to global multilateralism. If anything,
regionalism makes the case for the global multilateral system even more
cogent.
What is certain is the growing importance of regional discrimination. The
World Bank's latest study of global economic prospects shows that 41.4 per
cent of world trade fell within existing regional trading arrangements in
1988 and another 4.9 per cent of world trade within potential new
arrangements, such as those between the EC and eastern Europe, and the US
and Mexico.(1) Even if trade within the European Community is excluded as
now being like trade within one country, 24.8 per cent of world trade falls
within existing arrangements and 6.3 per cent more in potential new
arrangements.
Whether regional arrangements are in the economic interest of the
participants depends on the extent of trade creation, as opposed to trade
diversion. Trade creation occurs when high-cost domestic producers are
replaced by lower-cost producers in the regional partner. Trade diversion
occurs when lower-cost external suppliers are replaced by higher-cost
suppliers in the regional partner.
Clear a priori rules cannot be derived for when a given arrangement will
generate beneficial trade creation rather than harmful trade diversion. As
the distinguished international economist, Jagdish Bhagwati, argues,
geographical proximity is not a sufficient condition.(2)
Whether or not regional arrangements may benefit their participants, such
arrangements cannot be an alternative to multilateralism. As the chart
shows, roughly half of world trade was among broadly defined regions in
1990, not within them. Despite the onward march of regionalism, the
proportion of inter-regional trade has declined little since 1973.
The only region of the world for which intra-regional trade has looked like
a realistic trade strategy is western Europe, where a number of medium to
small countries send almost three-quarters of their exports to one another.
For North America and Asia, however, markets outside the region account for
some two-thirds of total exports. To sacrifice those markets to regional
ones would be folly.
Not only is multilateral trade hugely important, but the drift to
regionalism makes global rules still more essential.
As Professor Bhagwati notes, new forms of protectionism, such as
anti-dumping and voluntary export restraints, as well as the protectionist
use of local content requirements make trade diversion more likely. Global
disciplines are needed, therefore, to make regional arrangements less
damaging not merely to outsiders, but even to their participants.
Will regionalism undermine globalism? A recent study of regionalism from the
International Monetary Fund argues that 'beyond a certain threshold an undue
emphasis on regionalism would undercut the multilateral trading system and
render it inoperative.'(3) If the authors are right, regionalism makes
globalism more essential, but simultaneously enfeebles it. This is no cause
for celebration.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Delegates look back longingly to 1976: Supporters are hoping
Clinton can repeat Carter's success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's Democratic convention in New York is the fourth time the party
has come to the Big Apple for its election year get-together, and delegates
are hoping it will prove a repeat of 1976, when another little- known
governor of a poor southern state arrived to accept the party's presidential
nomination.
On that occasion, Mr Jimmy Carter went on to win the White House from a
sitting Republican president, a feat fellow-southerner Governor Bill Clinton
would love to emulate.
Mr David Dinkins, New York's mayor, also hopes for a reprise of 1976. At the
time, the city was recovering from a severe fiscal crisis, and the
convention proved a big psychological lift for New York and a minor boon for
its economy.
This year the city is also struggling to overcome a financial emergency, but
Mr Dinkins is confident the convention will breathe fresh life into the
ailing local economy.
He estimates that the press coverage of the event will be worth the
equivalent of Dollars 200m (Pounds 105m) in advertising expenditure
(although he makes a big assumption that all the coverage will be positive
about New York, which it won't).
In addition, the mayor estimates that Dollars 190m will eventually be spent
on preparations for the event and Dollars 110m by the convention during the
week itself. On top of that, as much as Dollars 175m will come in from the
general increase in economic activity around the convention centre and the
city, and another Dollars 27m is expected from tax revenues.
If the figures are anywhere near correct, New York should be left with a
handsome profit. The cost of hosting the convention is Dollars 21m, almost
all of it paid for by the city.
It is interesting to compare how the Texas city of Houston is financing the
costs of hosting the Republican convention next month. It has raised part of
the Dollars 10m estimated costs from private sources. The rest, however, is
coming from a most un-Republican source - a (read my lips) tax increase.
A large part of New York's Dollars 21m outlay will be spent on security, and
calming the fears of the thousands of out-of-towners attending the
convention. No fewer than 2,400 police officers will patrol Madison Square
Garden during the week, and their overtime will alone cost more than Dollars
6m.
The area surrounding the convention venue has been cleared of drug dealers,
pimps and prostitutes, and the Department of Consumer Affairs will be
issuing warnings to visitors about street con artists.
Private enterprise, meanwhile, should fill any gaps in security. One
(probably Republican) businessman who owns a gun-permit service in Queens
plans to rent bullet-proof vests to delegates for Dollars 10 a day while
handing out a friendly little pamphlet called 'Welcome to Fear City'.
Although New York officials deny it, pressure groups have complained that
large numbers of homeless people have been cleared from the streets around
the Garden in time for the convention.
Even if the area was being 'tidied' up for delegates, the vast army of
homeless in New York will not be totally ignored this week. Mr Jerry Brown
plans to eschew the comforts of a flashy midtown hotel and spend his nights
in a city shelter for homeless; the Coalition for the Homeless will hold a
nightly candelight vigil; and there will be an 'Unconvention Sleep-In' in
Central Park.
Other alternative events include an Unconventionals Crash the Convention
Concert organised by local anarchists, the Reverend Al Sharpton's Black
Agenda March, a No Police State March, and an Unconventional Smoke-In at
Washington Square to campaign for legalised marijuana. One wonders if
Governor Bill Clinton, a self-confessed marijuana user (but not inhaler)
will attend.
Finally, a note about media overkill. While there will be 4,928 Democrat
delegates attending the convention this week, organisers have arranged
accreditations for 15,000 journalists. That's three hacks for every one
delegate. No excuse, then, for any missed stories.
Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela will attend the Democratic National
Convention on Wednesday as a guest of party chairman Mr Ron Brown, Reuter
reports.
Political observers speculated that Mr Mandela's appearance at the
convention might be a pointed rebuke to President George Bush for not
putting pressure on South Africa's government to help end their dispute over
violence in black townships.
Mr Mandela had been scheduled to visit New York and address the United
Nations Security Council on Wednesday on the deadlock in South Africa's
democracy talks.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Clinton tops in the team spirit stakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Democratic party convention has not needed more than a single ballot to
choose its presidential nominee since 1956, and this year's convention in
New York will be no exception.
But Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the winning candidate, appears to
have done a better job than his predecessors of quelling any dissonant
voices that could have upset a show of Democratic unity behind his
candidacy.
Mr Clinton, with the backing of 2,565 of the 4,288 convention delegates, has
had to make remarkably few concessions to his opponents, either on the
content of the party platform or on the roster of speakers for the four-day
gala at Madison Square Garden.
'This will be more unified than any convention I've been to in recent years.
. . This is going to be Bill Clinton's convention,' says one Democratic
party activist now working for the Clinton campaign.
Some of the Arkansas governor's critics within the party have been
strong-armed into a display of team spirit - such as Governor Mario Cuomo of
New York, who has agreed, at the urgent behest of Mr Ron Brown, the party
chairman, to make the formal nominat ion speech on Wednesday night.
Mr Paul Tsongas, Mr Clinton's strongest challenger during the primaries, has
agreed to endorse his rival in exchange for a chance to speak to the
convention on behalf of his pro-business economic policies.
Others have been kept off the speaking list altogether, notably former
Governor Jerry Brown of California, whose rebellious primary campaign won
him 613 delegates.
Mr Brown's supporters hope to raise a challenge with a procedural vote on
the convention rules, but Clinton supporters are dismissive.
Mr Jesse Jackson, who has endorsed Mr Clinton but has spent the last week
sulking on television because no-one will treat him with the respect he
feels he deserves, could pose more of a problem. His convention speech has,
however, been relegated to Tuesday night, when it seems likely to receive
less attention than the simultaneously broadcast All Star baseball game.
Perhaps the biggest challenge for Mr Clinton will be to come up with an
acceptance speech on Thursday that is not eclipsed by the oratory that has
gone before. The Democrats have lined up all their most talented speakers:
from the acerbic wisecracks of Governor Ann Richards of Texas and the
intense eloquence of former Representative Barbara Jordan, to the emotional
uplift of Mr Cuomo.
Mr Clinton's last convention speech, nominating Governor Michael Dukakis in
1988, has gone down in the Democratic party annals as one of the dullest of
all time, but he can be more exciting.
The party platform, meanwhile, shows the marks of Mr Clinton's moderate
supporters, many of them drawn from the Democratic Leadership Council, a
mostly southern grouping that has set about drawing the party towards the
centre.
Calling for 'a New Covenant to repair the damaged bond between the American
people and their government', the platform includes many traditional liberal
Democratic themes, such as urban investment, abortion rights, affirmative
action in favour of minorities, public support for the arts, and a limited
amount of gun control.
However it also marks a shift away from government interventionism in its
rhetoric on economic policy - although not as far as Mr Tsongas would have
liked.
'An expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs is the
most important family policy, urban policy, labour policy, minority policy
and foreign policy America can have,' the platform states.
'We reject both the do-nothing government of the last 12 years and the big
government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our
way to prosperity.'
Perhaps as important, it contains a significantly tougher anti-crime plank
than recent Democratic platforms, remedying a weakness that the Republicans
have gleefully exploited for decades.
Democratic leaders hope the party platform and the selection of Senator
Albert Gore of Tennessee - a southerner very similar to Mr Clinton in age,
views and style - will help to signal to voters that the Democrats are now a
moderate party representing middle-class Americans, not left-wing interest
groups.
Even some of Mr Clinton's opponents acknowledge that this is likely to be a
more winning electoral recipe than the left wing coalition of recent
elections.
Mr Clinton's campaign has already broken out of the doldrums that becalmed
it this spring, when every step and every statement seemed to strengthen his
image as another slithery politician.
Yet he has not succeeded in putting these doubts about his character wholly
behind him, and is still no better in opinion polls than level pegging with
President George Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire.
A united convention and an inspired acceptance speech could lift Mr Clinton
by 10 percentage points in the opinion polls, according to one of his
campaign advisers. While this lead would clearly dwindle in August, they
say, it does not have to disappear entirely - as Mr Dukakis's even larger
edge did in 1988.

<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk on Saturday fired a deputy prime
minister who was considered the leading economic reformer in the government,
AP-DJ reports from Kiev.
The removal of Volodymyr Lanovoy was expected to cause concern among western
financial organisations. He was the architect of the reform program approved
this year by the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Lanovoy on Tuesday had threatened to resign in protest at what he called
the government's 'economic inertia'. But he withdrew the threat the next
day, saying he would remain on the job to fight conservative forces who were
resisting his market-oriented reforms.
Mr Kravchuk said Mr Lanovoy would be replaced by the president's
representative in Odessa, Mr Valentin Simonenko, a former Communist official
who has contributed to an economic boom in the Black Sea port.
Mr Kravchuk, in an Saturday interview on Ukrainian television, said he had
told Mr Lanovoy he could no longer tolerate his 'duplicity'.
Mr Lanovoy, 39, is a member of the opposition movement, New Ukraine.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Schlesinger faces a year at hard labour: Bundesbank chief's
extra term will be tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF HISTORY had not dictated otherwise, Mr Helmut Schlesinger would now be
within a few weeks of graceful retirement after four decades of honourable
achievement at the German Bundesbank.
In fact, Mr Schlesinger, unexpectedly made the bank's president last summer
after the resignation of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, will be staying on for another
12 months beyond the normal retirement age of 68, which he reaches in
September. It is likely to be a year not of grace, but of the central
banker's equivalent of a night out on the wrong side of Mount Eiger.
Mr Schlesinger faces the toughest decision of his long career when he and
the rest of the Bundesbank's policy-making council decide on Thursday what
to do about this year's runaway money supply growth.
Some form of credit tightening is expected as a signal that the Bundesbank
is taking seriously the 9 per cent increase in the M3 money supply for 1992
 -double the central bank's 3.5-5.5 per cent target.
Under the unprecedented strains provoked by German unification - the real
reason for Mr Pohl's exit - Germany's financial machinery is running
haywire. The worries are compounded by the Bundesbank's analysis that there
is 'no recognisable weakening' of inflation, which is running at 4.3 per
cent, against the central bank's longer-term target of 2 per cent.
Thursday's decision will have an important influence on the prospect of a
realignment of exchange rates within the European Monetary System - an
option thought increasingly plausible within the Bundesbank.
Tightening action would not simply send disruptive ripples around Europe,
where nearly every other country - led by Britain and France - wants to cut
interest rates to bolster sluggish domestic economies. The outcome of the
council's deliberations will also spill over to the US and Japan, where the
central banks have been cutting interest rates to try to speed up emergence
from recession.
Mr Schlesinger himself does not know exactly what the central bank will do.
The outcome of Thursday morning's meeting will depend on several hours of
tense debate within the 18-man council and, at the end, a show of hands. The
Bundesbank's statutorily independent policy-making body, which sets interest
rates not just for Germany, but, effectively, for the rest of Europe, is
accountable to no one but itself. But, in its internal deliberations, the
council is very democratic. It takes decisions on the basis of 'one man, one
vote'.
The psychology of the council, mixing men of very different character,
ability and political leanings, is highly complex. Several leading denizens
on the council have a strong streak of rebelliousness - and some have no
particular affection for Mr Schlesinger. The president is uncomfortably
aware that, if he makes any public statement prejudging the outcome of the
council meeting, he may end up producing a result opposite to the one he
intends. For fear of adding to speculation, the Bundesbank does not even
want to announce yet whether a press conference will be held after the
meeting.
Whatever course of action the Bundesbank takes, Mr Schlesinger knows he will
be criticised. For several reasons, the bank is at a watershed.
For the first time since it brought in monetary targets 18 years ago, it
faces a drastic overshooting of its objectives for both inflation and the
money supply. In previous periods when the Bundesbank has significantly
exceeded its monetary goals (1977-78 and 1986-87) inflation was well under
control and the current account (unlike in post-unity Germany) in healthy
surplus.
The overshooting marks the first time that serious doubts have arisen about
the significance of the Bundesbank's monetary aggregates. Unification -
above all the huge public subsidies flowing from west to east Germany - have
blunted the cutting edge of monetary policy. M3 has been artificially
inflated by high short-term interest rates attracting savings from
longer-term investments, as well as by the build-up of D-Mark assets in
eastern Europe. But the threat to the Bundesbank's credibility is all the
greater because Mr Schlesinger, architect of the monetary targets introduced
in 1974, has for years been the main protagonist of the bank's
anti-inflation policy.
During its years of anti-inflation battling, the Bundesbank has never faced
such a difficult international environment. In the Bundesbank's two previous
main bouts of credit tightening (1972-73 and 1979-81) the central bank was
often unpopular, above all, at home, but was acting within a broad
international consensus. This time round, however, because of the
extraordinary post-unification position of the German economy, the
Bundesbank is out on a limb. Each of its interest rate increases last year -
in January, August and December - provoked progressively greater impatience
from Germany's foreign partners.
Most delicate of all is the effect that Bundesbank tightening could have on
the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union (Emu). The decision in
December, just a week after the Maastricht summit, to raise discount and
Lombard rates to their highest since the 1930s was already widely conceived
as a sign of the central bank's hostility to the treaty. Outside Germany,
action on Thursday would be construed similarly.
In a deliberate change of role from his previous hawkishness, Mr Schlesinger
has been doing his best, both in public speeches and private conversations
with central bankers, to show emollience over Emu. On the international
central bankers' circuit, he rates as a much more patient figure than Mr
Pohl. However, there is no doubt of his fundamental hostility to a premature
abandonment of the D-Mark. Following the Danish 'no' to Maastricht in June,
Bundesbank officials have been talking more openly of the possibility that
Emu may not come into effect.
Mr Schlesinger is no stranger to criticism of the bank's monetary policies.
He regards some of it simply as proof that he is doing his duty. The barbs
which wound him most, however, are those from domestic German monetarists
suggesting that the Bundesbank has consistently acted too late during the
past few years in tightening money to combat growing signs of inflation.
As he seeks a path through the competing pressures, Mr Schlesinger will
instinctively head towards the road which will provide the best chances for
low German inflation. All other considerations - from the future of
Maastricht to the re-election of President George Bush - will loom less
large.
His inner convictions, however, are unlikely to guarantee Mr Schlesinger
undisturbed sleep during the next few nights. And, with still a year of his
presidency left, he may find after Thursday that the steepest part of his
uphill march is only just beginning.
Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony, yesterday warned Europe to
redirect spending priorities because of the need to overcome eastern
Europe's economic difficulties.
Mr Biedenkopf, a powerful spokesman for the German states' attempts to wield
influence over the Maastricht treaty, also voiced misgivings about whether
European monetary union (Emu) would come into effect at the time foreseen by
the Maastricht treaty.
During a visit to London, Mr Biedenkopf said the German states would ratify
the treaty only if the government fulfilled certain conditions on transfers
of powers to the EC. Among these conditions, the states were looking closely
at resource transfers to poorer EC countries as well as at the 'automatic'
timetable for Emu.
Lower-income countries like Spain would have to accept a longer period in
which to catch up economically with more prosperous EC states. 'If you
overdo (income) equalisation in Europe you're going to kill Europe. It won't
work,' he said.

FEARS that forest fires in Latvia might threaten Russian nuclear bases were
being played down yesterday by Swedish experts who have been assessing the
situation.
The fires, following two months of hot, dry weather, affect three main
areas, one of them Garkaune, where ammunition dumps of the former Soviet
army lie.
Latvia's defence minister, Mr Talav Junzis, had said it was conceivable that
nuclear warheads could be under threat from the blazes. But the Swedish
experts questioned whether there were any nuclear weapons in the former
Soviet republic. Mr Tor Larsson, an expert on nuclear weapons, said that
even if some nuclear weapons were stockpiled there he doubted whether the
fires would threaten them.
He pointed out that nuclear weapons are stored under the ground and would
never become hot enough through the concrete and earth to explode. 'It would
need a temperature of over 1,000 degrees", he said.
The Russian government's official position is that all tactical nuclear
weapons have been withdrawn from the Baltics and other outlying republics,
leaving only Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan in possession of strategic
nuclear weapons.
In Latvia, the prime minister's secretary said the country expected imminent
help from Finland and Sweden to help put out the fires.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Major firmly rules out devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's determination to maintain its economic strategy was
underlined by Mr John Major at the weekend as he gave unequivocal backing to
the chancellor's refusal to consider a devaluation of sterling.
In an acerbic side-swipe against Lady Thatcher, the prime minister also
dismissed as 'fantasy fears' the warnings from Tory Euro-sceptics that the
Maastricht Treaty on European union would create a centralist European
state.
Some Tory MPs, however, continued to voice fears that sterling's place in
the European exchange rate mechanism was jeopardising hopes of economic
recovery.
Mr Major's insistence that he would not be panicked into moves to
'kick-start' the economy came as senior Conservatives acted to quell the
latest outbreak of dissent among a small group of the party's MPs.
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative
MPs, rejected complaints that the composition of the new Commons select
committees to be established this week had been 'fixed' by party managers to
exclude those ready to challenge the government.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the former chairman of the select committee on
health, will tonight seek backing from fellow Tory MPs to overturn his
exclusion from the new committee.
His complaint, supported by some colleagues and a number of Labour MPs, is
expected to prompt angry exchanges in the Commons, but most MPs are likely
to back the view that Mr Winterton and several other long-serving committee
members should stand down.
Mr Major's decision to put the full weight of his authority behind Mr Norman
Lamont's economic strategy was designed to quash any suggestion that the
Treasury's hard line against devaluation was being questioned in 10 Downing
Street.
Several Tory MPs repeated calls for the government to consider a sterling
realignment in the ERM unless the pace of economic recovery picked up. Mr
John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, was
among those predicting that if the economy was not showing signs of recovery
by the beginning of next year, there would be intense pressure for
devaluation.
Mr Townend said on BBC television that a majority of Tory MPs would now
favour a general ERM realignment, involving a realignment of the D-Mark
against all currencies.
Mr Major acknowledged that the economy would not emerge rapidly from
recession, but insisted in a newspaper interview that devaluation would be
counter-productive. As senior Whitehall officials dismissed talk of a more
general ERM realignment as 'unrealistic', the prime minister said he was
determined to put Britain in a position where the businessman, investor and
saver knew the government would not devalue.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Germany 'on money supply tightrope': Dilemma for Bundesbank
in fixing monetary target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank is 'walking a tightrope' between the need to curb money
supply growth and pressure from Germany's European partners to avoid
stifling an economic recovery, a senior Bundesbank official said at the
weekend.
Germany's money supply has ballooned by nearly 40 per cent in the past two
years with the absorption of east Germany, putting the Bundesbank in a
severe dilemma as its central council meets this week to review its monetary
target for 1992.
The central bank, headed by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, is aware that drastic
action to curb growth in the money supply would upset its EC partners. But
in the last resort it is likely to give priority to restoring Germany's
domestic monetary stability.
The senior official suggested that countries which thought they were
suffering from Germany's monetary policies could take the initiative by
seeking realignment within the European Monetary System.
Pointing to the possibility of occasional currency changes in the EMS -
where the last full-scale realignment was in January 1987 - the official
said: 'We are not in a fixed exchange rate system yet.'
Although he stopped short of calling outright for a re-alignment, he
indicated that the Bundesbank believed market forces might eventually force
weaker currencies towards a devaluation.
The official did not mention EMS devaluation candidates by name. But he said
the Bank of Italy had been intervening with 'considerable' amounts to defend
the lira last week.
The official warned that if other countries were worried about rising German
inflation, the only way this could be combated would be through tight German
interest rates.
Bundesbank officials appear undecided about what the council should do at
Thursday's meeting. Despite the half-point rise in official interest rates
in December which lifted the Lombard rate to 9.75 per cent and the discount
rate to 8 per cent, domestic monetary conditions have become more uncertain
and less responsive to Bundesbank action.
A further rise in the Lombard rate is unlikely because of the problems this
would cause for other members of the European Monetary System, who want to
reduce rates.
The less important discount rate could be increased, however, or measures
taken to limit banks' access to central bank funds.
While the Bundesbank has virtually given up hope that this year's money
supply target will be met, it hopes to create the conditions for slower
growth in M3, the broad monetary aggregate, next year. M3 has risen at an
annualised 9 per cent against a target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per
cent. But the council is unlikely to alter the goal in the face of M3's
expansion, much of it caused by bank credits to finance heavily subsidised
investments in east Germany.

FT  13 JUL 92 / BR will continue to run railways until end of century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL will continue to run the railways to the end of the decade and
beyond under the government's substantially watered-down plans for
privatisation to be set out in a white paper tomorrow.
The slow-track approach will be greeted with relief by BR, but will come as
a bitter disappointment to Tory backbenchers and others who had hoped to see
a more radical shake-up and sale of the corporation.
Although BR's stations are to be put up for sale, ministers acknowledge that
only a minority of BR's passenger train services are likely to find their
way into the hands of the private sector in the foreseeable future.
They are pinning their hopes on the possibility that this small number of
privately-operated services will set an example that embarrasses BR into
doing better.
The latest plans will leave BR in charge of the railway tracks indefinitely.
Privatisation will consist mainly of trying to get the private sector to run
the trains.
However, only freight trains will be offered for outright sale. On the
passenger side, the private sector's role will be limited mainly to
operating some routes under franchise.
The government is likely to proceed extremely cautiously with the award of
franchises because of the private sector's lack of previous experience
operating complex railway services.
The private sector is also wary of the opportunities because of
uncertainties over whether there is any money to be made from running
trains. It has not been reassured by the escalating losses reported by BR
two weeks ago.
The white paper will attempt to ease some of the private sector's anxieties
about costs by allowing franchisees to lease passenger trains from BR
instead of buying their own.
If a franchise is not renewed, BR will guarantee to take the trains back
from franchisees. This will considerably reduce the risks to the private
sector in taking on a franchise.
In addition to privatising BR's existing services, the white paper will
allow would-be operators to start up new services alongside BR's. Several
companies such as Virgin Atlantic, the airline, have expressed an interest
in doing so.
However, this is unlikely to produce large numbers of additional passenger
services because operators will need to secure access to BR's tracks, many
of which have little or no spare capacity.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Perot stumbles as Clinton thrives

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton arrived in New York at the weekend for the Democratic
party convention, fresh from a demonstration of why, notwithstanding the
reluctance of Mr Jesse Jackson, he seems likely to win an overwhelming
majority of black and other minority votes in November's presidential
election.
Mr Jackson, the black Democratic leader who has clashed repeatedly with Mr
Clinton over the past few months, offered a grudging endorsement of the
Clinton campaign on Saturday night, but on Sunday he went on to make clear
that his differences with the Arkansas governor remained unresolved.
However, Mr Clinton's warm reception at a meeting of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the
leading black and minority rights advocacy groups in the US, suggested that
Mr Jackson, though clearly still influential with African-American voters,
does not speak for them all.
Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, his vice-presidential running
mate, received a generally enthusiastic response from the NAACP audience in
Nashville on Saturday, contrasting with a cool welcome for Mr Ross Perot,
the Texas billionaire who appears all but certain to run for the presidency
as an independent candidate.
In a speech to the NAACP delegates, Mr Perot recounted how well his father
had treated his poor black employees and repeatedly referred to 'your
people'. Some black leaders at the meeting called the comments
condescending.
Mr Perot later apologised for his language, but several NAACP delegates said
he had betrayed his lack of experience with minorities.
Mr Jackson, who has publicly flirted with the idea of backing Mr Perot,
despite a clear rebuff from the Perot campaign, was in a more forgiving mood
yesterday towards the Texas independent than he has been towards Governor
Clinton.
'That gaffe was not intentional,' he said.
Senator Gore also said Mr Perot deserved the benefit of the doubt for this
'slip of the tongue', but Governor Ann Richards of Texas, who is chairing
this week's Democratic convention, said Mr Perot's remarks suggested 'a
level of insensitivity'.
'If you have people working around you . . . who are black, who are brown,
who are Asian, who are female, you don't make mistakes like that,' she said.
Mr Jackson and his allies have complained that the Clinton campaign has
targeted white middle class voters at the expense of poorer urban
minorities, and needs to be more inclusive in its approach.
But although opinion polls show less than exuberant support for Mr Clinton
among black voters, his long experience in southern politics has helped him
forge alliances with many black elected officials, such as Mayor Maynard
Jackson of Atlanta and Congressman John Lewis.
These officials may be just as effective in winning Mr Clinton
African-American votes, without requiring the extravagant homage that Mr
Jackson regards as his due.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Serbian authorities step up pressure in Kosovo: A look at
the persecution of the majority ethnic Albanians in a colonisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL October 26 1990, Dr Alush Gashi was Professor of Anatomy at Pristina
University, Kosovo. He has no idea when he will be free to lecture again.
'That morning, three armed Serbian policemen came into my office. They
dragged me out in front of the patients. They were angry because, as an
ethnic Albanian, I had refused to leave my job,' said 40-year-old Mr Gashi.
The former visiting professor at the University at California now spends his
time documenting cases of human rights abuses in the southern province of
Kosovo, which was forcibly reintegrated into Serbia in 1990.
Since March 1990, when Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, issued a
decree called 'The programme of the Republic of Serbia to colonise Kosovo',
thousands of professional ethnic Albanians have been sacked.
According to Belgrade's policy of colonising Kosovo, the decree stipulated
how favourable credits would be granted to those Serbs and Montenegrins
willing to settle in Kosovo, and how ethnic Albanians would be excluded from
holding any positions of influence.
'Last autumn, 25,000 teachers, on all levels, were sacked; 865 lecturers and
professors were dismissed; over 2,000 doctors and medical staff now have no
jobs. About 85,000 workers have been expelled from the factories,' explains
Mr Gashi.
'Serbia wants to reverse the ethnic distribution in Kosovo,' says Mr Ibrahim
Rugova, elected president of Kosovo in elections banned by Belgrade two
months ago.
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 per cent of the province's 2m population. The
remainder are Serbian, Montenegrin and ethnic Turkish communities.
More recently, human rights organisations in Kosovo reported that Serb
authorities last month sacked 60 ethnic Albanian workers from a car parts
factory in Istoq, western Kosovo, and 350 ethnic Albanians from an
engineering plant in Glogovac, south-west of Pristina, capital of Kosovo
In response to the sackings, ethnic Albanians have begun to establish their
own parallel society and institutions. Since February, ethnic Albanian
children have gathered in private houses to be taught by teachers sacked
from the primary, secondary and university schools throughout Kosovo.
'We are determined to educate our children. It is crucial to preserve a
continuity in education and in our cultural traditions,' says Mr Rugova.
In another extension of this parallel society, sacked doctors are setting up
private, charitable clinics throughout the province.
Before the medical profession was ethnically cleansed, the main
gynaecological centre in Pristina was delivering between 50 and 55 babies a
month.
'Now the centre is delivering only five or six infants. Because the ethnic
Albanians have been sacked, the women do not trust the Serb doctors. They
are now giving birth at home. We try to help as much as possible,' says Mr
Gashi.
The summary dismissal of so many ethnic Albanians has made life even harder
in a province which last year was recording 40 per cent unemployment, the
highest throughout the former Yugoslavia.
Some ethnic Albanians cope by returning to the land. Some seek help from
ethnic Albanians working abroad in Germany or Switzerland. Others rely on a
special 'Solidarity Fund' set up by the Democratic League of Kosovo, which
won an overwhelming majority in the recent unofficial elections. This fund
is financed by the diaspora.
Mr Rugova says the parallel society will continue as long as Serbia
continues to repress the ethnic Albanians.
'Ethnic Albanians are picked up every day by the police. They are beaten,
detained, and held without warrant. Their houses are searched. Intimidation
prevails,' he explains.
'It is clear Belgrade is not willing to compromise with the ethnic Albanians
at the moment,' a US diplomat says.
'Even if Milosevic, or any other Serb leader, decides to give back autonomy
to the ethnic Albanians, it will be too late. The entire province is
radicalised as a result of the repression.'
Despite the repression, Mr Rugova says ethnic Albanians will not be provoked
into rising up against Serbian repression. 'That is exactly what Belgrade
wants. It would end up being a massacre because we have no weapons. That is
why we need a United Nations presence here before it is too late,' he says.
Western diplomats said last week's decision at the Helsinki summit meeting
of the 51-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to send a
mission to Kosovo may be the first, tentative step towards recognising that
the war in the former Yugoslavia must be prevented from spreading.

THE sight of elderly women in white headscarves using sickles to harvest
Albania's wheat crop says much about the country's continuing problems of
food production.
After three years of drought and another of political and economic upheaval,
the transition from Stalinist self-sufficiency to a market economy is being
slowed by acute shortages of basic commodities, from flour and sugar to soap
and writing paper.
Last week's attempted exodus to Italy by thousands of Albanians followed the
announcement of harsh economic reforms in accordance with an IMF adjustment
programme due to take effect next month. These include abolition of wage
subsidies and price controls on most goods, though a price ceiling will be
imposed for bread, cooking oil and sugar.
Dr Abdyl Sinani, a senior official in the industry and food ministry, says:
'The government view is that it will be another three years before we get
back to our standard of living in 1989' - the last year before communism
started to crumble.
This year, wheat production will amount to only 250,000 tonnes, half last
year's output and 700,000 tonnes short of the amount needed to provide
Albania's 3.3m population with a daily loaf of bread.
Milk and meat are hard to find because livestock breeders avoid selling
young animals for slaughter to build up herds from a few animals acquired
when the co-operatives' livestock was shared out last year.
Italian soldiers and a Greek state relief organisation make daily truck
deliveries of flour and other essentials, provided under an Ecu45m (Pounds
31.8m) European Community emergency aid scheme.
This week, the EC is expected to approve another Ecu35m as an immediate
balance of payments grant for Albania to buy industrial spare parts and raw
materials.
This amount is to be matched by the Group of 24 industrial states under a
co-ordinated aid plan for former communist countries.

FT  13 JUL 92 / A shift of mood favours Clinton: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before his ennoblement, Mr Nigel Lawson, the former British chancellor, once
explained the success of Thatcherism by referring to the tides of history.
The Conservatives, he implied, had been borne aloft in the 1980s as much by
powerful intellectual currents as by their own efforts. As the Democratic
National Convention opens in New York, I wonder whether Governor Bill
Clinton and Senator Al Gore may not benefit similarly from tidal forces of
unsuspected power.
The rise of Thatcherism coincided with a global shift towards free markets.
This movement continues, but, in the US, the Democrats may benefit from a
powerful cross-current. Many now believe that market forces must be
supplemented by more effective social and environmental policies. The
Clinton/Gore ticket neatly mirrors these anxieties: Mr Clinton has expertise
in education, welfare policy and health care; Mr Gore is one of the US's
leading environmentalists. Together these baby-boomers can speak with
authority on the critical issues of the day.
After three years of economic stagnation, economics was bound to play a
decisive role in this year's election. But fresh signs that the fragile
recovery is again flagging have raised the stakes. The candidate with the
most convincing plan for restoring prosperity is certain to have a powerful
advantage. Mr Clinton - unlike President George Bush or Mr Ross Perot, the
likely independent challenger - has a bold and potentially enormously
appealing economic message for the American people, if only he can
articulate it properly. It goes under the rubric of 'people economics'.
A coterie of close advisers has convinced Mr Clinton that efforts to improve
the education and skills of the workforce hold the key to American
competitiveness in the next century. The argument - long familiar in Britain
 -was well put by Mr Robert Reich of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government
in The Work of Nations (Knopf 1991). Mr Reich, a fellow Rhodes scholar at
Oxford with Mr Clinton, argued that capital mobility and global competition
rendered traditional Democratic approaches to the economy obsolete.
Rather than focusing on measures to aid industry or promote physical
investment, the US had to raise the skills and productivity of the American
people - the least mobile factor of production - thus raising their wages
regardless of the nationality of their employers.
Now listen to Mr Clinton outlining his 'putting people first' economic
strategy last month. 'In the emerging global economy, everything is mobile:
capital, factories, even entire industries. The only resource that's really
rooted in a nation - and the ultimate source of all its wealth - is its
people. The ony way America can compete and win in the 21st century is to
have the best educated, best trained workforce in the world . . .'
In proposing ways of improving workforce skills, Mr Clinton has moved well
beyond the usual focus on the failings of high schools. He wants to:
make employers invest in the training of all employees (rather than just top
executives) by imposing a training levy equivalent to 1.5 per cent of
payroll;
improve access to university by allowing all qualified students to borrow
from the government and repay either through a low tax on subsequent
earnings or by serving the community for a limited period - for example as
police officers or teachers;
offer new hope for the majority of Americans who do not graduate from
college by setting up a national apprenticeship programme loosely based on
continental European practice.
In America, such proposals are little short of revolutionary. The argument
that investing in people - all the people - will secure greater economic
prosperity has a good chance of resonating with the general public. Opinion
polls show that voters are confused and dismayed by the stagnation of wages
since the 1970s. Mr Clinton can offer both an explanation of what went wrong
and a cure that sounds plausible.
By contrast, the other candidates offer shopworn economic recipes. Mr Perot
is respected for his own entrepreneurial success. But on economic policy he
has advanced a succession of cliches. He talks of eliminating the Dollars
350bn budget deficit 'without breaking a sweat', yet his only concrete
proposal is to cut waste, fraud and abuse. He has criticised the free-trade
pact being negotiated with Mexico on the grounds that US employers cannot
compete with Mexican wages. Yet simply restricting US access to cheap labour
will do nothing to improve US productivity.
Mr Bush is even less inspiring. Under his stewardship, the economy has grown
more slowly than at any time since the 1930s. He has lost the confidence of
conservative supply-siders by acquiescing in minor tax increases and by
allowing real federal domestic spending to rise at an annual rate of nearly
9 per cent during his presidency. Yet he has developed no strategy for
channelling spending into productive investments, such as those proposed by
the Democrats. If Mr Clinton can lay to rest doubts about his character and
cogently articulate his vision of 'people first' economics, he has every
chance of winning in November.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Will they tighten?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER one of the most turbulent week's on the foreign exchange markets this
year, dealers are focused on one issue: whether the Bundesbank will tighten
monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz.
There are strong indications of a feverish behind-the scenes debate among
Bundesbank members over the issue, and every chance that a tightening will
take place. Those council members in favour will argue that M3 money supply
now shows annual growth of around 9 per cent against an annual target range
of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.
What will the Bundesbank do? Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB
International says the Germans are unlikely to alter the M3 target for fear
of losing credibility. He believes that there is some chance that the
Bundesbank will impose limits on the amounts of funds that could be borrowed
by banks at the Lombard rate. 'But there is a danger that such action could
result in higher money market rates and eventually force the Lombard rate to
rise.'
But Mr Mark Cliffe, chief economist at the Nomura research institute in
London, says that a rate rise could exacerbate the growing money supply. 'If
events follow a similar course to the last two rate hikes and long yields
fall,' he says, 'the effect on long term credit demand could actually be
expansionary. Moreover, the effect on long term capital formation will be
contractionary, with short term investments becoming even more attractive.'
Of course, that argument was made in reverse to explain why the Federal
Reserve would not dare to cut its discount rate. Ten days ago it did. The
market will have to sit this one out until Thursday afternoon.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Economics: Unease over Germany's next move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION will mount this week as financial markets contemplate Thursday's
Bundesbank council meeting, which may decide to tighten German monetary
policy in a further bid to damp demand pressures.
The strains in the European exchange rate mechanism likely to be caused by
such a move could force other European nations to increase their own
interest rates, at just the time when many would like to cut rates to
stimulate growth.
In the UK, the weak demand due to the recession is likely to be underlined
by tomorrow's release of the latest data on the prices of manufactured goods
at the wholesale level. Producer prices are expected to have risen by 3.5
per cent in the year to June, from 3.6 per cent in May, illustrating the
strong disinflationary pressures.
On Thursday, news is expected that the underlying increase in average
earnings across the UK economy reached 6.75 per cent in the year to May,
compared with 7 per cent in April, another indication of declining
inflation.
The following are the highlights of releases of economic data over the next
week. The numbers in brackets are median market projections, provided by MMS
International, the financial information group.
Today: Belgium, European Community finance ministers meet in Brussels.
Switzerland, monthly meeting of central bank governors from Group of Ten
industrial countries, in Basle until Tuesday. Australia, May retail sales
(down 1.2 per cent). Japan, June trade surplus (Dollars 9.1bn). Spain, June
consumer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month, 6.5 per cent on year). US,
May home completions. France, markets closed until tomorrow, for holidays.
Tomorrow: Japan, June wholesale prices index (down 0.2 per cent on month,
down 1.5 per cent on year), May machinery orders. Australia, May housing
finance. New Zealand, 2nd quarter consumer prices index. UK, May industrial
production (down 0.3 per cent on year) and manufacturing output (down 0.5
per cent on year, flat month-on-month), June producer prices index (flat
month-on-month, up 3.5 per cent on year) and input prices for factory goods
(flat month-on-month, down 1.1 per cent on year). US, June consumer prices
index (up 0.3 per cent month-on-month; excluding food and energy, up by same
amount), June retail sales (up 0.6 per cent on month; excluding cars, up 0.3
per cent), June real earnings and car sales for July 1-10.
Wednesday: Japan, May industrial production. New Zealand, first quarter
gross domestic product. France, June consumer prices index (up 0.2 per cent
month-on-month, 3.1 per cent on year). Finland, June consumer prices index.
US, June industrial production (down 0.4 per cent month-on-month) and
capacity use in industry (78.6 per cent).
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank council meets in Frankfurt, will consider new
monetary targets and whether to tighten monetary policy. UK, June public
sector borrowing requirement (Pounds 3.5bn), June unemployment rise
(25,000), rise in average earnings in May (6.75 per cent on year),
manufacturing unit costs in May. US, June housing starts (1.2m) and building
permits, initial claims for week ending July 4, money supply figures for
week ending July 6 and also for June. Canada, June consumer prices index (up
0.2 per cent on month and 11.1 per cent on year).
Friday: US, May merchandise trade deficit (Dollars 6bn), exports (Dollars
36.5bn) and imports (Dollars 42.5bn). Denmark, June consumer prices index
(up 2.6 per cent on year). Canada, May manufacturing data
During the week: Germany, June wholesale prices index (up 0.1 per cent on
month). Italy, May industrial production (up 3.6 per cent on year), June
wholesale prices index (up 3 per cent on year), June producer prices index
(up 2 per cent on year). Japan, June money supply. Switzerland, June trade
balance.

RESULTS DUE
OWNERS ABROAD, the holiday company, is expected to announce half-year
pre-tax losses on Thursday of between Pounds 23.5m and Pounds 26m, compared
to Pounds 21.4m last time.
The figures in themselves are of little interest. Holiday companies have
large costs in the first half and receive most of their payments in the
second.
More eagerly awaited will be a statement on high season bookings and the
dangers of continued discounting. A sluggish season could signal another
price war.
Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate run by Mr Greg Hutchings, is likely to
report today an increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended April of
around 15 per cent. The consensus forecast is Pounds 131m against Pounds
112m a year earlier.
The US continues to provide the group's growth, with the latest period
benefiting from a full-year contribution from Philips Industries, now
operating under the umbrella of Tomkins Industries, the group's
predominantly US arm.
While the market is always interested in where Mr Hutchings' acquisition
ambitions might take him next, he is unlikely to give many clues with the
results.
Ellis and Everard, the chemical processor and distributor reporting today,
has recently suffered a minor profit downgrading to around Pounds 13m
pre-tax for the year ended April from Pounds 17.5m a year earlier. The
downturn reflects the recession and a likely exceptional charge.
Wednesday is Cider Day, with Taunton Cider closing its share offer and H P
Bulmer (Holdings) producing its annual figures. The latter will have the
better of it. Pre-tax profits at Bulmer have risen to about Pounds 16m from
Pounds 14.4m thanks to growth of the UK market. Although Taunton has enjoyed
similar gains, its offer is unlikely to appeal right now to shareholders
giving a wide berth to any new issue.

FT  13 JUL 92 / European Bonds: Traders wait for next turn of the monetary
screw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPECTRE of German monetary policy looks likely to haunt European
government bond markets this week ahead of the Bundesbank's regular
bi-weekly council meeting on Thursday.
Investors have been anticipating lower German interest rates since the start
of the year but, so far, expectations have been misplaced. The Bundesbank
has been more inclined to tighten policy rather than cut rates. By the end
of last week, the market was bracing itself for another turn of the monetary
screw.
Stubbornly high money supply growth and consumer price inflation are the
root causes of anxiety. The authorities' favoured measure of money supply,
M3, is growing at a year-on-year rate of 9 per cent, against a target range
of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.
Most analysts think the Bundesbank will not raise either the discount rate
or Lombard rate. However, it could still tighten money market conditions in
an attempt to restrict broad money growth.
For example, increased reserve requirements for banks - the amount banks
must deposit with the authorities against loans - would increase the cost of
credit. Alternatively, the Bundesbank could restrict the amount banks can
borrow in the money markets at the Lombard rate - at 9.75 per cent its
emergency funding rate for the financial system.
The danger is that either move could squeeze money rates higher and possibly
necessitate a hike in the Lombard rate anyway. Overnight money was already
trading uncomfortably close to the Lombard rate last week.
Against this background, German bonds prices were virtually static. The
benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond closed on Friday on a yield of 7.96 per
cent, unchanged on the week. Moreover, nervousness did not prevent the
Bundesbank from selling DM8bn in new bonds.
This underlines that higher German interest rates could have a more serious
impact outside the Federal Republic. For example, the strength of the D-Mark
on the foreign exchange markets last week pushed sterling outside its
notional narrow band limit against the German currency.
Strains within the ERM have already kindled talk of a sterling devaluation,
possibly disguised by moving to a narrow band at a central rate below the
current DM2.95. It is unlikely the gilts market will prosper under these
conditions.

FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Gilts: Long-dated issues hold up well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING's decline caused some nervousness in the gilt market, though
long-dated bonds held up relatively well due to a promising outlook for
inflation over the next year.
While prices at the short end fell slightly, long-maturing bonds benefited
from further signs that demand in the UK economy is extremely weak.
This point was rammed home by news that the retail prices index increased in
the year to June by 3.9 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in May. The June figure
is the lowest since last October and underlines how inflationary pressures
are being squeezed due to weak demand linked to the recession.
Last week's fall in the pound against the D-Mark - it closed on Friday night
at DM2.8725, or more than 2 pfennigs down on the week - unsettled some
sections of the gilt market. It also effectively ruled out for the immediate
future a cut in base rates, held at 10 per cent since early May. Many would
like the government to reduce rates to revive the economy.
Reflecting the lack of likely movement on short-term borrowing costs, the
benchmark short-dated 10 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1994 was quoted
on Friday night down nearly  1/2 point on the week at 100 9/32 . Its yield
was 9.24 per cent.
Long-dated gilts, however, performed better. This was on the basis that the
longer base rates stay high, the sharper will be the disinflationary
pressures, and the more obvious will be the value to investors of holding on
long-term to fixed interest-rate securities. Accordingly, the long-dated 9
per cent stock due in 2008 gained  1/8 on the week, closing on Friday at 101
13/16 , for a yield of 8.79 per cent.
On the basis of the inflation prospects, it is possible to make out a good
case for buying gilts, a view which appears to have been accepted by many UK
institutional investors in recent weeks. That may also be the case for many
overseas investors, even with sterling looking fragile. If the point is
accepted that the pound will soon rise from close to the bottom of its band
in the European exchange rate mechanism, then anyone buying gilts using
D-Marks or any of the other relatively strong European currencies will find
UK bonds relatively cheap.
As for inflation, the retail-price figures showed how service-sector
inflation - which was relatively high for much of last year - is dropping
fast. Between January and June, year-on-year price increases for leisure,
household and personal services have fallen from 11.3 per cent to 8.1 per
cent, from 7.8 per cent to 5.9 per cent and from 8.8 per cent to 6.4 per
cent.
More indications about the modest upward pressure on prices in the UK
economy are likely tomorrow when the Central Statistical Office releases the
latest data on the prices of manufactured goods at the wholesale level.
Producer prices are expected to have risen by 3.5 per cent in the year to
June, from 3.6 per cent in May, underlining the difficulties many companies
face in increasing margins.

RANKS Hovis McDougall, the food processing group, looks likely to become the
latest in a string of UK companies to refinance a complex loan facility
arranged in the late 1980s with a simpler, relationship transaction.
The company is replacing a Pounds 250m multi-option facility arranged in
1988 with a revolving loan syndicated among a smaller group of relationship
banks led by Barclays.
The earlier five-year transaction provided RHM with funding at an interest
margin just 12.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. Last
week, banks were tight-lipped about the terms under which the new facility
is being offered.
Bankers estimate that interest margins have at least doubled - and in some
cases trebled - since the late 1980s.
However, companies feel they can achieve better terms by dealing with a
smaller number of banks. Last year, for example, Grand Metropolitan arranged
a Dollars 2.5bn four-year loan to refinance an expiring three-year facility.
The number of banks involved in the deal was cut from over 60 to 34.
At 37.5 basis points over Libor, the interest margin was considered tight.
In 1988, GrandMet paid 25 basis points over Libor for three-year money.
However, commitment fees of up to 27.5 basis points made the new facility
attractive to potential lenders and the deal was oversubscribed.
Elsewhere, Woolwich Building Society increased from Pounds 100m to Pounds
150m its five-year revolving credit facility arranged by JP Morgan.
The 11 banks participating in the transaction include Abbey National, the
former building society and residential mortgage lender. Abbey National is a
rare participant in the syndicated credits market although it is large
lender to the building society sector as a buyer of floating-rate and
mortgage-backed securities.
Yorkshire Building Society is arranging a club loan from a small group of
banks led by Fuji Bank. The deal was originally Pounds 50m but is likely to
be increased to Pounds 75m this week.
Citibank and Banco Santander will lead a syndicate of banks to finance the
Dollars 1.25bn acquisition by Cemex, the Mexican cement company, of its
Spanish rival Compania Valenciana de Cementos Portland.
The initial financing consists of a Dollars 750m guarantee to back the
tender offer and a Dollars 800m bridge loan, which will be replaced by
longer-dated funding.

FT  13 JUL 92 / US Money and Credit: Convention causes a shiver of
apprehension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Democratic party meets in New York this week to crown Mr Bill
Clinton as its presidential nominee, it is also likely to send a shiver of
apprehension through an otherwise bullish US credit market.
For a successful Democratic National Convention, producing a boost for Mr
Clinton in the opinion polls, will create even greater uncertainty over the
outcome of this year's three-way presidential race.
And anything that detracts from the chances of President George Bush being
re-elected will be taken badly by the bond market, which still seems to
assume a Bush victory and fears that inflation would be reignited by the
kind of national investment programme being advocated by Mr Clinton.
Politics apart, the market has had plenty to be bullish about ever since the
surprisingly bad employment report issued on July 2, and the Federal
Reserve's quick response in slashing half a percentage point from the
discount rate. Last week, corporate issuers rushed to take advantage of
lower short-term rates, with the US market absorbing over Dollars 9bn of new
corporate issues.
The interest rate differential, or spread, between risk-free Treasury bonds
and corporate debt has tightened so much because of declining short-term
rates that some of last week's corporate issues encountered substantial
buyer resistance.
That in turn helped hold down the price of Treasury securities as traders
lightened their positions to cover unsold corporate inventories.
Yet the overall mood remained strongly bullish as a succession of economic
indicators released during the week suggested that the momentum of both the
economy and inflationary pressures remain very weak.
The government reported on Friday that wholesale prices rose a mere
two-tenths of 1 per cent in June, while on Thursday the Fed reported a
Dollars 7.3bn drop in M2, the monetary aggregate it tracks most closely, for
the week ending on June 29 and a Dollars 13.8bn decline in M3. M2 is showing
an annual growth rate of 0.9 per cent, far below the Fed's target range of
2.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Statistics like this have increased fears of a 'triple dip' recession,
though the economic consensus still expects modestly accelerating growth in
the second half. The coming week could bring some better economic news, with
the retail sales figures for June forecast to show gains of between 0.2 per
cent and 1 per cent, thanks mainly to a stronger automobile sector.
The weakness of the economy certainly leaves room for further Fed easing
over the summer if the statistics look horrendous. But whether the central
bank moves or not, its action on July 2 appears to have produced a
substantial shift in the market's view of the remainder of 1992: no longer
do analysts expect the Fed to reverse direction and start tightening
monetary policy by the end of the year.
The Fed's easing, coupled with the poor economic statistics, helped push the
dollar down sharply last week as, too, did the likelihood of tightening
German monetary policy and the apparent willingness of Mr Nicholas Brady,
the US treasury secretary, to talk the currency down during the G7 economic
summit.
This raises two concerns for the bond market, both of which are likely to
have most impact on the long end of the yield curve: one is a lack of
enthusiasm among foreign investors, concerned about currency risk, for
long-dated issues; the other is the threat of inflation implied by an
effective dollar devaluation.
The latter need not, perhaps, be taken too seriously, given the generally
weak state of the domestic economy. Yet the market refuses to put much faith
in the long-term inflationary outlook, as underlined by the extraordinary
slope of the yield curve, which is now so steep that one analyst calls it a
'yield pole'. The Democratic convention will do nothing to flatten it.

FT  13 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Self-regulation, no last
chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS now accepted wisdom that, after all the scandals of the last few
years, self-regulation in the City of London is down to its last chance. But
accepted wisdom is always a lagging indicator. If the City believes its own
research project from the Corporation of London and the London Business
School, which has just produced its interim report, there is no time for
another try.
Its most important preliminary finding is that regulatory troubles could be
the greatest threat to the City's future in Europe. It is not just that the
present system is both cumbersome and ineffective (though that should be
enough to merit a death sentence). The real danger is that any revised and
'improved' system is likely to be over-ridden by Brussels.
Revision would therefore be a dangerous waste of time, despite the
persistent belief that self-regulation is a source of London's strength.
However, there should still be time for the City to take the kind of lead in
effective regulation that the Commission might regard as a model.
The would-be revisers are living in the distant past. It is true that
self-regulation in London was once a source of strength, but it could not be
sustained after the Big Bang. It used to work because though the rules were
imprecise - simply a consensus on what was acceptable conduct - enforcement,
through the blackball, was swift and ruthless. The post-1986 rules turned
this system upside down: we were left with huge doorstops of rule books, but
no effective enforcement at all.
There are two further weaknesses in the current system: it is run by the
wrong people, and for the wrong objectives. Those inside the market could
run an informal system very effectively, and they always knew that the prime
objective was to make the City's services completely trustworthy for the
outsiders who used them. Enforcing detailed rules, by contrast, is a job for
lawyers, not traders; no wonder it has been ill-done.
The traders have made matters worse by devoting too much of their attention
to protecting rival insiders rather than users and outside investors. This
was perhaps inevitable while excessive competition squeezed margins almost
out of existence, but the result has been to bring us to the brink of the
very disaster that the City used to avoid at all personal cost: a loss of
public confidence in the markets. This threshold has already been crossed in
Tokyo, as it was in New York after the 1929 crash, and with the same result:
a collapse in volume.
Visibly effective regulation may well, then, be the price of survival, as it
was seen to be in New York when the 1933 Securities Act was brought in, as
one of the first moves in the New Deal. The markets were demoralised by low
reputation and reduced incomes (does this sound familiar?); so James M
Landis, the brilliant young lawyer in charge of the legislation, and later
first head of the Securities and Exchange Commission which its created, saw
at once that he could harness market self-interest to the cause of tight
regulation.
Though markets have changed out of recognition in six decades, the basic
Landis approach still looks valid. First, adequate, verifiable information;
second, effective powers to enforce disclosure on those who are reluctant;
third, adequate staff to pursue wilful wrongdoers. All the things, in short,
that were lacking in the Maxwell affair. He first won the enthusiastic
support of the accounting profession, whose efforts to impose better
standards had limped along for years on a voluntary basis (familiar again?),
and the acquiescence of traders.
The result was an Augean clean-up at a pace that Hercules might have envied.
The legislation passed almost unopposed. Sam Rayburn, in charge in the House
of Representatives, remarked that he did not know whether this was because
'it was so damned good, or so damned incomprehensible'. The SEC got off to a
flying start: in its first 15 months not a single decision was challenged in
the courts. Men like Landis are born, not made; but his system still works,
and we can learn from it.

FT  13 JUL 92 / D-Mark Issues: Bundesbank guidelines set to give boost to
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET for debt issued in D-Marks, long shackled by cumbersome
regulations, is at last catching up with comparable sectors.
The new Bundesbank guidelines on issuing D-Mark paper, which come into force
at the beginning of August, are set to provide a further boost to the
market's recent development. Because of the importance of the German
economy, there is a natural appetite for D-Mark paper among international
investors, but in the past concern about liquidity and reluctance to deal
with different market practices have proved a strong deterrent.
While bunds have become increasingly broadly held, other types of securities
have remained largely domestic instruments until recently. Meanwhile,
foreign borrowers wishing to issue paper denominated in D-Marks have been
kept out by complex rules and restrictions.
But in the last couple of years, growing supply and demand, and a gradual
easing of rules by the Bundesbank, have boosted the D-Mark bond and
commercial paper markets and their improving liquidity has encouraged
greater international participation.
The latest move by the Bundesbank is set to accelerate that process and
enhance the competitiveness of German capital markets; but German bankers
say it will not necessarily improve their profits.
The main thrust of the change is the abolition of the two-year minimum
maturity requirement for foreign companies. The requirement still applies to
banks or other financial institutions.
The new Bundesbank regulations have also done away with a number of other
inconveniences - and expenses - involved in issuing D-Mark paper: the
requirement to appoint a German paying agent; to use the German clearing
system; to list on a German stock Exchange; and to use German law. In
addition, German branches of foreign banks can now arrange debt offerings.
In the first half of 1992, volume in the D-Mark sector of the Eurobond
market leapt to Dollars 14.8bn (equivalent), compared with Dollars 9bn for
the same period the previous year.
The jump is accounted for not by the growing number of issues but by a
substantial increase in the average size of D-Mark Eurobonds, which this
year have included DM2bn issues for Finland and Spain.
'In the past, we could not persuade these issuers to borrow in size,' said
the syndicate head of one German bank, who added that it is the growing
international investor base which has allowed the market to develop in this
way. German banks have had to make a more concerted effort to sell to
foreign investors since, until earlier this month, uncertainty on German tax
rules had undermined their traditional German retail investor base.
One German banker estimated the cost savings on a Eurobond at about 3 to 4
basis points, which could bring some business to the sector, 'but it is
marginal'. These savings, however, are for the borrower and, unless volume
is increased substantially, German banks could lose out, due to greater
competition from foreign houses.
But it is the D-Mark commercial paper market which stands to benefit most
from the latest changes by the Bundesbank. The CP market, which only opened
in February last year, has already attracted more than 40 issuers, and the
total value of programmes exceeds DM30bn.
Bankers predict that programmes could reach DM50bn by the end of the year,
up from DM16.3bn at the end of 1991, as the pace of expansion accelerates
following the abolition of the minimum maturity of two years for foreign
non-bank issuers.
These means that foreign companies will now be able to incorporate D-Mark
options into their existing Euro-commercial paper and Euro-medium-term note
programmes.
'This will save costs and result in a much wider use of the D-Mark because
it is so easy to do such issues,' says Mr Christof von Dryander in the
Frankfurt office of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, international
lawyers.
Until now, large companies such as France's Alcatel have had to set up
special German subsidiaries in order to issue D-Mark CP.
"The move is a significant boost for the DM's role as a fully-fledged
investment currency ,' says Mr Mark Houghton-Berry of Goldman Sachs in
Frankfurt. 'Obviously the DM has been the most important reserve currency
for decades, but because of a number of restrictions many more companies
have wanted to raise D-Marks than have found it simple or convenient to so.'
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange said last week that it welcomed this
liberalisation, 'as a matter of principle'. Privately, officials recognise
that the move will force a fundamental reassessment of the listing
procedures which are widely criticised as being complex and expensive - out
of fear that the liberalisation will drive business away from Frankfurt to
other financial centres, especially London and Luxembourg.

FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Tunstall settles out of court - Accountants
to pay damages over Sound Diffusion rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR YOUNG, the accountancy firm which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, has
agreed to pay Pounds 1.35m in costs and damages in connection with its role
as auditor and adviser to Sound Diffusion, the collapsed electrical
equipment leasing company.
Tunstall Group, the security and emergency communications equipment
supplier, agreed to settle out of court with the accountants after a battle
lasting more than two years in search of compensation following its
subscription for a rights issue just seven months before Sound Diffusion
went into receivership in December 1988.
Mr Michael Dawson, Tunstall's chairman, has doggedly pursued his case in the
belief that Arthur Young should not have approved the 1987 accounts because
of over-stated profits caused by a breach of SSAP 21, the accounting
standard dealing with leasing.
He also argued that the firm failed in its role as advisers to a Pounds 9.5m
rights issue in May 1988 which appeared to suggest that the new money was
partly for future growth, when in fact it was essential to support the
company's existing losses.
However, Mr Nick Land, national managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young, stressed
that the firm denied liability. 'We settled to finish the matter and to
avoid it going on for a long time,' he said.
Mr Dawson issued a writ in November 1989 and continued to put pressure on
the accountants right up to the date of the court case, which was scheduled
to begin on July 6. Ernst &amp; Young agreed to the payment shortly before that
date.
In his chairman's statement to the interim accounts for the six months to
March 31 this year, Mr Dawson said Tunstall had made a provision of Pounds
670,000 in professional fees for the action to date.
Tunstall sought damages for about Pounds 500,000 in rights for which it
subscribed on its shareholding at the time of the issue, Pounds 1.2m for
other shareholders' rights and Pounds 200,000 for rights it never exercised.
In the event, it received full compensation for the first item, Pounds
250,000 towards the second and none on the third.
If the case had made it to court, it might have filled an important hole in
determining whether auditors have a responsibility to existing shareholders
who subscribe for additional shares and buy others' rights in the market.
While the settlement requires that neither of the two parties discuss
details of the case, Tunstall's complaints can be derived from the highly
critical report issued by the two Department of Trade and Industry
inspectors on Sound Diffusion in February last year.
The DTI report states that Sound Diffusion had recognised 'excessive selling
profits' and 'materially over-stated' its balance sheet value in its
accounts for the year to December 31 1987 by failing to adequately follow
SSAP 21.
The report also suggests that the rights issue prospectus was 'misleading'
because it failed to point out that the new money was necessary for Sound
Diffusion's survival, a fact not pointed out to shareholders in the final
version which was circulated.
The lead partner on the 1987 audit was Mr Paul Rutteman, now a partner with
Ernst &amp; Young, an acknowledged expert on lease accounting and a member of
two technical committees of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales.
Yet as the DTI inspectors conclude: 'Arthur Young either failed to identify
or otherwise accepted serious defects in the company's lease accounting
practices and did not adequately audit the amount receivable under finance
leases.'
Ironically, Ernst &amp; Whinney was the auditor of Sound Diffusion before
relinquishing the job to Arthur Young for the 1987 accounts after a dispute
over the stated profits in the previous year. The merger of the two firms in
1989 means that partners from both sides will be involved in the settlement.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Inquiry by SFO looks at share dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office is investigating share dealings in at least two
quoted companies - Richmond Oil and Gas and Butte Mining.
The inquiry, which follows a raid on the abandoned offices of Jersey
accountants Bryant &amp; Co in April, is investigating transactions in Richmond
Oil between the Pounds 21m public offer in June 1989 and the failed Pounds
31m rights issue of October 1990. It is believed early indications have
raised the possibility of a share support scheme.
Documents recovered in Jersey, half a tonne of which were brought back to
the UK by investigators last week, could prompt an inquiry which may affect
several natural resource companies, including Geevor and Globe Petroleum,
formerly known as Far East Resources.
Bryant &amp; Co appears to have been a 'significant staging post' for share
irregularities, said a local investigator. Documents regarding Butte Mining
were also discovered at Bryant &amp; Co. Butte has launched legal action
claiming damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 184m) from more than 70 former
executives and advisers, including Bryant &amp; Co. Also named in the Butte
litigation is Mr Clive Smith, the Midland's based entrepreneur with natural
resources interests, who helped bring Richmond and Butte to the market. Mr
Smith and his family interests held 11 per cent of Corporate Broking
Services, the defunct broker which sponsored the Richmond float.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Economics Notebook: G7 passes the future of Russia to the
IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF any organisation emerged with its stature enhanced from last week's
lacklustre Group of Seven economic summit in Munich, it was the
International Monetary Fund.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, made an unprecedented
appearance at a G7 meeting to brief finance ministers about his negotiations
in Moscow on Russia's economic reform programme. The backing given by the G7
communique to co-operation between the IMF and Russia showed how the big
industrial democracies have effectively subcontracted responsibility for
helping Russia and other former Soviet republics integrate into the world
economy to the IMF.
But is the IMF's high-profile role in Russia such a good thing? Is the fund
itself the right organisation to deal with Russia's problems? Could it be
that the western industrial powers are overestimating its ability to keep
Russia on track? Is there a danger that it will be overwhelmed by the huge
difficulties to be tackled in Russia and emerge from the experience with its
prestige and effectiveness diminished?
The failure of the Russian government to achieve economic policy goals set
five months ago must cast some doubt on whether it will meet the performance
targets agreed with Mr Camdessus just before he went to Munich.
Recent research into the IMF policies and operations over the past decade by
the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a US think tank, also raises the
question as to whether the fund is best suited to the task of promoting
economic reform in Russia.
Mr Camdessus agreed in Moscow to release a first Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m)
tranche of IMF credits to Russia in return for sharp cuts in its projected
budget deficit and inflation by December. Russia will reduce its inflation
to less than 10 per cent a month by the end of 1992 from 15 per cent (and
rising) at present. It plans to cut its domestically financed fiscal deficit
from 17 per cent of gross domestic product to 5 per cent in the same period.
It was not clear in Munich how this would be achieved. The necessary fiscal
and monetary measures will be introduced over the coming weeks. The IMF has
been assured that most will be enacted by presidential decree, presumably
after parliament breaks up for the summer this week.
But are these goals realistic in the light of past experience? In late
February Russia's government and central bank agreed a programme of
stabilisation and reform that envisaged a sharp decline in inflation to a
range of between 1 per cent and 3 per cent a month by the fourth quarter of
this year when the budget deficit would be around zero. This programme
appeared to be on track until upset by decisions of the Russian parliament
in the spring.
Things may be different this time. The IMF has been careful to strengthen
the hand of the Russian finance ministry in drawing up the new programme so
that it can be considered as a Russian government programme. If the fulsome
tribute made by President Boris Yeltsin in his Munich press conference to Mr
Yegor Gaidar, his prime minister, means anything, the Russian government
should be able to count on Mr Yeltsin's support in pushing ahead with
economic reform. There is some hope that the Russian people and parliament,
looking as they are over the abyss at hyperinflation, will pull back and put
up with the conditions that IMF support will entail.
There is little doubt that the conditions will be painful. Moreover, the IMF
will have leverage because of the staged nature of its support. Another
Dollars 3bn of credits will not be released before autumn when Russia will
have been obliged to meet further economic performance targets and sort out
its monetary relations with other republics and especially those staying in
the rouble zone. The promised Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund is
further off. It depends on progress to currency stability and is unlikely
before 1993. This drip-feed technique gives the IMF a strong negotiating
position in the event of Russia backsliding on its targets.
That Russia could well backslide is suggested by the IMF Assessment Project
carried out by the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution of Arlington near
Washington. According to Mr Gregory Fossedal, the institution's chairman,
achieving currency stabilisation and inflation reduction have been among the
weakest areas of fund performance. The institution's study of 90 IMF
programmes between 1980 and 1991 also found that the successful achievement
of monetary and fiscal targets depended crucially on the implementation of
fiscal and monetary policies as planned.
Mr Fossedal argues that the IMF is most successful in countries with
long-standing democratic and capitalist traditions. He wonders whether the
fund can be the 'bold, energetic catalyst' needed to rebuild the former
communist states.
'The last time the West faced a challenge of of this magnitude, after the
Second World War, the IMF, the World Bank and the UN Rehabilitation and
Relief Agency all spent two years attempting to revive the economy of
western Europe, to no avail,' he says. Harking back to the introduction of
the Marshall Plan, he says: 'Only when a special, self-terminating executive
agency was funded, created, debated openly, co-ordinated with joint
commissions in the recipient countries, and staffed by the businessmen and
investors who would be called upon to support it, did the more focused
efforts of the fund and the Bank begin to bear fruit.'
Mr Fossedal would like to see a new Marshall Plan for Russia with a new
organisation that would move reforms ahead rapidly and have a Dollars 50bn
annual budget.
But herein lies the rub. One of the reasons the IMF has so much
responsibility thrust upon it is that the western industrial nations either
will not or cannot produce such financial support.
As Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, pointed out last week,
the US devoted 1.2 per cent of its gross national product to the Marshall
Plan. So far, the G7's contribution to the former Soviet Union amounts to
just 0.2 per cent of its combined GNP.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Hanson expects UK and US acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON, chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate that bears his name,
yesterday said the group planned to build its core businesses through
acquisitions that were more likely in the US and UK than in mainland Europe.
'Bargains will continue to arise both here and in the US', he said in
London.
Hanson has recently said it is keen to build and expand seven core
businesses. In the US they are Peabody Coal; Cavenham Forest; Beazer USA;
Grove Industries; and SCM Chemicals. In the UK they are Imperial Tobacco;
and building products groups, including ARC and London Brick.
Quoting from a private speech he gave to the Worshipful Company of Actuaries
on Thursday, he said: 'The days of Hanson's growth through acquisition are
not over. It's the timing which counts. At present disposing of small
peripheral businesses and adding new ones to our core companies is probably
right.'
While the conglomerate is still looking at the possibility of buying
businesses in Europe he warned: 'There are drawbacks which prompt my strong
belief in the priority of our present trans-Atlantic companies. There are
untold legal . . . financial and union problems in direct corporate
investment in the EC . . . which require a cautious approach. Look at
France. The country's road system paralysed by farmers and truckers.
Corporation tax in Germany, after eastern European surcharge and local
income tax . . . could be as high as 65 per cent - double the UK rate.'
He added: 'I believe the recoveries in the economies of the United States
and the UK which were expected to take place by the end of 1992 are more
likely to be delayed until the end of 1993 and a lot of companies . . . that
just managed to hang in there last year are now in worse trouble . . .
they're saying 'Well, we would like Hanson's help'.'
He warned the actuaries that corporate governance has been 'somewhat
overworked of late'. He said: 'Changes won't take place by loading the board
with non-executive directors. Their role is not apart . . . as watchdogs;
it's part of the single board. How often do companies need watchdogs? What
they need are hound-dogs who will help the company hunt down its targets.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To say gold has staged something of a rally in the last few weeks is
probably stretching the point. In dollar terms, admittedly, the metal is now
roughly 5 per cent higher than its 1992 intra day low in mid May. But in
just about any other major currency recent performance has at best been
flat.
Even so, relative stability is almost cause for gold bug celebration after
the disappointments of the last decade: in sterling terms gold is now
trading at almost exactly the same price as 10 years ago. Last week's
spectacular sale of 20m ounces of silver by the National Commercial Bank of
Jeddah provoked perverse glee among gold enthusiasts on the grounds that
they had been spared, and that perhaps there is no gold left to dump in the
Arab bank's vaults. More significantly, though, the bulls have been drawing
comfort from the market's ability to absorb pressure from persistent
producer forward selling and from operations like the 200 tonne sale by the
Belgian central bank earlier this year. Previous forecasts of Dollars 400
per ounce by the year-end have been trimmed back - but predictions of around
Dollars 380 per ounce (against Friday night's close of Dollars 348.45) now
appear to carry greater conviction.
Encouragement can obviously be derived from the dollar's weakness and the
negative turn in short-term US real interest rates after last week's
discount rate cut, though positive rates elsewhere and the absence of retail
investment demand in Europe somewhat spoil that particular story. It is also
possible that the bears under-estimate buying demand from south-east Asia,
India and the Middle East where gold has not yet lost its glitter.
That said, the arguments against the metal pushing decisively up through its
recent trading range seem more persuasive. There may have been a good
technical explanation for the Belgians lightening their load, but the market
has become twitchy that central bankers' hoards - equivalent to 17 years'
mine production - could have an increasingly unsettling effect. It may only
be a matter of time, the pessimists say, before the growing practice of
selling call options turns into physical sales. If that proves to be so, it
will take more than the closure of a few marginal mines to rekindle
confidence.

FT  13 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK savings market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk last week of UK banks and building societies being forced to raise
their mortgage rates in response to the government's aggressive marketing of
National Savings is probably exaggerated. Nevertheless, the problem is not
one which the societies or retail-orientated banks like TSB and Abbey
National can entirely afford to ignore. The prospect of National Savings
doubling its intake from the retail market this year will have little impact
on the outstanding stock of deposits, but it will make a difference to flows
of new savings.
Net new deposits collected by the building societies and Abbey National last
year amounted to some Pounds 20bn, including credited interest. The
comparable figure for National Savings was Pounds 2bn, so it must be aiming
for a significant increase in market share. On top of that TSB has motives
of its own to bid aggressively for retail savers' funds. It says it wants to
become less dependent on wholesale money market funding and to position
itself better in the retail market for the longer term.
All this matters less in an economy where the housing market is depressed
and the savings rate is at its highest for 10 years. Since there is no loan
volume to chase, lenders can afford to preserve their margins at the expense
of forgoing some new deposits. Nor is the broader clearing bank market
particularly affected by the National Savings campaign. The large clearers
are much more interested in developing fee income than raising deposits to
expand their loan books.
The picture will look rather different when base rates do finally resume
their fall. One cannot assume that will produce an instantaneous economic
recovery which will wipe out the PSBR. There will thus be a continuing need
for the National Savings marketing campaign - with the attendant probability
that its rates will become something of a benchmark for savings products.
Mortgage lenders would then face a double squeeze on their margins: through
competition for deposits and downward pressure on loan rates.
The consequence may well be that mortgage rates will eventually come down
much more slowly than the government would like or than the state of the
housing market would dictate. Had the authorities succeeded 10 days ago in
trimming base rates by a quarter point, for example, mortgage rates would
probably not have budged.

FT  13 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Welcome signs of life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is too early to be sure, but the world's big drug stocks could just be on
the turn. Since the peak in early January, their falls have been
precipitous. But since April, Merck and SmithKline Beecham have outperformed
their local markets by 9 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. In the
course of last week Glaxo outperformed the London market by 8 per cent.
Wellcome, the one stock which crucially stands to gain from all this, has
outperformed by some 3 per cent since the start of the month.
Given the market power wielded by the advisers to the Wellcome sale, this
change of sentiment might not be wholly fortuitous. But it also makes sense
in a wider context. Drug stocks on both sides of the Atlantic were driven up
last year in a classic recessionary switch out of cyclicals. Early this year
they duly came down again as the markets scented economic recovery. In the
UK, market sentiment is now back in the doldrums, while in the US it has
been somewhat dented by the latest discount rate cut. The Wellcome tender
closes at the end of next week. At this rate, the vendors could just get
lucky.
There is another strand of thinking which might assist Wellcome. In terms of
drug pricing, the 1990s could prove not merely non-inflationary but
positively deflationary. In such a world, producing me-too drugs in
quantities is not enough, since they will get hammered on price.
What is needed is genuinely innovative products which can be charged for.
Wellcome has such products in the pipeline, as do Glaxo, Merck and
SmithKline Beecham. Having been stampeded indiscriminately into drug stocks
before, the market this time round is showing signs of being more choosy.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Concorde reaches supersonic milestone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCORDE reached a signif-icant milestone yesterday by completing 250,000
supersonic flying hours in commercial service with British Airways but the
aircraft is showing signs of its age.
The UK carrier said the supersonic hours flown by Concorde now totalled more
than all the supersonic flying hours completed by the combined air forces of
the west since the introduction of supersonic combat aircraft.
This achievement comes as the Anglo-French airliner, which began commercial
service with BA and Air France in 1976, has suffered a series of technical
problems. These include the loss of parts of its rudder during supersonic
flight on three occasions since 1989.
BA is now subjecting Concorde rudders to scrupulous checks after every five
flights compared with normal inspections after each 50 to 100 flights. It
has also commissioned new rudders from British Aerospace at a cost of about
Pounds 5m to be fitted on all BA's seven Concordes.
The company said yesterday the first new rudder would be fitted in November.
Both BA and Air France want to stretch the working life of the aircraft into
the next century in an effort to continue supersonic services until a second
generation supersonic airliner is developed to replace Concorde.
Without modifications, Concorde is expected to reach its operational limit
by 1998-99.
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale, the two Concorde airframe manufacturers,
as well as Rolls-Royce and Snecma of France, the engine suppliers, are
working with the two airlines to make design adjustments and improvements to
extend Concorde's operational life to 2005 or possibly 2010.
Both UK and French airworthiness authorities are satisfied Concorde remains
safe and the rudder incidents did not represent a serious risk to the
air-craft.
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said Concorde had to have its certificate
of airworthiness renewed each year.
The aircraft were 'monitored on a continuous basis and have to be maintained
in accordance to a very strict maintenance schedule to anticipate any
eventual problems'.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Letter: Economic options not so dismal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER GREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your 'Unhappily, all options are dismal' advice to economic
policymakers ('A beleaguered government', July 7) itself erred, it seemed to
me, on the dismal side.
First, rather than 'push for the earliest possible move to (European)
economic and monetary union with a (European) central bank that would look
at the European economy as a whole, and not just one region of it', the
government should immediately institute an independent Bank of England to
manage the nation's money in place of, and more prudently than, vote-seeking
politicians (ie itself). This is on the principle that sound monetary (and
economic) management, like charity, begins at home. And it would pay the
government, and the rest of us, hands down. If nothing else, it would bring
interest rates down sooner and faster than otherwise.
Of course, the government should also drop its Emu opt-out clause, if only
to retrieve London's (or other British contenders') otherwise lost chance of
landing the valuable (not to say invaluable) price of providing that
European central bank's home.
In addition, besides continuing to resist any idea of a sterling
devaluation, within or outside the EC, with might and main, the government
should take advantage of its current EC presidency to press for a general
realignment centred, as in present circumstances it clearly must be, on a
revaluation of the D-Mark (and so only indirectly constituting a devaluation
of other ERM currencies, sterling included). Such a move would not only help
Germany's own post-unification struggle against inflation, which is holding
the ERM in its thrall, but also relieve some of the pressure on (and allow
more room for manoeuvre to) Germany's ERM partners and others.
Both options are opportunities too good to be missed at this critical
juncture.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Selling the recession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT BEFORE time, the British government has realised that if its economic
strategy is to succeed it must deploy the most important weapon in its
political armoury: persuasion. There are many Conservatives who are
unconvinced that the gain, which lies in the future, is worth the present
pain. Some, notably on the back-benches, openly question whether there will
be a recovery unless there is a complete change of direction - a withdrawal
from the exchange rate mechanism, say, or a temporary flotation of sterling.
Yes, inflation is down, it is conceded, but where is the growth? They - and
the country - need reassurance that there is something of value to be had
for what has been called a price worth paying: that low inflation alone is
not the whole prize.
Mr Norman Lamont started the process of persuasion in a frank speech on
Friday night. The chancellor's determination to stick to the government's
hawkish anti-inflationary stance could not have been more clearly stated. It
was supported by the prime minister in an interview published yesterday.
Given where the economy now stands, it is argued, there is no alternative
but to stick with a hairshirt strategy whose nature should have been clear
when Mr John Major, himself then chancellor, took Britain into the ERM
nearly two years ago. Unfortunately, the case for a long hard slog was
blurred by 17 months of electioneering, during which it was intimated by
both Mr Major and Mr Lamont - not to mention the Treasury's economic
forecasts - that recovery was just around the corner.
Now that the election is out of the way the original argument must be
rehearsed all over again. If the prime minister was hesitant about selling
his strategy after April 10, it may be because he genuinely believed that
consumer confidence would return once the threat of a Labour government had
been removed. Mr Lamont, who has shown greater courage and persistence under
pressure than most of his postwar predecessors, has until now been slow to
perceive that you cannot hope to lead the British public on a long march
towards permanent near-zero inflation unless you explain the benefits of
such an endeavour. The need for political salesmanship will increase if
there is no sign of an upturn after the summer holidays.
By that time, backbench doubts about the management of the economy will be
bound up with doubts about the wisdom of ratifying the treaty on European
union agreed at Maastricht. Mr Major has been robust in his responses to the
Eurosceptics behind and above him, but the Tories remain divided. Yet, as
with the ERM, there is no alternative for the government to the policy of
keeping Britain 'at the heart of Europe'. This means ratifying Maastricht,
unless the French veto it. The government is engaged in a doubly heroic
endeavour. If it fails, so too do the prime minister and the chancellor. No
wonder they have come out fighting.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY SHOULD think that last week's outline debt accord between Brazil and
its leading creditor banks means the country has surmounted its foreign debt
problem. The risk that the outline deal will never be completed is high and,
even if completed, default would still be possible.
Things are not totally bleak. The agreement might strengthen the position of
Brazil's relatively competent economic team. The government is also publicly
optimistic that its tax reform - essential to the accord's viability - will
pass through Congress this year. Yet in no other country embarking on a
Brady agreement has economic reform been so prone to reversal; in no other
country has inflation been so high and the government's control over its
finances so weak; and nowhere else has the government's hold on power been
so fragile.
Brazil cannot boast a record of fulfilling its debt commitments: its 1988
pre-Brady restructuring agreement lasted for less than a year. A 'Brady
accord' is different from previous restructurings. Under this approach, most
debt is converted into marketable bonds. Once these bonds have been sold
into hundreds of portfolios, any future restructuring would make the current
effort, hard as it is, look easy. Since the immediate cash benefits are
modest, the main value of the Brady deal to Brazil would be improved access
to external market finance. That access could be shut off quickly if things
went wrong after the deal is completed. If so, the deal could make things
worse, not better.
While the banks may see short-term gains - the agreement should allow them
to write back provisions and leave them with more readily marketable
securities, instead of loans - a subsequent failure would hurt their
portfolios, too. A possible knock-on effect would be a reduction in the
value of their assets in other Brady countries.
Successful implementation of this package will almost certainly require
support from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But
Brazil's current IMF standby programme has missed its first quarter targets
and looks likely to miss its second quarter ones too.
Both institutions are likely to come under political pressure - not least
from a US administration that would like to claim it has solved the debt
crisis - to back the deal. If the fundamental economic case for supporting
Brazil is weak, however, they should not yield.
This outline deal should not be completed at all costs. A deal that
ultimately collapses would be worse than reaching no deal at all.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Debt workout dangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norman Lamont's analysis, in his speech on Friday, of the various deceptive
quick fixes for getting around, or out of, the exchange rate mechanism (ERM)
constraints should be read in full. It can be obtained from HM Treasury
Press Office, Parliament Street, London SW1P 3AG. Tel. 071-270 5238; Fax 270
5244.
Mr Lamont is enough of a politician to know how much he is putting himself
out on a limb and that the official Treasury would not hesitate to leave him
as a scapegoat if it changed its mind about the appropriate policy regime.
I shall say nothing more about the ERM until after the Bundesbank council
meeting on Thursday, and instead turn to a problem that could weaken the
whole industrial world and, with it, debilitate the ex-Communist countries
and the third world as well.
This is an aspect of the debt problem. It is often said that recovery is
held back because people and businesses prefer, whenever they receive some
cash, to reduce debt rather than buy more goods and services. The problem is
acute in the US and Japan and therefore cannot be blamed on the ERM.
The nature of the threat is little understood. If it were just a question of
people wanting to get their indebtedness down while incomes remain the same,
before resuming normal purchases, it would not be the end of the world.
Economic growth never has been and never will be an entirely smooth process.
But it could be worse.
Let us take a closer look at the process of repaying debt. Is it just
working off the excesses of the previous boom? It would be easy to
understand the need for it if there had been great physical mal-investment
in the wrong industries or processes - the extreme example being the
obsolescent and polluting plants in the ex-Communist states.
I have to pinch myself, however, to see excess debt in a similar light - why
people should be unemployed and capacity unused because of entries on
balance sheets. A possible reason is moral hazard. If imprudent, or even
just unlucky, borrowers are always to be bailed out by official policy, they
would have every incentive to do it again, which can hardly be good for the
long-run development of the economy. The purpose of leaving people to work
through their own debt is to teach them that there is no such thing as free
or riskless credit.
There is, however, a precise way in which the debt workouts can go too far.
One person's spending is another person's income. If I cut down my spending
too far, your income is reduced and with it your ability to service your
debt, which in turn will hit your expenditure. A cumulative downward process
 -which might be called the debt repayment multiplier - is thus a
possibility. If it were to happen, it would not necessarily show up fully in
the savings ratio, as incomes would be reduced as well - a subtlety that is
usually missed.
We are talking of dangers not actualities. There is little sign of such a
downward multiplier in operation. There are plenty of cushions which
normally prevent it. Moreover, it is normal at the end of every recession
for some people to fear that the economy is entering a new long-term
depression just when it is about to turn upwards. The OECD Economic Outlook
showed that gross national product (GNP) in the main industrial countries
has risen by an estimated 5 per cent per annum in nominal terms in the first
half of 1992. By no standards is this a cumulative downward spiral.
Those who think otherwise still suffer from the delusion that governments
have the power to manage demand in real terms, irrespective of what happens
to prices and pay. Even after Britain's anti-inflation success, the
underlying RPI has still only moved down to 4.8 per cent per annum - enough
to take up nearly all of a normal 5 per cent increase in spending, leaving
little room for real growth.
It is always wise to be prepared. The boy who was disbelieved because he
cried 'wolf' too often would have been better employed drawing a sketch so
that his family would have known what to look out for. What is lacking among
the leaders of the Group of Seven is a recognition of their responsibility
to maintain - but not to inflate - world demand in nominal terms. This may
not be easy, if people react perversely to such stimuli by saving all the
more. There could in the end be a need for New Deal strategies which might
guarantee certain kinds of credit.
But we are far from being there yet. So far, the G7 leaders have not even
recognised their responsibility for managing nominal demand jointly. The
ones who talk about demand and growth - mainly the Americans - forget the
little word 'nominal' and still believe that they can influence directly the
real economy. But many of the others do not seem to recognise any
responsibility for demand management and have thrown out the Keynesian baby
with the bathwater. We all need to get out our sketch-books and look out for
wolves.

'CRISIS' HAS so long been the normal state of Italian politics and state
finances that foreigners are in danger of underestimating the crisis Italy
is now experiencing.
A rampant public sector deficit, an inconclusive election result followed by
a 16-ballot presidential election, the country's top anti-Mafia magistrate
murdered, leading politicians indicted for corruption, a fragile government
formed after prolonged horse-trading, the public contemptuous of politics:
so what else is new? Italians will go on working and making money, even if
much of it is concealed from the authorities. Italy will remain a delightful
country to visit and an enjoyable if sometimes exasperating one to do
business with. Its politics, happily, will remain the least interesting
thing about it.
Perhaps that instinctive response of the outsider will prove right, yet
again. But this time Italy may have to confront some painful choices. The
corruption and irresponsibility of the postwar state has in some respects
been cumulative rather than static. The scale of corruption revealed by the
current scandal in Milan - particularly in the higher reaches of the
Socialist party - goes beyond what even the most shameless politician would
have attempted in the 1950s or 60s: one reason why it has come to light is
that contractors can no longer afford kickbacks of the size demanded.
Similarly the proportion of revenue absorbed in servicing the public debt
has grown to almost unmanageable size.
The recession does not help, even if it has affected Italy later and less
drastically than other European countries. In addition, the convergence
criteria laid down at Maastricht present a serious challenge to a country
which needs both economically and psychologically to be in the European
Community's first tier.
Above all, the Italian state is a child, and therefore now an orphan, of the
cold war - its domestic politics dictated by the choice in favour of the
west made in 1948. It has put up with an ever more corrupt and inefficient
political system mainly because the only alternative appeared to be a
communist-dominated government. But today, communism is no longer an alibi
for the ruling class. That is why last April voters plumped in unusual
numbers for maverick, anti-system parties, including some which call into
question the unity of the country.
The result of that election is paradoxical: a government composed of the
same parties as before, with a narrow majority, but conscious of the need
for drastic fiscal and institutional reform. It has begun boldly, by taking
the axe to Italy's legendary cornucopia of a state pension system. If it
carries on like this it should, according to the traditional rules,
collapse. But this time traditional rules may not apply. Maybe the
government will be able to appeal over the head of parliament to a wider
public, which knows that the price of the usual governmental failure would
this time be too high.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: South African theatre after apartheid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GREIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken the visit of an American director to stir the stagnant waters
of South African theatre. Two decades of cultural isolation, combined with
the widely-felt need to testify against apartheid, have created a local
drama scene in South Africa of much energy but little variety. Now
directors, writers and actors face new possibilities. But inevitably many
find it difficult to shift their focus, to find new ways of saying and
showing.
Professor Richard Schechner of New York University is the first
international director of repute to work in South Africa for a long time. He
is a guest director at the current Standard Bank National Festival of the
Arts in Grahamstown, the elegant university town which was once at the heart
of 19th century settler-Xhosa wars.
Schechner, who was jointly sponsored by the bank and the US government, has
brought August Wilson's play, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. He cast and
rehearsed it in Johannesburg, using mainly unknowns, before opening it at
the festival this week.
The play is set in a Chicago blues recording studio in the Twenties and is a
cameo of racial attitudes then and now. Unlike most of the 120-odd plays at
the festival, it is not set behind a proscenium arch; instead, Schechner
uses the entire auditorium as a stage. Thus the focus falls on the stage,
rather than circumstances alluded to; on direction rather than performance;
and on unspoken intimacies and nuances of relationship rather than
statements. This obliqueness is foreign to the often strident realism and
rhetoric of local theatre as it has succumbed to the twin pressures of
reduced public funding of the arts and anti-apartheid orthodoxies.
The production represents one fruitful direction for the future. Others are
emerging as artists face what Nadine Gordimer, echoing the psychologist
Erich Fromm, calls the 'fear of freedom'.
For the first time, a state-sponsored arts council, the Performing Arts
Council of the Transvaal, has staged a work by the Nobel Prize-winning
Nigerian poet and dramatist, Wole Soyinka. His Death and the King's
Horseman, staged with statuesque simplicity, depicts the conflict between
British colonial values and tribal custom. The tribal scenes are written
with often operatic flamboyance, the colonial with easy, sardonic wit. The
production boasts several fine performances, notably one of weary cynicism
by one of the country's most impressive actresses, Nomhle Nkonyeni, who
started her career with Athol Fugard's Serpent Players in Port Elizabeth in
the Sixties.
A variant of the focus on the local is the blending of Fugardian
psychological realism with the exuberant expressionism of song-and-dance of
black improvised theatre. The blend is still uneasy, with marked
gear-changes from action within the stage, which the audience observes, to
action intended to arouse the audience. Breaks in narrative flow for a
toyi-toyi performance (toyi-toyi is the march dance used by black militants)
to underline a politically correct sentiment demand a degree of flexibility
of the audience.
This artistic eclecticism is seen, for example, in Life imn Hostels by the
Zakheni Cultural Group, which also demands trilingualism, being performed in
an insouciant mixture of English, Afrikaans and Zulu, like many workshopped
plays. The play takes place in a hostel for migrant mine-workers: intense,
poignant revelations of degradation break suddenly into rousing tribal songs
and dances; horrifying disclosures are swiftly followed by mordant comedy.
Such violent disjunctions are smoothered in Ekhaya-Museum Over Soweto by
painter/writer Matsemela Manaka. His musical is about a returning exile's
dream of establishing Soweto's first museum. A band is on stage; the master
of ceremonies is drunk and libellous; uplifting speeches are made at the
audience, and calabashes of beer passed round. The ritual of the opening
ceremony is intentionally blurred with the rituals of performance.
Multi-culturalism is more smoothly achieved in The Nuga Moya Cinderella by
Natal's Theatre for Afrika. Their musical burlesque is set in a rural post
office, complete with a gallery of South African types: the officious
postmaster, the right-wing clerk, the resentful, militant son of the dead
tea-lady. To raise money for his education, the post office staff stage a
version of Cinderella for the village, setting their version in a Zulu
kingdom. The white right-wing clerk plays the king; the handsome prince is
played as a Soweto rock singer who is not too interested in rural grandeurs;
the ugly sisters are played by a white and a black clerk. Ostensibly a light
comedy, it consciously creates an image of hope and co-operation,
identifying what is and what might be in the country at large.
Facing new freedoms has also encouraged South African playwrights to deal
with topics previously considered insignificant: preserving wildlife; sexual
inequality; sexuality itself. A bizarre feature of this new freedom is some
nostalgia for the immediate past - of about three years ago. An Afrikaans
duo has disinterred early Boer and Afrikaans songs, which they perform with
all the flair of cabaret and disco. When they do the national anthem, Die
Stem and come to the verse which talks of dying for the country, black
audience members are stalking out, to the performers' apparent surprise.
White audience members took the same line when the country's best-known
satirist described sex with identical twins in what is his first mature,
well-made play, Die Vleiroos (The Marsh-Rose). Pieter-Dirk Uys's play is his
first to plumb beneath political surfaces. Like a surprising number of new
South African works, it features a motif of a father-figure, dead but still
influential, whom strong, living and often crazy women fight against. It's
an apt metaphor for the emergent South African theatre.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: New York's oasis of the park - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's summertime in New York and the heat is driving you crazy. The streets
are steaming, the hydrants are streaming and only the oasis of the park can
help to keep you sane. There cannot be another city in the world where a
park is of such importance. It is like St. Mark's Square in Venice - an
outdoor drawing room. But it is so much more than that. It really is rus in
urbe and it was intended to be by its nineteenth century creators.
When the Street Commissioners of 1807 impressed the island of Manhattan with
an immovable grid, they felt that the miles of waterfront around the
shoreline would be enough to give the city breathing space and plenty of
room for exercise and recreation. They were wrong. Commerce and the piers
took up the waterfront and soon the highways, the bridges, the entries and
exits from the tunnels filled up the desireable waterside places. There was
a need for a lung.
It was not until 1858 that the city held a competition for the Central Park.
It was won by a writer, Frederick Law Olmsted and an architect, Calvert
Vaux. Their scheme was called 'The Greensward'.
There was something very original about their plan at the time. It was
nothing to do with the classical ideas of the eighteenth century but it was
deeply romantic and picturesque. It was to look like untamed nature but
every inch of it was to be planned and designed. It was also to have whole
areas where the denizens of New York could promenade in a more formal manner
 -taking the air in a leisurely way - long before the advent of jogging and
manic movement. The Park was also to house some cultural activities and
among the rustic arbours and fountains music would be played and civilised
pleasures provided.
Many of the wishes of the founders of the park have been fulfilled over the
years. But there was a time when the joys of Central Park were overshadowed
by its dangers. In the 1960s and 1970s vandals and criminals began to ruin
the Prk systematically. Only in the recent past has the New York City's
Parks Department, with the considerable help of the private fund raising
group known as The Central Park Conservancy, been able to reverse the
decline and begin the restoration of much of the park to the original
design.
One of the areas that has been the subject of much restoration work and
expenditure has been the park's mall, which stretches from 66th Street to
72nd Street on the east side of the park. An area just to the east of this
mall is known as the Concert Grounds and here stands the remarkably handsome
and appropriate Naumburg Band shell - a gift to the City of New York in 1921
from a music enthusiast, Elkan Naumburg. The limestone band shell resembles
a giant ruined portion of a Roman building and its great coffered half-domed
ceiling, while looking marvellous also projects the sound of an orchestra or
band perfectly. The shell is inscribed 'Presented to the City of New York
and its Music Lovers', and it is not just a handsome object in the park but
also a monument to the generosity of a private citizen. It has hosted
concerts by Duke Ellington, Percy Grainger, Sousa, Irving Berlin, Benny
Goodman and many others. It is, amazingly, to be demolished by The Parks
Department.
The row over this perverse decision has grown and grown and complex legal
proceedings are underway to try and save this part of the history of Central
Park. If it is demolished it will be a great loss and it is hard to
understand the reasons for its removal. These arguments are that it is
'obsolete for today's amplified concerts' and the Central Park Conservancy
are opposed to permanent concert sites in the park. I would have thought
that many musicians are anxious to play in 'natural' acoustic conditions
today, and that there is more than enough amplification of sound in a city
like New York. The other main argument seems to be that the shell was not
part of Olmsted's original design and that it partially blocks a view from
the newly restored Wisteria Pergola. The other argument seems very spurious
 -that the band shell attracts the homeless, drug dealers and vandalism. As
one opponent of the demolition has written, 'if that argument is used in
favour of the demolition of historic buildings then New York should start
with the demolition of Grand Central Station and work down.'
The argument over the demolition of an agreeable, useful and important
monument in Central Park demonstrates how vulnerable historic buildings are.
I suspect that the 'improvers' of Central Park who give generously of time
and money think that they are doing the right thing.
But in fact they are demonstrating the fallibility those who believe in
'authentic restoration'. As the New York architect Robert Stern has written:
'Central Park is no longer a 'pure' work of Olmsted and Vaux's. It is a
palimpsest with many layers . . . History demands that we take a longer
view, preserving all the best elements of the past, which is invariably more
complex and varied than simply returning the clock to a particular moment
will allow. The past should not be erased.'
How right he is. But will politicians see the subtlety of his point or will
they wantonly destroy one of the survivors of the City Beautiful Movement?
The band shell may be a small object in a great city, but the fight over its
future concentrates the mind on the complex history of our surroundings. It
is too easy to wipe out the generosity of the past and too easy to believe
in the false gods of 'authentic restoration' to remove anything that may get
in their way.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Management: One of the boys - The rapid growth of an Ohio
bank over the last 18 months has lifted it into the same league as some of
the oldest US financial institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Against a national backdrop of a commercial banking industry battered by
property loan losses and recession, a bank from Columbus, Ohio, has quietly
emerged as one of the best managed, most rapidly expanding and most
strategically successful financial institutions in the United States.
Banc One, little known outside the US, has expanded away from its roots in
the midwestern heartland by way of a dozen bank takeovers over the past 18
months in places such as Colorado, Texas and Arizona.
The acquisitions have been accompanied by a management formula that combines
decentralised decision-making with group-wide guidance and advice.
Since the start of 1991 - as a result of the acquisitions - Banc One has
succeeded in boosting its total assets from Dollars 30bn (Pounds 15.7bn) to
more than Dollars 75bn.
Its network has grown from 587 to 1,328 branches, its workforce from 19,300
to 47,061 people and its geographic presence from six to 11 states.
Wall Street analysts say Banc One is one of the few US institutions
genuinely positioned to become a nationwide bank.
This has been accomplished without diluting the bank's earnings per share,
its equity-to-assets capital ratio or its return on assets, which at 1.5 per
cent is significantly higher than the average (0.89 per cent) return of the
top 25 US banks.
Last year, only four US banks - Bank of America, JP Morgan, Chase Manhattan
and Bankers Trust - earned more than Banc One's Dollars 529.5m of net
profits.
And only BofA, NationsBank, Morgan and Chemical Bank have a present market
capitalisation larger than Banc One's stockmarket value of Dollars 9bn.
The secret of Banc One's success is the result of a mosaic of strategies.
These include a strictly domestic banking operation, a conservative approach
to lending that has kept the bank largely away from the troubled property
sector, a technology-driven focus on consumer banking and an innovative set
of management and financial reporting tools that are admired throughout the
industry.
It is almost axiomatic to assume that problems must await any bank that is
expanding as rapidly as Banc One.
Yet Wall Street analysts and top bankers alike say they have confidence in
the bank and in John McCoy, the third generation member of his family to
chair the bank.
George Salem, a normally sceptical analyst with Prudential Securities,
fairly bubbles with praise: 'Banc One could well be the best practitioner of
excellent bank management in all its dimensions.'
Art Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, has great faith in Banc One's
strategy: 'They are very, very good at what they do. I'd buy their stock.'
Banc One's stock price, which has leapt by 86 per cent over the past 18
months, has obviously helped pay for the takeovers, which are mainly in
stock, not cash.
But so has the bank's continuous experience in acquiring banks - more than
100 deals have been made over the past 25 years.
Acquisitions, according to McCoy, are more than a strategy. They are a line
of business.
The 48-year-old McCoy, a burly man with a penchant for monogrammed blue
shirts, sits in his 16th floor office in downtown Columbus and explains his
acquisition and management strategies.
'First of all I don't believe in merger of equals. We've really tried to
study what we do. One rule is we never buy a bank more than a third of our
own size.
'Then, we are only really interested in opportunities in a retail banking
market where we can be first or second in terms of market share. And we
don't want to take on a bank with asset quality problems.'
The few sceptics around say Banc One has paid too richly for some banks.
But McCoy insists that the bank takeovers will not dilute overall earnings
per share, even if the issuing of new stock has diluted shareholdings in
Banc One itself, including that of his own family, which is now below 1 per
cent.
Once banks are acquired, however, Banc One swings into action to help manage
and to slash operating costs. The first step is to transfer data processing
operations to a central office in Springfield, Ohio.
The Springfield computer centre is more than just an administrative division
 -it is also the second biggest automated clearing house transaction
processor in the US, a profitable Banc One business that last year processed
44.8m electronic payments, primarily made to insurance companies by
individuals. The dollar value of those transactions was Dollars 47bn.
The heart of Banc One's much envied management, however, is what the bank
calls its policy of 'uncommon partnerships'.
This is shorthand for leaving acquired banks relatively free to design their
own marketing strategies and pricing, although not their management system
and product portfolio, which are uniform inside the Banc One empire.
Managers at the 58 separate banks inside the network are both intimidated
and inspired to achieve a high return on assets by an unusual,
computer-based monthly reporting system known as the Management Information
Computer System (Mics).
All Banc One managers can and do use Mics to compare results. The management
system also has a human face.
A team of Banc One consultants is almost always on the road, offering a
manager in Kentucky the fruits of lessons learned in Ohio or Wisconsin.
'Most people don't have anything to compare themselves to. We allow our guys
to see who is doing things the best, and how they are doing it,' says McCoy.
If Banc One is bucking the national trend, this is also because of the
bank's strategy of spreading risk geographically and among numerous small
consumers.
Its retail banking experience includes being the first bank in the US to buy
a franchise to issue BankAmericard (1967), the forerunner of Visa, and being
the first bank to install a cash dispenser machine (1970).
McCoy notes that 99 per cent of the bank's Dollars 32.6bn total loan book
consists of loans of less than Dollars 50m. The bank's strong focus on the
consumer can also be found in the profitable credit card and instalment loan
divisions. With Dollars 4.1bn of credit card receivables on its books, Banc
One is among the leading card issuers in the US.
Nancy Bush, a bank analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, says the bank's
above-average 6.5 per cent net interest margin stems in part from the rich
pickings of an average 17.8 per cent interest yield earned on credit card
balances.
Just as striking is the fact that while big banks in New York are
experiencing record consumer delinquencies, Banc One's more conservative
midwestern clientele is better at paying bills, which helps explain the
average 14 per cent earned on Dollars 6.9bn of consumer instalment loans.
The main criticism to make of McCoy's management approach is that he is
taking on more than he can handle. Bush says the bank is 'pushing the outer
edge of the envelope' with its aggressive acquisitions strategy. But she
adds: 'They have a great depth of management simply by dint of having
already acquired and integrated so many banks for the last 20 years.'
McCoy, while noting proudly that Banc One will be the seventh biggest bank
in the US in asset terms by year-end, agrees that the bank must now undergo
a period of consolidation rather than further acquisitions.
Yet analysts forecast that Banc One will achieve an increase of about 13 per
cent in its 1992 net profits, hardly a sign that the acquisitions have
caused a bout of indigestion.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service and efficiency were seldom buzzwords of hoteliers in the Soviet
Union and eastern bloc under communism. But as the former Soviet republics
and east European economies open up, many hotels are trying to raise
standards to attract more tourists and business travellers.
According to Andrew Lockwood, lecturer in hotel and restaurant management at
the University of Surrey: 'In the past, many of the hotels had no need to
budget or look at cost control - the money was simply provided by the state.
Now they need to learn how to budget and prepare financial statements,' he
says.
The hotels also face practical problems in attracting and training suitable
staff, and obtaining regular supplies of food and fuel.
When Toomas Sildmae started recruiting staff for the Palace Hotel, rated the
best in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he vowed not to employ anyone who
had worked under the old Soviet system.
As managing director of Finest Hotel Group, he wanted staff who were young,
motivated and service-minded to establish a hotel which could cater both for
businessmen and well-heeled tourists.
With unofficial unemployment estimated at 20-25 per cent in Estonia, there
is no shortage of labour, although there is a shortage of well-trained hotel
staff. Initially, the Palace Hotel sent its staff to Finland for training
only to discover that the best people quickly found jobs there.
So the hotel has started a number of schemes to keep its employees.
Staff receive part of their salary in roubles, plus a sum ranging from
one-to-three times the rouble portion in hard currency, according to how
well they perform. In a country where the rouble is regarded with some
contempt, the hard currency is very attractive.
Staff are entitled to discounts at the hotel's hard currency shop which
sells alcohol and imported food. They can also order basic groceries on the
premises so they do not have to waste time shopping during their working
hours. This also means staff spend their working hours at work.
Staff are given cheque books with which to pay for groceries, canteen or
restaurant food, and the money is deducted from wages.
The most senior staff are entitled to use company cars, bought second-hand
in Germany which can be resold two years later for almost the same price.
'A hard currency salary and the prestige of working for a successful
business is important,' says one Estonian official. 'It's very easy to fire
people here so if you have a good job, you don't want to lose it - it's
quite an incentive for people to smile in the hotel.'
Even so, Sildmae, a former trade ministry official, sees the government's
privatisation plans as the most serious threat to attracting staff.
'Estonians like to work for themselves, even if that means having a
two-metre wide kiosk on a street corner . . . we have to persuade them that
it is not bad to work for someone else.'
Food and fuel supplies have posed problems for the hotel, and the group's
separate restaurants, and pizza chain in Tallinn. The company employs four
people in its purchasing department simply to ensure that it has the right
ingredients. Most of the food is produced in Estonia and is bought from the
private sector, but some items - alcohol, French cheeses, spices and fruit -
are imported, mainly from Germany.
While it is possible to buy food in bulk, it can be very difficult to
guarantee supply. 'You can only get the fishermen to supply salmon for the
three months when it is available, so the purchasing staff must buy, prepare
and freeze it so it is always on the menu,' says Sildmae.
Last winter, Estonia had to cut heating in offices and homes, and rationed
fuel supplies as Russia started to charge world market prices for energy
supplies. Sildmae rented a filling station and bought as much petrol as
possible for the rental cars and delivery vans. The decision paid off and
the group now has surplus petrol.
The group was less fortunate with its heating supplies last winter. The
hotel was unable to control its heating supply and had to install electric
heaters to prevent the rooms from turning into iceboxes. Now, it plans a
separate system for heating the water and rooms so that it can run off an
independent energy supply next winter.

HIGH-POINT RENDEL is to design and supervise the construction of two major
schemes for Southern Water to dispose of wastewater and stormwater from two
Isle of Wight towns, Ventnor and Bembridge.
Work has already begun on scheme identification and the whole Pounds 18m
project, incorporating treatment works, pumping stations, pipelines and long
sea outfalls, is due for completion during 1995.
Conceptual schemes for Ventnor and Bembridge are already in place after
earlier feasibility work by two Southern Water companies, Southern Projects
and Southern Science, and Rendel's first role is to identify appropriate
schemes for planning approval. It will then undertake detailed design,
prepare contract documents and supervise construction.
The Ventnor scheme is expected to incorporate a sea front interceptor sewer
and pump station at Collins Point with a pumping main/gravity sewer to
headworks at Flowers Brook and an 800 metre long sea outfall.
At Bembridge a pumping main/gravity sewer could run from a pump station at
Lane End to headworks at Foreland Field Road, incorporating a 2,300 metre
long sea outfall. Rendel will also be considering alternative proposals to
include pumping 4km to a treatment works at Sandown.

FT  13 JUL 92 / People: Cutts moves to Chartered WestLB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Cutts, one of London's growing corps of European corporate financiers,
is moving shop again. Having helped build Samuel Montagu's European
corporate finance network, he is joining Chartered WestLB as managing
director, corporate finance.
The 41-year-old Cutts, who is fluent in German, French and Dutch, has not
followed the traditional career path of most London merchant bankers. He
started work as an engineering apprentice building Rolls-Royce aero engines
in Derby, then sold telephone answering machines around Europe. But it was
not until he graduated from the Insead management school that he realised he
wanted to be something more than an engineer.
He joined Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank in the early 1980s and was involved in
building up its mergers and acquisitions team. At the end of 1985 he moved
to EBC Amro Bank to head its corporate finance department, and three years
later switched to Samuel Montagu. His move to Montagu, the merchant banking
arm of Midland Bank, was partly prompted by George Loudon's appointment to
the Midland Bank board in 1988. Loudon, a Dutch man, and Cutts, who is half
Austrian, had worked together at Amro.
Samuel Montagu differs from many London merchant banks in having established
a successful corporate finance network in various Continental centres,
rather than servicing clients' needs just from the City. Cutts wants to do
the same again at Charter WestLB, a merchant bank jointly-owned by Standard
Chartered and Westdeutsche Landesbank. Cutts knows Germany well, having been
brought up in Dusseldorf, home of Westdeutsche Landesbank.
Cutts joins Jan Bowlus, who was hired from Prudential-Bache Capital Funding
two years ago. Bowlus, who is also a corporate finance managing director,
will concentrate on developing and marketing corporate finance products.

Sir Desmond Pitcher will be stepping down as chief executive of the
Littlewoods pools and retailing group next March after completing 10 years
in the job.
He will be succeeded by Barry Dale, 53, currently finance director, who
joined the Liverpool-based Littlewoods from London Transport four years ago.
Sir Desmond, who will retain his links with Littlewoods by becoming
non-executive vice-chairman, intends to devote his time helping to
regenerate Merseyside. 'He will be 58 by next March and believes this will
be an appropriate time to pursue the next step in his career,' Littlewoods
said.
During his time there, Sir Desmond has given Littlewoods a far harder
commercial edge. Its retailing arm, which includes Littlewoods stores and
the Index chain of catalogue shops, has sharpened its focus and benefited
from the introduction of computer systems. Sir Desmond was fully at home
with such technology, given his background working for Plessey, even if he
was not the most intuitive of retailers.
Dale has been appointed chief executive designate with immediate effect. 'I
think there will be adjustments on the tiller but there will be not change
in the overall direction,' Littlewoods said. It added its now-ritual coda
that the Moores family, which owns Littlewoods, had no intention of taking
the company public.

Minoru Murofushi, the 61-year-old chief executive of C Itoh, one of the
world's biggest trading houses, has been appointed to the board of HSBC
Holdings, the new owner of Midland Bank.
This is believed to be the first time that HSBC, parent of the Hongkong
Bank, has put a Japanese businessman on its board and is in line with the
group's plans to give it a more international flavour. Until now it has been
dominated by local Hong Kong businessmen.
Murofushi joined C Itoh in 1956 after graduating in law from Tokyo
University. In 1963 he was made general manager of the group's coal
department in New York and became vice president of C Itoh (America) in
1971. He went on the board of C Itoh in 1985 and was appointed chief
executive in June 1990.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Basil Smallpeice, one of the UK's best-known industrialists in the 1960s
and 1970s, died yesterday after a short illness. He was 85.
Sir Basil, who was knighted in 1961, was perhaps best known for transforming
the Cunard shipping line from a big loss-maker into profitability during the
1960s.
He also played a key role in several other flagship UK companies, including
British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) - now British Airways - and the
pottery group Royal Doulton, owned by Pearson, publisher of the Financial
Times.
An accountant, Sir Basil joined Cunard in 1964 after a period as BOAC's
managing director. Within two years he became chief executive and started
the lengthy process of turning round a passenger-oriented shipping line
facing the full consequences of a world turning to air travel.
Central to the success of his strategy was a decision to sell off most of
Cunard's fleet in order to concentrate on the upper end of the market with
just three vessels, including the QE2. By 1969 losses had been turned into a
Pounds 3m profit.
He retired from industry in 1979, standing down as chairman of Associated
Container Transportation (Australia).

<TEXT>
THE Indian parliament today elects the nation's ninth president to succeed
Mr Ramaswami Venkataraman, whose five-year term ends on July 24. Over 4,500
parliamentary representatives will vote.
The contest is largely a two-man race between Mr Shankar Dayal Sharma,
India's vice-president, the favourite to win and the ruling Congress (I)
party nominee, and Mr George Gilbert Swell, the opposition-sponsored
candidate. Mr Ram Jethmalani withdrew on Saturday. The only other candidate
is Mr Joginder Singh, sponsored by a group of legislators.
The contest is the culmination of a new phase of Indian politics. The
presidential debate has broken the opposition ranks, and radically altered
the agenda of the main opposition parties.
The Communist party of India (Marxist) did not bow to pressure from its
allies, the National Front, and has decided to support the ruling party
candidate. This has left the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party in
uncomfortable alliance with the National Front, to support the opposition
candidate.
This regrouping is seen as an indication the opposition is reactivating
itself to pressure the ruling party. It could undermine the influence of
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. India's new president will be announced on
July 25. The ruling party candidate has always had an edge over the
opposition candidate. The Indian presidency, can be highly influential in
times of turmoil.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Rabin names Peres as foreign minister: 'Dove' to seek
Mideast talks breakthrough
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK RABIN yesterday appointed Mr Shimon Peres, a former premier and
long-time political 'dove', as foreign minister in the new Israeli
Labour-led coalition, which seeks an early breakthrough in Middle East peace
negotiations.
The new government, with Mr Rabin as premier, is due to be officially
endorsed at a session of the Knesset this afternoon, following Labour's June
23 general election victory. Labour, with its commitment to territorial
compromise, replaces the hardline Likud party, which has been in government
for 15 years.
Years of often bitter personal rivalry did not prevent Mr Rabin from
offering the post of foreign minister to the highly experienced Mr Peres,
whom he ousted as Labour leader earlier this year. Mr Peres's approach to
the peace talks is much less cautious than that of Mr Rabin. But the new
prime minister, who will also be defence minister, is to keep direct control
over pivotal negotiations with the Palestinians on an interim agreement on
self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Peres will have
responsibility for the parallel multilateral talks with Arab countries.
Mr Rabin appointed as finance minister Mr Avraham Shochat, a Labour stalwart
and former chairman of the Knesset finance committee, who in recent weeks
stressed Labour's switch from traditional socialist economic policies to
market reforms.
Labour gave three lower-scale ministries to Meretz, the alliance of
pro-peace parties that is its main coalition partner, and one to Shas, the
ultra-orthodox religious party which is the third partner. Together with
support from two Arab parties, the coalition is assured of a comfortable
majority. But Mr Rabin is still hoping to bring in a second religious party
and Tsomet, a right-wing group.
Mr Rabin's immediate priorities are to mend relations with the US, to
accelerate the peace talks, and to stimulate economic growth to combat
record unemployment, bloated by mass immigration from the former Soviet
Union.
He says he hopes to travel to the US by early August to see President George
Bush. Peace talks, which Mr Rabin wants to move into continuous session, are
likely to resume in Rome by early September.
Mr Rabin is anxious to secure Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan
guarantees to aid immigrant absorption, withheld by Washington because Likud
refused to freeze Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Mr William
Harrop, US ambassador in Israel, said on Friday he hoped the new
government's policies would make the release of at least some guarantees
possible.
But the issue is by no means resolved. Mr Rabin has so far been careful not
to promise a complete settlement freeze, though he favours a freeze over
what he calls 'political' settlements. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian
spokeswoman, yesterday warned the US not to ease the conditions it
originally attached to the guarantees.
Mr Rabin regards the guarantees as a vital to revitalising the economy. But
Mr Harrop cautioned the new government not to regard them as a panacea,
saying it must push ahead urgently with liberalisation of the still
state-dominated economy.

SOUTH AFRICA'S 'mass action' campaign gathers momentum today when trades
union leaders are due to hold a protest march on government offices in
Pretoria.
Police have given permission for the march, seen as an important test for
both sides in a tense political climate, and in the run-up to the United
Nations Security Council debate this Wednesday.
Labour leaders and their allies will be looking for a turnout that would
give credence to the 'mass action' campaign designed to force President FW
de Klerk to concede an early transfer of power to the country's black
majority. The government will want to show that it can keep control of the
streets while allowing dissent.
The march is organised by the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(Cosatu), the country's most powerful labour federation, and supported by
the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist party
(SACP).
Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president, is in New York, where he and other
political leaders, including Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign
minister, will address the UN Security Council.
Mr Botha, in a speech over the weekend before flying to New York, said the
government wished to discuss the ANC's grievances. But he went on: 'I hope
they will also realise that without power sharing there will be no peace.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / Cuba to facilitate foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUBA's National Assembly has approved changes to the 1976 constitution that
would facilitate foreign investment, grant a mandate of direct secret
elections for deputies, and permit freedom of religion for the first time
since 1959.
The changes, first proposed by October's party congress, will not permit
opposition parties, nor allow private ownership of the 'fundamental means of
production'. The government will continue to control prices, wages, and
ration basic goods.
The law will allow private, in effect foreign, investment in selected state
enterprises, let individual Cuban companies export and import without
seeking central government permission, and recognise foreign ownership of
property in joint venture deals.
The changes will give what is now common practice greater legal validity. In
the past few years Cuba has sought to attract foreign investment to soften
the blow of the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union and eastern
Europe.
Foreign companies have invested heavily in tourism, and less so in oil,
nickel, biotechnology and light industry. They have tended to form joint
ventures with nominally independent Cuban companies, that are nevertheless
heavily backed and controlled by the government.
Mr Juan Escalana, president of the National Assembly, told Granma, the
official newspaper, that the investment reforms 'will demonstrate the will
of the state, the government to continue along the path already taken of
encouraging investments, negotiations, trade openings, in short to boost our
international economic relations'.
The direct elections of deputies is intended to make the parliament more
responsive to local demands. In the past deputies were chosen by municipal
and regional councils, which are dominated by loyal party members.
On Saturday, Cuba's President Fidel Castro expressed support for a
constitutional clause linking economic development and protection of the
environment, saying these issues had almost become a new world ideology
following last June's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Reuter adds from
Havana.
Mr Castro said Cuba would be the first country in the world to include the
linked themes of the environment and development in its national
constitution.

AID WORKERS escorted by UN armoured vehicles took a convoy of relief
supplies to the most devastated area of Sarajevo yesterday for the first
time since a 71-day siege of the district began, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
But elswehere in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Serb forces tightened a ring of steel
around the eastern town of Gorazde, seized key roads in the northeast and
fought fierce battles in the north and southwest.
In a breakthrough for international relief efforts, 12 lorries flanked by
eight white UN armoured vehicles delivered 120 tonnes of supplies in the
Dobrinja district.
To subdued applause from hungry residents who flocked onto the streets, they
unloaded the food and other supplies at two distribution centres before a
three-hour local truce ran out and sniper fire resumed.
'This is what the United Nations and the UNHCR (the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees) has been aiming for after getting aid to more accessible places,'
said Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman for UNHCR in Sarajevo.
'There has been very heavy fighting, shooting and shelling there all the
time. People there have been living on grass - ordinary grass,' he said.
Over 7,500 people have been killed in Bosnia since the Serbs rose up against
independence from Yugoslavia and won control of more than 60 per cent of
Bosnian territory from the majority Moslems and Croats.
The UNHCR estimates 380,000 people are trapped in Sarajevo with little food,
water or power. More than 1,000 tonnes of aid have been flown to the capital
by an international airlift but hardly any had reached Dobrinja and other
embattled districts.
Dobrinja, a community of apartment blocks used as the media village in the
Sarajevo Winter Olympics in 1984, bore the marks of a 71-day siege by Serb
irregular forces. From 30,000 to 45,000 people are estimated to be trapped
there.
'Seventy people have been killed in the siege here and 1,500 have been
wounded,' a doctor at a makeshift hospital told reporters who visited
Dobrinja with the convoy.
Street battles broke out in Gorazde at the weekend and people were trapped
with little food. Amputations and other surgery were being carried out
without anaesthetic, according to amateur radio operators.

Mr Havel failed to be re-elected as Czechoslovakia's federal president

a post of active president, not a merely ceremonial figure.
The second round of the presidential election will take place on Thursday.

   TALLINN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATVIA has announced that its own rouble, which has circulated in parallel
with the Russian currency since the start of May, will become the only legal
tender from July 20.
The Baltic state will thus be the second country to leave the rouble zone,
after Estonia, which introduced its own currency, the kroon, on June 20. The
Latvian rouble will only be temporary, as Latvia still intends to introduce
its own currency, the lat, this autumn. Ukraine and Lithuania are also
expected to introduce their own currencies within the next few months.
The Bank of Latvia does not expect problems with the clearing of payments
with Russia, as an agreement was reached at the end of last week with the
Russian central bank. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian prime minister,
however, said he had not been consulted about the move.
The Latvian rouble, unlike the Estonian kroon, is backed only by the
government's authority. Dubbed 'white money' by the Latvians, it will be
convertible into Russian roubles at par, though not officially into hard
currency.
Mr Einars Repse, central bank president, said Estonia's introduction of the
kroon had caused an overwhelming influx into Latvia of Russian roubles. This
had revived inflation, which had been squeezed to under 250 per cent by a
shortage of cash roubles and the freezing of Latvian bank accounts in
Moscow.

<TEXT>
IT had to happen: somebody somewhere has found Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
Germany's erstwhile all-but-immortal foreign minister, in the files of East
Germany's former Ministry of State Security, the feared Stasi.
However, there is a nice twist to this particular story of the perfidy of
the East German secret police.
According to Der Spiegel, Germany's fearlessly investigative and
occasionally muck-raking weekly magazine, former Stasi officers have passed
to the (west) German secret service the devastating information that Mr
Genscher was known in the Stasi files as 'Tulip'.
Or rather. . . that was the code-name for a purported 'collaborator' of the
all-powerful East German spy network, deliberately made to look like the
long-time leader of the Free Democrats in West Germany.
The magazine does not suggest for a moment that Mr Genscher, whose name has
been frequently mentioned as a possible successor to Mr Richard von
Weizsacker as the next state president, was actually a collaborator.
The whole purpose, according to Der Spiegel, was to prepare the ground for a
potential campaign to discredit Mr Genscher when the time was ripe.
The file was fleshed out with details from the genuine career of an East
German citizen, which were then simply applied to Mr Genscher.
The former foreign minister, who retired without real explanation in April
after 18 years in office, was always seen as a potential and indeed ideal
target for the East German security services.
He comes from the east, having been born in Halle, which he left for the
west in 1952. Thereafter he always remained a frequent visitor to friends
and relations there.
The 'Tulip' file was finally destroyed by the East Germans at the beginning
of the 1980s, it says. The reason was that Mr Genscher, a lifelong proponent
of detente, 'was not pursuing any policy contrary to the goals of the GDR'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has invited its Community partners to go back to basics in assessing
the European Commission's proposed five-year budget plan.
Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the Exchequer, has sent his EC
counterparts a letter asking them to consider the Commission's package from
a strict financial perspective; to compare the one-third revenue increase
requested by Brussels with individual member states' growth forecasts.
In Brussels today Mr Lamont will chair the first meeting of finance
ministers under the British presidency of the EC. It will also be the first
time the 'Delors II' package of budget proposals has been discussed at this
level since EC leaders' inconclusive debate at last month's Lisbon summit.
Further discussion of binding rates of value added tax and excise duty - on
which finance ministers nearly reached agreement two weeks ago - has been
postponed until September, because some ministers cannot attend today.
In his letter, the chancellor has also asked ministers to consider whether
the cost-effectiveness of existing EC spending justifies a substantial
increase in future expenditure.
'As finance ministers they would no doubt expect a lot of attention to be
paid to the scope for offsetting savings from existing programmes,' said a
senior British official last week.
Budget debates in the first half of the year have already opened deep
divisions between rich member states - led by Britain and Germany - and
poorer countries, over the extent of 'cohesion' funding for the latter.
Britain, which will have to search for a compromise during its presidency,
wants to intensify the role of finance ministers in considering the budget
proposals. But at Lisbon, other leaders made clear to Mr John Major, UK
prime minister, that foreign ministers would take the lead in the budget
discussions.
Britain expects the period from July to the end of September will be spent
analysing 'Delors II'. The presidency has submitted an 85-point
questionnaire on the plan to senior national officials in Brussels to help
the discussion. According to British officials, the debate will become more
political at meetings of foreign and finance ministers in October and
November, in the hope of reaching an agreement at December's Edinburgh
summit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA may not be able to complete its full standby agreement with the
International Monetary Fund before late autumn, a senior IMF official has
warned.
After negotiating a preliminary agreement with the Fund which will allow the
release of a first Dollars 1bn (Pounds 523.5m) credit tranche, Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, had hoped to complete the standby
agreement in October.
But IMF officials have said they will need some time to complete
negotiations on the standby after arrangements for a rouble zone, including
several of the former Soviet republics as well as Russia, have been put in
place.
'We have no experience in the IMF of a standby negotiated in one day or
two,' a senior official said.
However, the officials added that it should be possible to complete the
standby and move on to the third phase of Russia's IMF programme with the
installation of a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund early next year.
Fund officials are encouraged by the precedent set by the Baltic republic of
Estonia for a 'civilised exit' from the rouble zone, and say they now want
to create the conditions for 'civilised coexistence' between Russia and
those republics, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, which are considering
remaining within the rouble zone.
While the deal for a preliminary Dollars 1bn programme negotiated a week ago
between Mr Gaidar and Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, was
viewed in some quarters as a concession by the Fund, given its original
demands for radical economic reform, IMF officials said they had a 'guarded
optimism' about the Russian government's commitment to reform.
'In view of the strength of the commitments of the Russians and their
friends we believe that there are enough assurances to go ahead,' a senior
official said.
Fund officials warned, however, that the international community had not yet
begun to address Russia's financing needs for 1993. They expect a financing
gap next year of roughly the same size as this year's, which prompted a
combined Dollars 24bn western aid package.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW LEGISLATION to prevent political corruption will be put forward in the
autumn, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, announced at the
weekend at the Socialist party congress in Bordeaux.
His move followed a newspaper report last Thursday that Mr Henri Emmanuelli,
the Socialist president of the national assembly, was to be charged with
political corruption, allegedly in connection with the long-running
investigation into previous illicit financing methods of the Socialist
party.
The report, carried in Le Monde, has not been confirmed by any official
source. But the story has acquired a political life of its own, and has
caused alarm across the French political spectrum.
Many politicians, from right as well as from left, have deplored a story
which, if true, must be a damaging leak in the confidentiality of the
judicial investigation system conducted by the juges d'instruction. Mr Jean
Auroux, leader of the Socialist group in the national assembly, has called
for urgent reform of the system.
But there is also concern among some politicians, and not just Socialists,
that the newspaper report may be an indication of something resembling a
politically motivated campaign by part of the French magistracy against the
Socialist party.
Some Socialists have not hesitated to denounce the timing of the leak as a
deliberate attempt to destabilise the party just before its congress and the
long summer holidays.
Mr Bernard Stasi, a leading member of the Centrist party, has commented:
'The judges must not engage in a vendetta with the politicians.' And Mr
Andre Lajoinie, the Communist leader, has denounced the 'unhealthy climate'
created by 'the threat of charges against politicians'.
The Le Monde story was not specific on the nature of the charge, and
indicated that Mr Emmanuelli's interview would not take place until next
month.
Mr Renaud van Ruymbeke, the investigating magistrate based in Rennes, has
denied any political ulterior motive in the case. But he has also declined
to confirm or deny the substance of the Le Monde report, and he has now gone
on holiday for a month.
The report did not make clear whether Mr Emmanuelli was supposed to be
charged for illicit party financing or for personal corruption.
It is widely believed that the Socialist party was in the past involved in
illicit money-raising schemes, and Mr Emmanuelli makes no attempt to deny
it; since he was treasurer of the party from July 1988 to January 1992, he
must be formally responsible. But he might be covered by the political
amnesty designed to clear the decks for new, tighter party financing laws.
A charge of personal enrichment would be much more serious, and could lead
to imprisonment. To counter any such innuendo, Mr Emmanuelli has written to
the Justice Ministry asking for a preliminary inquiry into his personal
finances.
Many of his party colleagues have publicly declared their faith that Mr
Emmanuelli could not be guilty of any personal enrichment.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (13): A rare bird among businessmen -
Interview, Seiji Tsutsumi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE common image of Japanese businessmen is that they are always doing
calculations on calculators in their rooms. I'm different,' says Mr Seiji
Tsutsumi.
It is no idle boast. Part businessman, part artist and part intellectual, Mr
Tsutsumi, who is 64, is a rare bird among Japanese businessmen.
Saison Group, the conglomerate he leads, employs 145,000 people in
everything from fast food and helicopters to luxury hotels. His interests
include writing poetry and novels, modern art and the temples of Angkor Wat.
His family history is the stuff of soap opera.
Mr Tsutsumi talks about himself in a slightly detached way, as if a little
unsure of the many roles he plays. He seems shy but very determined - a man
driven, as he says, by a hungry spirit.
This spirit was nurtured in a difficult childhood and youth. His father, Mr
Yasujiro Tsutsumi was a ruthless railway baron who founded Seibu Railway,
one of Japan's biggest private railway companies, as well as Seibu
Department Stores and Prince Hotels, a luxury hotel chain.
At the end of the Second World War, Mr Tsutsumi senior bought prime Tokyo
sites from impoverished Japanese aristocrats in a series of hard-driven
deals, for which he earned the nickname Pistol Tsutsumi. He went into
politics and became speaker of the Diet's lower house.
Mr Seiji Tsutsumi's life was blighted by the fact that he was the son not of
his father's wife but of his mistress. His childhood was torn by the many
conflicts generated by his father's pursuit of women. Mr Seiji Tsutsumi
rebelled and, as a student, joined the Communist Party. With Japan still
under US occupation and the Cold War raging, this was a risk, even for
someone as privileged as Mr Tsutsumi.
After graduating from Tokyo University, he decided to conform - he joined
his father's business and even served for a time as his father's political
secretary, making friends with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who
was then a young political aide.
The turmoil left deep scars on Mr Tsutsumi about which he writes in a
semi-autobiographical novel, A Spring Like Any Other, recently published in
English. It concerns a department store owner's attempts to reconcile
himself with his life and his family, who all live in the shadow of a
tyrannical father. At one point the hero says of himself: 'It seems I'm
burdened with an inability to commit myself which keeps me from belonging
anywhere.'
When Mr Tsutsumi senior died in 1964, his legitimate son, Mr Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi, inherited almost the entire business empire except for Seibu
Department Stores, which then consisted mainly of one loss-making shop in
Ikebukuro, in central Tokyo. 'The people at Seibu Railway thought the
department store would go bankrupt. So they said: 'You take it',' says Mr
Tsutsumi.
To revitalise the company, Mr Tsutsumi says he had to try something
different. He had earlier spent some time working for Seibu Department
Stores in Los Angeles. There he saw chain stores in operation for the first
time. These included JC Penney, the fast food group and consumer credit
businesses. None of these then existed on any scale in Japan. When he
returned to Tokyo, he realised what Seibu must do. 'I saw the future of
Japan in the US,' says Mr Tsutsumi.
Seibu developed into a web of interlocking companies - a department store
chain, a fashion chain, supermarkets, fast food, food processing and
consumer credit.
Later, as Japan grew wealthier, Mr Tsutsumi invested in leisure, including
the Seiyo Hotel, a luxury hotel in Tokyo, travel agencies, and a stake in
Club Mediterranee, the French holiday village company. In 1988, he paid
Dollars 2.15bn for Inter-Continental Hotels, the luxury chain.
'When I started, this business was one-hundredth the size of what it is
today. We are the only department store company in Japan to have succeeded
with diversification,' says Mr Tsutsumi with a smile.
Japanese magazines often describe the rise of Mr Tsutsumi in terms of a
life-long rivalry with his half-brother, Mr Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who regularly
heads lists of the world's richest businessmen.
Even when the group's name was changed last year from Seibu Saison to Saison
Group, it was seen by some Japanese journalists as a snub to Seibu Railway.
Mr Seiji Tsutsumi parries a question about family rivalry, by saying: 'We
don't compete directly. Seibu Railway is completely different. My goal was
not to compete with Seibu Railway but with Takashimaya and Mitsukoshi
(Japan's two grandest department store companies).'
Mr Tsutsumi admits that the circumstances of his inheritance fired his
ambition: 'I think what made us successful was the fact that we had very few
blessings at the beginning. We didn't have much bestowed on us. We had a
hungry spirit.'
Today, Mr Tsutsumi acknowledges that Saison Group, like other Japanese
companies, suffers from an excess of that hungry spirit. He believes it is
time for Japanese businessmen to replace a workaholic culture with one that
would allow individuals more time for themselves.
He welcomes a recent appeal made by Mr Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony,
the electronics group, who urged Japanese companies to stop seeking to
maximise sales and profits and instead give employees more pay and more
holidays.
Mr Tsutsumi has tried to live up to Mr Morita's philosophy - last year he
retired from some top corporate posts in order to give himself more time for
writing and for politics.
In practice, Mr Tsutsumi has found it hard to distance himself from Saison
Group. He remains chairman of Saison Corporation, a core company. 'I have
delegated day-to-day management, but still I must still do some
co-ordination between companies,' says Mr Tsutsumi.
Mr Tsutsumi would have more free time were it not for the problems of
Inter-Continental Hotels, which Saison bought from Grand Metropolitan of the
UK in 1988.
The acquisition has been hit by unforeseen increases in borrowing costs and
a decline in business travel caused by the Gulf war and the world economic
slow down. It has made operating profits, but has fallen into the red after
interest costs in each of the last three years.
Saison had hoped to share the risks and costs with Scandinavian Air Systems,
the European airline, which bought a 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental.
But earlier this year, SAS, squeezed by financial difficulties, pulled out
and sold its shares back to Saison.
Mr Tsutsumi says that other Saison companies are injecting new capital into
Inter-Continental. Perhaps Y100bn (Pounds 437m) in total will be invested to
reduce borrowings. The hotel building programme will be slowed down over the
next two or three years. But he denies that the chain is damaging the
finances of the Saison group as a whole. There are no plans to sell hotels
to clear debt. 'We are long-term commercial investors not financial
investors,' he says.
Mr Tsutsumi finds it difficult to tear himself away from the group he has
headed for more than 30 years. On the day we met, he had attended a meeting
of 400 top managers of Seibu Department Stores. He said: 'Mr Mizuno (Mr
Seiichi Mizuno, president of Seibu) told the managers about his plans for
the new (financial) year. I heard his speech. I was just observing. Nobody
knew I was there.'
Nevertheless, Mr Tsutsumi strongly believes that he must force himself to
stay away in order to make space for his future successors. Mr Tsutsumi
wants to follow the example of Mr Soichiro Honda, the late founder of Honda
Motor, the car manufacturer, who retired at the peak of his powers in the
early 1970s.
So Mr Tsutsumi is spending more time in politics. The appointment of his
friend Mr Miyazawa as prime minister has created demands, including trying
to smooth relations between the government and industry. He is a member of
the board of Keidanren, the employers' federation.
Semi-retirement from Saison has given Mr Tsutsumi more time to write, under
his pseudonym Takashi Tsuji. He has written more than 20 novels and
collections of poems and essays. A book of poems was translated into English
and published two years ago under the title, A Stone Monument on a Fine Day.
He argues that Japanese business culture will change to allow other people
to make time for themselves. 'If Mr Morita had talked 10 years ago about
cutting working hours and increasing pay nobody would have listened. Now
people are talking about it.'
It is hard for companies to cut hours in times of growth because they are
busy; while in times of recession, companies are concerned about costs, says
Mr Tsutsumi. Nevertheless, employers are beginning to act. Saison Group has
this year established a new subsidiary charged with advising group companies
on how to improve fringe benefits and welfare for employees.
The worst difficulty is that 'there are many Japanese business people who
don't know how to use their free time even if they have it', he says.
Employers can introduce staff to mountain climbing and skiing and even
reading but there is a limit to how much they can do before they are accused
of 'trying to manage employees' free time'.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (14): Growing awareness - Foreign aid and
charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE private contributions to Third World charities are on the increase
in what is regarded as one sign of the country's growing public awareness of
global problems.
Although critics may contend that the response of the Japanese public is
long overdue, there are several historical reasons for the reluctance of the
individual Japanese to become involved in charitable enterprises abroad.
The Japanese traditionally have relied on the government to solve most
social problems outside the individual's own environment.
Although charitable giving is strong in Japan, it is normally confined to
those in one's family, company or neighbourhood.
This reflects the Confucian tradition, which promotes reliance on the group.
The Japanese government's role as one of the world's largest aid donors to
the developing world has discouraged private aid. The country's foreign aid
amounted to Dollars 11bn last year.
Buddhist Japan also lacks a strong overseas missionary tradition similar to
that of western countries, while its post-war quest to catch up with the
west led it to ignore less developed countries.
The refugee crisis of the Indochinese 'boat people' in the late 1970s,
however, was the first event that pierced the public's post-war
isolationalist attitude to the problems of the Third World.
Several Japanese student groups sent volunteers to the refugee camps in
Thailand. This activity created the foundation for the growth of
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) engaged in international development
co-operation.
There are now an estimated 270 Japanese non-profit organisations dealing
with Third World issues, although this constitutes only 1.3 per cent of the
total number of private foundations in Japan.
Many have been established by former student activists who believe that the
government's Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme does not devote
enough resources to grass-root development projects.
Critics argue that ODA aid is mainly used to promote industrial projects
that will benefit Japanese companies.
A shortage of both funding and volunteers, however, still presents serious
problems for the Third World NGOs despite growing public support in recent
years.
Although private contributions to Third World charities are approaching
Y15bn, a third of that amount is designated for the Japan chapter of Unicef
and the Foster Parent Plan.
More than 100 organisations must compete for the rest.
'The average budget of a NGO is quite small, about Y20m,' according to Mr
Hiroyuki Yumoto, deputy director of the Japanese NGO Centre for
International Co-operation, which represents 35 groups in the Tokyo region.
The financing problem has been eased somewhat by the creation, three years
ago, of the Voluntary Deposit for International Aid, a postal deposit system
to help Third World nations.
Under the system, Japanese can donate 20 per cent of the interest from their
postal savings accounts for Third World projects. The Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) distributes the money to selected NGOs.
More than 5m Japanese participate in the fund and will give an estimated
Y2.4bn this year.
The MPT has become the biggest government financial source for the NGOs,
exceeding the small amount of money given by the Foreign Ministry.
Some of the funds are used to attract personnel for NGO projects in the
Third World.
'Although we rely on volunteers to carry out much of the administration, we
need to find skilled people to operate the programs in the Third World,'
said Mr Hisashi Shibata, senior programme officer for the Japan
International Volunteer Centre.
'They need to be paid because they often have their own families to
support,' he explains.
'It is growing difficult to find skilled technicians, especially when there
is a labour shortage in Japan.'
Nevertheless, a spirit of optimism prevails among the Japanese NGOs. 'I
believe that the country's prosperity is convincing the Japanese that they
have a responsibility to areas of the world that are less fortunate,' said
Mr Yumoto.
'It is my hope that the NGOs have reached the turning point where they find
wide acceptance and support in Japan.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (12): Close partnership could develop -
International relations, China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is paying more attention to its Asian neighbours as its trade disputes
increase with the US and the EC. Although the Association of South East
Asian Nations (Asean) countries were the main focus of Asian investment by
Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, China could emerge as Japan's closest economic
partner in Asia in the 1990s.
If that occurs, it would be as significant for east Asia as the post-war
rapprochement between France and Germany was for western Europe.
One encouraging sign is that Japanese investment is flowing into China as
the two countries celebrate the 20th anniversary of the restoration of
diplomatic relations this year.
Japan views China both as a source of cheap labour and natural resources as
well as a potentially large and lucrative market. Although China harbours
suspicions about Japan dating from the Second World War, it also eagerly
seeks economic aid and investment capital from Japan.
Japan has curried favour with Beijing by leading the way in breaking western
diplomatic isolation imposed on China following the military crackdown on
the pro-democracy movement in 1989.
Last year, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, then Japan's prime minister, became the first
leader of a leading western power to visit China after the Tiananmen Square
massacre. This was followed by the resumption of Japanese government loans
to China.
China's political troubles in 1989 occurred as Japanese investment in the
country was accelerating. The investment reached a peak of Dollars 515m in
1988, then fell to Dollars 356m in 1989. There has been a gradual recovery
since then, with Japanese investments amounting to Dollars 503m in 1990 and
Dollars 533m in 1991.
However, China still accounts for only a tiny share of Japan's total
worldwide investment. Japan has invested Dollars 2.86bn in China between
1979 and 1991, although the figure climbs to Dollars 4.12bn if planned
investments are included. This amounts to only about 4 per cent of Japanese
industrial investments abroad and less than 1 per cent of its total
investments overseas.
Japan's direct investments accounted for a slim 4.4 per cent of the Dollars
11.98bn in total foreign investment in China last year. Although China ranks
seventh among Asian countries in terms of Japanese investment, it is
expected to climb up the table in the next few years.
Corporate investment is concentrated among Japanese producers of light
industrial goods, including textiles, electrical appliances and consumer
products. In particular, Japanese electronics companies are looking to China
as one route out of their current downturn. China is not only considered a
low-cost manufacturing base, but also as a market for electronic goods such
as TVs and VCRs that have reached saturation point in the west.
But until Chinese authorities increase foreign access to the domestic
market, an estimated 70 per cent of the goods produced by Japanese companies
in China will be for export.
The port of Dalian is the main area attracting Japanese investment, followed
by Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin. The Japanese government, banks and trading
companies are financing development of a Y30bn industrial park at Dalian
that will be 80 per cent owned by Japanese interests.
'The infrastructure at Dalian is good, with port facilities and an adequate
transportation network,' said Mr Satoshi Imai, a senior economist and China
specialist at the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro). 'We expect that
around 100 small and medium Japanese companies will locate in the industrial
complex.'
Another attraction of Dalian is that 'the Japanese have a certain
familiarity with the area,' explains Mr Imai in a subtle reference to Dalian
having been part of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in the 1930s and
1940s. Despite Japanese colonial occupation of Manchuria, 'the regional
authorities are now encouraging Japanese investment.'
Shanghai, meanwhile, has become the main base for Japanese trading houses
and is likely to be another key manufacturing site for Japanese companies.
Japan, however, has lagged behind other foreign countries in making direct
investments in the booming Guangdong region of southern China. 'Japanese
companies based in Hong Kong are primarily using Guangdong for
subcontracting work and it is difficult to evaluate the extent of Japanese
involvement in the province,' says Mr Imai.
Japan is also providing loans to develop China's natural resources. The
government has pledged a loan package of Y810bn to China for 1990-95. The
funds will be used to develop coal and oilfields as well as the building of
transport facilities, chemical fertiliser plants, and dams in which Japanese
construction companies will be involved.
This activity is taking place against the backdrop of growing trade between
Japan and China. Bilateral trade is expected to reach at least Dollars 25bn
this year, exceeding last year's record of Dollars 22.8bn.
Japanese exports to China, which amounted to Dollars 8.59bn last year and
mainly consisted of electronic goods, vehicles and machinery and equipment,
were boosted by China's easing of import restrictions following the growth
in its foreign exchange reserves and the resumption of foreign loans.
China enjoys a trade surplus with Japan, with exports reaching Dollars
14.2bn last year. They included supplies of coal, oil and food products. But
manufactured items accounted for 55 per cent of the Chinese exports and a
rising proportion of the textiles, metal goods and computer software being
shipped to Japan are made in factories with Japanese investment.
Obstacles remain, however, to the development of Sino-Japanese relations in
both the economic and political spheres.
Japanese companies complain about the poor state of China's transport
infrastructure, while the supply of electricity is unreliable. Laws and
regulations lack transparency and are changed frequently.
The chief source of concern among Japanese investors, however, remains the
political stability of the Chinese government. 'There are worries about what
will happen after the departure of Deng Xiao-ping,' says Mr Imai. But there
is also a growing acknowledgement that China may be becoming a more stable
place than the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
Government relations have been soured by several recent disputes. China has
criticised parliamentary approval of legislation allowing Japanese troops to
participate abroad in peace-keeping operations.
Japan has been irritated by renewed claims by China to the ownership of an
island group near Taiwan that Tokyo also claims. Oil deposits are believed
to lie in the surrounding seas.
But it is memories of Japan's aggression in China between 1931 and 1945 that
still cast the biggest shadow over good relations. The Japanese government,
for example, is reluctant to accept an invitation by Beijing for the Emperor
Akihito to visit China in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of restored
diplomatic relations.
Tokyo fears that the Chinese may demand an apology for the Japanese
occupation, although Beijing denies such intentions. However, China may
permit individuals to seek as much as Dollars 180bn in war reparations from
Japan, which has renewed suspicions among Japanese officials. 'The Chinese
are raising the issue of the Japanese role in the Second World War as a
bargaining chip to get more technology, investment and economic aid, which
they consider inadequate. An apology by the emperor would force us to make
new concessions,' said a Japanese government foreign policy adviser. 'Our
position is that China has problems absorbing the current level of
technology and investment that we provide.'
Despite these differences, Japan will probably work hard to strengthen its
relations with China during the next decade. The Asean countries are
becoming too costly as a production base, while the Soviet Far East is
regarded as a poor investment risk.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (11): Downturn begins to bite - The Labour
Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE day starts early in Tokyo's day labourer district. By dawn most of the
men, many of whom had slept outside in blankets and cardboard, hang around
the day labourer market - a block where the recruiters wait around with
their minivans.
However, times are hard for the labourers of the Sanya district in east
Tokyo. While the average Japanese office worker has yet to feel the direct
effects of the recent downturn in the economy, the labourers, usually
working on construction sites and small factories, are one of the first
groups to face the slump in the real estate market and decline in capital
investment by companies.
'It's a recession,' says one labourer waiting for the tehaishi, day job
recruiter, to pick him up. 'I'm lucky because I have connections. You can't
find jobs without connections these days,' he adds. He is one of 8,000
workers in the district, the second largest day labourer area following
Osaka's Nishinari district. The men sleep in the doya, cheap hotels and
apartments, or outside on the streets if they cannot afford Y1,000 for the
night.
At about 6.15 am those who have not been so lucky in finding work for the
day, head off to the employment centre, run by the municipal government, a
grey concrete building where day jobs are posted from 6.30 am.
Waiting for the shutter of the centre to open, the workers, mostly men in
their 50s, wait around with cigarettes in hand, and their belongings in
paper bags by their sides. 'I couldn't pay the rent for three months, so I
just ran away,' says one man to his friend. 'There are three good jobs in
Tokyo, and one in Sendai,' shouts another.
Once the shutter opens, the men crowd into the centre, which resembles an
empty parking lot. The workers look intently at the job offers posted on the
walls. However, the number is limited and only a handful of applicants are
accepted. The daily average number of jobs at the three employment centres
in Sanya fell 16 per cent in the last fiscal year to March, to 554.
For those who have given up looking for work, the day begins with glasses of
beer or sake at one of the many sake stands. Some stand around a meal van
eating curry with rice for Y120, a fraction of the price for a businessman's
meal in Tokyo.
The heady days of the late 1980s and the acute labour shortage created high
demand for the day labourers, increasing daily wages to as high as Y13,000
for clearing and digging land. The increase in pay gave rise to business
hotels where workers upgraded their boarding facilities from a badly lit
room with six bunks to fully air conditioned rooms with television sets,
costing as much as Y4,100 a night.
However, the lack of jobs has pulled down wages, and for an increasing
number of workers, even the cheaper hotels are too expensive. 'Of the 200
hotels for day workers, only 50 per cent of the rooms are being utilised,'
says Mr Kouichi Sato, manager at Jouhoku Welfare Centre, a government run
counselling and aid centre in the Sanya district.
By 8.00 am, the early morning buzz is over, and blue-suited office workers
start their journey to offices surrounding Sanya. The lives of the middle
class around the area, are rarely affected by the outcast day workers.
During the day, the Sanya area becomes quiet, with a few of those who could
not find work sleeping on the streets. Some of the labourers say they are
turned off by the poor terms of the recruiters who are often connected with
the yakuza, or gangsters.
'I'd rather be out on the streets than work for the yakuza,' says one worker
who chose to spend the day at the welfare centre. He complains that the an
increasing number of employers try to exploit the labourers by charging
unrealistic prices for meals, cigarettes, and tissue paper consumed during
the day. With such expenses deducted, 'by the end of the day, you end up
being paid around Y4,000 although the promised amount is over Y10,000,' he
adds.
Mr Sato at Jouhoku says the number of labourers asking for aid or
counselling has risen in the past year. 'The number rose over 3,000 last
January for the first time in eight years,' says Mr Sato. Last fiscal year
to March, the number of workers seeking help concerning food rose by 64 per
cent, while those in need for board rose by 30 per cent.
'You're drinking, aren't you,' says a welfare worker sternly to a
middle-aged straggly-haired man waiting for counselling. A high percentage
of the Sanya dwellers are alcoholics, and many are in poor health due to
malnutrition. 'Get your free health inspection,' urges a flier distributed
by the welfare centre, listing the symptoms of tuberculosis.
The demographic changes under way in Japan are apparent in Sanya. While most
of the men look older than they actual are, due to the harsh manual labour,
the average age of the labourers is rapidly rising. In Sanya, some 60 per
cent of the residents are over 50 years old, while the same age group
constitutes only 30 per cent of the whole of Tokyo.
Another problem for the labourers is the increase in foreign illegal
workers. Employers prefer to hire younger foreign labourers at cheaper
prices. Mr Sato was concerned over the increasing number of Japanese
labourers losing jobs to such foreigners. 'The rise in tensions could lead
to riots,' he adds.
By sunset, most of the workers are back from their jobs. After retrieving
their bags containing their belongings from the coin lockers, some head for
the public baths. By 9.00 pm, the streets are quiet again, as the labourers
of Sanya prepare themselves for another early morning ahead.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (10): Yamazaki's family affair - Machine
tool industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT is a characteristic of the machine tool industry that from the top of
the boom to the bottom of the slump the market can halve. We need to lower
the break-even point so that we can survive that,' says Mr Teruyuki
Yamazaki, one of the world's leading machine tool makers.
Sitting in his sumptuous office - paintings by Ingres, Delacroix and
Boucher, sculpture by Rodin, furniture old English - he scarcely looks hard
up. There is no question, though, that times are tough. His company,
Yamazaki Mazak, is running at 60 per cent capacity. 'But we're in profit
this month, anyway,' he says.
The present slump in machine tool orders is partly a function of over
investment by Japanese industry in the bubble years. In the two years
1987-89, according to the Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association, domestic
sales of machine tools virtually doubled. In the first four months of this
year, domestic orders are down by nearly half.
However, this is not without precedent. Mr Tsunehiko Yamazaki,
vice-president of the private family-owned business and Teruyuki's brother,
says: 'In the history of the industry, there have been plenty of examples of
famous manufacturers dating back to the Industrial Revolution going under.
The only way to avoid that is through continuous investment.'
Yamazaki is expanding capacity at its main plant, at Minokamo in southern
Japan. It has just opened its first Asian manufacturing operation, in
Singapore. In the past three years, capital expenditure has averaged Dollars
100m, or about 10 per cent of turnover. This year it will be about the same
'not because we wanted it, but because we were committed to it,' says
Teruyuki .
Yamazaki takes to the extreme the principle of automated manufacture. 'A job
which used to take 1,000 operatives can now be done with 10. We can generate
Dollars 10m of output with the same overheads as for Dollars 1m,' says
Teruyuki.
The physical process this involves is slightly spooky to watch. Machine
tools are, of course, machines for making machines. The Minokamo plant takes
this a step further. In essence, it is one large machine-making machine to
make machines.
At one end of the plant unmanned loaders, some 10 feet long and three feet
high, roam around the floor, playing tunes to warn any stray humans of their
approach. One rolls up to the warehouse counter, playing 'Annie Laurie,' and
deposits a couple of machined body parts.
Another robot, a spindly giant about 100 feet high, whisks the parts up and
stacks them under the roof. The loader picks up a pallet of small parts and
moves off again. One of its fellows waits courteously for it to pass. It
then moves off, tootling 'Fur Elise.' They will go on doing this all night.
In a culture which still does not permit lay-offs, this gives a useful
element of flexibility. 'When the plant is running below capacity, as now,
we can simply eliminate one of the unmanned night shifts. That's why we're
not losing money,' says Tsunehiko.
The process of automation, Teruyuki says, has further to go. 'The cost of
labour is rising and working hours in Japan are going to be reduced. So
whether we like it or not, the number of craftsmen is going to be reduced.
Even if the technology isn't cost-effective yet, it will be one day.'
It is often alleged that in terms of quality and precision, Japanese machine
tools still do not match the more expensive hand-built machines from Germany
and Switzerland.
Tsunehiko's response to the charge is aggressive: 'People sometimes say that
such a precise machine should be hand made. We don't deny that some parts
should be made by hand. But where unmanned operation is possible, a lot of
talk to the contrary is sour grapes. Perhaps some people without the
electronic knowledge are afraid to adapt it into their technology. We
aren't'
Yamazaki's other chief defence against the roller coaster nature of its
industry has always been its international diversity. Japan accounts for
only some 30 per cent of its sales, with 25 per cent coming from the US and
a further 25 per cent in Europe. It manufactures in the US and the UK.
Geographical spread is of limited use this time round. 'In the 30 years I've
been in this business,' says Tsunehiko, 'this is the first time I've seen
all the world economies going down together'.
Teruyuki qualifies this slightly. 'Although Japan and Europe are poor at
present, the US and Far East are not so bad. But that still means that two
out of our three main markets are down, which is a serious problem.'
The forward picture is still confused. 'In the past two months, there has
been a small improvement in order intake in the UK and the US which we
couldn't have expected four or five months ago. But in Germany and Japan,
orders are weak compared with what we expected six months ago.'
Does it help that Yamazaki has remained a private company? 'It has
advantages and disadvantages,' says Teruyuki. 'If we'd been listed when the
stock market was booming, we'd have had cheaper money. But the problem is
that all that cheap money was someone else's. Now it has to be paid back.'
There is a wider consideration. The machine tool industry's continuous
demand for investment means the return on equity is typically low - perhaps
lower than would be accepted by a public company. It is doubtless no
coincidence that many of Yamazaki's competitors elsewhere in the world are
private as well.
Teruyuki goes further: 'Making machine tools is a job which should be handed
down from generation to generation. Sometimes, a machine tool company is
sold to a conglomerate because the son is not interested and it fades away.'
Yamazaki was founded by Teruyuki's father in 1919. So will Teruyuki's son
succeed him? 'I believe so. He's already on the board.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (9): Product innovation is price of survival
 -Research and development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the air of gloom now fashionable in Japanese industry, the search
for new products still goes on. Nowhere is this more true than in the
electronics industry, where product innovation is the price of survival.
Severe though the latest downturn has been, it is not without precedent.
Matsushita, for instance, saw its profits drop 39 per cent last year. But in
the last two downturns, in the crisis years of 1975 and 1986, profits fell
by 40 per cent and 40 per cent respectively.
This year, like most Japanese manufacturers, Matsushita will be cutting its
capital expenditure heavily. But research and development spending will
actually rise slightly to Y430bn (Dollars 3.5bn).
In the field of consumer electronics, products in development by the
industry at large include wall-hanging flat screen TV sets, digital VCRs,
digital compact cassettes and - above all - high definition television, or
HDTV.
Mr Frank Ohgai, planning director of Matsushita's audio-visual division,
says: 'HDTV is the one key to growth in our business. By 1995-6, that's
going to be a very popular market. Then people are going to need everything
else to go with it - camcorders, VCRs and so on.'
The other key development, he says, is in the combination of audio-visual
and computer equipment for use in the home. 'But everyone is interested in
that: the computer people like IBM, Apple and Microsoft, video games
producers like Nintendo, movie software producers, educational publishers,
manufacturers like ourselves.
'So we're still in a period of transition. The big question is what format
will become the international standard and who will get there first.'
It is only fair to point out that not everyone in Japan shares Mr Ohgai's
confidence about the outlook for these products.
On the subject of HDTV, Mr Masanori Moritani, a specialist writer on
technology, is downright pessimistic:
'The question for HDTV is one of software - that is, the programmes people
actually watch. The popular TV programmes in Japan are quiz shows, chat
shows and programmes about eating out. What's the point of watching that
kind of thing on high definition?'
A more serious fundamental problem, he argues, lies in the size and cost -
about Dollars 10,000 - of the HDTV set itself. 'In the past, Japanese
companies have worked on miniaturisation.
'Whether that works for HDTV is an open question.
'Besides, earlier products like calculators or video recorders were
genuinely new. People bought the earlier versions regardless of expense, and
that helped to fund their development. But if you already have a TV, a VCR
and a camcorder, where's the incentive to buy new versions which are three
times as heavy and very much more expensive?'
Mr Moritani is equally pessimistic about developments involving home
computers. 'The trouble about home computers is that people don't know how
to use them. At present, PCs are used for enjoyment by enthusiasts. Will
housewives behave like computer freaks?
'If you can produce a computer on which you push two or three buttons and it
does something really interesting, that could be feasible. But what are the
interesting things a computer can do, and can we find them?'
Mr Ohgai of Matsushita does not deny that the technological risks are
enormous. His conclusion, though, is not that they should not be undertaken,
but that they need joint funding to spread the risk.
'To create these huge markets needs so much investment that individual
companies can't afford it. What is needed is international consortia, with
the manufacturers getting together to establish agreements on formats and
technical standards and to spread the investment risk.'
In these consortia, he believes, each geographical region should play to its
strengths.
'The hardware and software have to proceed in parallel. On into the 21st
century, the computer and entertainment will still be handled by the US. The
hardware will be in the hands of Japan or maybe other Asian countries, which
are catching up fast.
'As for Europe, we respect the fact that the basic R&amp;D and technology is
still in European hands. Japan's role here is its traditional one: to
popularise the product and make it at an acceptable price'.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (8): Dismal start to decade - Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the giants of Japanese industry, the 1990s have got off to a dismal
start. The most obvious problem is the bursting of the asset bubble, which
has caused severe damage to balance sheets and sharply raised the cost of
finance. But in more fundamental terms, it is striking how many of Japan's
key industrial sectors face quite specific difficulties of their own.
The effects of a falling stock market, while real enough, may with luck
prove temporary. Among the most publicised victims of the crash are
companies which took advantage of soaring share prices in the late 1980s to
raise cheap bond finance with stock warrants attached. Since the warrants
are now worthless, the bonds must be refinanced at very much higher rates of
interest - say, 6 per cent instead of 0.5 per cent.
Some estimates put the sums involved at Dollars 140bn over the next four
years, with the peak for refunding due next year.
Formidable though this sounds, there seems little doubt that it can be
afforded. First, as the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan argues, the money
repaid will go back to the bond market. It will then presumably be
reinvested in the new bonds which the companies issue to pay for the old.
In addition, says Mr Yasuo Kanzaki of Nikko Securities, Japanese companies
still carry huge amounts of cash on their balance sheets. 'A lot of
companies still remember the days of 20 years ago when it was hard to raise
money. So they still maintain unnecessary liquidity. That means they do not
have to make demands on the banking system'.
The problems of individual industries are another matter. Some of these may
prove merely cyclical. Others may have to do with basic changes in Japanese
patterns of work and consumption, which the bursting of the bubble has
served merely to accelerate.
In the traditional Japanese arena of consumer electronics, for instance, the
problem is one of a glut of old products and a shortage of new ones. Mr
Frank Ohgai, planning director of the audio-video business of the
electronics giant Matsushita, gives the background.
'In the audio-visual business, it usually takes ten years for a product to
get from introduction to maturity. The period 1945-55 brought the switch to
transistor radios. In 1955-65 it was black and white TV, then in 1965-75
colour TV, then in 1976 video cassette recorders came along. In 1985 it was
the turn of the compact disc. Now the audio-visual industry lacks a
locomotive'.
Mr Ohgai pins great faith on the success of high definition television to
take up the running in the mid-1990s. In addition, he is optimistic about
what are known in the industry as multi-media products, meaning home
computers combined with audio-visual equipment. But as Mr Ohgai concedes, if
these do not take off, the industry is in trouble.
According to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), if the
electronics industry were to carry on solely with its existing products, the
Japanese market would shrink by two thirds between now and the year 2000. As
it is, the EIAJ forecasts that the market of will grow 2 1/2 times by then,
which means it will have to consist almost wholly of products which do not
yet exist. It seems a tall order.
Similarly, the Japanese car industry is facing contraction in its domestic
market for the first time in its history. In the old days, it would have
responded by expanding its sales overseas. Now it faces two problems.
First, the sharp increase in trade friction in the past decade, particularly
acute in the US market, puts aggressive exporting out of the question.
Second, Japanese car manufacturers are now huge overseas producers
themselves. Honda, for example, makes more cars in the US than it does in
Japan.
For the Japanese construction industry, much hope is pinned on a surge in
infrastructure and housing spending in the 1990s. Certainly, it seems
plausible that in a country where only 44 per cent of houses are connected
with a main sewer, there should be a great deal of catching up to do.
But according to Mr Yoichi Uchida, senior economist with the Research
Institute of Construction and Economy, it is not that simple.
The 10-year programme concluded between Japan and the US under the
Structural Impediment Agreement promises spending of Y430,000bn (Dollars
3,500bn) on infrastructure between 1991 and 2001. But that, says Mr Uchida,
involves raising public investment by 6.3 per cent a year in real terms over
the 10 years. Official projections are for growth in the Japanese economy of
only 4.75 per cent over the period. In other words, public investment has to
increase as a proportion of economic activity.
But history, says Mr Uchida, points the other way. In the 1960s, public
investment rose much faster than GNP. In the 1970s, it grew at about the
same rate. In the 1980s it lagged behind. To reverse the trend would mean
either an increase in the burden of taxation or a rise in government
borrowing. The first is unpopular with the public, the second with the
government itself.
Behind all these individual problems are a group of familiar themes to do
with shifts in Japanese society and the increase in trade friction. Japanese
companies, it is now said, should pay more attention to generating return on
equity than to expanding market share. Working hours should be reduced. The
Japanese quality of life should be raised to reflect the country's standing
in the world.
Proclaiming the end of the Japanese industrial miracle has been fashionable
for years. Since the bursting of the asset bubble - surely a transitory
phenomenon - it has become more popular than ever.
Those who underestimate the fundamental strength of the Japanese industrial
machine do so at their peril. But there is no escaping the sense that the
machine is becoming more mature and less different from its western rivals
than it used to be.
The bubble may only have hastened the process of change. But one way or
another, large chunks of Japanese industry may never be the same again.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (7): Training needed with credit cards -
Debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN explaining the real or feigned credit inexperience of Japanese consumers,
a telephonist at a Tokyo debt collection agency told of the householder
apparently surprised to find that the goods she ordered and received from a
mail order house were not part of a free gift offer.
Having spent much of the 1980s convincing Japanese to increase their use of
consumer loans and credit cards, consumer credit companies and department
stores have realised that along with the cards should have come education
about how to use them.
Personal bankruptcies rose from 11,273 in 1990 to 23,287 last year,
prompting large Japanese companies, which have traditionally relied on
in-house collection departments, to turn to credit research agencies and
lawyers in an attempt to improve their debt recovery rates.
Mr Eiji Tamaki, chief executive of Consumer Credit Clearance (CCC), a credit
information and collection agency, has noticed the difference. His client
base has grown by more than 20 per cent over the past six months and he has
been surprised by the renown of some companies that have sought help.
'People need education about credit. They have been given credit but they
don't understand how to use it,' said Mr Tamaki, who expects that his
business will continue to grow rapidly over the next few months. 'This is
the winter after the bubble era.'
The image of the debt collector in Japan had been tainted by the popular
perception that only gangsters are in the business. But the success of Mr
Tamaki and of his Credit Assurance Co-operative (CAC), described as a
'voluntary membership union' to which companies subscribe, has made
collection more respectable.
As a voluntary membership union, CAC is able to send letters requesting that
consumers pay outstanding debts to member companies, whereas debt
collection, per se, is limited to Japanese lawyers. Fear of gang
loan-sharking inspired the restrictions, but the value of CCC and CAC is now
becoming painfully obvious to leading companies.
CAC can encourage consumers to pay their debts or risk a black-listing on
its credit files. The union will send a card politely requesting the payment
of a debt and follow up with a card that is still polite, but hints that the
black list awaits a defaulter. Meanwhile, the broader the client base of CCC
and CAC, the more effective a black-listing becomes.
Mr Tamaki is also prospering from the realisation that retailers and credit
companies need to be better informed about the credit background of
consumers and small companies. A credit industry survey of card penetration
earlier this year found that the average adult holds 1.54 cards, up 0.24
from two years ago, and companies have realised that some of these cards
should never have been issued.
One response has been for credit card companies to introduce tougher limits
for new card-holders and improve collection procedures. But, for some
bankrupts, the limits have come too late because they were able to
accumulate substantial debt from companies more keen on building a customer
base than on verifying credit worthiness.
A lawyer who specialises in debt collecting explained that an increasing
amount of consumer and small company debt is backed by property or security
assets greatly eroded by the collapse in the stock and property markets:
'The only thing that will save some people is a rekindling of asset price
inflation.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (6): Confidence crisis - The Financial
System
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER since it became clear that there was something desperately wrong with
the Japanese stock market, the world financial community has been anxiously
awaiting the fall-out.
The immediate fear was that the mighty Japanese financial institutions would
pull out of the international arena: in particular, that banks would
withdraw from overseas lending.
The problem was seen as a mechanical one: that as the Nikkei index fell, the
banks' capital bases would be eroded, causing them to cut back lending to
keep within internationally-agreed rules on the ratio of loans to bank
capital. That specific problem may have been exaggerated. However, the
broader question of the health of the Japanese financial system remains open
to anxious debate.
Mr Takasha Kiuchi, chief economist of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
points out that the banks' ability to lend depends not only on the level of
the equity market, which affects their asset base, but on the yen-dollar
rate, which affects the value of their dollar-based loans. On both counts,
he is fairly optimistic.
'We presently think the Nikkei index is below its normal range, which on
various measures should be between 18,000 and 20,000. If it gets back within
that range and the yen stays above Y130 to the dollar, the long-term credit
banks and city banks can probably expand their lending at a similar rate to
last year's 4 per cent. That didn't cause any strain, and this year we don't
expect a recovery strong enough to need more than that'.
Not everyone in Tokyo is so sanguine. Mr Peter Tasker, of the merchant bank
and stockbroker Kleinwort Benson, says: 'The problems of the banking system
are very serious'.
Suppose, to take an extreme case, the Nikkei index were to fall further to
10,000. 'The cost of that would be paid by the real economy for years to
come. The banks' hidden reserves would disappear, so they couldn't use them
to offset bad loans as they did in the past. So it would take many years to
absorb bad debts. That means raising banking spreads, which means slower
economic growth.
'The Japanese blue-chip industrials may have access to alternative funding
sources such as the Euromarkets. But the small- to medium-sized companies -
the heart of industrial Japan - rely wholly on the banks. In a worst case,
that could hold the economy back for six or eight years'.
As for the contraction in Japanese bank lending abroad, it has already
happened. Ms Alicia Ogawa, of S G Warburg in Tokyo, says: 'In the year to
March 1990, loan growth overseas by the Japanese banks was three times as
high as in the domestic market. By 1991 it was actually negative. In 1992 it
will be the same, and again in 1993. The banks got badly burnt in the UK and
have no interest in Europe. In the US, they're doing a lot of strategic
re-thinking. The only overseas markets they're still interested in are in
Asia, especially mainland China'.
In any case, Ms Ogawa says, generalisations about the health of the Japanese
banking system at present are largely meaningless. This is because nobody
knows the true scale of their bad debts.
'In most Japanese townships', Ms Ogawa says, 'depositors have only the
regional banks or the government savings bank to choose from. There has been
a lot of switching into the savings bank already. If the regional banks had
to announce bad debts equivalent to six or seven times their capital, the
exodus would reach tidal wave proportions'.
Bad debts, Ms Ogawa estimates, must amount to between 5 and 10 per cent of
the average bank's loan portfolio. In addition, she points out, some
Japanese companies do not have to disclose off-balance sheet loan guarantees
which they have made to their own subsidiaries. 'In some cases, that could
exceed the company's assets. So the banks don't always have a real idea of
their customers' collateral either'.
Even those who dispute the seriousness of the banks' position would concede
that the other pillars of the Japanese financial system, the insurance
companies, are changing their behaviour as a result of the bursting of the
bubble.
Mr Yasuo Kanzaki, deputy president of the Tokyo stockbrokers Nikko
Securities, says: 'In the past, the insurance companies weren't so concerned
about currency risks. They claimed to have plenty of hidden reserves, so
they could offset currency losses by realising unrealised capital gains.
'Now the stock market has collapsed, their currency risk is uncovered. A lot
of my friends in overseas portfolio management now say that if the yen goes
up any more, they're exposed. In the past, they could ask the domestic
portfolio managers in the same organisation to cover for them from their
profits. Now their domestic colleagues aren't so generous. And if the rising
trend in the Japanese trade surplus is a guide, the yen could still be
undervalued. So they're very nervous'.
Given the traditional role of the Japanese insurers in funding the US budget
deficit, this trend could eventually prove fairly serious. At the margin, it
could push up US long-term interest rates, further jeopardising US economic
recovery.
But in the end, the plight of the financial institutions in Japan belongs in
a wider context. As time goes by, it is becoming apparent that the true
effect of the bursting of Japan's asset bubble is to cause a crisis of
confidence in the wider economy. 'The body is sound', says Professor Makoto
Utsumi of the Ministry of Finance, 'but the brain is suffering from
neurosis. The result is a 'Don't take risks' syndrome which is very
serious'.
The problem thus goes beyond the availability of Japanese finance to service
a world economic recovery. Important though that issue is, the real question
is how far the Japanese economy will be able to act as an engine of growth
to pull its trading partners out of recession. If the neurosis proves as
serious as Professor Utsumi fears, the world may be disappointed.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (5): Sensitivity over surplus - Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the quest to prove that the Japanese market is open, the country's car
makers have been doing US producers the favour of sharing cherished showroom
space. And electronics companies are doing their bit for trade harmony, with
Matsushita Electric Industrial selling US-made hiking gear for the great
Japanese outdoors.
The mix of a soaring trade surplus and a US election campaign has made
Japanese companies all the more sensitive to political symbolism. And with
the European Community keen to convene negotiations to remove 'structural'
barriers to balanced trade, EC companies may be the beneficiaries of
Japanese corporate favours in coming months.
At the centre of this activity is the Japanese trade surplus, which is
likely to set a new record this year surpassing the Dollars 82.7bn of 1986.
The sheer size of the figure inspires trade friction, regardless of the
structural changes made by Japan over the past six years, and generally
regardless of the corporate favours.
Having watched the surplus fall in successive years to Dollars 52.1bn in
1990, the Japanese government was dismayed by the jump to Dollars 77.8bn
last year and is even more uncomfortable at the prospect of the surplus
topping Dollars 100bn in the current year. The resurgence has come with the
slowing of the economy, as demand has fallen for imports and Japanese
manufacturers, who over-invested in new capacity in the late 1980s, have
increased exports.
Given the embarrassing surplus, the government has good reason to maintain a
low profile this year, other than for the announcement of new trade favours
and promises to stimulate the domestic economy. However, the Japanese
government has been uncharacteristically aggressive in recent weeks and
caused confusion in Washington with the timing of its first report on unfair
trading policies.
The report, which found that the US had nine black marks out of a possible
10, was conceived when Japan's surplus was falling and was intended to show
that not only the EC and the US could find fault with trading partners.
While not providing for punitive action against violators, the report did
achieve its aim of 'stimulating discussion'.
US Congress representatives dismissed the report on the grounds that 'people
who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones', while even the Bush
Administration complained that Japan was 'not in a position' to criticise US
policy. However, at least a few officials in Tokyo were pleased that they
had created a small stir in Washington and given the impression that Japan
had become less passive.
Meanwhile, Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, dispatched letters to
the US and EC complaining that they had failed to honour deadlines for
reports under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Japan, one
of about 15 countries to meet deadlines for submissions on industrial
tariffs, presented a 450-page report, while the US furnished only a few
pages and said that reductions were still under consideration.
And the foreign ministry also sent a separate letter to the EC complaining
that a Commission review of bilateral relations was no more than a
collection of trade whinges and had ignored the potential for improved
political and cultural ties. Japanese officials were particularly annoyed
that the report bluntly suggested that the EC 'convince Japan' to cut the
trade surplus.
There is concern in Tokyo that the Commission will be tempted to use Japan
as an issue on which to unite EC sentiment. When Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, met Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, in early
July, EC irritation at Japan's Dollars 27bn surplus was made clear and it
was suggested that the two sides establish an 'experts forum' to study the
'structural' causes. The proposal echoes the Structural Impediments
Initiative (SII) launched by the US in which Japan promised to increase
infrastructure spending and to speed the approval of larger stores in an
attempt to change spending patterns and stimulate demand for imports.
If the trade surplus continues to increase, Washington will be under
pressure to concede that SII was of limited use and to devise another
initiative to redress the imbalance. But, by focusing on the raw figures,
Japan's trading partners are ignoring policy changes and overlooking the
competitiveness of Japanese products.
The first signs of recovery in the US were accompanied by an increase in
Japanese exports, essentially because US consumers and companies were
choosing to buy Japanese. And manufacturers of machine tools are able to
export excess domestic capacity to the EC and Asia because of the enduring
demand for quality production equipment.
That doesn't mean Japanese companies are completely free of blame. The
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) explains that some
companies which expanded capacity in the late 1980s got their numbers badly
wrong and are now being forced to export. And the ministry also concedes
that the financial 'bubble' of the late 1980s distorted the improvement in
the trade balance, having prompted an unsustainable increase in imports of
luxury goods, including European prestige cars.
But Japan has done much since the mid-1980s. The yen has appreciated
sharply, domestic demand was stimulated, markets were opened and import
promotion campaigns were christened. Yen appreciation was supposed to make
exporters less competitive, but companies adapted and have kept or expanded
market share in industries such as cars and machine tools.
At the same time, leading manufacturers have established factories in
south-east Asia and China dependent on high value-added components made in
Japan.
These factories have created demand for imports from Japan and are exporting
competitively-priced Japanese-branded goods to western markets. In the
longer term, Japan will face political pressure not only from the EC and US,
but also from the Asian countries which have recently surpassed the US and
Canada as its largest regional market.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (4): Appetites dampened - End of the
consumer boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<TEXT>
ANOTHER WORLD is the name of the foreign luxury goods section at the main
Tokyo branch of Mitsukoshi, the prestigious Japanese department store.
It served as a thriving bazaar for the 'Heisei aristocrats,' those who made
their fortunes from rising stock and land prices in the late 1980s and who
took their title from the new emperor's reign that began in 1989.
But foreign luxury goods manufacturers and Japanese retailers are now
confronting another world from the one two years ago when conspicuous
consumption was in vogue and expensive imported items were eagerly bought.
The bursting of Japan's bubble economy has dampened the appetite among
consumers for French jewellery, German sedans or Italian suits.
The declining interest in branded products has hurt European makers of
luxury goods particularly hard because they were the main beneficiaries of
the spending boom. Ms Mami Toyonaga, an analyst with the Japan External
Trade Organisation (Jetro), said: '1989 and 1990 were the years of the EC
brandname.'
Imports of European luxury goods have dropped sharply since then and were
largely responsible for the 9.2 per cent decline last year in EC exports to
Japan of Dollars 31.8bn, according to Jetro.
Works of art and antiques from France, which accounted for half of the art
objects shipped from abroad to Japan, fell by 80.9 per cent to Dollars 539m.
Imports of jewellery from the EC slipped by 14.1 per cent to Dollars 374m,
while diamonds and other precious stones from Belgium and the Netherlands
declined by 11.2 per cent to Dollars 608m.
Imports of luxury cars from the EC fell by 16.1 per cent to Dollars 1.75bn,
while European clothes suffered a drop of 11.2 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn.
EC furniture declined by 8.9 per cent to Dollars 318m while handbags and
luggage dipped by 2.5 per cent to Dollars 714m. This trend has continued for
the first four months of 1992, with only European executive cars making a
slight recovery; imports growing by 9.6 per cent.
It is not only European luxury goods producers who have been affected by the
passing of the brandname fad. Japanese department stores that heavily
promoted imported products suffered profit falls last year. Mitsukoshi
blamed the decline in art and luxury purchases for its 43 per cent drop in
pre-tax earnings to Y10.9bn for fiscal 1991, a result that forced it to
delay plans to expand its store network.
Mitsukoshi now has a large inventory of Impressionist paintings and other
European art that it bought at the height of a market that was mainly driven
upward by Japanese investment. The value of Mitsukoshi's collection has
subsequently fallen and it is waiting for a recovery in prices, which could
take several years, before offering it to the public.
It is one indication that Japanese consumers have become price-conscious.
European luxury goods companies in Japan realise that they can no longer
sell their products on snob appeal. A high price tag was once considered an
advantage in attracting Japanese consumers who wanted to impress neighbours
with their wealth.
European luxury goods makers have now changed their marketing strategy by
promoting the brand name as a guarantee of good quality and design rather
than as a status symbol. They are also cutting their prices or introducing
lower-cost products.
'Although the Japanese consumer used to purchase the brand rather than the
product, quality has become the most important consideration and the
competitiveness of price is another key factor,' says Mr Guy Leymarie,
president of Cartier Japan. 'It proves that Japanese consumers have rapidly
matured in their buying habits.
'Sales of big-ticket imported items have fallen, but there is a rise in
sales of imported goods at the lower price end of their respective product
segments. Japanese still want brand name products, but at a cheaper price,'
explains Mr Yoichi Kimura, a Jetro researcher who has helped compile a study
on popular imported products.
Prices for some foreign jewellery brands at Mitsukoshi, for example, have
been reduced by 10 per cent, which has improved sales of jewellery costing
less than Y1m.
The promotion of less expensive car models, rather than price cuts, has
resulted in BMW of Germany and Volvo of Sweden suffering smaller sales
declines than other European car makers in Japan. BMW is concentrating on
marketing its entry-level 300 series, while offering low-interest vehicle
loans. Volvo is introducing its 850 GLT model, which is Y1.5m less than the
top-of-the-line 960 model. 'We have to adjust to the new price situation,'
said Mr Hans-Olov Olsson, president of Volvo Cars Japan.
More attention is also being paid to regions outside Tokyo, which was the
centre of the imported goods boom. 'Although Tokyo has only 20 per cent of
the population, it accounts for 40 per cent of the luxury goods sold. But we
see growth potential in other areas,' explains Mr Osamu Tanegashima,
director of operations of BMW Japan. Sales of BMW sedans are on the rise in
Osaka and Nagoya, although they remain depressed in Tokyo.
Louis Vuitton is also concentrating on a regional marketing strategy instead
of cutting prices to improve sales. Indeed, the company took the risky step
last year of raising prices by 5 per cent. Although sales consequently fell
by 10 per cent to Y39bn in 1991 and are expected to decline by 5 per cent
this year, company officials defend the decision.
The company wants to maintain the high profit margins that exist in the
Japanese market, which accounts for almost 30 per cent of Louis Vuitton's
total sales. Prices for Louis Vuitton products in Japan are 45 per cent
higher than in France. Officials also worry that price reductions would harm
its brand image. Louis Vuitton hopes that the opening of new outlets in
Kyushu and western Honshu will curb the sales decline next year and set the
stage for a recovery.
Other European luxury goods companies are also focusing on the top end of
the market. 'Sales of products in the middle price range have gone down, but
sales are growing in the upper and lower ends of our product segment. This
means that our sales will stabilise in 1992 after doubling between 1988 and
1991,' says Mr Leymarie. 'There are still enough clients who have the money
to buy our best jewellery in the knowledge they are making a sound
investment.'
Mr Didier Handache gives a Gallic shrug at the mention of Japan's economic
troubles. The importer of the French Venturi sports car says the country's
financial woes are having little impact on sales of the expensive vehicles,
which cost between Y12m and Y16m.
He predicts instead that sales will triple to 40 cars this year. There are
plans to open a showroom soon in downtown Tokyo, which will display a new
model priced at Y20m.
'We are aiming for the absolute top of the pyramid; people who are immune to
the bubble economy,' says Mr Handache, who counts among his customers
baseball players and actresses. 'There are always people who can afford such
luxuries.'

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (3): A Japanese-style recession - The
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORDS such as 'disaster' and 'horror' are increasingly entering the
vocabulary of economists describing Japan. As each month's statistics are
released by the government, economists search for a sign that the economy,
rapidly plunging, is about to hit bottom.
Instead, and despite repeated government assurances to the contrary, the
accumulated evidence points towards an extended period of weak demand,
falling production and dismal corporate profits. The turning point towards
renewed growth is increasingly elusive.
Of course, this is still a Japanese-style recession that is unlikely to meet
the standard economist's definition of two quarters consecutive decline.
Economic growth this year is likely to reach at least 2 per cent, and
employment remains at high levels. But the manufacturing sector is in steep
decline, financial markets are devastated, and the contraction of demand has
stemmed the flow of imports, pushing up Japan's already large trade surplus
and angering its trading partners.
The latest 'horror' came at the end of June, when the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (Miti) reported a decline of 8.7 per cent
in industrial output during May, compared to a year ago.
A sharp drop in industrial output was by itself expected, and in principle
it was a healthy sign because it showed that manufacturers were making
efforts to cut back high levels of unsold goods in inventory by reducing the
flow from the factory.
Yet in this case, although in May there was the steepest year-to-year fall
in manufacturing since 1975, bloated inventories also edged up by a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent - because the flow of goods out of
inventory to the market also slowed as demand contracted.
The Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance officially expect the period
of inventory adjustment - when inventories decline to normal levels that
allow manufacturers to restore production cuts - to last until the autumn.
Salomon Brothers Asia, however, now believes the turning point is unlikely
to come before the spring of 1993.
To bring inventory levels back to historical trends by November,
manufacturers would have to cut output by 1 per cent a month, which Salomon
Brothers believes is unrealistically severe.
The government case for optimism is based in part on the most recent Tankan,
or short-term economic survey. The survey uncovered an unexpectedly sharp
decline in business confidence in May, which hit the lowest level in five
years. But the survey also showed that manufacturers were expecting a modest
improvement in business conditions by September.
Corporate profits were expected to grow in the second half of the fiscal
year by 17 per cent, after declining by 22.5 per cent in the first half. The
government interpreted the Tankan to mean that the economy had hit bottom.
Financial markets plunged after the survey was released, but not so much
because of the Tankan itself. It was, instead, the government's optimism -
which appeared to dampen prospects either for an emergency government
spending package or a cut in interest rates - that sent markets reeling.
The government's relative lack of alarm is easy to understand. Hardly anyone
these days expects the government's growth forecast of 3.5 per cent in the
year to next March to be realised. But the expected 2 per cent or better
would be considered respectable anywhere else in the industrialised world.
The government can additionally comfort itself that unemployment is
negligible, at 2.1 per cent, compared to an average of 6.4 per cent in the
seven largest industrialised economies. The labour market is softening and
overtime and bonus awards are being cut, but the direct human cost of the
slowdown is small.
The government is also deeply fearful about rekindling inflation. With
Japan's consumer prices now increasing at about 2.5 per cent annually, this
fear looks ill-founded. But what haunts both the Ministry of Finance and the
Bank of Japan is the underlying tightness in the labour market, where a
structural shortage of manpower results from Japan's declining birth rate.
Indeed, the frequently proposed solution for the economy - to spend money on
public works - would pour money into the construction industry where the
labour shortage is most keenly felt. The government could easily re-ignite
wage inflation with an overly hasty attempt to jump-start the economy.
In the end, though, the government is certain to act, if only because Japan
has come under intense international pressure to increase domestic demand,
boost imports and help to pull the rest of the world out of the economic
slump. Already, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed a programme
of public works that would result in some Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn of extra
spending. A decision will come in the autumn.
The rapid growth in the economy in the late 1980s, accompanied by easy money
policies, temporarily put off the day when companies would have to face the
fact that Japan is becoming less accommodating to manufacturing industries.
Now, with labour both in short supply and expensive, land prices sky high,
roads choked with traffic, and the cost of capital having risen sharply,
this fact is inescapable.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (2): Reform will be difficult - Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER months in the political doldrums, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese
prime minister, is enjoying something of a revival.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will fare much better than it
feared in the forthcoming elections to the Diet's upper house, to be held on
July 26.
However, the recovery in the prime minister's fortunes will do little to
improve his capacity to govern. The LDP is steadily losing control of the
Diet, making it increasingly difficult to secure the passage of anything
except routine legislation. This month's poll will probably make it even
more difficult than before to solve the party's more serious challenges -
including electoral reform, possible revisions to tax laws and international
demands for an end to the ban on rice imports.
Only a few months ago, LDP officials considered ditching Mr Miyazawa. The
government had suffered badly from the prime minister's handling of two
nasty political scandals involving allegations of bribe-taking, from the
economic downturn, and from the arguments over the controversial bill to
allow Japanese troops to serve on United Nations missions. Mr Miyazawa's
fortunes hit rock-bottom when the LDP lost a by-election in Nara - an
ancient capital of Japan, and a traditional LDP stronghold.
But the prime minister's stock has since staged an unexpected recovery. This
is partly caused by a lull in the two political scandals which grabbed so
much space in newspapers earlier this year.
Interest in the affair concerning Kyowa, a steelframe maker turned property
developer, has largely died away, following the arrest of a former cabinet
minister who now faces trial on bribe-taking charges. The public
prosecutor's office is still investigating a much larger scandal involving
Sagawa Kyubin, a truck delivery company, and its links with gangsters and
politicians. But leaks from the prosecutor's office have become scarce in
recent weeks. Whether the probe has come to an end, or whether the
prosecutors are merely maintaining a discreet silence until after the
election, remains to be seen.
The prime minister has also benefited politically from the passage of the
peace-keeping forces legislation, which completed its tortuous way through
the Diet in early June, amid stormy scenes inside the chamber and
demonstrations in the street outside. According to opinion polls, people
remain deeply divided over the bill; its opponents are concerned about a
possible revival in Japanese militarism. But LDP officials are relieved that
the inter-party arguments over the bill are finished at last. Moreover, the
opposition parties' filibustering tactics, including the 'ox-walk'
slow-voting technique, won credit from no-one.
Even the decline in the stock market and the economy seems, paradoxically,
to have bolstered support for the LDP and the government. In the initial
stages of turmoil in the financial markets, voters were happy to criticise
the government, particularly the finance ministry. However, as the economy
has deteriorated further, so alarm about the country's future has spread
throughout Japan. As in previous economic crises, there is a growing feeling
that the Japanese must pull together - a sentiment which has rallied support
for the ruling party, just in time for the upper house elections.
Polls will be held in half the seats in the 252-member chamber. Elections
are held every three years - with members sitting for six years, so the
seats now being contested were last fought over in 1986, when the LDP won a
resounding victory on the back of the personal popularity of Mr Yasuhiro
Nakasone, the then prime minister. The party therefore expects to lose seats
this time: the question is how many.
It is defending 75 out of 127 seats being contested. LDP officials believe
they might lose about 10. Independent analysts think it could be as many as
15.
But even the loss of these few seats could be crucial in future national
politics. This is because the LDP lost its majority in the upper house in
1989, when voters registered their anger at the party's involvement in the
Recruit affair. Since then, the ruling party has relied in the upper house
on the support of the main centrist party: Komeito. For example, without
Komeito's 20 votes in the upper house, the LDP would have failed in its
attempt to pass the peace-keeping bill.
Thus, although the LDP has kept its majority in the lower house, despite all
the trials of the Recruit affair and other scandals, its ability to pass
legislation is now severely limited.
The LDP and Komeito together hold 134 seats out of 252: a bare majority. If
the LDP loses 10 seats this majority is forfeited (even if Komeito loses no
seats, which seems unlikely). So the LDP will be forced to rely on making
deals with other centrist parties, including the Democratic Socialist Party.
The LDP and DSP have worked together before. But the LDP's inter-party clout
will decline in proportion to the seats it loses.
LDP officials are concerned about the erosion of their control of the Diet.
They point out that Japanese parliamentary practice has long included close
consultation with opposition parties. So a smaller representation in the
upper house may make little difference.
This is all true. But during its three decades in office, the party has
rarely been forced to make difficult decisions about changing the law. Japan
has largely been governed by bureaucrats acting within the framework of
existing laws. The challenges of the 1990s are different; parts of the
post-war legal framework are now in urgent need of reform. For example,
Japan is under pressure from trading partners to open the rice market, which
is protected by food security laws. The tax system places a heavy burden on
wage-earners, while giving numerous breaks to the self-employed. Land use
laws still favour farmers over townspeople. So do electoral regulations
which give people living in rural constituencies a disproportionately big
voice in the Diet.
Leading LDP officials are aware of these problems. But it is difficult for
them to reform a system which they helped to create, and which helps to keep
them in power.

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (1): Doubts and confusion - Japan is gripped
by serious doubts over its economy and confused and uncertain about its role
in the world. But even in bad times the Japanese economy still continues to
out-perform those of the US and Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR KIICHI MIYAZAWA, Japan's prime minister, played his part well at last
week's Munich summit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries. With
his quick mind and fluent command of English, he did his country proud.
But behind Mr Miyazawa's polished performance is a country gripped by
serious doubts over its economy, and confused and uncertain about its role
in the world. These concerns are coming to the fore in the campaigns now
under way for national elections to be held on July 26 for seats in the
Diet's upper house.
Many Japanese fear that the recent collapse of land and stock prices could
herald a long slowdown for the whole economy. The worldwide economic
downturn has come late to Japan but in the past year it has arrived with a
vengeance. Economic growth, which remained at a healthy 3.5 per cent in the
year to March 1992, could fall to below 3 per cent in the current financial
year ending in March 1993.
The effects of this slowdown are rippling around the world. Economic growth
has declined, but so, too, has the growth which was previously taking place
in imports. As a result Japan's trade surplus has surged from Dollars 52bn
in 1990 to a likely Dollars 100bn plus in 1992.
Meanwhile, the turmoil in Tokyo's financial market has undercut Japanese
investors' capacity to invest overseas - after exporting record amounts of
capital in the 1980s, Japan last year became a net capital importer.
The government is considering economy-boosting measures, including extra
public spending of about Y6,000bn. But there are doubts in Tokyo about
whether this will prove sufficient. There are fears that - as well as a
severe short-term cyclical down-swing in demand - the economy faces
unsettling long-term structural changes. As Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a leading
member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and possible future prime
minister, said recently: 'I see the Japanese economy facing quite a serious
structural recession. In many ways we have enjoyed very good economic
conditions in the past. But it is impossible to continue behaving in the
same way in the future.'
The mood in Tokyo is so grim that Japan's strengths are being forgotten. The
truth is that in bad times as in good, the Japanese economy continues to
out-perform the US and Europe.
Companies in key industries, including steel, machine tools, motors and
electronics, are under pressure. But their foreign competitors are also
suffering. Even in a slowdown, Japanese companies are loath to cut research
and development spending or capital investment. They do not sack their
employees, except as a last resort. While demand for recruits has eased in
the past year, vacancies still outnumber job-seekers by about 20 per cent.
Nevertheless, companies face some difficult challenges. They must adjust to
the fact that the high-speed growth of the 1980s was, in retrospect,
something of an aberration. The outlook is for slow growth, in which costs
will be restrained and expansion plans considered for their contribution to
profits as well as to sales. Capital costs have soared due to the difficulty
of raising stock market funds. Banks, burdened by bad debts, will find it
harder to lend than in the past, thus creating a potential shortage of
credit.
On the demand side, companies cannot look to exports for salvation because
of rising protectionist sentiment in the main export markets of the US and
Europe. At home, Japanese consumers could eventually generate a huge surge
in demand - if they were allowed to spend as freely as westerners.
Unfortunately, the job of liberalising Japan's tightly-regulated post-Second
World War economy is not yet finished. The rules still favour producers at
the expense of consumers. For example, food prices are kept artificially
high to protect farmers. As a result, Japanese must spend more than 30 per
cent of their disposable income on food compared with about 20 per cent for
Americans and Germans. So the Japanese have less available for other goods
and services.
Mr Miyazawa's government recently published a five-year plan which puts a
priority on improving the consumers' lot. There is no doubt about the
sincerity of Mr Miyazawa's intentions. But his scope for action is limited
by his lack of political clout inside the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Also, the authority of the party itself has been undermined by financial
scandals and by a constant need to do deals with opposition parties to
secure the passage of legislation.
After nearly 40 years in office, the Liberal Democratic party's ageing
leaders see little need to take risks. They are not willing to ride
rough-shod over the interests of their supporters who are often, like
farmers, prime beneficiaries of the economic status quo.
As Mr Ozawa said in a recent press conference: 'Japanese people. . . have
not really got out of their old ways of living and thinking. Change will
require a great deal of effort.'
The LDP has good reason to be cautious. It has presided over nearly 40 years
of prosperity. Japanese people in opinion polls express complaints about
their living standards, especially about housing costs, but are generally
satisfied with the country's economic management. Nevertheless, if the
current slowdown were to turn into a prolonged full-blown recession,
accompanied by bankruptcies, sackings and a decline in real income, the
pressure for action might become intense.
If Japanese are more concerned about their economy than at any time since
the oil shocks of the 1970s, they are also more worried than in the past
about their country's political role in the world.
Japan has responded to international demands for it to play a more active
part in global affairs by passing a bill which will allow Japanese troops to
serve on United Nations peace-keeping missions. Tokyo was stung into action
by criticism of its role in the Gulf crisis when it contributed money to the
allied cause but no manpower.
However, the peace-keeping bill has left Japan divided between those who
believe an economic superpower should share the burden of policing the world
and those who fear such involvement could lead to a revival of Japanese
militarism. The government, despite its internationalist intentions, will be
obliged to tread carefully for fear of inflaming domestic opposition.
Meanwhile, the end of the Cold War could lead to changes in east Asian
international relations. The cornerstone of Japan's policies remains close
friendship with the US, including a security alliance. Both partners remain
committed to each other and indeed are held together by a common interest
in, among other things, the stability of the region.
But this interest differs in subtle ways. For example, Japan has been
noticeably more friendly than the US towards China since the suppression of
demonstrations in Beijing in 1989. Tokyo is considering an invitation from
Beijing for Emperor Akihito to visit China this autumn.
Japan's policies are also coloured by its dispute with Russia over
territories seized by Soviet troops in 1945. Japan insists that it cannot
extend large-scale financial support to the states of the former Soviet
Union until its claims are recognised.
While Tokyo has fudged this condition in recent years - by granting
increasingly large quantities of humanitarian aid - it remains reluctant to
participate in the grand plans for economic assistance being formulated in
the US and Europe.
But Japan's willingness to become more independent of the US in its foreign
policies is strictly limited. As the debate over the peace-keeping bill
showed, Tokyo's priority is to grow in its role as a fully-fledged member of
the international community. And that community, for the foreseeable future,
is US-led.

TODAY and tomorrow is the grand finale of the Hampton Court Flower Show.
Exhibitors have continued to multiply in ever more marquees and the occasion
has the same strength as last year's show, its coming of age.
Do not expect a second Chelsea: none of the exhibits aims or arrives at
quite the same magnificence. The great distinction of this show is that it
gives you a better chance to view and shop on the spot.
Dozens of smaller exhibitors who do not come to Chelsea bring their stock
for display and disposal. Shopping is continuous and, once again, I have
returned with plastic bags filled with plants which I could not bear to
miss, although I did not set out wanting them in the first place.
Peach-coloured Alonsoa and the pale yellow variety of Potentilla Recta are
not options which float into the grasp of keen plant finders every day of
the week.
There is one fact which may make you hesitate before setting out to join the
fray: last year, 458,000 people descended on the site.
When the public is swarming, it is hard to remain consistent: last year, I
tried to arrive by car, warned you strongly against the inevitable jams but
ended by buying so much that I also advised you to pack it all into the car
boot.
This year, the jams have arguably been worse. The occasion, however, has a
major sponsor: BR's Network South East. Its friendly spokesperson encouraged
me to use the sponsor's facilities and enjoy the preview on Wednesday on a
direct line from Waterloo. 'Frankly,' she confided, 'we see this occasion as
something of a PR Showcase.'
The thousands who have already been trapped this year in BR Showcases would
probably have known better. On the spokesperson's advice, I opted for the
'easy 10-minute hop' from Clapham Junction down to Waterloo.
For unexplained reasons, the connecting link to the showcase ground to a
halt just outside walking distance to Waterloo, sat for 35 minutes and
missed the Sponsor's Special Press Show Train, scheduled for 10.34.
It was hard to be entirely certain at first that the connecting link was as
late as it seemed because the big clocks at Waterloo had stopped for the
morning. Something, it emerged, must have forewarned them.
A heart attack down the line at Malvern was reported to have delayed the
Special Press Train by nearly 10 minutes, but not for long enough to sit all
the Press into the Showcase.
Latecomers, therefore, were advised to catch the 10.54 to Hampton Court,
which turned out to be even more difficult because the only 10.54 was a
Silver City Special Departure which left superbly on time, refusing to
accept any fee-paying passengers.
Back on Platform 4, the BR staff awaiting the ordinary gardener's 10.54 were
surprised to find a 10.45 to Guildford which was not going anywhere. On
questioning, they remarked that the root of the trouble was Rain On The
Points (the ROP hazard).
By now, several hundred garden visitors had also joined the clamour for the
Showcase with a feeling that they were being ROP'ed off.
Loudspeaker announcements at Waterloo are not intelligible to passengers who
cannot decode echoes, but we were asured that problems with points and
signals were making delays inevitable.
It could happen to any of us, but it had not happened to the Special Press
Train or the Silver City Special which had both left on time for exactly our
destination.
Remarkable aggression now seethed among my fellow Showcases, most of whom
had paid a cool Pounds 18 for their show ticket and a price ranging from
Pounds 3.20 for the remaining part of BR's journey.
After 45 minutes the Showcase arrived, sat around and eventually crept
forward. Almost everyone on it was bound for Hampton Court, as promised, but
the itinerary involved stops at each intervening station. It was
understandable, but not well-advised, that the first announcement to the
passengers on board was a routine call to ensure we were on the right train.
The second, shortly afterwards, was even less fortunate. On the left hand
side, we were told, we could now see BR's engineers working hard to put
right the trouble with points and signalling which had delayed anyone who
was not travelling on an important freebie.
At about 30 mph, coachloads of jeering gardeners enjoyed a long hard look at
one BR workperson in an orange, fluorescent anorak who was scraping at the
loose shingle on a nearby line. Soapwort on the sleepers, I suppose, said
one of my neighbours.
After 12.30, we were finally put down with two alternatives: a long walk to
the show entrance, or a further long queue for a 70p boat ride to the
entrance. I chose the boat ride, reflecting that those who non-journalists
were paying, on Wednesday, Pounds 18 for the ticket, at least Pounds 3.20
for the train and Pounds 1.40 for the boat.
I must emphasise that the special quality of Hampton Court Show is the
volume of good plants, pots and extras on sale from tradesmen who are being
charged next to nothing to display it and are hoping for us to buy them out.
I did just feel that an arrival fee of Pounds 15-Pounds 22 is a bit steep
for entry to a glorified garden trade fair.
What about the Citizen's Charter as a refuge for gardeners who want to let
off lost steam? We asked for forms at Hampton Court but the friendly
ticketperson was not at all sure he had any. Charter Refunds seem to apply
to season tickets and big block buyers, not to gardeners with a Showcase
Single.
At best, they may hope for a 20 per cent refund in a voucher for another
journey on the same network. None of my many interviewees was willing to
volunteer for the risk of such a refund and the risk of use of Charter
Credit.
John Nelson, managing director of Network South East, asked all members of
the press to 'remember if you come by train you avoid the stresses of
driving and the difficulties of trying to park the car.'
How true, how very true, but as I prepared for the Showtrip home, a certain
darkness of mood did descend as yet more rain fell on points and the joy
went out of the last 30 minutes among lovely Princess Alstoemias and the
rare plants on sale from Green Farm Nursery.
Next year, I suggest that show sponsorship is handed to a privatised network
of individual power boat drivers who can deliver passengers direct to
Hampton Court jetty.
Otherwise, I will devise my own timetable and travel the last two miles on
my reliable horse. After all, it costs nothing to exhibit inside the tent. I
could set up a stall selling animal manure.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Food: A gastronomic tour of Yorkshire - Nicholas Lander
enjoys beautiful countryside and genuinely good food in the north of England

NEITHER Yorkshire nor its inhabitants have ever taken kindly to outside
influences but, in a world where regional differences are disappearing, this
may prove an advantage.
Certainly anyone, let alone a Lancastrian such as myself, could be forgiven
for thinking that the gastronomic changes sweeping through England would be
rebuffed at Yorkshire's borders.
Far from it. Instead, committed individuals at various isolated outposts
throughout Yorkshire - George Pagendham at the Black Bull, Moulton
(0325-377289), Michael Gill at Pool Court ((0532-842288) and the Wynnes at
Epworth Tap (0427-873333) - will revive the most discerning of travellers.
The attractions of a Yorkshire gastronomic tour lie not just in the
immediate pleasure but in the longer-lasting and, perhaps more incongruous,
memories.
We arrived at Winteringham Fields to find an hotel that could sit easily in
France or Switzerland.
This is not surprising since it is owned by Swiss chef Germain Schwab, and
his Grimsby-born wife Annie. Romantic encounters in the restaurant business
are never ordinary but theirs, at a mountain-top restaurant in Zermatt where
he was the cook and she the manageress, must be one of the more unusual.
Trained in Switzerland, Schwab worked in France, Italy, Germany and London
before they started their first restaurant together on a small farm outside
York. With Pounds 200,000 they turned a derelict building into a thriving
business.
Schwab stressed just how cooperative the village had been in helping him
establish his restaurant and build extra rooms. And, of course, his hotel
has brought considerable benefits to the village. Meat is bought from the
local butcher and during the summer he obtains fruit and vegetables from
villagers.
The Schwabs have also put Winteringham on the map in a way that the absence
of local signposts seems determined to prevent. The motorway brings loyal
customers from Leeds and Harrogate, and there is a steady stream of
tourists, German, Dutch and French, en route from London to Scotland.
The cooking reflects Schwab's upbringing and travels. There were excellent
breads at both dinner and breakfast and a variety of home-made jams. One
amuse-gueule of thin slices of pork cheek and black pudding with an apple
compote seemed designed to please equally the natives of Yorkshire and
Bavaria. There is also an emphasis on sophisticated desserts, always
appreciated in the north of England.
Dinner included two exciting dishes: a surprisingly successful first course
of Savoy cabbage stuffed with slices of monkfish and foie gras, followed by
a casserole of goat with a roast pear. Amid the flat, charming, quiet
countryside, he is perfecting what he has learnt and working uninterrupted
on his own ideas.
Isolation is not a feeling you will experience if you eat or stay with the
McCoys at the Tontine in North Yorkshire. The house was built as a coaching
inn. Today, the busy A19 supplies constant traffic along one side of the
property and the talents of the three McCoy brothers, Tom, Peter and Eugene,
bring human traffic through the front door.
The brothers provide the complete management structure. Tom cooks for the
restaurant, Peter looks after front of house, breakfast and desserts and
Eugene takes care of the bistro and the wines.
Now established as one of the most enjoyable and idiosyncratic places to eat
in the North East, McCoy's also reflects the vast improvement in eating out
in this country over the last 20 years.
The bothers reckon that because the hotel is open every night of the week
and the bistro for every lunch and dinner it has to be pleasurable for them
as well as for their customers.
Hence a most comfortable hotel lounge with the most successful collection of
old armchairs and sofas; large parasols over some of the dining tables, a
wittily written and well-chosen wine list and a loyal band of very friendly
staff.
The cooking in the restaurant is not cheap - first courses cost Pounds 9 to
Pounds 10, main courses Pounds 15. Neither is it simple - try a Bresse
pigeon with cream, leeks, truffle, foie gras and port glaze - but it is
generous. It is the bistro downstairs, however, which would make most London
restaurateurs envious.
The bistro was originally the hotel bar and doing little business.
The McCoys have changed that. There are no tablecloths, the napkins are
paper, menus are written on blackboards, there is no air-conditioning and it
is packed. There were 120 customers in and out on the night I visited eating
anything from huge bowls of mussels, queen scallops and garlic butter,
sausage, Yorkshire pudding and onion gravy and huge steaks and Dover soles.
Desserts included sticky toffee pudding and banana McTophie.
A blackboard, the same standard of enthusiastic, polite and helpful staff
and the same county are all that links the Tontine with The Sportsman's Arms
at Wath in Nidderdale.
Head for Pateley Bridge near Harrogate and follow the signs for Wath. As the
valley closes in the countryside becomes more inviting. After two miles
there is a small car park signposted on the right. Use it and walk across
the bridge over the River Nidd, which supplies trout for the pub's kitchen,
and up to an imposing pub.
The bar menu has almost everything you could ask for before or after a walk
on the moors. Bowls of homemade soup and crusty bread, huge servings of
ploughman's lunch, and rolls stuffed with smoked salmon and other fillings.
For those who prefer to look at the moors rather than walk them there was
dressed crab and a number of hot fish dishes on my visit. Lest you forget
that it is a pub the draught beer is good too.
After lunch we did go for a walk. On the way back we sat on the swings in a
field opposite the pub, looked at the countryside around and wondered why we
were rushing back.
