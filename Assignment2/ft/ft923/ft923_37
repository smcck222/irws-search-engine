FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pitfalls of property letting - Tax
problems for landlords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION is forcing many debtors to consider alternative ways of
increasing income and making their debts tax deductible.
Letting a property or part of a property could be a solution. But be careful
 -rules governing interest payments on loans taken out by individuals to
acquire, improve and maintain property for letting are stringent and
complex.
First, the property must be in the UK or the Irish Republic. Next, be
careful who you borrow money from. If you choose a non-UK lender you may
have to deduct and pay the Inland Revenue 25 per cent tax on behalf of the
lender.
Always borrow via a loan and not via a bank overdraft. Interest payments on
overdrafts are not tax deductible (unless you are trading); neither are
interest payments on loans taken out to pay off the overdraft. Where money
is borrowed by means of an overdraft as a temporary measure and repaid from
a loan account, the Revenue will, by concession, allow the interest to be
deducted if repaid within six months.
Brooks, in the recent case of Brooks v Lawson, discovered this rule to his
cost. He financed property improvements using bank overdrafts over a number
of years before negotiating loan accounts with the bank. The Revenue refused
to deduct his interest payments on either his overdraft or his loan accounts
against his rental income.
Brooks appealed. The court found in favour of the Revenue. This may seem
harsh, but is nevertheless the law.
If you decide not to borrow from a bank, ensure the loan can remain
outstanding for more than a year. Short-term interest on non-bank borrowing
is not tax deductible.
If you get the right borrower and type of borrowings, interest payments
could still be disallowed as a deduction if you do not borrow the money for
a qualifying purpose. Basically, buying or improving property are qualifying
purposes but repairs are not.
The Inland Revenue has given some guidance on where it considers the
dividing line to be. For example, it will regard underpinning, 'extensive
repointing', pebble dashing, texture coating (but not painting) and stone
cladding as improvements, but the replacement of a leaky roof or new
guttering as repairs.
Any interest payable on a loan taken out for repairs is not deductible from
rents. So landlords are not encouraged to take out a loan to keep their
properties in good repair.
If substantial repairs are needed and you must fund them with a loan, it may
be possible to get relief if you sell the property into a private trust or
company. The property will then be in a new ownership and the interest
payments on a loan taken out to do the repair work, will be treated as
repairs attributable to a period before the estate or interest was acquired.
They will then be treated as 'dilapidations' and become tax deductible. But,
before rushing into a sale, take care that in so doing you do not trigger an
even worse capital gains tax liability or stamp duty charge.
Even with the right borrower and the right purpose for the loan, you still
may not be able to deduct your interest payments from your rental income if
the letting does not qualify. To qualify, the interest must be payable
during any period of 52 weeks during which the property has been let for 26
weeks at a commercial rent.
In theory, where interest is payable half-yearly, it should be possible to
have a gap between lettings of 76 weeks without loss of interest relief. But
it is not good to sail this close to the wind since in the current market
you may not be able to find a tenant just when you want one. Nor can you be
guaranteed that the tenant will occupy your property without a break to suit
your tax plans.
The key point is the date when the interest is payable, not when it is
actually paid. If letting becomes a problem, you cannot just pay your
interest late. You must renegotiate dates on which it becomes payable with
your bank.
If the property is not let during the period of 52 weeks, it must be
available for letting or used as your main residence or undergoing works of
construction or repair. It is not always possible to do substantial works
within the time scale to suit your tax plans and, if your bank does not
agree to an interest free holiday or to a re-arrangement of when your
interest becomes payable, the cost of your building works may be increased
by the grossed up amount of your interest payments.
If you can arrange your finance and lettings so that interest payments can
be deducted against the rental income, all the interest can be deducted
regardless of the size of the loan. The relief is not restricted to the
basic tax rate.
If your interest payments exceed your net rental income, the loss cannot be
set off against your other income, nor can it be carried back against any
previous rental income you may have received and on which you have paid tax.
Excess interest payments can only be set against net rents of other
properties in the tax year in which the interest was payable, or in
subsequent years.
It is hardly surprising that the government is criticised for discouraging
people from letting property and allowing it to fall into disrepair.
Maybe now is the time to encourage, not discourage, the acquisition,
improvement and maintenance of let property.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: No fall in repossessions - Mortgage
arrears persist . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Government will have found little cheer this week in the findings of a
report which concluded that measures to prevent an increase in the rate of
repossessions are failing.
The study from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research
foundation, says the government hoped to reduce the number of repossessions
in 1992 by 40,000 through the launch of its mortgage rescue scheme last
December. However, the report concluded that the figure will be in the
region of only 10,000.
The rescue package agreed with the Council of Mortgage Lenders included a
decision by the government to pay the mortgage interest element of income
support directly to lenders. This was introduced on May 25. But the report,
which was based on a survey of Nationwide building society borrowers, found
that over 80 per cent of claimants pass this on in full to their lenders.
Direct payments to lenders would prevent only 10,500 repossessions.
Mortgage-to-rent schemes, where those in arrears could remain in their homes
as tenants, have been even less successful according to the report. 'The
scheme is administratively complex and people want to remain as homeowners,'
said the Building Societies Association.
Around 40 per cent of those with arrears live in the south east where
average mortgage payments owed are Pounds 500 a month. This falls to Pounds
369 a month across the country. Almost a fifth of borrowers owed more than
Pounds 4,000 in arrears - half of these are in the south east.
Lenders have realised that increases in the number of repossessions are
exacerbating the problems in the housing market by adding to the number of
properties that cannot be sold. There were more than 75,500 repossessions in
1991.
'The most effective way to prevent repossessions has been for lenders to
accept lower repayments but it is not a permanent solution,' said the
Building Societies Association. Lenders have been encouraging those facing
repayment difficulties to get in touch with them sooner rather than later.
'We are being flexible on repayments from those borrowers who are in serious
arrears,' said Mike McQueen, home rescue co-ordinator at Nationwide. 'In
some cases we are even prepared to accept 25 per cent of normal monthly
interest payments for up to two years.'
Mortgage lenders are critical of the paucity of help extended to them by the
government in trying to solve the problem of a sluggish housing market which
has affected all income brackets. They have been particularly disappointed
that the government will not be extending the temporary suspension of stamp
duty on house purchases below Pounds 250,000 beyond August 19.
'On the one hand the government is reimposing stamp duty which will make
home-buying more expensive, and on the other its use of National Savings to
fund the PSBR will restrict our ability to cut mortgage rates,' said David
O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial, one of the ten largest
societies.
The Rowntree report recommends a mortgage benefit scheme providing help with
housing costs to people on low incomes, regardless of whether they are
unemployed as the most effective measure towards preventing an increase in
repossessions.
'The economic conditions are in place for arrears and possessions to persist
at high levels,' said Steve Wilcox, co-author of the report. 'This evidence
of unprecedented difficulty and failure must, in turn, be expected to act as
a drag on the recovery of the housing market.'
The Building Societies Association said it had expected an improvement in
conditions by now and was disappointed that the number of repossessions in
the first half of the year is likely to be 32,500.
'Because of a big increase in arrears, it is possible that possessions would
start rising again if there is no improvement in the economy. Lenders are
doing all they can to stop that happening,' it said.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: When surrender leads to heavy loss -
The pitfalls of life policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE MAY never be the same again. This week, nine of the UK's biggest life
insurers admitted they faced a serious problem with early surrenders of life
policies, and committed themselves to tackling it.
A large and ambitious report, which they commissioned, showed that the
recession had much to do with current high surrender rates, but also
disclosed problems with the policies themselves.
The verdict, according to Keith Bedell-Pearce of Prudential, was that the
industry 'must do better'.
None of this has come too soon. The companies were stung into action by a
Securities and Investments Board report published last year which showed
that during 1990, 37.1 per cent of unit-linked life policies, and 23 per
cent of with-profits policies, were terminated within two years of being
started.
These disquieting figures were attacked by regulators and by the press -
including the Financial Times. The industry's response was less contrite
than it is now.
Hugh Scurfield, general manager of Norwich Union, wrote a letter to the
Financial Times which said: 'The investigation is flawed and I suggest no
further conclusions should be drawn from it.'
However, Norwich Union is one of the companies which conducted the research,
and now accepts that there is a problem. Bedell-Pearce said some offices
disagreed with the SIB survey 'at the margins', but added: 'There was a very
clear message that rates of persistency had deteriorated, and that they were
unacceptable. It was also clear that no hard reasons yet existed.'
Early surrenders benefit no-one - investors get a poor return on the money,
as the full benefits of the investment are only available to those who carry
on to maturity, while insurers have to take substantially reduced profits,
or even losses. Sometimes intermediaries will lose commission.
The companies' survey attempted to find out why so many had surrendered
their policies, by interviewing people who had done so within the last six
months.
It found that 68 per cent of them had done so because of a 'change in
personal circumstances'. Of these, 10 per cent were caused by redundancy, 15
per cent by inability to afford the premiums and 7 per cent by a need for
extra cash. These people tended to live in the south and the Midlands, where
the recession is most severe.
In 17 per cent of cases, consumers had allowed their policy to lapse because
of product cover and value for money, while 14 per cent of lapses were due
to problems with advice or service. Of these, problems with direct debits
only accounted for 3 per cent of lapses.
It seems that blatant bad advice such as churning - telling a customer to
cash in an old policy and then pocketing the commission on the new one - is
quite rare among advisers and sales agents. Only 3 per cent said they had
been influenced explicitly by the advice of a financial adviser.
While manifestly dishonest advice is rare, advice which is economical with
the truth is more widespread. The survey found that only 81 per cent of
customers were aware that not all their premiums would be returned if they
surrendered, while more than one third of customers said they were not told
about the financial implications of lapsing a policy.
The survey, carried out by Survey Research Associates, made several
important recommendations. It suggests that the life companies should:
Review their sales processes to identify possible 'change of circumstances'
issues; Communicate the serious financial implications of early surrender to
customers more effectively;
Improve quality of service; Consider more flexible 'customer-orientated'
products.
This phrase is revealing - a 25-year policy which penalises you for stopping
any earlier certainly cannot be described as 'customer-orientated'.
The shopping list of measures for extra flexibility produced by SRA also
make eminent sense. They include:
Variable premiums, a measure which has been made much easier by the move
from traditional to unitised with-profits contracts;
Premium holidays - at the outset you would be allowed to take a certain
number of holidays between premiums;
Longer hiatus periods between premiums being paid, which would allow
customers greater scope for improved cash flow;
Waiver of premiums, allowing the ultimate value of the policy to be reduced
without terminating it;
Special options for those hit by divorce or separation;
Loan facilities - these could be extended. You could borrow at a
preferential rate against the maturity value of the policy. The total debt
outstanding would be deducted from that value; and
Part encashment.
All of these should make endowments more attractive than they are at
present.
It is questionable to what extent the report's findings exonerate the
industry. They show that people are very prone to 'changes in personal
circumstances'.
This is just as well. Life would be very boring if one could expect to live
through 25 years - the term for a mortgage-related endowment - without any
significant changes in circumstances.
The figure for people whose circumstances have changed suggests that the
inherent inflexibility of endowments makes them inappropriate for customers
who usually need flexibility. The best solution would be for them to buy a
different product altogether.
The most obvious, tax-efficient alternative is the personal equity plan
(Pep). Bedell-Pearce admitted that the Pru would love to sell more Peps, a
view echoed by other insurers. But he said the Pru still found it difficult
to sell them, though recently Pep sales have increased.
Another nagging issue is the fact that 32 per cent of people surrendered for
the 'wrong' reasons - problems with the product or the intermediary.
But the nine companies deserve great credit for acknowledging a problem
which some in the industry still wanted to ignore, and going a long way to
doing something about it. The roll of honour is: Commercial Union, Eagle
Star, GA Life, Guardian Royal Exchange, Legal &amp; General, Norwich Union,
Prudential, Royal Life, and Sun Alliance. All nine have committed themselves
to improvements.
They said regulatory changes to disclosure, which will force poor surrender
values to be made clearer, and to training and competence of sales staff
would both help. The companies are also committed to emphasising possible
changes of circumstances.
Laudably, they intend to be 'more pro-active in addressing industry issues.'
So in future they will not wait for SIB to issue a damning survey, and then
wait months before taking action.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Kleinwort taps a new seam - Potential
for profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson's new Endowment Policy Trust has brought the possibilities
of secondhand endowments to public notice.
So what advantages does the investment trust route have over buying your own
endowment directly from a market maker or at auction?
Well, the scheme is closed-ended, which means you just need to purchase
shares in the trust, which has been designed to wind up after 11 years, with
the proceeds divided among the shareholders - this investment is for capital
growth only.
Using an investment trust avoids double taxation problems - the trust pays
no tax and the investor is subject to Capital Gains Tax on cash-in.
Unlike direct investment, investors in this trust will not have further cash
calls made to meet the premiums due on the endowments in the portfolio.
Although the trust will invest mainly in endowments, which mature on or
before the wind-up of the trust, it will hold shorter-dated endowments where
the maturity proceeds will provide the cash to pay these premiums.
Investors wishing to cash in before the trust is wound up must sell their
shares.
The trust will have an issued share capital of 30m shares of which
one-quarter will be available to the public, the remainder having been
placed. The offer price is 100p a share, with a minimum application of 1,000
shares and thereafter in multiples of 1,000 shares.
Investment can also be made through regular savings - minimum Pounds 25 a
month. The illustrative annual return, assuming life company bonus rates -
both reversionary and terminal - does not change and is 12.7 per cent gross,
compared with a yield of around 14 per cent on individual second hand
endowments maturing in 11 years.
The difference reflects charges incurred setting up the trust and getting
fully invested - expected to take a year - and the conservative method used
by KB in discounting future premium payments in valuing endowments.
For investors wanting to enter or get out of the trust in the interim period
they will have to buy or sell shares - which may not be so simple.
The trust, which has two actuaries on the board, will regularly calculate
the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares, with independent checks on the
basic parameters used. This NAV will be published and form the basis for the
share price.
But share prices of investment trusts are affected by other factors - the
general market movement and the supply and demand of a particular share.
Share prices could stand at a discount to NAV if investors try to sell their
shares because the stock market has fallen or life companies have cut bonus
rates.
A rush of investors wanting to cash in early will not force the trust to
sell endowments, but it could result in the share price falling below NAV.
So anyone buying into the trust needs to consider the implications of
getting out before the trust is wound up.
The launch of this trust could herald the start of other collective schemes,
greatly increasing the demand for second hand endowments without any
corresponding increase in supply. That could have implications for the
market in second hand endowments.
Some commentators believe that the growth in the secondhand endowment market
has an inbuilt self-destruct mechanism. It is argued that as far as the life
company is concerned, it loses the profit made on surrender when an
endowment is sold to a third party and therefore kept in force. So the
growth in the market will lead to lower profits and therefore lower bonuses.
And those investors in the policies, either directly or through a collective
scheme, will receive lower returns than anticipated and become
disillusioned.
But this argument only covers one profit source of traditional life
companies, not the complete trading pattern. The main source of profit for
traditional with-profit business arises from the excess yield on investments
on the underlying funds compared with the return assumed in the premium
calculations. This investment profit accelerates over the lifetime of the
contract as the funds build up on a compound basis.
The profit which life offices take on surrender is generally only part of
the investment profit that could have been earned had the contract been kept
in force until maturity.
The secondhand endowment market will hit problems when the supply of
endowments fails to meet demand. This will happen when existing
policyholders cease selling their contracts to third parties, which in turn
would only occur if policyholders stopped wanting to cash-in their contracts
before maturity, or life companies improved their surrender pay-outs to such
an extent that market makers could not match those pay-outs.
The latter is already happening. Bad publicity has made many life companies
substantially improve surrender values. They are almost as concerned with
their position in the surrender value league tables as they are with the
maturity tables. If surrender values continue to improve, market makers may
find that the price they are prepared to pay for endowments cannot match
them. That would be bad for the market, but possibly good for consumers.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A risk-free bond that may be worth the
wait - Why the latest National Savings product has upset the building
societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH this week of a new National Savings product has provoked calls of
'foul]' from building societies in the competition for deposits.
The First Option Bond was promised by Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in the
Budget when he forecast a doubling of the public sector borrowing
requirement, compared with last year, to Pounds 28bn, an amount that will
have to be raised in part through National Savings and government bonds.
Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said
this week that National Savings was trying to raise Pounds 6bn at the
expense of building societies. He did not welcome the competition because
'it is not on proper terms'.
Building societies claim the competition is unfair because, unlike the
lending institutions, the government does not have to be profitable.
The row intensified this week after National Savings announced an interest
rate of 7.75 per cent net on its new one year fixed rate First Option Bond
(see box for details).
Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government was
mindful of protests from banks and building societies that rates from
National Savings were too high and had pitched the interest level
accordingly. 'We don't want an embarrassment of riches,' he said.
Privately, building societies felt this to be disingenuous. This week few
offered a better rate of interest than the new bond's.
The Halifax, the UK's largest building society, said it had anticipated
public demand for the bond and believed its recently launched Guaranteed
Reserve account, with investment terms from six months to five years,
offered 'attractive and realistic rates of interest.'
The sting is in the word 'realistic,' with its implication that National
Savings is paying above current market rates. The rate of interest on
Halifax's Guaranteed Reserve account at 6.66 per cent net (8.88 per cent
gross) is more than a full percentage point below the First Option Bond,
although the rate increases to 6.83 net (9.11 gross) on Pounds 10,000 and
above.
The minimum investment of Pounds 2,000 is also double that for the National
Savings bond. A rate similar to the First Option Bond was offered by
Nationwide through its one year Fixed Rate Bond fixed at 7.73 per cent net
last month. But the minimum of Pounds 10,000 would be beyond the reach of
small savers.
In any case, Nationwide was unable to satisfy demand for the bond and it was
withdrawn within a month of issue.
Britannia has tried to steal some of the thunder of National Savings with an
index-linked account, paying 4.5 per cent gross (exactly the same rate as
National Savings on its index-linked certificates).
The NS certificates have the great advantage of being tax-free but they are
less flexible since they have to be held for five years, whereas the
Britannia account operates on 90 day notice. It is paying 6.6 per cent net
(8.8 per cent gross).
Higher rates than on the First Option Bond can be found in the building
societies but on their variable rate accounts. These are shown in our Best
Rates table on Page VI. Banks and building societies do not offer much
choice of fixed rates for savers.
Guaranteed income bonds are the most directly comparable product to the
First Option Bond. According to Baronworth Investment Services, the best
rate on a one-year Gib with a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000 is 7.4 per
cent net from Acuma. The National Savings rate of 8.05 per cent net on
Pounds 20,000 is bettered by American Life's one year Gib, which is paying
8.25 per cent on Pounds 20,000 to just under Pounds 50,000.
Savers are unlikely to have much sympathy with the building societies and
may argue that in a competitive market, the lending institutions will just
have to raise interest rates to compete.
Building societies say they cannot afford to do this because they are also
trying to cut mortgage rates. They accuse the government of pushing them to
lower mortgage rates as a spur to a revival in the housing market, while
poaching savers through National Savings. Two of the largest mortgage
lenders said this week that they would have to consider raising mortgage
rates unless there was a base rate cut, because they could not afford to
lose more savers to National Savings.
Simon Briscoe, of Greenwell Montagu, points out the potential that the
government's policy has for delaying the recovery. 'Why encourage savings
when it is spending that ought to be encouraged?' he asked.
Building societies are on the defensive because net receipts - the
difference between deposits and withdrawals - have been unusually low this
year. Net receipts last year totalled Pounds 5.8bn but they amounted to only
Pounds 657m for the first five months of this year. By contrast, National
Savings has attracted Pounds 1.53bn of net receipts so far this year
(excluding accrued interest).
For the building societies, this drop in growth of receipts comes when the
ratio of peoples' savings to income is at a 10 year high. Building
societies' share of the personal sector financial assets market dropped from
16.2 per cent in 1980 to 15.3 per cent in 1991 but this is not entirely
attributable to National Savings, since its market share has also declined,
from 4 per cent to 2.8 per cent during the same period.
The clear winners have been the life and pension products. Their market
share rose from 34.8 per cent to 52.3 per cent, mainly as a result of the
growth of endowment mortgages which have a life assurance element.
Other reasons why net receipts have fallen include the offers of shares in
newly privatised industries during the 1980s, which sucked funds out of the
personal sector, and the growth in unit trusts, according to a report on
building societies by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, published last month.
But the report also attributes the fall in net receipts to lower saving
rates offered by the building societies: 'Due to their bad debt problems,
building societies have kept their savings rates low relative to money
market rates, despite mortgage rates rising to well above money market
rates.'
Bad debts relative to advances tripled last year to 0.6 per cent from 1990;
they doubled to 38 per cent relative to operating profit over the same
period.
Yet the report says that building society profitability as measured by
return on capital is much higher than for banks. The return on capital for
the 20 largest building societies in 1991 was 17.8 per cent compared with
8.5 per cent for the Big Four banks and it forecasts that the building
society industry will 'continue to remain inherently strong and successful.'
So savers should not be constrained by a philanthropic desire to help out
the building societies - they should put their money where the highest rates
are, with the usual caveat that this should not be with a shady institution.
In this case, that caveat is not needed - short of revolution, National
Savings is risk-free and the First Option Bond offers the highest one year
fixed rate for a bond of its type. As long as you are happy to tie the money
up for a year, what are you waiting for?

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The facts behind FIRST
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST (Fixed Interest Rate Savings Tax-Paid) Option Bond went on sale on
Tuesday with a guaranteed interest rate of 7.75 per cent net (equivalent to
10.34 per cent gross) on a minimum of Pounds 1,000.
A higher rate of 8.05 per cent is payable on Pounds 20,000 and above.
Interest will be added annually and the maximum holding is Pounds 250,000.
The rate is guaranteed for a year, but National Savings can announce a new
rate of interest for new issues at any time.
Who should buy the bond?
The new bond fills a gap in the range of National Savings products which
until now have worked to the advantage of higher rate and non-tax payers
with no comparable product for basic rate taxpayers.
With basic rate tax deducted at source, the bond is suitable for the
country's 25.1m basic-rate taxpayers.
Higher rate tax payers will be better off with the National Savings
certificates because they are free of income or capital gains tax while they
would have to pay the extra tax on the First Option bond.
The 37th issue certificates pay 8 per cent per annum compound fixed for 5
years (equivalent 13.33 per cent to a 40 per cent tax payer).
The index-linked certificates have a fixed rate of interest of 4.5 per cent
above the retail price index.
Non-taxpayers have the Capital Bonds which are subject to tax but on which
interest is paid gross. They offer a guaranteed return if held for five
years. The present Series D offers a gross return of 10.75 per cent per
annum, compound over five years.
However, non-taxpayers who want to invest their money for a period shorter
than five years can consider the First Option bond, since tax is reclaimable
from your tax office.
Basic rate taxpayers who want a higher rate and are prepared to invest for
five years should choose the Capital Bonds since the return after basic rate
tax is 8.063 per cent per annum, which is marginally higher than the 37th
issue certificates.
How to apply
Unlike other National Savings products, you cannot buy the bond over the
post office counter though the post office will stock application forms.
Alternatively, fill in the purchase forms issued in newspapers during the
next three weeks or apply direct to National Savings, Glasgow G58 1SB.
After receiving payment, National Savings will send an investment
certificate within 28 days. The date of purchase on the certificate will be
the date on which National Savings received the purchase form and payment.
To cash in or not to cash in
National Savings says that it does not regard First Option as a one year
bond because savers can hold the bond for longer if they like the sound of
the next annual fixed rate, hence the name 'option'.
National Savings will write to investors, informing them of the new rate at
the anniversary of purchase of the bond.
Those who want to continue holding it need take no action - the bond will
simply roll forward incurring the new fixed rate. Unlike most National
Savings products, the unattractive general extension rate - currently 5.01
per cent - will not apply.
If you want to cash in the bond on the anniversary date, you must complete
the repayment form printed on the back of the investment certificate. No
formal notice period is necessary.
But there are penalties for early withdrawal. If the bond is cashed in

FT  11 JUL 92 / Markets: Electricity profits, a highly charged question -
The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THURSDAY was the last day of a hard results season for the electricity
industry. The 12 regional companies, privatised a year ago, found themselves
alternately apologising for their profits and proving they could be
sustained.
A chorus led by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator,
and Frank Dobson, the Labour energy spokesman, warned that their profit
increases - which averaged around 49 per cent - were higher than expected.
Top of the list was Norweb, with a 126 per cent increase against last year's
pro forma profit, followed by Manweb at 75 per cent and Southern at 57 per
cent. Last came Yorkshire with a 20.9 per cent increase and South Wales with
a 28.3 per cent rise.
Any companies found overcharging customers, they were warned, will face
regulatory thumbscrews when the industry watchdog Offer reviews the formulae
that govern how much they can increase their prices in 1994.
Meanwhile, City analysts wondered how the companies could sustain this
year's high dividend increases - averaging 14.5 per cent - in the long term.
Even if the regulator is not too hard on them, the chances the companies
will ever make windfall profits by increasing prices is slim.
Given that the outlook for electricity sales growth is modest - about 1 per
cent next year - they are left with little opportunity to boost growth other
than cost-cutting, although for the next year or two their figures will
improve as exceptional charges disappear and interest charges fall.
The non-core businesses - shops and contracting - are unlikely to do much in
the foreseeable future except turn small losses to break-even or small
profits.
The underlying increase in the electricity companies profits, moreover, are
much less than the figures suggested. That is because the companies
undercharged customers in the year to March 1991, and recouped the loss by
charging more in the year to March 1992.
If this effect is stripped out, the underlying rise in profits was between
15 and 20 per cent, rather than 40 per cent.
These figures show that most companies made most of their extra profit by
increasing prices and cutting costs for the transmission of electricity
across their wires.
Profits in the supply business (buying and selling electricity on the
wholesale market) fell, as costs rose sharply.
Next year, profits from distribution (the business of selling electricity
from the main network into customers' premises) will probably fall, because
price rises this April were modest. Supply should do a little better, as
exceptional costs for running the national grid disappear.
Most analysts expect an overall profit increase of 10 to 12 per cent with
similar dividend growth in the years up to the regulatory review in 1994.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, last week gave
investors a hint of what they should look for beyond that date. He seemed to
suggest that companies which have cut costs, and prices, and improved
customer service face lower regulatory risk. Cost-cutting is also one of the
few ways they can improve underlying profits. Manweb, which cut 18 per cent
of its workforce and controllable costs by about Pounds 10m, must be near
the top of the list. followed by South Wales and Eastern.
South Wales and Seeboard promised to hand back cash to customers. This looks
good, but there has been no sign yet that companies such as Yorkshire which
have charged customers as much as they can will be penalised.
Nor is it clear what the regulator will make of recent price changes.
Eastern, for instance, has the lowest price, but the highest increase. South
Wales, meanwhile, has the highest price, but a below average increase.

<TEXT>
The recession is proving obstinate, because the British economy faces a long
process of adjustment to lower inflation and lower levels of private debt.
For the moment, the stock market should be treated with caution. But
investors can still earn 9 per cent on fixed-income investments, with
inflation only 4 per cent and falling slowly. Fixed-interest investments
receive special attention in the summer issue of the FT Quarterly Review of
Personal Finance, to be published with next Friday's paper and repeated with
Saturday's. The Review also includes a survey on Personal Pensions.

Small companies endured another bad week. The County NatWest smaller
companies index fell 3.26 per cent to 915.26 over the seven days to
Thursday, July 9. Over the same period the Hoare Govett index (capital gains
version) slipped 2.55 per cent to 1148.24. Hoare Govett attributes these
problems to a familiar source - the continuing non-appearance of a
consumer-led recovery, and its effect on confidence.

British Aerospace has run into market turbulence over the last year. Its
share price was hit last autumn, at the time when former chairman Professor
Sir Roland Smith resigned. Continuing predictions by City analysts of
provisions that would have to be made against the difficulties of their
regional aircraft division, plus another knock from the news that Germany
was withdrawing from the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, inflicted
further damage last week.
This week the share price rallied slightly in what one marketmaker described
as a 'dead cat bounce'. It started the week on 243p, and ended, after plenty
of fluctuation, on 246p.

Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, said house prices rose 0.7 per
cent last month. It said that, allowing for seasonal fluctuations, prices
rose by 0.3 per cent in June, the first seasonally adjusted rise since

The Halifax index conflicts with a survey published last week by Nationwide,
the second-largest society, which said house prices fell by an average 0.5
per cent last month.
Despite last month's price rise, Halifax said the Pounds 65,361 average cost

FT  11 JUL 92 / Markets: All dressed up - but nowhere to go - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINDOW dressing is wonderful art. In New York, the streets are suddenly
cleaner, flowers and bunting more noticeable, the police more in evidence.
The reason is simple: a Democrat convention is coming to town.
On Wall Street, something similar seems to be going on. Last week, a
panic-struck Federal Reserve cut the discount rate to its lowest level since
the early 1960s. There was nothing too complicated behind this move, either.
Unemployment is rising alarmingly, just as the politicians are saying that
the economy is on the mend.
But, for stock market traders and investors, the outlook immediately
acquired a rosier tinge. After an edgy start to the week - in which the Dow
Jones industrial average first rallied and was then hit badly by a wave of
programme selling on Tuesday - dealers started to anticipate a mild summer
rally. On Thursday, the Dow staged an extremely solid revival, gaining more
than 30 points in heavy volume. The sheer breadth of the upturn,
encompassing both small stocks and big blue chips, encouraged many market
participants.
On Friday morning, suitably low inflation data boosted the optimistic mood.
A gain of just 0.2 per cent in the June producer price index - and a fall of
0.1 per cent in the 'core' rate, which excludes food and energy prices -
suggested that inflationary steam is non-existent in the US economy at
present. Share prices first took further heart, and then dithered briefly.
But by mid-morning, they were still adding modestly to Thursday's gains.
However, it remains a moot point whether this burst of summer confidence has
much to support it. Clearly, lower interest rates reduce again the yield on
competing investments, and the low real cost of money may encourage some
marginal investment decisions. As pundits have pointed out, the second half
of an election year tends to enjoy a stock market rally.
But a more revealing picture of the 'real' economy may emerge when the
corporate reporting season - covering earnings for the second quarter of
1992 - gets under way next week.
So far, the auguries are mixed. On the plus side, profit warnings seem to
have been less prevalent than in other 'pre-quarterlies' periods during
recent years - although they have not been entirely absent, either. This
week, for example, it was the turn of Georgia-Pacific, the US paper group,
to tell analysts that it would only achieve 'slightly better than
break-even'. After-tax profits, added the company, would be lower than in
the same period of 1991. Georgia-Pacific's announcement duly knocked Dollars
4 3/8 of its own share price, at Dollars 55, and the rest of paper sector
fell in sympathy.
Some early earnings figures, meanwhile, have been anything but cheery. In
the supermarket sector, for instance, Safeway reported a 6.5 per cent
decline in second quarter profits, with same-store sales falling by over
three per cent. This is a testament to the extent of price-competition in
the retail sector - and the reluctance of consumers to spend more than is
necessary. In the hotels sector, Marriott reported a marginal improvement
overall only.
Many leading US retailers reported only modest gains in sales during June -
well below improvements seen in April and May. The Limited, long viewed as
one of the more successful specialty retailers, disclosed a four per cent
fall, causing its shares to fall Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 19 7/8 , close to
their 52-week low. And Sears Roebuck, which is more heavily influenced by
'big ticket' items, reported a 2.6 per cent drop.
Lay-offs continue to flow. In the aerospace sector, McDonnell Douglas
announced up to 5,000 job losses while Northwest Airlines also trimmed
staffing figures this week. In the oil industry two large programmes were
revealed by Amoco and Unocal. Amoco is restructuring business operations at
the cost of 8,500 jobs, or 16 per cent of its workforce, Unocal is
eliminating 1,100 jobs.
Finally, intense price competition in many major sectors shows little sign
of abating. The airlines are a good example. Having just endured a fierce
bout of domestic fare wars, the industry had hoped to raise its prices this
week. Instead, promotional fares were announced by the bankrupt Continental
Airlines.
In short, just as cleaner pavements do not make New York's drug problem go
way, so a cut in interest rates and election fever do not instantly answer
the nation's economic ills.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Unholy saga of the church's missing millions: The average
clergyman's annual pay is about Pounds 12,000. But the Church Commissioners
have let Pounds 500m slip through their fingers because of ill-judged
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHURCH Commissioners, who manage Pounds 2.7bn of investments on behalf
of the Anglican clergy, have some explaining to do. Over the past two years
no less than Pounds 500m has slipped through their fingers.
That mind-numbing sum is the amount by which they have been forced to write
down the value of their property investments after an ill-judged decision to
expand their property holdings at the top of the 1980s property boom; and it
has been magnified by a controversial decision to finance speculative
property developments with borrowings, mainly from National Westminster
Bank, that reached nearly Pounds 520m at their peak last year.
The outcome is that the Church's income is sharply down in real terms and
Anglican parishioners are being asked to fill the hole in the commissioners'
finances. How did this august body, which ranks a number of distinguished
City figures on its asset committee, get into such a mess?
The commissioners claim the disaster was caused by forces outside their
control. In pamphlets distributed in parishes across the UK they have
declared that investment income will be flat over the next few years because
of the recession. They have warned that the amount they contribute to the
pay of the church's 11,300 clergy will be cut from 45 per cent last year to
a mere 30 per cent in 1995. Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury and
chairman of the commissioners, was reported in the Church Times earlier this
year as saying that 'the finances of the Church of England have been badly
hit by inflation'.
Yet a detailed investigation by the Financial Times into the church's losses
in property suggests a rather different explanation. The badly-timed
decision to add to the church's already extensive property by borrowing to
invest in a series of speculative developments raises serious questions
about the management and accountability of this discreet but powerful
institution.
How could this happen? Part of the answer depends on the peculiar history of
the Church Commissioners. They were the product of a merger in 1948 between
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and Queen Anne's Bounty, whose combined
assets were then worth more than Pounds 200m. Most of those assets were in
farms and property ground rents, some dating back to the dissolution of the
monasteries. A minority was invested in gilt-edged stocks. Not until the
merger did the men who invested the church's money have the power to invest
in ordinary shares.
Since then the commissioners' task, under the Church Commissioners Measure
of 1947, has been to continue providing pensions, pay and housing aid for
the clergy and its dependents. In effect, they run a cross between a pension
fund and a private investment trust. They do so within broad ethical
guidelines that preclude investment in armaments, alcohol, tobacco and other
controversial businesses.
Since the 1950s the church's investment managers have sought to exploit the
potential of one of the country's oldest estates in partnership with leading
property developers. With the help of entrepreneurs, such as Lord Rayne of
London Merchant Securities, the balance of the Church Commissioners'
property portfolio has changed from predominantly agricultural and
residential, to commercial. Huge residential estates, such as Maida Vale
estate in north London, which had belonged to the bishops of London since
the Middle Ages, were largely sold off and the proceeds reinvested in
offices, shops and industrial premises.
This change of emphasis, as Oliver Marriott has recorded in his book The
Property Boom, was highly profitable for the commissioners. At the start of
the 1980s property still accounted for more than two thirds of the church's
investments, compared with a little over 20 per cent for the average pension
fund.
Then the trouble began.
The past decade has been near-disastrous for commercial property investment.
According to a leading performance measurement survey run by the WM Company,
UK property produced a total annualised return, including capital and
income, over the past ten years of 9.7 per cent. This compares with the
return on all investments held by the average pension fund in WM's survey of
15.6 per cent. On a rough calculation that underperformance could have cost
the clergy anything between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m a year in today's
money over the course of the decade.
The commissioners' problems were compounded by errors of timing. In 1983,
when the dollar was riding high and money was pouring into real estate
development in the US, they joined the American real estate stampede.
Advised by Chesterton, the property agents, they bought offices, shopping
centres and warehouses from Tampa, Florida to Minnetonka in Minnesota, to
Sunnyvale, California. Their approach was idiosyncratic.
The Church Commissioners' property man, until his resignation last year, was
Michael Hutchings. In the words of a former colleague, Hutchings, a
flamboyant character, was 'temperamentally disinclined' to fly. To monitor
the church's investments in the US, he used to cross the Atlantic on the QE2
and then travel the continent by train, car and bus. He also attracted some
notoriety world by sending his own cases of wine ahead of him; but without
obvious beneficial effect on investment performance. By the end of the
decade the return on the church's US properties was even worse than on the
British ones at an annualised 7.3 per cent. A decision was taken to reduce
the American portfolio.
But as the commissioners cut their US losses, their large investment in
agricultural property was doing even worse. The commis sioners say that they
hold farmland for 'historical reasons' and argue that tenanted farm land has
been hard to sell. So their longstanding policy has been to reduce their
holdings whenever vacant possession has been obtained. In 10 years this has
cut the acreage by 10 per cent to 155,000 acres, recently valued at Pounds
211m. But the investment performance has been abysmal. One broad indicator
is the annualised return over the past 10 years on agricultural properties
in the respected IPD databank. This was a mere 1 per cent.
However, other institutions appear to have been much more successful than
the commissioners in selling tenanted land. According to IPD, tenanted land
in its database has come down from just over 500,000 acres to 277,500 acres
over the past 10 years. A leading agent in the agricultural property market
said: 'Even in the early 1980s the commissioners' agricultural commitments
looked incredibly over-exposed. They are immensely traditional landlords and
so wrapped up in this that it has clouded their judgment. I am surprised
they did not try to shift more.'
Another property expert wondered whether the commissioners might have become
too attached to the seigneurial trappings of land ownership - visiting
farms, presiding over dinners for the tenantry and dispensing engraved
goblets to longstanding tenants - despite potential conflicts with the
financial needs of the clergy. According to one insider these duties were
seen as terrific fun and were enthusiastically performed by some members of
the commissioners' asset committee.
Between the start of the 1980s and the end of 1988 the commissioners reduced
their property holdings from 67 per cent to 57 per cent of their total
portfolio. Even at that level they were heavily at risk when compared with
the average pension fund, which had reduced property from more than 20 per
cent of the portfolio to under 10 per cent over the same period.
Then the commissioners took a fateful decision. They not only increased
their commitment to property, but did so on borrowed money for speculative
development.
This move, which was to take property back up to 64 per cent of the
portfolio by the end of 1990, was highly controversial. Earlier ventures
into property development had been financed mainly by selling property on
the existing estate. Yet, in their 1990 annual report, the commissioners
described the decision to borrow for developments as being 'in accordance
with normal commercial practice'.
Leading fund managers consulted by the Financial Times found this statement
bizarre. For a closed fund with no new money coming in, borrowing for
high-risk speculative development was, in their view, extremely unorthodox.
Even for a contributory pension fund with a positive cash inflow, borrowing
is usually regarded as a questionable practice. In those cases where pension
funds have been tempted to borrow for property development, as at the ICI,
Unilever and Electricity pension funds in the 1970s, the outcome proved
exceptionally damaging to their finances and performance.
So it turned out with the Church Commissioners.
Back in 1988 their unsecured borrowings of Pounds 192m from National
Westminster Bank bore interest at between 9.15 per cent and 14 per cent. By
the time total borrowings topped Pounds 500m in 1990 the commissioners had
ceased to disclose the interest rates in their annual report. But they were
undoubtedly burdensome. In effect, the church had decided to go into debt
just before real rates of interest, after adjusting for inflation, rose to
their highest level since the Depression of the 1930s.
Most of the developments were brought to the commissioners by Chesterton.
Some, such as the Metro Centre at Gateshead in north east England have
proved successful. This scheme, on which the commissioners arranged
long-term borrowings of more than Pounds 100m, attracts high-spending
shoppers from Norway and Denmark, as well as the immediate area around
Newcastle. It was recently valued at over Pounds 200m.
Others have proved problematic. Among the retail developments the Marlowes
Centre at Hemel Hempstead, undertaken jointly with Martin Landau's City
Merchant Developers (subsequently merged with property group Imry) and Sir
Robert McAlpine, is only 75 per cent let. Beechwood Place shopping centre in
Cheltenham, undertaken jointly with developers Arrowcroft, is 50 per cent
empty. Even in those developments that have found tenants, costs have often
exceeded budget, while revenues have fallen short.
A striking feature of many of these development partnerships, in which the
commissioners provide most of the finance and the developers the expertise,
is their apparent generosity to the entrepreneurs. Under a formula known in
the property market as a 'profit erosion' deal, the developers sell the land
to the commissioners on day one. They then share some limited risk in the
development by agreeing to pay the commissioners a guaranteed rent for up to
two years after completion, regardless of whether the building fills up with
tenants.
But thereafter the commissioners are unprotected. In many cases they have
given the developers a 40 per cent share of the profits and assets.
According to property market experts approached by the Financial Times, this
looks on the high side. With hindsight, it has unquestionably proved to be
so in certain instances. A case in point was a partnership with Oxford &amp;
Cambridge Estates, run by Andrew Oakes, a former partner in agents Richard
Ellis. The partnership was set up in mid-1989 to develop a business park of
more than 300,000 sq ft near Banbury in Oxfordshire, with profits shared
60/40 in favour of the commissioners. By mid-1990 Oxford &amp; Cambridge was in
liquidation.
One of the most difficult of these speculative developments is at Ashford in
Kent, where the commissioners, jointly with Imry Merchant Developers, have
spent more than Pounds 65m buying agricultural land, and options on land,
covering 2,000 acres in all. The site, originally assembled by property
entrepreneur Jim Cookson, was another of the projects introduced to the
commissioners by Martin Landau. The plan is to build a giant office and shop
complex to benefit from the Channel Tunnel's main junction point in Kent.
But this grandiose vision is proving controversial. Local Anglicans have
been angered by the potential disruption of communities and have questioned
the scheme's financial soundness from the outset. Some protested directly to
Dr Robert Runcie when he was still Archbishop of Canterbury.
This was not the first time that the commissioners faced controversy over
the social consequences of their role as landlords. Part of their Paddington
estate used to contain pockets of prostitution, including an area near
Paddington Station known as Sin Triangle. And, in spite of being powerless
to act under the terms of 19th century leases, the commissioners were
accused of paying the clergy from the proceeds of immoral earnings. More
recently the commissioners have been forced to justify their investment
policies in the High Court by the Rt Rev Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford,
who rejected the idea that the church's interests were best served by
maximising investment returns.
Dr Runcie's response to criticisms of the proposed development at Ashford
was robustly commercial. 'We have to face the fact,' he said, 'that in many
parts of the country, development is the price we have to pay for economic
expansion.' His view appears not to have been shared by Chris Patten,
environment secretary at the time and a Roman Catholic, who rejected the
outline planning application. According to documents seen by the Financial
Times, the open market value of the site without planning consent was
estimated to be only Pounds 15m after the rejection, compared with its
original cost to the partners of Pounds 65m.
More than Pounds 200m of the write-down against the church's property
portfolio relates to developments such as these. The consequences for the
church's income, which is what really matters to the clergy, are depressing.
So why did the commissioners go out on such a limb?
The Financial Times asked Matthew Oakeshott, of Olim, the independent fund
manager which runs property portfolios for large pension funds and Oxford
Colleges, to look at the commissioners' annual report. He was struck by the
exposure to property, when compared with the average pension fund, the
property holdings of which are now down to 7 per cent. Oakeshott was also
surprised that the commissioners attributed their faltering income to
recession, since the property income of most long term funds continues to
rise.
He diagnosed a lack of clarity about performance objectives: if this were a
large pension fund it would be normal to have more information about the
management structure, clearer figures on investment returns and an attempt
to address the issue of asset allocation directly.
That view would apply with equal force to earlier annual reports.
Performance is mainly discussed in terms of individual asset categories such
as shares or property. No figures are given for the total return on the
funds. In the absence of any clear statement of long-term asset allocation
policy, says Oakeshott, they appear to be judge and jury in their own case.
Much the same might be said of the commissioners' advisers, Chesterton, in
the sense that they provide valuations for the property performance
measurement, as well as advising on purchases.
Sir Douglas Lovelock, the First Church Estates Commissioner, said the
commissioners decided to borrow for property development because they were
under pressure to generate more income to meet rising pension costs in the
early 1990s. Without borrowing, they could not have invested in such a big
development as the Metro Centre. Developments, he added, also provided an
element of diversification away from offices into retail property. The
commissioners, unlike some, had not been badly hurt in central London
offices, the worst hit area of the market.
'Ideally,' he said, 'we would have sold farms and offices, but we cannot do
it fast enough. We are reducing our property, and would like to reduce
further.' On the borrowing, he said: 'Hindsight does not lead me in a
different direction' and added that the borrowings were not high by the
standards of property companies.
It seems odd, however, to compare this arm of the Anglican church with a
property company. Other sources close to the commissioners suggest that the
decision to borrow may also have been indirectly influenced by pressure from
the National Audit Office, which vets the accounts. Under the 1947 Church
Commissioners' Measure, the commissioners are allowed to spend money on pay
and pensions only out of earned income, a rule designed to protect the
interests of tomorrow's clergymen against those of today. Within that
constraint, property development creates problems because it depletes income
during the long gestation period before developments generate revenue.
In their earlier developments financed from their own resources, the
commissioners found a means of smoothing their overall income through the
separate subsidiary companies that undertook the developments. While these
were legal, the National Audit Office is believed to have worried about the
spirit of the arrangements.
By borrowing money on which the interest was rolled up until completion of
the development, the commissioners' current income has been protected from
an interest charge now running at more than Pounds 50m a year. They have
also had the benefit of high money market interest rates on sums set aside
to repay the borrowings. But now that borrowings must be repaid, the fat
receipts from money market accounts are being replaced by very low returns
on property. Hence the income crisis and the demands now being made of
Anglican parishioners.
The Church Commissioners have been obliged to sell off many of their better
properties while the market is at its lowest level for many years. The
clergy, whose average annual income is little more than Pounds 12,000, is no
doubt meekly accepting the commissioners' explanation of events, while the
Anglican laity reaches into its pockets with as much goodwill as it can
muster. In an organisation where questioning the performance of well-meaning
people might be seen as un-Christian, no investigation into the disaster has
been announced.
But not everyone has emerged poorer from the saga. While the commissioners
continued to increase their property holdings, one of their partners, Martin
Landau, was bought out of Imry in a takeover at the peak of the boom. While
investors in the bidding company, Marketchief, lost all their money - the
company is now the subject of a rescue led by Barclays Bank - the
irrepressible Landau is a tax exile in Monte Carlo.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Germans may raise discount rate in tightening of monetary
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FEVERISH debate is under way among members of the Bundesbank's central
council about whether and how to tighten monetary policy when they meet next
Thursday.
Some tightening, which would upset Germany's European trading partners so
soon after the Munich summit, is almost certain because of deep concern in
the Bundesbank at the rapid increase in money supply, fuelled by credit
growth.
However, an increase in the internationally-sensitive Lombard rate, which at
9.75 per cent has set the effective floor for official interest rates in the
European Monetary System since December, is not at present being considered.
Instead the debate centres on a possible increase in the discount rate,
which since December has been
8 per cent - its highest level since the 1930s - or a limitation of the
amount of money banks can borrow from the Bundesbank against collateral at
the Lombard rate.
The former option has been canvassed by some of the powerful anti-inflation
hawks among Germany's regional central bankers, including Mr Lothar Muller,
president of the state central bank of Bavaria. It is thought that Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, favours limiting banks' access to
Lombard credit.
The Bundesbank is being driven to further action because there are no signs
that the present high level of German interest rates is damping down money
supply growth and because of its deep disquiet at the way
government-subsidised credits for rebuilding eastern Germany are seemingly
being diverted to fuel consumption.
Under a long-standing arrangement, next Thursday's council meeting is due to
carry out the Bundesbank's traditional mid-year review of money supply
trends.
With the latest month's statistics showing annual growth of about 9 per cent
in M3, the Bundesbank's chosen aggregate, against an annual target range of
3.5-5.5 per cent, members feel that the occasion cannot pass without a
determined signal to the government and the German people that the
Bundesbank is serious about wanting to cut inflation.
Mr Muller has suggested the council should send a stiff warning to the
government about its failure to cut subsidised credits and other subsidies
and publicise this decision after the meeting. He is deeply sceptical
whether the Bonn government's recently-announced plans to curb public sector
borrowing and spending are tough enough.
It is impossible to predict exactly what the Bundesbank council will do.
Council members will still be making final assessments of the latest
monetary trends next week while the D-Mark's recent strength could persuade
some that only modest monetary tightening is needed.
An increase in the discount rate could be portrayed in this light. The rate
is less important internationally than the Lombard rate and yet it
influences some domestic consumer and business borrowing costs. However, a
discount rate increase would also have a psychological impact and could
therefore spill over into the foreign exchange market giving the D-Mark a
further boost.
Any such development would create tensions in the EMS and cause dismay among
Germany's partners where impatience with high German interest rates is
growing.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Search for Times editor promptsshake-up of top newspaper
jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEARCH for a new editor of The Times has triggered a surprise shake-up
at the top of three leading British newspapers.
New editors will take over at the Daily Mail, the London Evening Standard
and the Mail on Sunday - all owned by Associated Newspapers - and Mr Simon
Jenkins, editor of The Times, yesterday announced that he would step down
when a replacement was found.
The round of editorial musical chairs was prompted earlier this week when Mr
Paul Dacre, editor of the Evening Standard, was twice offered - and turned
down - the editorship of The Times, one of the most illustrious jobs in
British journalism.
Instead, Mr Dacre, who became editor of the Evening Standard last year, was
appointed editor of the Daily Mail, taking over from Sir David English, who
held the post for just over 21 years. Sir David will become chairman of
Associated Newspapers as well as remaining group editor-in-chief.
Mr Jonathan Holborow, deputy editor of the Daily Mail, becomes editor of the
Mail on Sunday, and Mr Stewart Steven, currently editor of the Mail on
Sunday, takes over the Evening Standard.
Viscount Rothermere, Associated's proprietor, gives up his chairmanship of
the newspaper subsidiary but remains chairman of its holding group, the
Daily Mail and General Trust.
The saga began in London some weeks ago when Mr Dacre was interviewed by Mr
Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corporation, and Mr Andrew Knight,
executive chairman of News International, its UK subsidiary which owns five
national newspapers, including The Times. The interview was followed this
week by the two formal offers of the job.
The offers precipitated the changes at Associated, which was keen to keep Mr
Dacre, but according to one senior executive only brought forward by a
couple of months what was likely to happen anyway.
Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, said last night
that the changes would release tremendous energy.
Mr Jenkins, who has edited The Times since March 1990, told his editorial
staff yesterday afternoon that he would be giving up the editorship of The
Times before next March.
He said he had always made it clear he was a short-term editor and that he
wanted to resume his writing career within two years. He had agreed to stay
for a third year - until March 1993 - to enable a new editor to be found.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Italian austerity budget to overhaul pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Italian cabinet last night announced an emergency austerity budget,
which included a long-awaited shake-up of the country's generous pensions
system, increases in wealth and property taxes, cuts in public spending and
a freeze on public sector employment.
Mr Giuliano Amato's government, which obtained a vote of confidence from
parliament a week ago and is backed by the Christian Democrats, Socialists,
Social Democrats and Liberals, has been forced into the move because of an
overshoot in spending.
The original 1992 budget envisaged a public sector deficit of L128,000bn
(Pounds 82.62bn), but this was expected to reach L175,000bn, equivalent to
almost 11 per cent of GDP. The latest measures seek to produce an extra
L15,000bn in cuts and L15,000bn in revenues.
The main revenues will come from special taxes on property, bank deposits
and deposits in postal savings. Overall, these new wealth taxes are expected
to raise L11,200bn. Further revenue will come from increases in stamp duty,
the cost of passports and some licences. Property taxes will also be raised,
and monitored more closely.
The government stepped back from its earlier intentions of increasing income
tax after strong union objections. But it increased social security
contributions by 1 percentage point for the self-employed and 0.8 per cent
for salaried workers.
More significant was the decision to reform the pensions system. The
pensionable age will be raised gradually to 65, from the current 55 years
for women and 60 for men, while the minimum contributions period to qualify
for pensions was raised from 15 to 20 years. Private pension funds are also
to be encouraged.
The cuts in spending centred on a freeze on new employment in public
administration and state companies.
The need for urgent action was underlined yesterday as the lira came under
renewed pressure on the foreign exchange markets and the Bank of Italy was
obliged to raise its short-term interest rates to more than 15 per cent.

<TEXT>
FRANS SWARTTOUW, a prominent member of the supervisory board of Fokker, the
Dutch aircraft builder, has resigned his post in a further sign of the
controversy aroused by the proposed sale of a 51 per cent stake in the
company to Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany.
Mr Swarttouw (above), a former Fokker management board chairman and the man
associated with the successful launch of a new generation of aircraft in the
1980s, had threatened to resign last month but retracted the warning after
his views were leaked to the press.
His resignation from the eight-member board underlines Dutch fears that
Fokker would be downgraded to an assembly operation if it were taken over by
Dasa, which is owned by the Daimler-Benz industrial group.
The Dutch government, with 32 per cent of Fokker's shares, wants guarantees
that Fokker would continue to be fully involved in designing and marketing
new aircraft.
Talks between Fokker and Dasa were launched in March but have taken longer
than expected because of Dutch efforts to build in safeguards about Fokker's
future role. The two sides hope to reach an agreement that would win Dutch
government approval by the end of this month.
Yesterday, employees at Fokker's aircraft-assembly plant in Amsterdam downed
tools briefly to seek explanations from management about a report claiming
that the new German majority shareholder would gain virtually full
management control and that it might move part of production abroad.
Mr James Bryan, head of Airbus in the US, has resigned two days after the
European consortium clinched a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) United Airlines
order. Mr Bryan said he was leaving to pursue other interests.

OMV, the Austrian oil group which the government is planning to merge with
the Verbundgesellschaft utility, expects to make a positive operating profit
this year.
The company said it would make operating losses of around Sch500m (Dollars
47.2m) for the first half of 1992 but would end the year with a
significantly positive result.
Wolfgang Ruttensdorfer, finance director, said half-year figures were not
yet available but he expected OMV's second-quarter performance to match the
first when an operating loss of Sch247m was incurred.
Richard Schenz, interim company chairman, said he expected the company's
performance to improve in the second half.
OMV's energy operations, suffering from bad oil refining profit margins, had
poor results in April and May. But there was a significant improvement in
profitability in in June.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRANSPORT aircraft arm of McDonnell Douglas, the defence and aerospace
group, is to cut its workforce by up to 5,000 people or about 16 per cent,
this year largely because of declining new jetliner orders.
About half of the latest layoffs will come from workers indirectly involved
in producing aircraft. The rest will come from employees directly involved
in production.
Douglas Aircraft, which employees about 36,000 people, has already slashed
17,000 indirect jobs since April 1990 with about 7,000 from normal
attrition.
The company said the latest cuts were part of its new 'zero-based' budgeting
effort, which involves keeping only those positions essential to making
aircraft.
In a letter to employees, Mr Robert Hood, president of Douglas Aircraft said
one of the most immediate challenges to the company 'is to lower expenses to
be better aligned with the expected lower revenues which are the result of
the prolonged slump in the airline industry. This means we must reduce the
number of people in addition to cutting other expenses.'
There has been widespread speculation that a project to build a MD-12
super-jumbo jet in partnership withTaiwan Aerospace has been foundering. Mr
Hood said talks with Taiwan have slowed but the company is continuing to
make progress in talks with other potential partners.
'I remain personally convinced we will successfully negotiate a mutually
satisfactory agreement with investors in Taiwan.'
In a separate announcement, the company said it will lay off about 100
employees at its electronic systems operations.

A 17-MONTH quest by Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa to take full control
of Cavendish International ended yesterday when the company's shareholders
approved a HK5.50-a-share offer.
An extraordinary general meeting egm voted 96 per cent in favour of the
offer which valued Cavendish at HKDollars 16bn (USDollars 2.07bn) and
required an outlay of HKDollars 5.8bn by Hutchison for the 36.63 per cent of
the company it did not already own.
Hutchison first bid for Cavendish in February last year. But, in a rare
upset for Mr Li, shareholders rejected the then HKDollars 4.10 offer.
Cavendish was formed in 1987 to act as a holding company for some of Mr Li's
property and energy interests. Aside from property, it owns a third of
Hongkong Electric and 24.5 per cent of Husky Oil of Canada.

FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Market to be made in HSBC's HKDollars
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER SOME last minute arm-twisting, the London Stock Exchange yesterday
assembled a group of six market makers prepared to make sterling quotes in
HKDollars -denominated shares in HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, just hours before they were due to start trading.
On Thursday, the original group of market makers pulled out after County
NatWest decided not to make sterling quotes of the HKDollars shares.
Hongkong Bank's shares are split between the UK (worth Pounds 2.6bn) and
Hong Kong (Pounds 5.6bn).
The plan to quote sterling prices in the HKDollars line, in addition to the
new sterling denominated shares, was abandoned because of concerns about low
volume, according to firms involved.
On Friday morning, James Capel, Hongkong Bank's broker, helped arrange group
of market makers, comprising Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Cazenove, James Capel,
Morgan Stanley International, Smith New Court and SG Warburg.
Sterling quotes on both lines of HSBC shares started at 2.30pm yesterday,
after Hongkong Bank's Pounds 3.6bn offer for Midland Bank became fully
unconditional.
Failure to assemble a group of market makers could have resulted in a change
to the planned weighting of HSBC in both the FT-SE 100 and FTA indices,
which might have depressed the share price.
In the event, the indices will take quotes from both lines on SEAQ, combined
to reflect the capital of the whole company, according to Mr Mark Makepeace,
secretary to the FT-SE steering committee.
'We did not know until (yesterday) morning that the decision on marketmaking
had implications for the index weighting,' said one market maker, adding
that this consideration helped tip the balance.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe)
yesterday launched equity options on sterling-denominated HSBC shares.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Letter: Opera was a fine piece of farce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN MILLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have just had a chance to read, belatedly, the criticism of Il
Viaggio a Reims, to which Max Loppert audaciously put his name (Arts, July
6).
Mr Loppert's admiration for the opera appears to be restricted to its
abstract form, that is to say to the 'notes and words' on the page. Perhaps
he would have been happier to remain at home reading the libretto and
imagining how the opera would be performed in the ideal world. Then his idea
of a 'light-as-air comedy' would not have to be 'transmogrified into a tacky
hotel caper'. However, it is John Cox's job to transfer a work from the page
to three dimensions and it is unfortunate that his endeavours seem to have
caused Mr Loppert and his friends so much pain.
I find it difficult to believe that Il Viaggio should be construed primarily
as a 'vision of human peace, concord and harmony . . .']
While this element is certainly present, much more present is the element of
festivity. Mr Loppert winces at its transformation into 'bone-achingly
tedious farcical sketches' and suggests that these lacked originality;
indeed that the hooped petticoat gag, the St Trinian's schoolgirls in specs
with bowls of flowers gag, etc, appear in most operas.
I like farce. The rest of the spectators also seemed to like it. I was most
of all surprised by the singer's acting ability. How rare it is to see a
singer act well and much of the humour came from this quality. As for being
one-dimensional, I can only say that the superimposed modern themes were
treated with an admirable irony and ambiguity.
Punters in need of laughter, refreshment and a purging of the spirit should
attend. Mr Loppert should seek out other means.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Turnaround at the table: Recession is hitting restaurants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Had he not been born into a family of hoteliers, Rocco Forte, chief
executive of Forte plc, would have made a very successful football manager.
That is the conclusion many observers of the hotel and leisure industry, now
one of the country's biggest employers, must draw after his two recent
signings.
Forte has just recruited Bob Payton, one of the most innovative
restaurateurs of the 1980s, to take over the company's aesthetically
stunning, but, until now, gastronomically unexciting, Criterion Brasserie in
Piccadilly Circus. And on August 3, Nico Ladenis will relinquish his two
Michelin stars and take over the stoves in the restaurant at Forte's
flagship hotel, the Grosvenor House, to be renamed Nico at Ninety.
Forte's acumen may eventually be proved to be beyond reproach although there
is no doubt that both developments carry a considerable risk. But what his
competitors are finding hard to digest are the commercial implications - why
have two of the industry's strongest individuals pledged their futures to
the leviathan of the industry?
Ladenis and Payton made their names in an industry that has always welcomed
the small entrepreneur. They started in the res-taurant trade more than 10
years ago at a time when few other businesses required such a small capital
investment and unsoph-isticated means of production. And for financial
reasons, and tax benefits, you could keep it in the family too.
The business became more complicated with the introduction of VAT: the
advent of the Inland Revenue's detailed scrutiny of service charges and the
use of part-time staff, and the widespread disappearance of cash and its
replacement by the ubiquitous credit card. Costs also rose - rents, the
business rate and wages - and the 1990 Food Safety Act demanded a
considerable level of sophistication and technology.
But there were compensations. Everyone has to eat (a fact that causes
considerable envy among the restaurant trade's sister, the drinks business)
and eating out became a growth industry. For the well-situated restaurant
there were two bites at the cherry every day: business-oriented lunches and
social dinners. One of the maxims of the restaurant trade during the 1980s
was that if you could secure satisfied customers paying with corporate
credit cards at lunch, they would come back in the evening and spend their
own money.
For most of the 1980s, restaurateurs made substantial profits. But the trade
is so open and competition so fierce - for the most attractive plates, the
plushest chairs, the heaviest crystal glassware - that they were quickly
spent. Chefs even tried to outdo each other behind the scenes. One
restaurant opened in London's West End late last year with a range of ovens
that cost Pounds 100,000. There was little left for the rainy days.
The clouds burst in the late 1980s with the stock market crash and
recession. Financial controllers put the squeeze on corporate spending,
lunchtime bookings disappeared and as, personal disposable in-comes were
cut, so were the restaurants' evening takings.
The consequence, for the past two years, has been gloom and doom in the
restaurant trade. Many have closed permanently; some have changed identity
and reopened as brasseries, bistros or trattorias. Many have signed up with
American Express in an attempt to improve their marketing - a strategy that
five years ago would generally have been regarded as unnecessary. In three
months this year, American Express signed up 722 new restaurant customers
including a couple of two-star Michelin restaurants.
And yet, in spite of the recession, many restaurants are busier than ever.
This apparent paradox hides a significant shift in our attitude to eating
out. The reliance during the 1980s on the corporate credit card is today a
liability. What today's successful restaurants are doing is appealing to
those who are spending their own money and are doing so with a
discrimination not previously associated with the British diner.
Those who enjoy eating out also seem to be combining an eye for economy with
continued culinary pleasure. Industry estimates suggest that a household
which would previously have allowed Pounds 100 per month for two evenings
out has now decided to save 20 per cent and spend only Pounds 80. But they
are simultaneously trading up and to make it a memorable occasion are
spending the total on one dinner.
This economy brings with it a natural conservatism. Rather than face
disappointment elsewhere, many are choosing to re-turn frequently to their
fav-ourite restaurant. Once a res-taurant has captured such customers the
rewards can be significant. A considerable proportion of the restaurants
which have opened in London in the past six months have already achieved
this - Belgo, L'Accento, Stephen Bull's Bistro, The Square and Snows on the
Green. Forte, and his shareholders, will be hoping that Ladenis and Payton
will quickly achieve the same success.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write in response to Mr Dominic Lawson's column ('Blood on their
cheque books', July 4) to put the record straight on a number of points he
raised about pictures published in the Sunday Times Magazine. Colorific
represents the New York news and feature agency Black Star, which
distributed Bruce Haley's photographs from Burma of the killing performed by
a member of the Karen National Liberation Army.
It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the motives of the editor of
The Sunday Times Magazine in publishing the photographs, but I should make
it clear that Bruce Haley, like countless news photographers before him, had
to make the choice whether to document the events happening before him or to
do nothing. Certainly he had no indication of what was about to happen, and
to have attempted to prevent the killing would probably have resulted in
more bloodshed. To imply, as Mr Lawson does, that the events were staged for
him is to impute to Haley motives totally uncharacteristic of this
photographer.
Haley chose to take the photographs, and I know he feels that their
publication (and they have been published in America) might highlight the
full horror of such senseless acts of savagery. It is highly arguable
whether Haley's presence exacerbated the situation, and I find Mr. Lawson's
contention that Haley choreographed the execution unworthy of a journalist
of his standing. Christopher Angeloglou,

<TEXT>
I can get it for you wholesale,' has long been one of New York City's
best-known street cries. Today's foreign visitor might be moved to reply in
the words of the Rodgers and Hart song: 'I'll take Manhattan.'
The recent slide in the dollar has shaken loose a windfall of bargain prices
in the Big Apple. Yesterday, the US currency closed in London at Dollars
1.92 to the pound, 21 cents below its high for the year in late March.
The good news starts with hotels. A double room at the Plaza, the Fifth
Avenue establishment owned by fallen property tycoon Donald Trump, can be
had for Dollars 246 a night, including taxes. At Dollars 1.90 to the pound -
the exchange rate used throughout this article - that is 28 per cent less
than the cheapest double room at London's Savoy.
On nearby Madison Avenue, the even more exclusive Carlyle Hotel offers a
three-course lunch for Dollars 29. That works out at two-thirds the price of
the Pounds 25 set lunch at the Connaught, the Carlyle's nearest London
equivalent - though a 20 per cent tip is de rigueur at the Carlyle.
For those on a tighter budget, a Big Mac hamburger and french fries goes for
Dollars 3.55 on Manhattan, 18 per cent less than the Pounds 2.27 at a
McDonald's in London.
A similar bargain awaits opera-lovers. One of the best seats in the house at
the Metropolitan Opera will set them back Dollars 110, a one-third saving on
the Pounds 87 for a front-stalls ticket at Covent Garden.
But if musicals are more to your taste, London still has the edge - just. A
front-stalls ticket for Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre costs
Pounds 31.50, including booking charge, 9 per cent less than for the same
show on Broadway.
London also scores heavily when it comes to medical treatment. In New York,
where doctors notoriously specialise in diseases of the rich, the cheapest
private room at the Tisch clinic costs Dollars 893 a night, four-fifths more
than the Pounds 215 at London's University College Hospital. A typical upper
east side dentist, meanwhile, charges Dollars 175 for a small filling, half
as much again as the Pounds 60 demanded by his Harley Street counterpart.
However, New York spectacle prices are a snip. Lenscrafters, a US optical
retailer, charges as little as Dollars 69.95 for a pair of prescription
lenses and frames. But the lowest price at Lenscrafters' outlet in the
Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex, is Pounds 60  - a difference of
almost two-thirds.
There are also wide discrepancies in the prices charged by some other
retailers with outlets on both sides of the Atlantic. New York is 21 per
cent cheaper than London for a pair of Gucci loafers and 33 per cent cheaper
for a pair of US-made Timberland shoes.
However, bottles of shampoo and lotion cost almost 50 per cent more at the
Body Shop in New York than in London, while there is virtually no difference
in the prices of Rolex Oyster Perpetual wristwatches and Hermes ties.
Probably the biggest savings of all are on electronic goods. Differences of
at least 30 per cent are common in the after-tax prices of products such as
computers, consumer electronic products and compact discs sold in New York
and London - and in some cases the differences exceed 45 per cent.
The prices given in the table were obtained this week from similar types of
outlets. For instance, prices for the Apple Powerbook were from authorised
Apple dealers in both cities, while those for the Sony Handycam were
obtained from retailers which advertise discounts on the recommended retail
price.
Car prices in Britain, already high by comparison with those in many other
European Community countries, look even more exorbitant when set against US
levels. Toyota's Lexus luxury saloon, the Japanese carmaker's successful
rival to BMW and Mercedes-Benz, sells for 29 per cent less in New York than
in London. That is in spite of a recent luxury tax in the US and a cut in
the special car tax in the UK.
In most other cases, though, New York prices are flattered by an 8.25 per
cent sales tax, which compares with Britain's 17.5 per cent value added tax.
HM customs also spoils some of the cut-price fun by charging VAT and duty on
all imports worth more than Pounds 32 Yet in spite of these obstacles,
ingenious consumers can still make transatlantic shopping pay - without
resorting to smuggling. Indeed, they do not even need to leave Britain: they
can take advantage of bargain US prices by buying from American mail order
houses.
Many appear already to be doing so, to judge by the growing number of
inquiries which UK Customs and Excise says it is receiving about the exact
rates of duty payable on different types of mail order products imported
from the US.
Lands' End, an American mail order house which specialises in casual
clothing, recently responded to this growing demand by establishing a
heavily-advertised UK sales operation. However, the astute British
bargain-seeker would do far better to buy direct from Lands' End in the US
(mailing address: 1 Lands' End Lane, Dodgeville, WI 53595).
A men's cotton Oxford shirt listed at Pounds 25.50 (plus Pounds 2.95 postal
charge) in the British Lands' End catalogue sells for Dollars 23.50 in the
US - less than half the price. Even after import duty, VAT and air mail
postage to the UK, the shirt costs 25 per cent less ordered from the US than
in Britain.
Such price differences are only partly due to the dollar's recent decline,
which in any case takes time to feed through into market prices. Indeed, as
the 'effective' exchange rates in the table show, many products would still
be bargains by British standards, even if the dollar rebounded to Dollars
1.50 to the pound - or even higher.
In other words, many internationally-traded goods - particularly those
produced in Japan - have long been much cheaper in the US than in Britain.
The price discrepancies are too big to be explained away simply by customs
duties and transport and distribution costs. Unless one believes that many
producers have consistently pursued a suicidal policy of selling in the US
at below cost, the obvious conclusion is that British consumers are paying
over the odds for internationally-traded goods.
This may partly reflect superior efficiency and lower margins in the US
retail trade. But the recent growth in the UK of 'grey' imports, such as
computers, at prices well below manufacturers' recommended retail prices,
suggests producers have also sought to segment the market by charging widely
varying prices in different countries.
EC competition rules prohibit differential pricing of identical products
between Community countries. In theory, it ought not to occur on a large
scale or over long periods in an efficient global market. Instead of
marvelling at how low prices are in the US, perhaps British consumers - and
competition authorities as well - should be asking some pointed questions
about why they are so high at home.
Meanwhile, they can always console themselves by taking a trip to Florida's
Disneyworld: a one-week flight and hotel package for two adults and two
children costs Pounds 1,900. That is Pounds 700 more than a four-night
package trip to Eurodisney, just outside Paris. But the Florida trip works
out Pounds 30 cheaper on a daily basis, the cost of living is much lower
than in France - and brilliant sunshine is virtually guaranteed.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Mr Lamont's long voyage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR of the exchequer is convinced that there is no better
alternative than the policies now being pursued by the British government.
What is certain is that there is no alternative for this government but to
pursue these policies. Mr John Major has run the flag of the ERM to the top
of his government's mast and there it must stay, unless blown away by the
economic storms.
Mr Lamont talked enticingly in yesterday's speech to the European Policy
Forum of the safe harbour that the UK is set to reach. 'Under Margaret
Thatcher,' he argued, 'the 1980s saw huge improvements in the performance of
the supply side of the the British economy . . . But the unfinished business
of the 1980s was inflation. If we can only combine this dynamic supply-side
performance with an environment of permanently low inflation, we can build a
truly world-class economy . . . in the 1990s and beyond.'
The voyage will be longer and harder than the chancellor had earlier
suggested. But the reduction in retail price inflation, excluding mortgage
interest relief, to 4.8 per cent in the year to June 1992 is an achievement.
Annual pay settlements are also running at 4 per cent. If the present
squeeze continues - and everything suggests it will - underlying inflation
may well fall to 2 per cent in the next couple of years.
Albeit welcome, lower inflation will not necessarily bring recovery nearer.
In the debt-laden housing market, the prospect of negligible house price
inflation means that those with negative equity will have to save to cover
the shortfall. In a highly indebted economy like the UK today, prospects for
recovery depend heavily on the level of real interest rates. But unless
nominal interest rates fall pari passu, lower inflation will raise real
interest rates.
Ineffectual summit
Nominal interest rates will not fall soon. What matters most of all is the
level of German interest rates, on which the news looks bad. The British
economic vessel is, in fact, voyaging between the Scylla of German monetary
overshooting and the Charybdis of US dollar depreciation. The extent of the
policy divergence was merely underlined at this week's ineffectual summit of
the group of seven industrial countries.
The dollar has fallen from DM1.67 in mid-April to DM1.50 yesterday, which is
not far from its all-time low of DM1.45. This decline reflects not only the
yield gap between German and US short-term interest rates, which is at the
unprecedented level of six and a half percentage points, but also the
negligible prospect of early US monetary tightening.
Dollar weakness directly undermines UK competitiveness, with overall
sterling appreciation of a little under 1 per cent since mid-April. More
importantly, it influences the pound's position within the ERM. Sterling's
exchange rate against the D-Mark has fallen to DM2.8725 from DM2.945 in
early May. This puts it outside its narrow band limits, to which yet again
the chancellor has committed the government.
Uncomfortable position
Unhappily, dollar weakness is not the only misery the UK economy has to
endure. The Bundesbank is about to reset its monetary targets next week, at
a time when German monetary overshooting persists. It finds itself in a most
uncomfortable position: if it tightens monetary policy, it will face uproar
in Europe; if it does not tighten monetary policy, the credibility of its
monetary targets will be undermined. In this particular contest, it would be
far safer to bet on monetary tightening, though perhaps in a slightly
disguised form.
With such ill economic weather, the chancellor can do little more than offer
the hope of a safe arrival in the promised harbour. But he also rejects all
alternative routes. On many points, he is unquestionably correct:
the UK cannot hope to enjoy significantly lower interest rates than Germany
within the ERM;
a German realignment against other ERM currencies does not look at all
likely;
a sterling devaluation within the ERM is far more likely to raise UK
interest rates than lower them; and
simply leaving the ERM is bound to be seen as yet another British flight
into the inflationary never never land.
The only serious alternative would be to leave the ERM while establishing
strong domestic institutional arrangements, including an independent central
bank, to achieve the goal of non-inflationary growth. This is theoretically
possible. There is no a priori reason why what New Zealand has managed is
impossible for the UK. Nor is it inconceivable that British interest rates
would be below the German: by now the interest rates of most developed
economies whose currencies are not directly linked to the D-Mark are below
the German level.
Nevertheless, any such move would destroy this government's economic policy,
its European policy and quite possibly the government itself. The chancellor
is bound to remain on his present course for the foreseeable future. But the
international weather is getting very rough. The passengers must hope to
escape sea sickness or, worse, drowning.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Business advice bodies are criticised: Heseltine deplores
'low' standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUALITY of much advice to businesses is 'too low', Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, said yesterday.
He added at a conference in Birmingham of Training and Enterprise Councils
that providers of advice should aim for much higher standards and greater
professionalism.
'Nowhere near enough Tecs, chambers of commerce, local enterprise agencies
or other support agencies come close to meeting these tough criteria at
present,' he said.
'Standards are simply too low across the network as a whole, and I see it
very much as our joint responsibility to take the necessary action to bring
these new networks into a more effective partnership.'
He said the government intended to boost the establishment of 'first-stop
shops' to give advice to businesses by setting up a pilot network of 15
'shops' in the autumn. He was keen to speed up the establishment of the
'shops' and iron out conflicts between some Tecs and other providers of
advice including chambers of commerce.
Tecs, which operate throughout England and Wales, have a role in providing
advice, particularly to small businesses. Some work with chambers, but
others have set up their own membership schemes, raising fears among local
chambers of an erosion of their own membership income.
Chambers believe Mr Heseltine's department is seeking to play a mediating
role in conflicts between Tecs and chambers. The DTI has taken over some
business advisory work previously carried out by the Department of
Employment.
The 'first-stop shops' are designed to provide central points at which
businesses can seek advice on issues such as export procedures,
capital-raising and compliance with health, safety and employment laws. They
will also be expected to bring together the small-business responsibilities
of the DTI and the Department of Employment.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Ferry row referred to police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGAL wrangle over one of the oldest ferry routes in Europe took a new
turn yesterday after the operators of the cross-Thames service announced
that they had passed files to the police alleging that the Crown Estate
could be open to prosecution if it forces closure of the service.
The rights to the crossing are owned by the Crown Estate. It has told White
Horse Ferries, operators of the Tilbury-Gravesend ferry service, to stop
journeys on the route.
The Crown Estate, which manages property owned by the sovereign, says the
route licence held by the previous operator was non-transferable.
The company has defied the order to halt services and is seeking damages for
loss of revenue and a fall in passenger numbers.
White Horse has now sent to the police details of legal judgments indicating
that the commissioners acting for the Crown Estate may risk committing an
offence if the service is closed. White Horse says it is an offence if a
ferry owner breaches its common-law obligation to operate a service. Essex
police confirmed yesterday that they had received the documents.
Copies of the judgments have also been sent to the Crown Estate, which said
it was seeking legal advice.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Revving up for the Pounds 20m Mansell show: John Griffiths
visits Silverstone racetrack, where business is thriving for this weekend's
British Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEKEND, a 750-acre corner of Britain has found a temporary cure to the
economic malaise sweeping the rest of the country: the racing driver Nigel
Mansell.
While the weather and economic clouds have cast gloom over this year's
corporate hospitality scene from Wimbledon to Royal Ascot, the organisers of
the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in Northamptonshire say they sold the
last available hospitality space three weeks ago.
Advance ticket sales have been 30 per cent higher than last year, when a
total of 200,000 people attended over the three days of practice and racing
 -making the grand prix the UK's single biggest paid spectator event.
At Silverstone, it was being taken for granted that the circuit's attendance
record would be broken this weekend as decisively as Mansell broke the lap
record in practice yesterday.
Pre-filed flight applications show that tomorrow Silverstone's grass strip
will once again become the world's busiest airfield, with nearly 3,000
movements, mainly of helicopters.
Ms Corinna Phillips, public-affairs manager for Silverstone Circuits, has no
doubt that it is because of 'the Mansell factor' - the increasing prospect
that this year Britain will have its first grand prix world champion since
James Hunt in 1976.
'Like everyone else, we had a slow start this year,' said Ms Phillips. 'But
when Mansell started winning, sales picked up enormously.'
Supporting Mansell's progress in person requires a substantial commitment of
the wallet for private and corporate punters alike. The basic admission
price is Pounds 50 on race day; an additional Pounds 100 secures a seat in
the grandstand.
While most corporate hospitality is handled by agencies such as Keith
Prowse, Silverstone Circuits offers its own direct hospitality package - at
Pounds 250 a head.
When ground rent payable by stallholders selling everything from T-shirts to
tow ropes is taken into account, total receipts accruing to Silverstone
Circuits are believed to approach Pounds 20m, although the figures are not
released.
The profits do not end up consolidated in the accounts of some large leisure
group. Silverstone Circuits is owned by the British Racing Drivers Club and
is charged with ploughing the proceeds into circuit facilities and
subsidising the lower-profile club racing on which Mansell and all his grand
prix colleagues cut their competitive teeth.
Mansell himself loves Silverstone. He regards it as his spiritual home and
it has been the scene of some of his greatest triumphs - not least a
crushing victory there last year. With time running out at the age of 38, he
now has his best chance yet of winning the world championship. He won the
season's first five races in a row - unprecedented in grand prix racing -
and then came second in Monaco to his arch-rival Ayrton Senna of Brazil,
driving for McLaren-Honda. He failed to finish in the Canadian grand prix,
but scored his sixth victory in France last weekend.
That win brought his total tally of victories to 27 - equalling Jackie
Stewart's 19-year-old record.
Yesterday he was at Silverstone driving his 700-horsepower Canon-sponsored
Williams-Renault FW14 B for the first practice.
Typically, he is still trying hard to damp down what he says is an
erroneous, if widely held, assumption that he has the championship in the
bag. 'I've only won 66 points and there's another 90 points to win.'
Realistically, he says, 'we know we'll get beaten sometimes in the next few
races'.
The lugubrious manner in which he doles out such sentiments, and his
frequent comments on mechanical shortcomings, have contributed to a
widespread media image of Mansell as a 'whinger' - an image hotly contested
by his team. Sheridan Thynne, Williams's long-standing finance director,
says: 'What the press interprets as whingeing is actually Nigel demanding
the highest standards.'
It is understandable that Williams and executives of Renault, the French
state-owned company that supplies his engines, should be so supportive of
Mansell. For Williams, this year's world championship would be its first
since 1987 and would greatly facilitate Thynne's task of raising the more
than Pounds 20m which, he says, Williams needs for each season's racing.
About 90 per cent of that comes from sponsorship. With the possible forced
retreat of the tobacco companies - because of threatened broadcasting
restrictions - the hunt for more sponsorship may soon become anxious. They
provided the lion's share of grand prix teams' funding.
The French anti-smoking lobby came close to blacking out the French grand
prix last weekend, winning a court ruling that for every tobacco name or
image broadcast, TFI television would be fined Pounds 1,000. TFI broadcast
anyway, and on the basis of the 1,250 such images shown on the preceding
Canadian grand prix, stands to be fined more than Pounds 1m.
It is away from the racetracks that a triumph by Mansell, Renault and
Williams over Honda would be most deeply appreciated. In the boardrooms and
research and development departments of Renault and other European car
companies, victory would be seen as the best possible riposte by a European
motor industry frequently depicted as withering under an unstoppable
technological onslaught from Japan.

FT  11 JUL 92 / All-seater soccer scheme modified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has backed down over its plan to make all soccer clubs in
England and Wales install all-seater stadia by the turn of the century.
Mr David Mellor, national heritage secretary, whose department has
responsibility for sport, said yesterday that clubs in the Second and Third
divisions will be exempt from the policy to scrap terracing. Those were the
clubs that were in the Third and Fourth divisions until the recent
introduction of the Premier League.
Clubs from the Premier League and the new First Division will still have to
provide all-seater stadia by 1994, as recommended by Lord Justice Taylor's
report after the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.
The Football League, which organises all clubs in England and Wales outside
the Premier League, said the decision would considerably ease the financial
burden on clubs. The league estimated that it would cost Second and Third
division clubs Pounds 77m to implement the Taylor report.
Mr Mellor warned Second and Third Division clubs not to see it as an 'easy
option'. Terracing would have to meet high safety standards, he said.
The Football League said it would encourage its members to 'work towards a
greater amount of seating and an upgrading of terraced accommodation'.
The government hinted at a change of heart at the beginning of June, when Mr
Mellor - a Chelsea supporter, like the prime minister - announced that he
was going to reconsider the all-seating requirements.
Mr Tom Pendry, Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde and chairman of the
all-party parliamentary football committee, described the announcement as 'a
show of good sense and responsibility', but he called for greater
flexibility on First Division clubs which attract crowds of less than
10,000.
In Scotland, the decision that First and Second division clubs should be
all-seated by the turn of the century is being reviewed. Scottish Premier
League clubs will have to introduce all-seater stadia by 1994.
Mr Peter Popper, a director at Higgs &amp; Hill, the construction company that
specialises in sports stadia, said Mr Mellor's announcement would not
significantly effect the construction industry.
'Because smaller clubs will not be building stadiums they could never
afford, they may be encouraged to make more ground improvements than was
previously the case,' he said.
Many clubs in the Second and Third divisions are believed to have delayed
efforts to introduce all-seater stadia in the hope that the government would
abandon its plans.

THE GOVERNMENT is to hold talks with institutional investors to see whether
a fresh initiative can be taken to build up the private rented housing
sector, Sir George Young, the housing minister, said yesterday.
'My vision is of good-quality, professionally managed accommodation for
rent, backed by long-term institutional investment,' he said at a meeting of
the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
Sir George also sharply rebuked critics of the mortgage-rescue scheme agreed
between the government and lenders last year.
'The mortgage-rescue package is forecast to rescue 55,000 people, many more
than originally forecast last December,' he said. Long-term arrears owed to
mortgage lenders had risen because lenders were avoiding repossessions.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Whistleblowers to be protected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS who blow the whistle on dangerous working practices will be
protected from employer victimisation, Mr Michael Forsyth, employment
minister, said yesterday .
Unions are likely to see the planned legislation as the first piece of
positive employment law brought forward by the four Conservative governments
since 1979.
The planned legislation will give workers the right to leave their
workplaces if they believe themselves in 'serious and imminent danger'. If
dismissed, they can take their employers to an industrial tribunal,
irrespective of length of service or hours of work.
Under present UK law, workers are usually barred from going to industrial
tribunals until they have served two years.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said: 'We
welcome the move as far as it goes.' He added that the two-year time bar
ought to be lifted.
Mr Nigel Harris, executive member of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union with responsibility for health and safety, welcomed the move. He said
hundreds of AEEU members had been dismissed for raising health and safety
issues.
The move is partly a response to the European requirement that workers
should not be penalised for refusing to obey instructions from their
employers that they believe are dangerous. It is also a response to claims
by oil unions - after the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, in which 167 men died -
that workers believe they face the sack if they raise health and safety
issues.
Mr Forsyth described victimisation of workers who raise safety claims as
'totally unacceptable'. He said: 'I know there is considerable anxiety among
the workforce about victimisation.'
Mr Ronnie McDonald, chairman of the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee, the
union for North Sea Oil workers, described the announcement as a 'publicity
stunt'.
He said the right to take employers to industrial tribunals was not adequate
protection: 'Tribunals have little real power.'
The Cohse health service union, is developing guidelines to help individuals
who are concerned about safety in the National Health Service after several
recent controversies over whistleblowing.
The union says a recent analysis of whistleblowers showed that all but one
had suffered retaliation from their employers and their colleagues.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Regulators bar two from audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO CERTIFIED accountants were barred from conducting audit work during the
first six months of the new self-regulatory mechanisms established by the
government last year, it emerged yesterday.
Officials at the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants have
restricted the practising certificate of two members since audit regulation
work began last October.
The figures emerge in the first submission to the Department of Trade and
Industry on audit regulation until the end of March, during which 94 visits
took place among the 3,000 certified accountants registered to conduct
audits.
Separately, the joint monitoring unit, which scrutinises auditors registered
with the three Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in
Scotland and in Ireland, has made no disqualifications. Its more up-to-date
figures show the unit has refused to register as auditors 1,108 accountants
from the 10,509 who had applied until last week.
The unit has carried out 44 visits to determine whether to register
accountants as auditors, and 80 visits to those already registered. That
includes 13 in response to complaints and 49 that were routine. It has
pledged to visit all the 163 auditors of listed companies every five years.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Hundreds of jobs to go at hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal London yesterday became the latest casualty of the financial
pressures facing the capital's hospitals and announced that several hundred
jobs are to be shed in the face of an expected Pounds 4m shortfall in income
this year.
Managers told staff that 400 to 600 posts must go because the hospital has
failed to attract sufficient contracts under the new system of health
financing to enable it to operate at full capacity. Compulsory redundancies
will be avoided as far as possible.
The Royal London, a teaching hospital serving the east end, became one of
the first self-governing trusts last year. Guy's, another of the first trust
hospitals in London, shed a similar number of jobs a year ago. Many other
large London hospitals, including the Middlesex and University College, face
serious financial pressures and are seeking economies.
Mr Peter Marshall, east London regional secretary of the Cohse health
workers' union, said: 'This appalling news is a direct result of the
introduction of untrammelled market forces into the health service. It is a
scandal that trained health staff will lose their jobs and services will be
cut in one of the poorest areas of London.'

FT  11 JUL 92 / MPs told of Imro 'shortcomings'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAILURE of the Invest-ment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) to
detect the plundering of pension schemes by Robert Maxwell arose from
'shortcomings of implementation', Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to
the Treasury, told the Commons yesterday.
'I do not accept that this case demonstrates that the supervisory structure
itself is deficient,' Mr Nelson said.
Acknowledging the need to strengthen the regulatory system, he emphasised
that the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) had decided to work on
correcting key shortcomings rather than withdraw recognition from Imro.
He denied that Imro warned the government that it could not carry out its
duties properly because of difficulties over the relationship between the
Financial Services Act regime and trust law.
Mr Nelson rejected further Labour demands that the government should
compensate the pensioners concerned. He insisted that no government could
accept a duty 'to make good losses resulting from fraud or theft of
savings'.
Mr Nelson said it was clear that the chain of responsibility had failings at
many links.
Mr Paul Boateng, a Labour spokesman on Treasury affairs, said: 'SIB was, in
its own way, as much to blame in these matters as Imro'. Both bodies, he
said, must bear a degree of culpability.
Mr Ken Eastham, Labour MP for Manchester, Blackley, warned that it would be
years before ordinary working people regained confidence in pension schemes.
Calling on Imro to provide compensation, he said: 'I am not talking about
petty cash like Pounds 2m or Pounds 3m.'
Mr Eastham said some kind of penalty should be imposed on Imro 'for its
incompetence and slackness regarding protection of pensioners' interests'.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Fresh legal hope for creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by four insolvent companies in the London United Investments
insurance group to put together schemes of arrangement for the benefit of
their creditors have been given a second impetus by the courts.
On Thursday, a ruling by the Court of Appeal increased the ability of the
Policyholders' Protection Board, whose support is crucial to the schemes, to
participate in them.
Yesterday a High Court judge held that deposits totalling about Dollars 98m
(Pounds 51.7m), held by banks in the names of the four companies, are the
absolute property of the companies.
Mr Justice Harman said that HS Weavers (Underwriting) Agencies, also a
wholly owned subsidiary of LUI, which acted as underwriting agent and
managing agent for the companies, had no right to any part of the deposits.
Kingscroft Insurance Co, El Paso Insurance Co, Lime Street Insurance Co and
Mutual Reinsurance Co, which are in provisional liquidation, have gross
liabilities of Dollars 2.5bn and assets of about Dollars 1.7bn.
They believe the proposed schemes, which would enable them to run off their
business in the normal way and pay a percentage of the claims, would be more
beneficial to their creditors than liquidation.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Discounting forces down retail inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION at the retail level has shown a sharp fall, helped by a drop in
the price of seasonal foods, widespread discounting in shops and only a
small rise in the prices of many services.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the retail prices index
(RPI) rose in the year to June by 3.9 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in May.
The June figure is the lowest since last October.
The RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - a measure favoured by the
Treasury as indicating underlying inflation - rose by 4.8 per cent in the 12
months to June after 5.3 per cent in May. That is the smallest increase in
the measure since June 1988.
The Treasury said that, on the basis of an unpublished internal study, the
equivalent inflation rate for the European Community as a whole was 4.9 per
cent in June. That meant UK inflation was for the first time since 1986
lower than the EC average, if the two are measured on a comparable basis.
Between May and June the RPI stayed unchanged at 139.3. There was a
relatively sharp 0.4 per cent increase in the index between the comparable
months last year.
Of the fall of 0.4 points between year-on-year inflation in May and June,
roughly half was due to a fall in the prices of seasonal foods, particularly
potatoes, British lamb and fresh fish.
Last month the price of this type of food fell by 2.9 per cent, while in
June last year - due largely to wet weather - prices increased by the same
amount. As a result of that statistical quirk, prices for seasonal foods
dropped 6.8 per cent in the 12 months to last month - the biggest
year-on-year drop for the items since 1984.
Prices of household goods such as furniture and carpets showed a 0.1 per
cent fall between May and June. That resulted in a year-on-year increase
last month of 2.6 per cent, the lowest for this class of goods since 1987.
Do-it-yourself products for home decorating also saw lower prices, as did
some processed vegetables such as baked beans.
Prices of leisure services, such as charges for sports activities and those
for personal services including hairdressing, both saw an increase of just
0.1 per cent between May and June.
Prices associated with motoring showed a 0.2 per cent increase between May
and June, to make the year-on-year rise in those prices last month 7.5 per
cent. Petrol prices fell during June by about 1p a gallon, while prices of
many secondhand cars went up.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Lamont says ERM will remain at centre of strategy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extracts from the speech by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to the
European Policy Forum yesterday:
Today's inflation figures marked another important milestone on Britain's
long road to permanently low inflation. For the first time since 1986, our
inflation, measured on a comparable basis, is lower than the European
Community average.
But just beating the average, when most of our competitors are seeking to
reduce inflation further, should not be good enough. Two thirds of our
exports go to countries with inflation rates lower than our own.
For almost two years, the government's counter-inflationary strategy has
been based on sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism. The ERM
is not an optional extra, an add-on to be jettisoned at the first hint of
trouble. It is and will remain at the very centre of our macroeconomic
strategy.
Retail price inflation has fallen from nearly 11 per cent at the time of
entry to less than 4 per cent today. As inflation has come down, we have
been able to cut interest rates nine times from 15 per cent to 10 per cent
today - below the average of the last 10 years.
Both management and unions are getting the message that if we want to
compete with the rest of Europe, we must not award ourselves pay increases
far in excess of their levels. Britain's trade performance has confounded
the pessimists. Exports are at a record level.
I cannot believe we could have achieved all this outside the ERM. But
despite these achievements, and the progress we are making towards our
medium-term objectives, there are those who try to blame the present
difficult economic situation on our membership of the ERM. As soon as the
going gets rough, the quest begins for the easy way out. They cast around
for a painless, cost-free route to higher growth with low inflation.
I would be the last person to say that - to coin a phrase - there is no
alternative to our present policy. Plenty of alternatives are suggested. But
in my view, they are all illusory or destined to fail. They would not
deliver low inflation.
Let me deal with each in turn:
Cut interest rates immediately. If any country within the ERM is to have
lower interest rates than Germany, the markets must expect its currency to
appreciate against the D-Mark.
But the D-Mark has never been devalued in the history of the ERM. So it is
scarcely surprising that foreign exchange markets are just not prepared to
hold ERM currencies yielding substantially less than the D-Mark.
Nevertheless, some suggest that Britain has more flexibility; that by
allowing the pound to fall to the bottom of its wider band, we would create
the scope for a subsequent appreciation, and hence our interest rates could
be much lower than Germany's. This is theoretically ingenious, but wholly
unrealistic.
If it were true, it would be the weakest currencies in the ERM that had the
lowest interest rates. But foreign exchange markets do not expect a weak and
falling currency, with low interest rates, to bounce back up again. They
expect it to carry on falling, and they sell it, forcing interest rates up.
So even with the extra flexibility afforded by the wide bands, I know of no
serious economic commentator or analyst who believes that sharp interest
rate cuts - from our current position, with rates just above those in
Germany - are a serious option within the ERM.
A German realignment. There are those who argue that Germany has been hit by
an exceptional, inflationary shock - that of reunification - and that the
rest of Europe is being forced to bear the consequences. The D-Mark should
therefore be realigned upwards.
No country in the ERM is look-ing in that direction. The issue is simply not
on the agenda. Devaluation within the ERM. It is patently absurd to suggest
that this would allow interest-rate cuts. When currencies devalue against
the D-Mark, the markets do not expect them to be revalued back up again.
They expect a further devaluation, and demand higher, not lower, interest
rates to compensate for that risk. So currencies that devalue pay an
interest-rate premium. A realignment could only put interest rates up, not
down.
Leave the ERM, cut interest rates and let the pound find its own level. It
sounds simple. After all, the US floats its currency; why shouldn't we do so
too? The British economy is far more dependent on international trade. More
than a third of our national output is exported, compared to just a tenth
for the US. For Britain, the threat of imported inflation is very real.
Many who advocate floating intend a devaluation of the pound. And they would
certainly achieve it. The result of leaving the ERM, combined with large
cuts in interest rates, would be a fall in the pound probably unprecedented
in the last 40 years. It's the cut-and-run option; cut interest rates and a
run on the pound. We know from bitter experience that devaluation just does
not work for Britain. The devaluations of the past yielded not booming
exports but a steadily falling share of world markets.
Outside the ERM, we would still have to compete with the ERM countries.
Markets would see that, unlike all our major European competitors, Britain
lacked the will to pursue the goal of permanently low inflation. And they
would be right. We would have given up after less than two years. They would
conclude that we were back to our bad old ways; that, given the chance, we
would always delude ourselves by thinking that with a little more inflation
we could get a little more growth.
The credibility of our anti-inflationary strategy with businesses and
employees would be in tatters.
And quite soon interest rates would have to go back up again - to much
higher levels than they are today.
Leave the ERM and set interest rates according to domestic monetary targets.
There are those who also seek a return to floating, but think we can control
inflation by fixing monetary targets and setting interest rates accordingly.
We have been here before. In the 1980s we fixed domestic monetary targets
and attempted to meet them by setting interest rates accordingly. But the
money supply figures often provided a poor guide to interest rate policy.
The government could not remain indifferent to the level of the exchange
rate. It is no surprise that most interest rate changes in the 1980s were
associated with movements in the exchange rate. So there is no reason to
believe that a floating exchange rate regime would lead to lower interest
rates. The experience of the 1980s suggests quite the opposite.
Those who advocate a return to floating sometimes dress up their arguments
in free-market language. They say that the exchange rate is simply a price
like any other, and that it is wrong, in a market economy, to try to fix
prices.
But if - as I believe - it is the responsibility of government not to
debauch the currency but to ensure that money retains its value, the
question we must ask is how we can best attain this objective. The evidence
of the last few years demonstrates that it is the ERM that is most likely to
deliver price stability in Britain.
So we have five options - five ways we could try to change the current
monetary policy. What they all have in common is that each is a plea for a
free lunch. Sadly, there is no such thing. As the Russians say, only
mousetraps have free cheese. The result of attempting to implement any of
them would be either higher interest rates, higher inflation, or most likely
both.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Maxwell City adviser gives fund Pounds 50,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATSON'S, the actuarial consultancy firm that acted as adviser to the
Maxwell Communication Corporation pension scheme, has donated Pounds 50,000
to the compensation scheme set up to aid the Maxwell pensioners. It is the
first City firm to make a donation.
The fund has received only one other donation so far, a Pounds 120,000
contribution from the National Association of Pension Funds.
Mr Alan Chaplin, a partner, said the firm decided to make the donation after
assurances that such a move would not imply any guilt or liability
Sir John Cuckney, a leading City figure and former chairman of 3i, the
venture capital group, has been seeking donations to the fund from firms
that had dealings with Robert Maxwell.
The scheme was set up nearly two months ago by Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, who said that those who had profited from their dealings
with Maxwell should help to cover the shortfall in assets from pension
schemes he controlled. More than Pounds 400m is missing from those schemes.
Mr Chaplin said that Watson's first became aware of 'serious irregularities'
in the MCC pension scheme on December 3 last year after a meeting it had
sought with the pension scheme manager. Watson's immediately contacted the
Occupational Pensions Board to advise them of the situation, he said.
Watson's most recent actuarial valuation of the MCC pension scheme was made
as of March 31 1988.
Another was due to be completed as of March 31 last year, but while
membership data required for the exercise had been received, information on
assets had not.
Watson's said that in addition to actuarial valuations, it advised MCC
itself on matters such as the pensions aspects of sales and purchases of
subsidiaries.

FT  11 JUL 92 / MoD optimistic over EFA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will meet his Italian and Spanish
counterparts next Tuesday to discuss the future of the European Fighter
Aircraft amid increasing optimism at the Ministry of Defence that the Pounds
20bn project can be saved.
The talks coincide with intensified lobbying by the UK aerospace industry,
which warned yesterday in a briefing paper that the collapse of the EFA -
which is in its developmental phase - would have severe consequences on
employment and the future competitiveness of the UK manufacturing industry.
Italy and Spain have signalled that they wish to continue with the project,
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said in a Commons debate
yesterday.
The MoD is also pressing for the EFA project to continue - in spite of
Germany's withdrawal from production and Treasury scepticism about the extra
costs that may now be involved.
At the London meeting, all three defence secretaries will discuss options
for continuing the project within budget.
Mr Aitken said discussions on the costs of the EFA had always been planned
for early next year, when the development phase was near completion. 'We are
now having these discussions a little earlier,' he said.
On the cost side, Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British
Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the UK industry's trade association, said
yesterday that the aerospace industry was 'dismayed' by views attributed to
the Treasury on its worries over the EFA costs. Those views indicated 'not
only reluctance to acknowledge the UK's defence policy commitments and a
lack of appreciation of the cost-effectiveness of EFA but also a large
degree of navety on industrial matters'.
He also warned that for many smaller companies involved in the EFA,
cancellation might lead to the collapse of the companies themselves.
The society argued that almost all the developing technologies that would
feature in the future of both civil and military aerospace 'are part and
parcel of the EFA development programme'.
It claimed that the companies involved in the EFA had already produced
substantial cost savings 'creating a unit price of less than Pounds 25m' per
aircraft. Government risk had also been minimised 'by the most stringent
contractual and performance agreements ever developed in the military
aircraft field'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S economy moved into high gear in the first half of 1992, with gross
national product rising an estimated 10 per cent over the same period last
year, according to the official People's Daily, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The newspaper attributed the high growth rate, which outstripped even the
government's most recent increased estimate, to a call in January by Deng
Xiaoping, the country's senior leader, for faster economic reform.
Preliminary statistics show that industrial production rose by 18 per cent
over the first half of the year. Retail sales rose 14 per cent. Customs
figures show exports rising 17 per cent to Dollars 35.6bn (Pounds 18.6bn),
and imports growing 23 per cent to Dollars 33.1bn.
Though the rapid growth has caused fears of overheating, the People's Daily
said market retail prices were basically stable, while commodity prices rose
by about 5 per cent over the first six months of 1992.
Premier Li Peng, a conservative who oversaw a three-year austerity programme
from 1988 designed to bring the economy back under control after a similar
period of rapid growth, told parliament in March the 1992 growth target was
6 per cent.
In a humiliating reversal, he was forced to amend his report to allow for
the possibility of higher growth in some areas. Last month, he climbed down
further by admitting that GNP growth would probably surpass 9 per cent.
Growth was 7 per cent in 1991.

The jury found that he and fellow corporate officers defrauded more than

The bonds proved to be worthless when Lincoln failed in what was the
costliest collapse in US banking history.
The damages were the largest awarded in the series of scandals that have

US producer prices rose modestly last month, providing further evidence that

IRAQ is pursuing plans for a pipeline through Jordan to export crude oil
from the port of Aqaba on the Red Sea once it returns fully to the oil
market, according to a report to be published on Monday in Petroleum
Intelligence Weekly (PIW), the leading oil industry newsletter, Mark
Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent, writes.
The report says talks between Iraq and Jordan were concluded in the spring
and that the Iraq State Company for Oil Projects began digging on its side
of the border a month ago. The pipeline, with 1m b/d capacity, would stretch
900km from Iraq's pump station at Haditha.

A hairdresser recently asked her view of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new
governor, furrowed her brow and said: 'Hmmm, Mr Patten; a very important
man.'
'Why?' 'Well, he's the chairman of Britain. Hong Kong is lucky to have such
an important man.'
The former chairman of the Conservative party might be taken aback by his
elevation, but then, to the Chinese, the word 'chairman' has a singular ring
to it.
An altogether different grassroots perception of the new governor is
provided by cartoonists in the leading local newspapers. They have lighted
on Mr Patten's somewhat corpulent demeanour and nicknamed him 'Fat Pang' -
Pang being the Chinese surname he has taken.
This is not a case of lese majeste as such - the Chinese will pick on
someone's most distinguishing feature be it a stammer, squint or limp and
turn it into a nickname - but more a piece of well-intentioned and
irreverent teasing.
But it is a nickname the governor will have to live with for the rest of his
time in Hong Kong. One newspaper, the Hong Kong Economic Journal, has begun
to run a daily comic strip entitled 'Fat Pang's Theatre'.
Mr Patten's desire to run an 'open and accessible' administration - one
element of which will be a form of prime minister's questions in the local
legislature - will no doubt provide fertile material for the colony's local
wags.
So may his desire to run a 'presidential' style of government. Yesterday, he
held one of the largest press conferences the colony has seen in the garden
of his official residence. It was not quite the White House Rose Garden, but
the tone was unmistakable. Mr Patten intends to lead from the front.

<TEXT>
INDIA'S financial scandal claimed its first political victim yesterday with
the resignation of Mr Palaniappan Chidambaram, the commerce minister, one of
the key initiators of the country's economic reforms.
The resignation followed his admission to prime minister PV Narasimha Rao
that he and his wife owned shares in Fairgrowth Financial Services, which is
being investigated in the securities scandal.
Mr Chidambaram said his wife Nalini, who managed the family's financial
affairs, had invested Rs250,000 (Pounds 4,600) of their money in Fairgrowth,
which has been named by the central bank as involved in the scam.
In a letter to Mr Rao, Mr Chidambaram, 46, said: 'It is my sincere hope that
these small investments will not cause any embarrassment to the government.
If they do, I would have no hesitation in stepping down from the office of
minister. I leave the matter to your judgment.'
Fairgrowth received Rs2.4bn (Pounds 48m) from a subsidiary of state-owned
Andhra Bank while handing over securities worth only Rs1.35bn, according to
the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, which said the balance was
covered by allegedly forged documents testifying to the ownership of
securities.
Mr Chidambaram said he and his wife were not aware of the company's actions.
'My wife had no reason to suspect any wrongdoing,' he said. 'In fact, if
FFSL have done anything wrong, we may stand to lose our investments.'
The ruling Congress party said Mr Chidambaram had done nothing illegal by
investing in a private company. A spokesman said his resignation was 'in the
best traditions of the party'.
Asked if the resignation would slow the economic reform process, the
spokesman said reforms 'were a party programme' and would not be affected by
the exit of one individual.
The prime minister's decision to accept Mr Chidambaram's resignation is
viewed as a strong signal that his government intends to unearth the truth
about the Bombay financial scandal. However, some observers feared the move
would slow the pace of trade liberalisation.
A lawyer from Madras, Mr Chidambaram had built a good reputation in
industrial and financial circles during his one-year tenure as commerce
minister. He was credited with introducing export-import scrips, which paved
the way for partial convertibility of the rupee. He accelerated
liberalisation by simplifying bureaucratic procedures.
Mr Chidambaram appeared in parliament yesterday but made no statement. His
resignation was not raised because parliament was adjourned after
pandemonium erupted over construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a
mosque at Ayodhya.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S anti-monopoly Fair Trade Commission has ordered 166 construction and
related companies to disband the largest bid-rigging cartel uncovered by the
agency in its attempts to clean up the country's construction industry.
The surveying, consultancy and construction companies are alleged by the FTC
to have routinely rigged bids for contracts in the Nagoya area, in central
Japan, by convening a meeting two days before a bid closing date.
Commission officials said that the companies would decide among themselves
which would apply for the contract and, if more than one company was keen,
they would conduct a lottery. In the bidding process, the chosen company
would bid lowest and inevitably win the contract.
These cartels, or dango, are a serious point of trade friction between Japan
and the US, which is attempting to improve access to the Japanese market for
US contractors.
Until this case, the largest dango was in Saitama, near Tokyo, where 66
companies had divided local government projects among themselves until this
year.
The FTC closed down the cartel, and the Ministry of Construction warned the
companies not to renew their collusion. The 166 companies have until July 23
to notify the FTC of their willingness to disband the cartel.
If they refuse, the commission could decide to take legal action, which
would be the first formal anti-monopoly case against the
politically-influential construction industry.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Afghans continue fighting to win the peace: Kabul's ruling
mujahideen are still beset by the divisiveness that hampered their struggle
against the former regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE months after taking power, Afghanistan's ruling council has even less
control over the countryside than did the government it deposed.
The Islamic fundamentalist mujahideen, backed by a military triumvirate, are
beset by lawlessness and the same bitter divisiveness that hampered their
14-year struggle for power against the former Moscow-backed regime.
Bandits still routinely loot vehicles in the countryside. Night-time
sentries in Kabul are as likely to train a grenade launcher at a stranger as
simply to ask for identification.
Last month, minority Shia and ethnic Pushtun mujahideen fought a five-day
battle on the capital's south side leaving more than 100 dead. Recently,
radical mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar fired rockets on Kabul,
killing 50 people.
'Kabul under the old government controlled 29 provincial capitals and all
the major supply routes. What does Kabul now control?' asked an Asian
diplomat in Kabul.
There are signs of a government trying to begin governing. On Monday - three
months after his appointment - the new prime minister, Mr Abdul Saboor
Fareed, arrived in Kabul and took his oath of office. The president,
Berhannuddin Rabbanni, is also in office, chairing the 51-member ruling
civilian council. A campaign has begun to expel armed rebels from the
capital.
A rise in confidence is suggested by a strengthening of the Afghan currency,
which has doubled in value to 650 to the dollar since former President
Najibullah fell in April.
The regular Friday prayers have become the most democratic arena Afghans
have seen for years, with fired-up devotees shouting critical questions at
mujahideen leaders standing at the pulpit.
However, the impression is of a government plagued by blood feuds and
disorder, struggling to transform itself from a guerrilla army.
The ruling council appears to be respected by most mujahedin commanders. But
power is largely held by a strategic alliance of the former rebel commander,
Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, who is defence minister; Mr Abdul Rashid Dostam, a
powerful militia general whose defection triggered Mr Najibullah's fall; and
General Abdul Momen, the de facto military commander of Kabul.
Mr Masood is viewed as the single most powerful person in Kabul. But because
Afghan society demands consensus and honour, he must tread lightly.
He is said to spend most of his time trying to bridge discord among the
various armed ethnic and political groups in the capital.
Mr Momen is in charge of an operation intended to rid Kabul of armed
mujahideen. Pursuing the assignment with zest, his convoy of tanks has
rolled around Kabul, lowering muzzles at obstreperous mujahideen commanders.
However, his less than tactful approach upsets some mujahideen. One
complained: 'I didn't fight 14 years of jihad (holy war) to be ordered
around by a communist.'
Mr Dostam is the triumvirate's most controversial member. From the
mid-1980s, he commanded a mercenary army which, bankrolled by Mr Najibullah,
fought the war's most brutal battles against the mujahideen.
When he and Mr Momen defected, Mr Najibullah was finished.
The most vocal opponent of Mr Dostam has been the radical leader Mr
Hekmatyar, a Pushtun. Mr Fareed's delayed arrival was a result of Mr
Hekmatyar's refusal to allow his man in the capital until Mr Dostam's
militiamen left. Mr Dostam's departure is unlikely, since Mr Masood probably
needs him to hold back Mr Hekmatyar.
For now, Mr Hekmatyar, believed to hold a huge arsenal of US and
Saudi-supplied weaponry, wanders the countryside in a convoy, biding his
time.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Hindu militants start to build Ayodhya temple: The start of
construction is in defiance of an assurance to central government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW erupted in the Indian parliament yesterday after Hindu militants on
Thursday openly defied a court order and began construction of a Hindu
temple on the site of a disputed 16th-century mosque at Ayodhya.
Five thousand Hindu activists from the militant right-wing Vishwa Hindu
Parishad (VHP) poured into the dusty town near Lucknow with truckloads of
gravel and sand, and three concrete mixers as prominent Hindu leaders
performed the ritual of pouring gravel on the foundation stone, laid almost
three years ago. The Hindus want to build a temple on the site because they
say the Hindu god Lord Ram was born there.
The symbolic start of the temple construction was in open defiance of the
Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s assurance to the central government
that it would respect the verdict of the courts. The VHP is a radical wing
of the BJP.
A court order forbids the construction or demolition of any permanent
structure on the disputed site. While Hindu activists have not dared to
invade the barbed wire fencing around the ancient Babri mosque, they have
demolished other smaller structures on the site.
The move, which is seen as politically expedient rather than religiously
motivated, has escalated tension between Hindus and Moslems in northern
India.
The BJP which wrested power in Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is located, a
year ago, on the promise that they would build the Hindu temple, against all
odds, has been unable to contain the enthusiasm that it whipped up on the
temple issue two years ago.
Mr SB Chavan, the Indian home minister has summoned Mr Kalyan Singh,the
Uttar Pradesh chief minister to New Delhi, to ask for an explanation. Mr
Singh, who has been under tremendous pressure to deliver on his main
electoral promise to build the temple, has allowed the commencement of the
construction to appease the militant wing of his party.

FT  11 JUL 92 / EC to allow bank stake in Air France: 'Subsidy' likely to
upset London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission is set to give Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP)
permission to buy an 8.8 per cent stake in Air France, the state-owned
airline, in spite of the misgivings of Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition
commissioner.
Commissioners are almost certain to approve the investment, which will cost
the state-owned bank FFr1.25bn (Pounds 128m), on Wednesday. But Sir Leon is
understood to be concerned that his Belgian colleague, Mr Karel Van Miert,
the transport commissioner, did not go into enough depth in his inquiry into
the deal.
Sir Leon was narrowly defeated in the commission last November when he
opposed Mr Van Miert's decision to wave through the French government's
FFr2bn capital injection for Air France.
Mr Van Miert decided in both cases that the capital injection did not amount
to state aid and that a private investor would have acted in the same way as
the government and BNP, in spite of the continuing losses of the airline.
The latest decision could increase tension between London and Brussels over
state subsidies to French companies. Last week, Mr Michael Heseltine,
president of the British Overseas Trade Board, attacked the commission's
decision to approve FFr6bn of government subsidies to Bull, the loss-making
French computer company, claiming that the decision would distort
competition in the sector.
Sir Leon was responsible for the Bull recommendation, but allegations of
illegal state aid for airlines are always examined by Mr Van Miert - often
to the irritation of Brussels competition authorities.
British Airways, the privately-owned national airline which is staunchly
opposed to state subsidies in the sector, is also likely to criticise the
Air France deal if it is given Commission approval.
For its FFr1.25bn, BNP is to receive bonds which can be converted into
shares in Air France at any time in the next eight years. The bonds pay a
fixed 6.5 per cent interest rate. Plans to raise a further FFr2.59bn via a
complex issue of subordinated floating rate notes have not been examined by
the commission.
The commission still has to investigate another Air France deal: the
airline's BFr6bn (Pounds 100m) purchase of a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena,
the Belgian national carrier. Sir Leon will be responsible for that inquiry
because the agreement falls under normal EC competition rules and not the
state aid code.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US jury yesterday found Pan American World Airways guilty of wilful
misconduct in a case filed by relatives of the victims killed in the bombing
of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Pan Am Flight 103 ended in disaster on December 21 1988, when a bomb hidden
inside a portable cassette player tore the jet apart shortly after it left
London for New York. All 259 people on board the Boeing 747, and 11 people
on the ground, were killed.
Yesterday's verdict comes after a civil trial lasting nearly 11 weeks in a
Brooklyn federal court. The plaintiffs are seeking more than Dollars 300m
(Pounds 157m) in damages from the airline and two subsidiaries, Pan American
World Services and Alert Management. Under international treaties, liability
damages are limited to Dollars 75,000 for each victim unless wilful
negligence is proved.
A second phase of the trial, to determine the amount of damages to be
awarded, will now have to take place. No date for this has yet been
scheduled. Pan Am, which stopped operating last year, is also thought likely
to appeal against yesterday's verdict. Lawyers acting for Pan Am and its own
legal department declined to make any immediate comment on the verdict.
The case centred on how the bomb got on board the jet. The plaintiffs argued
that the bomb had been placed in an unaccompanied suitcase, and put on an
Air Malta flight to Frankfurt. This bag, they contended, was then improperly
transferred to Flight 103 by a Pan Am employee. The employee, they
contended, failed to examine the bag and note that it did not belong to
anyone travelling on the flight.
The defence argued that the bag was smuggled into the Pan Am system at
Frankfurt, or even London, by terrorists. Lawyers said the plaintiffs were
seeking 'private vengeance' against the carriers, which had no control over
the disaster.
The jury was also told that the airline had improved security measures in
the months before the disaster.
Pan Am, which had been losing money for many years, went into bankruptcy in
January 1991, and ceased operating last December. Its affairs are still
being wound up, but the airline's insurers would be liable for any damage
award.
Yesterday, Mr Tom Plaskett, who was in charge of Pan Am at the time of the
Lockerbie bombing, claimed that the trial had 'failed to solve the mystery
that is the Lockerbie disaster'.
'Much of what we do know with certainty about Lockerbie was not shared with
this jury. . . We shall endeavour through the appeals process to shed some
light on this uncertainty,' he said.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS MEXICO prepares for its most important state elections of the year, seven
groups of observers have jointly concluded that the 'necessary conditions'
do not exist 'for the celebration of clean elections', while the leftist
opposition appears to be preparing massive protests in anticipation of
fraud.
The states of Michoacan and Chihuahua will vote for new governors tomorrow
in elections that are widely seen as tests of popularity of the opposition
in its former strongholds, and of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
party's (PRI) commitment to a more open democratic system.
The centre-left Party of Democratic Revolution is already planning to
demonstrate in Michoacan against what it sees as the inevitable fraud. The
army is ready to move in, and a tense and violent post-electoral period is
expected.
The protests will coincide with President Carlos Salinas's July 15 summit
with US President George Bush in San Diego and, if they last, with his visit
to the UK, Spain, France and Hungary later in the month. They will add to a
growing list of worries afflicting him, including recent sharp drops in the
stock market, and delays in wrapping up negotiations for the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The election observers concluded that the 'apparent unlimited use of
government resources, favouritism of electoral authorities and virtual
monopoly in the media, among other factors, create a scene propitious for
manipulating the popular will in favour of one party, and permit the federal
government to decide in the political terrain the result of the polls.'
The observer groups have offered no evidence for many allegations, such as
electoral roll rigging. But no-one questions the huge disparity in resources
between the PRI and opposition.
The leftist PRD is expected to lose in Michoacan, which would be a
considerable setback and make it difficult, if not impossible, to mount an
effective challenge in the 1994 elections.
In the border, and more urban, state of Chihuahua, the centre-right PAN is
running neck-and-neck with the PRI in the polls.
Mexico's consumer prices increased by 0.7 per cent in June, the lowest
inflation rate for the month in 20 years.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Rebel becomes a folk hero: The discontent behind a new east
German movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter-Michael Diestel has become an east German folk hero since
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) ousted him as head
of the CDU in Brandenburg state.
The enigmatic east German politician was catapulted into the vanguard of the
still-unnamed east German bipartisan movement, to be launched today, which
seeks to tap the widespread discontent in the economically battered region.
According to the movement's co-initiator, Mr Gregor Gysi, head of the PDS,
the former Communist party, grass-roots committees are to be formed in an
attempt to alleviate mass unemployment, de-industrialisation, the
destruction of agriculture and the 'humiliation' of east Germans. Among the
signers of the founding appeal was Mr Stefan Heym, east Germany's most
prominent writer and former dissident.
Politicians of the mainstream parties, particularly the CDU, whose
popularity has plummeted among easterners, accused the new movement of
turning east Germans against west Germans. Mr Diestel claimed it could
become the nucleus of a political party.
The 40-year-old Mr Diestel was long a thorn in the flesh of the CDU
leadership in Bonn for criticising the 'subjugation' of east Germany. The
surge in his popularity was nonetheless remarkable, as he was ousted for
defending ex-informers of the Stasi security police against 'one-sided'
accusations.
While Mr Diestel was criticised for his remarks by the Social Democrats
(SPD) in Brandenburg, who are coalition partners of the CDU, his expulsion
was denounced by Mr Manfred Stolpe, the SPD prime minister of the state, as
being typical of west German high-handedness.
Nearly three-quarters of east German production workers have lost their jobs
since 1990 or are on short-time work. Most are languishing in retraining or
job creation programmes which offer them little future. Psychologically,
says Mr Heiner Winkler, an east Berlin journalist, 'they are worse off than
before'.
An entire generation of east Germans above the age of 45 - skilled workers,
engineers, academics and officials - has been relegated to the scrap heap.
Yet east Germans are reluctant to take to the streets to express their
discontent and instead sink deeper into resignation.
Mr Diestel's alliance with his fellow lawyer, Mr Gysi, has alarmed both
conservatives and social democrats, who have sought to isolate the PDS. Mr
Gysi is a brilliant speaker and tactician and in local elections last May
the PDS scored a stunning upset by becoming the strongest party in east
Berlin's borough legislatures.
But Mr Diestel's erratic behaviour during his rapid rise to prominence in
post-Communist east Germany gave him a reputation for inscrutability. As
interior minister of the last, freely-elected East German government, he
antagonised Bonn officials by employing former senior Stasi officers as
advisers and arguing against opening Stasi files to the public, saying it
would lead to acts of violence within families and between neighbours.
But it was Mr Diestel's purchase of a big villa belonging to the Interior
Ministry which raised questions about his integrity. He bought it for
DM193,000 (Pounds 66,500) in July 1990 when it was estimated to be worth
nearly DM1m. The German government is demanding that he return the house,
which it claims he bought without the approval of the east German parliament
and, in effect, sold to himself.
If Mr Diestel succeeds in setting up an east German coalition movement, some
east Germans such as Mr Wolfgang Thierse, the astute deputy chairman of the
SPD, believe it would backfire by deepening the mistrust between east and
west Germans.
On one thing, however, all east German politicians are agreed. Unless the
voice of east Germans is heard more loudly in Bonn, the danger will grow of
the extreme right wing profiting from their frustrations in future
elections.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S five-week government crisis ended yesterday as parliament approved
Ms Hanna Suchocka, a 46-year-old lawyer, as prime minister of a seven-party
coalition government.
Ms Suchocka, who is from the pro-free enterprise Democratic Union (UD)
party, won a 233-vote majority in the 460-seat lower house (the Sejm).
The coalition which sustains the government is made up of parties which
share a common past in the anti-communist Solidarity movement, which
fractured after the collapse of communist power in 1989. At its heart is an
alliance between the UD, the largest of the ex-Solidarity parties, the
pro-free market Liberal Democratic Congress, the right-wing catholic
nationalist (ZChN) party and Solidarity farmers' groups.
The new government will be opposed by the former Communist party with 60
seats and the right-wing populist Confederation for an Independent Poland
with 49 seats. But President Lech Walesa has assented to the new government,
which can also count on the votes or benevolent neutrality of several
smaller parties in the fractured parliament of 29 parties which emerged from
last October's general elections.
Ms Suchocka, Poland's first female prime minister, told parliament her
government's priorities would be to overcome the crisis in public finances,
speed privatisation, raise efficiency in the state sector of the economy and
modernise the farming sector.
She also presented her coalition cabinet, which parliament is expected to
vote on today after the candidates have been vetted by parliamentary
committees.

BELGIAN constitutional reform talks involving seven government and

Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said the government would now have to work

between the Flemish and French-speaking communities.
Belgium should consider cutting back its generous unemployment benefits,

ITALIAN pensioners have long been the most privileged in Europe. Yesterday's
reforms approved by the new Amato government are a belated attempt to reduce
the state's generosity and bring Italy more into line with European
Community practice.
The main innovations are the raising of the pensionable age to 65 years for
both men and women, an increase in the minimum contribution period from 15
to 20 years, and equalisation of state and private schemes.
There have been three previous proposals for reform since 1984. All
suggested changes similar to those announced yesterday but foundered because
no party was prepared to court unpopularity by reducing benefits. The latest
proposals, to be presented to parliament as a decree, stand a better chance
of acceptance simply because the budget can no longer afford the existing
system.
Pensions for 14.2m people account for more than 80 per cent of social
spending and are equivalent to 14 per cent of gross domestic product. If the
system were to continue, pensions would absorb the entire budget in under 20
years. Alternatively, it would require something close to a 50 per cent
contribution from salaries to balance contributions and payments within 30
years.
Until now, women have been able to retire at 55 and men at 60. The reforms
envisage a range of incentives for people to stay at work until 65 and
disincentives to discourage early retirement.
Some workers in arduous jobs such as mining will be excepted, and allowed to
retire five years early.
There is also an attempt to tidy up abuses of early retirement in the state
sector, where men have been able to retire after only 20 years' work, as
opposed to 35 years in the private sector. A recent study showed 87 per cent
of all state employees retired early. The authorities are also committed to
examine claims for early retirement on health grounds with greater rigour.
No fewer than 4.2m, one third of all pensioners, receive disability
pensions, many of which have been granted as political favours or through
payments to compliant health officials.
The government also intends to stimulate the growth of the undeveloped
pension fund business. This is seen as the most effective way both of
expanding Italy's capital markets and of ending the anomaly whereby state
employees have no pension fund - their pensions have been covered out of
current annual budget expenditure. At present a state employee can receive
up to 94 per cent of final salary. There is now likely to be a ceiling of 80
per cent.
Many state employees have abused the pension scheme and taken advantage of
early retirement to take up other jobs because they have been poorly paid by
the public administration.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Clinton lays out Gore's agenda
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Albert Gore will lead a future Democratic administration's efforts
to break the logjam in Washington by enacting a legislative programme within
100 days of taking office as vice-president, Governor Bill Clinton of
Arkansas said yesterday.
Mr Clinton said that if he was elected president, Mr Gore, whom he chose
this week to be his vice-presidential running mate, would take the lead in
passing laws designed to restore US competitiveness, contain health care
costs and improve national education standards.
'I don't want Al Gore to be the kind of vice-president that sits in the US
Senate waiting to vote to break a tie. I want him to break the logjam in
Washington,' said Mr Clinton, who is due to be anointed as the Democratic
presidential candidate at next week's party convention in New York.
Under the US constitution, vice-presidents preside over the Senate, but they
do not vote unless the 100 senators are evenly divided.
Mr Clinton acknowledged that the Democrats, who control both houses of
Congress, shared part of the blame for the Washington logjam.
'There are people in our party who have contributed to the paralysis out
there, but I don't think you can lay that at Al Gore's feet,' he said.
Mr Clinton's supporters are hoping that the selection of Mr Gore to be the
Democrats' vice-presidential candidate will boost their campaign on the eve
of the convention, which itself can usually be relied on to provide a
further lift.
Mr Clinton and the Democrats should have the limelight to themselves next
week, as President George Bush is going fishing, and Mr Ross Perot, the
Texan billionaire who is expected to run as an independent candidate, seems
likely to adopt a similarly low profile.
Although some recent opinion polls show Mr Clinton recovering from his shaky
start this spring, three polls released this week still placed him third. Mr
Bush led in two and Mr Perot in the third. The results of all three polls,
however, were so close as to suggest a statistical dead heat. In addition,
the opinions of those questioned were only weakly held, so these polling
results provide virtually no guide to what might happen in the November 3
election.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Noriega given 40 years' jail
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER military ruler of Panama, General Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was
arrested on drug-trafficking charges after the US invasion of his country in
1989, was sentenced to 40 years in US prison in Miami last night.
The sentence brings to an end a trial which lasted more than half a year,
cost the US government millions of dollars to prosecute, and raised
questions about US policy on the war on drugs in Central America. Gen
Noriega is the first ruler of a foreign country ever sentenced by a US
court.
He was sentenced to two concurrent 20-year terms under two counts of the
indictment, which charged him with conspiring with members of the Medelln
cocaine cartel to ship cocaine from Colombia via Panama to the US. The
balance of the general's 40-year sentence is based on convictions on six
other charges involving specific actions taken to support the conspiracy.
Before the sentence was imposed, the general gave a long speech in which he
claimed that Presidents Bush and Reagan sought to reverse the 1977 Panama-US
treaty, which calls for a US withdrawal from Panama and the Canal Zone in
1999, and said the real reason for his indictment and trial was that 'I was
the obstacle to obtaining military bases in the (Panama) canal in
perpetuity. I was the obstacle to dismembering the treaty.'
The general made a number of specific charges against US officials,
including claims that some had at one point sought to have the Shah of Iran
killed by Panamanian doctors in order to win the release of US hostages in
Tehran and that Mr Reagan's national security adviser, Admiral John
Poindexter, demanded that Panama provide a pretext for US armed intervention
in Nicaragua.
Before imposing the sentence, federal district judge William Hoeveler said
that, despite the general's claim that the prosecution was politically
motivated, 'the politics of this case were not a part of this case.
'The real reason we are here today is that a jury of 12 men and women had
decided that the charges were true beyond a reasonable doubt.'

FT  11 JUL 92 / Lamont firmly defends ERM policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, insisted yesterday that a devaluation of
sterling would not achieve lower interest rates.
The only way to low inflation, healthy growth, more jobs and higher living
standards was to maintain the pound's membership of the European exchange
rate mechanism at the present central rate of DM2.95.
'There is no alternative,' Mr Lamont said, borrowing an old slogan from the
recently ennobled Baroness Thatcher.
Although his speech was directed at jittery foreign exchange markets and
nervous Tory backbenchers, it was also a response to reports that the former
prime minister had warned of a 'financial accident' in the event of
unchanged policies.
Mr Lamont said yesterday's news that the inflation rate had fallen to an
annual 3.9 per cent in June represented a 'significant breakthrough'. For
the first time since 1986, UK inflation was lower than the European
Community average.
But beating the average 'should not be good enough', he told the European
Policy Forum in London. Other countries were also cutting inflation and
two-thirds of UK exports went to countries with inflation rates lower than
Britain's. The UK must aim for permanently low inflation, he said.
Although Mr Lamont is sceptical about plans for European economic and
monetary union, his speech was a forceful rejection of any other option for
the UK than the existing monetary policy robust response to Tory concerns,
like those attributed to Lady Thatcher, that high interest rates are choking
recovery.
After a week in which sterling fell through its theoretical lower limit in
the narrow band of the EMS grid, he repeated that the government would in
due course move the pound into the narrow bands at its current parity.
Mr Lamont said there was no painless, cost-free route to higher growth with
low inflation. He then proceeded to reject the arguments in favour of other
options.
Cutting interest rates immediately by two or three percentage points in the
ERM was not a serious option, he said. France had tried to cut interest
rates to below German levels last November but had to reverse the move
quickly in spite of having a stable parity for five years. Britain's
membership of the wide EMS bands gave it no extra leeway.
An upwards realignment of the D-Mark was 'simply not on the agenda'. No
other European country was prepared to sacrifice hard-won credibility by
allowing its currency to be devalued against the D-Mark.
A devaluation of sterling in the ERM would put interest rates up as
financial markets would demand a risk premium for the pound.
Leaving the ERM and cutting interest rates would persuade markets that
Britain had given up on the fight against inflation and gone 'back to our
bad oldways'. Quite soon interest rates would have to go back up again 'to
much higher levels than they are today'.
Leaving the ERM and setting interest rates according to domestic monetary
targets offered no guarantee of lower interest rates. The 1980s had
suggested the opposite because 'inside or outside the ERM, we could not
ignore the level of interest rates in continental Europe', he said.
He insisted that the current policy was the 'right one for the long-term
health of the British economy'. If the UK could combine the improvements in
the economy's performance achieved in the 1980s with permanently low
inflation, it could build a 'world-class economy'.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Western air-sea units to enforce Serbian sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN European states yes-terday agreed to mount an air and sea operation
in the Adriatic to enforce United Nations sanctions against Serbia.
At least five to six ships, four maritime protection aircraft and several
ground-based helicopters will be involved. The naval operations will be
undertaken by the nine-nation Western European Union defence organisation in
co-operation with Nato. While several nations belong to both groupings, a
number of Nato members, such as the US, are not in the WEU. Britain is
sending a frigate, HMS Avenger, as part of the joint force.
The move coincided with the adoption by the 51-member Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe of a wide-ranging European security framework, at
the end of its two-day summit in Helsinki. This will give the CSCE a new
peacekeeping role to tackle growing ethnic and national conflicts in
post-Cold war Europe.
The naval surveillance operation was decided at a special meeting of WEU
foreign ministers to demonstrate that Europe was not standing aside from the
Yugoslav crisis.
The WEU undertook joint naval operations to protect shipping during the
Iran-Iraq and Gulf wars. But this is the first time it has agreed to act
jointly in a European crisis.
It is also examining how it can help the humanitarian aid operation for the
people of Sarajevo and other stricken Bosnian areas.
A group of experts will explore the feasibility of organising transport
through land corridors from the Adriatic coast to Sarajevo, where more than
300,000 people have been cut off for three months by fighting between Serbs,
Moslems and Croats.
Departing from the UK government's cautious attitude towards military
involvement in the crisis, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said that if
the feasibility of a land corridor was established, Britain would consider
providing air cover for ground transport.
He again ruled out British ground forces taking part in any relief
operations. He also stressed that a new UN Security Council resolution would
be required to authorise a land relief operation.
Downing Street said that in a move to help wounded children in Sarajevo, the
Foreign Office, on Mr Major's instructions, last night contacted the UN High
Commission for Refugees to offer British medical assistance.
Sanctions-monitoring oper-ations, which will be co-ordinated by the
Italians, will take place in international waters in the straits of Otranto
and on other points off the Yugoslav coast, including the coast of
Montenegro.
But the WEU vessels will not have the authority to stop or board ships
suspected of breaking the UN sanctions, for which a further resolution by
the Security Council would be necessary.
President George Bush yesterday denied reports that the US was stepping up
naval deployments in the Adriatic. He had made no decisions on the
deployment of new naval forces since arriving in Helsinki for the security
conference summit two days ago. The US has two task forces in the
Mediterranean.
Mr Bush has consistently refused to commit himself to the use of American
ground troops in Bosnia.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Church sees Pounds 500m wiped off value of property
investments: Commissioners borrowed heavily to fund speculative developments
just before market fell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY Pounds 500m has been wiped off the value of the Church of England's
property investments after heavy borrowing to fund speculative developments
in Britain and the US just before the market plunged.
The financial debacle which has hit the Church's income was the result of a
decision by the Church Commissioners to expand their property assets before
the market crashed in 1990.
This has emerged from a detailed investigation by the Financial Times into
the finances of the Commissioners, who manage Pounds 2.7bn in investments to
help pay for the salaries and pensions of the 11,300 Anglican clergy and a
similar number of pensioners.
A majority of the borrowings, which reached nearly Pounds 520m at their peak
in 1990, were provided by National Westminster Bank on an unsecured basis.
These were used for speculative property developments in offices, shopping
centres and warehouses many of which have exceeded their budgeted cost or
failed to find enough tenants.
After this disastrous expansion, the Church Commissioners' income is
expected to be flat for some years. To meet pay and pension costs that will
rise at more than Pounds 5m a year, the Church is appealing to parish-ioners
to bridge the gap.
month the Church Commissioners, whose chairman is Dr George Carey, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, blamed their investment problems on the recession.
The Commissioners' affairs are managed by a board of governors which
includes several bishops, Mr Michael Allison, the Tory MP, and other
prominent lay members including a leading actuary and a former chief
executive of the M&amp;G unit trust group.
Its asset committee, which dictates investment policy, has recently been
strengthened by the appointment of Sir Christopher Wates of Wates City of
London Properties.
The manager in charge of property at the Church Commissioners until last
year was Mr Michael Hutchings.
Described as a flamboyant character by former colleagues, he refused to
travel by air and took the QE2 to visit the Church's US investments.
News of the Church Commissioners' financial crisis comes after a recent High
Court case in which the Bishop of Oxford challenged their investment
policies. He called for greater emphasis to be placed on ethical
considerations. The court found in favour of the Commissioners, concluding
that their existing ethical approach, which precludes investment in such
industries as tobacco and armaments, reflected a proper exercise of the
Commissioners' powers.
In an interview, Sir Douglas Lovelock, the First Church Estates
Commissioner, defended the decision to borrow for speculative development.
Without borrowing, he said, the Commissioners could not have afforded to buy
such successful investments as the MetroCentre in Gateshead, the largest
shopping centre in Europe,now valued at more than Pounds 200m.
But he acknowledged that other developments had been less successful. The
Commissioners had too much property for historical reasons and were reducing
it, he added.
A spokeswoman for Chesterton, which acted as estates consultant to the
Commissioners and introduced property developments to them, said yesterday
that the firm was not in a position to comment.
Chesterton also valued the properties to see how the investment had
performed. Asked if valuations should not have been provided by a separate
firm of surveyors, Sir Douglas said: 'We've always done it this way.' But
added: 'We don't just accept it at face value.'
Since the beginning of 1990 the Church Commissioners have sold investment
properties with a book value of more than Pounds 350m in an attempt to
reduce their exposure to property. But their remaining property holdings of
Pounds 1.4bn still account for 56 per cent of the portfolio, compared with 7
to 8 per cent for the average pension fund.
The MetroCentre in Gateshead accounts for more than a fifth of their UK
commercial properties, which are valued at over Pounds 900m.
Last year the Church Commissioners reduced their borrowings to Pounds 383m.
A further Pounds 171m falls due for payment this year.

festooned with jewellery from the ear downwards. Nor for wearing a shirt
which didn't cover his distinctively furry navel. Nor for keeping his tennis
hat firmly on his head even while he received the All England trophy from
the Duchess of Kent (he must have reasoned that if she would not take the
plaster cast off her broken ankle, he would not return the compliment). It
is not even the fact that Agassi comes from Las Vegas which has caused great
offence.
No, what has generated outrage is the revelation that he has engaged in a
little play-acting. You might recall that after he won the final point of
the match the American collapsed and then lay prostrate on the sacred turf
in a display of apparently uncontrollable emotion.
It now appears that young Andre was very much in control of his emotions.
The sports commentator of the New York Post, one Phil Mushnik, obtained a
copy of video film of the match shot from a low camera at the side of the
Centre Court. This apparently shows Agassi falling to his knees as his
opponent netted on championship point and then looking directly up at his
trainer, Nick Bollittieri. Bollittieri is to be seen, not cheering, but
waving his arms frantically downwards, indicating that his young charge
should move from the kneeling position to one more appropriate in a mosque.
Says Mushnik, this was 'the million dollar reaction shot, the shot that was
too good to be true was, quite literally, too good to be true'.
And it is certainly true that Agassi's paroxysm of victorious ecstasy seemed
to have enormous PR value, remaining tear-jerkingly vivid long after the
public had forgotten everything else about the match.
The New York Post fumed that this little deception on the public was 'so
damning, so disgusting.' The same attitude was taken by a number of
newspapers in the UK, where the match was played. Today damningly and
punningly referred to the incident as 'a grand sham'.
One can understand why the media seemed so outraged by this harmless piece
of public relations. They felt manipulated, because it was they who fell for
it, and then sold on to the public what they mistakenly thought to be the
genuine article: real emotion, folks. But the newspapers and television had
only themselves to blame.
I was struck throughout the championship by how much they strained to
present the great event, not as sport, but as a soap opera, with the thrill
of using 'real people'. So, instead of analyses of Monica Seles' tennis, we
had endless stories about her not very gripping private life. The only
aspect of her tennis that seemed worthy of detailed reporting was her
grunting. Was Monica faking it? After each match the poor girl, under the
terms of the tournament, had to face this absurd question from hordes of
so-called sports writers. Even other, lesser players had to put up with
inane questioning about their diet, their clothes, their hair styles. All to
little point.
The sad fact is that professional tennis players are very dull people,
because they eat, drink and breathe tennis. So competitive is the sport,
they have little choice. This may not matter. It is more than likely that
the only interesting thing about them is the thing they all have in common:
that they have unusually good hand-eye co ordination, and can therefore hit
a tennis ball with a consistency which eludes the rest of us.
Even if one were to stumble across a tennis player with a deeply fascinating
world view, one could be sure that he would keep these personal thoughts
well hidden from the crass types who thrust microphones and flash bulbs
under their noses. Like all modern young celebrities they are sufficiently
experienced in the ways of the media to know the safest thing is to invent a
few trite insights into what passes for their character and repeat them
parrot fashion to any journalist who crosses their path.
Andre Agassi is even shrewder. He knows that by dressing in such a
provocative fashion he needs say nothing at all. The dazzling exterior is a
more than adequate substitute for dazzling utterances. His victory roll,
premediated or not, was an act in the same spirit. Let us not complain if he
chooses to keep his soul, however exiguous, hidden from us.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE TIME has come for my annual inspection of Cosmopolitan magazine. I do
this partly from nostalgia: there was a time when, surrounded by three
teenage sisters, I counted myself well abreast of the Cosmopolitan world.
But now consider it a man's duty to scan the journal once a year, if he has
any solicitude for the opposite sex. 'Smart women carry Cosmo' is the
legend. There is no better index of what makes a smart woman tick these
days.
I have July's issue before me. It is chunky and colourful and undeniably
good value. Before one even approaches the printed matter, goodies spill
from the pages. Two sachets of moisturiser have popped out of my copy, one
of them rose-tinted. For a fellow whose face has been compared to stretches
of Arctic tundra, it is a boon to have some rosy tints to hand. Gladdened by
the gift, I turn to the first feature, which looks promisingly incisive. Its
author is a penitent copywriter, and the thrust of his article is to deplore
the stereotypes of women in advertising campaigns. 'When women run ad
agencies, we'll see real women doing real things in TV commercials as a
matter of course.'
This seems a worthy sentiment. And since Cosmopolitan is staffed mainly by
women, one might look to the magazine for enlightenment in this area. The
current issue, accordingly, has no truck with the diligent housewife, the
capable matron, or the fastidious hostess. Cosmo women are not repressed by
such expectations. Cosmo women are out pedalling their bikes, swinging their
briefcases, and extending their limbs on the sand. They wear stiletto heels.
They drive small and snappy cars, usually scarlet. They cradle mobile phones
in wine bars. They talk about Chippendales: perhaps the antique chairs, more
likely the troupe of male exhibitionists. If they ever cook a meal, it must
be one of those clever little elfin banquets Marks and Spencer do so
nourishingly.
No one familiar with magazines for smart women will be surprised at the
absence of aprons and frumpiness here. But the image is not entirely
comforting to a man concerned with women's lot. What is most striking about
the models used by Cosmopolitan is their homogeneity. The Cosmo species may
be broadly summarised as a sort of stick insect, marinated in rich
moisturisers and then barbecued on a tropical beach. One might be reminded
of Proust's dictum, that pretty women are for men with no imagination. More
alarmingly, one might suspect a vast conspiracy operating here. Most of the
words and images in Cosmopolitan encourage women to shed their clothes, shed
their surplus flesh, and sizzle in the sun. Admittedly, it is a summer
number: but the myriad advertisements for skin toners, plastic surgery,
surefire diets and depilation doubtless continue through the year. No wonder
readers have been given a sample of moisturiser. They will need all the
moisturiser they can get to replenish the sun's robbery of body fluids.
Smart Cosmo-oriented women do seem to have escaped the prison of
domesticity. But they have signed themselves in for a new routine of
confinement. It is a prison of perpetual dieting, overseen by an army of
psychiatrists and experts in the laws of subcutaneous correctness, and
upheld by a host of potionmongers and sunbed suppliers. The dereliction of
the kitchen sink is no path to freedom if it leads straight into the
trammels of endless aerobics and carrot salads.
The apparatus of images and half-baked advice in the magazine puts it in a
weak position for being incisive about matters more serious than carrots.
Not simply the feature about women in advertising: also the angry paragraph
about the statistic that only 3 per cent of university professors are women,
and the reprimand issued to the Daily Express for describing Virginia
Bottomley as 'blooming.' 'What about Michael Heseltine's hair? Norman
Lamont's paunch?' demands Cosmopolitan. But Cosmo women are so tied up with
restructuring their hips that they cannot possibly become professors; and
the Cosmo advice to Norman, implicitly, is that he get down to a health farm
and join the Chippendales.
I am not saying that Cosmopolitan treats its readers like pea-brained
flappers. At least, while they are being barbecued, the stick insects are
given plenty of reading to get on with. Among the bibliographic suggestions,
ironically, is Thackeray's Vanity Fair.
But the main course in the promised 'feast of summer fiction' is
unacknowledged. It is, of course, the fiction of female emancipation.

FT  11 JUL 92 / I spy with my little eye: Jimmy Burns uncovers a snoopers'
corner in London's Belgravia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Major may have pledged to 'sweep away some of the cobwebs of secrecy',
but there still seem to be an awful lot of people around who think they are
James Bond.
The opening of a shop in Lowndes Street in London's Belgravia called
Spycatcher is the latest evidence of the spying epidemic that appears to be
sweeping post cold-war Britain.
According to security industry sources, the use of surveillance and
counter-surveillance equipment for private or business use is on the
increase with the open marketing of devices which once would have been the
preserve of professionals.
Spycatcher - rather more sophisticated than the gadgetry shops along the
Tottenham Court Road - stocks everything from the tongue-in-cheek to the
deadly serious, although according to Conrad Sandler, its managing director,
only 10 per cent of its clients come in just for fun.
Into the tongue-in-cheek category slot a pair of 'see-behind' sun glasses
(Pounds 25), telephone voice-changers (man to woman or woman to man) at
Pounds 150 as well as a range of 'revenge and harassment books' which
persecuted secretaries can give as Christmas presents.
More serious are state-of-the art bugging devices (including office-style
personal organisers with miniature tapes) at Pounds 800 to Pounds 1,000,
bullet and knife proof vests (Pounds 450-Pounds 1,000), 'special' telephone
recorders, and handset scramblers of use to both predator and potential
victim.
Sandler gives away little about his own background or about the company's
owners, and he suggests that not all equipment available is readily on
display to the inquiring journalist. One suspects there is more than a touch
of marketing ploy behind the apparent climate of secrecy.
He is certainly bullish when it comes to talking about the people he sells
to. To that extent Spycatcher is as upfront as its namesake, Peter Wright,
the British intelligence agent, who told us everything we are ever likely to
know about M15 in a controversial bestseller.
Robert Maxwell, who bugged most of his directors and some of his enemies,
was not one of Sandler's clients. But many other businessmen - usually
acting through intermediaries - are.
'A hell of a lot of people bug their own companies,' says Sandler, who
describes himself as a former locksmith with years of experience in the
security business. 'Most of the clients we get come from the upper-middle to
wealthy class. They are the ones who have the most to lose and who are the
most worried about themselves. To worry about security you have to have
something to lose, whether its your life or your possessions.'
Spycatcher's client profile is broad. It ranges from paranoid marriage
partners, to company executives who want one to keep one step ahead of the
competition.
Sandler, who clearly enjoys his work, is ready to give examples as long as
names are not mentioned. 'We have some unusual clients . . . there was a
woman in the other day who was quite convinced that someone had followed her
all the way from Arizona to London just to fool about with her underwear.
Another customer came in and wanted a watch that would enable him to listen
to what his wife was up to in Abu Dhabi.'
According to Sandler, one growing sector of clients comes under the heading
'social'. This is is the client who goes to a cocktail party and does not
want to be seen taking notes between mouthfuls of canapes. A micro-recorder
the size of a matchbox, neatly tucked into the inside pocket of a dinner
jacket or inside a bra, ensures that the businessman or woman can pick up on
that essential tip or even check on any personal indiscretion.
'Offensive' bugging devices like those on sale in a shop such as Spycatcher
have been known to be used by a temporary absentee board member who wanted
to know what his fellow directors were saying just before making an
apparently 'chance' entry.
Sandler remembers being approached by a gold dealer who suspected he had
been undercut by his customer and wanted to intercept his telephone.
'I told him it would cost him Pounds 20,000. I would have helped him with
the equipment if he'd paid the money upfront (which he didn't) although I
told him that what he was trying to do would have been difficult lawfully,'
he recalled.
In fact one of the reasons that James Bonds are on the increase is that UK
law is rather fuzzy when it comes to the use of equipment available through
companies such as Spycatcher.
The Home Office said this week that the buying and selling of bugging
devices which usually operate on UHF and VHF frequences was legal.
Theoretically, certain activities connected with the installation of bugging
devices could lead to the user being prosecuted under Company Law, the
Official Secrets Act, or Common Law.
The interception of other people's phones is also an offence under the
Interception of Communications Act 1985 which makes it illegal to tap a
phone without a warrant.
However, John Wadham, legal adviser to the National Council of Civil
Liberties, says there are huge practical difficulties in implementing the
law. He said: 'Because the activities have become so secretive, they have
become out of control.'
Sandler insists that nothing he stocks is illegal but is not reassuring when
he talks about the real James Bonds for whom the kind of equipment he
displays in his shop window are of limited interest.
'Government intelligence agencies are now using much more sophisticated
equipment than anything that is available on the open market. What is on
sale commercially is what intelligence agencies were using ten years ago . .
. there is no antidote against what they have now,' says Sandler.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Private View: A girl who got money and a room of her own -
Anne Stotter realised as a child the importance of independence. She is now
one of England's few women surgeons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A WOMAN must have money and a room of her own.' When she said that in 1928,
Virginia Woolf was talking about writing novels. Anne Stotter says her
prescription fits the profession of medicine just as well.
Miss Stotter is a doctor - not just any doctor but one of only 13 women
consultant surgeons in England. She belongs to what is reputedly the
toughest specialism, and the one with fewest female practitioners.
Miss Stotter earns a lot more than the Pounds 500 a year (Pounds 11,800 in
today's money) that Virginia Woolf said would suffice when she addressed the
young women of Newnham College, Cambridge. More to the point: Anne Stotter
realised very young that money means independence.
Her father, a skilled but disillusioned printworker in Walthamstow,
north-east London, never revealed how much he earned, kept his wife and six
children on a tight leash yet seemed always to have spare cash himself.
'It was all very unfair,' she said. 'I think I was aware from very early on
that control of my life was going to depend on having an income. I wasn't
ever going to let someone say to me 'you cannot make these decisions because
I hold the purse-strings.''
Anne Stotter did not achieve a room of her own until, defying her father's
prejudices and amazing the nuns at her convent school, she won a place at
Newnham 40 years after Virginia Woolf's visit.
'I never had a room before that I could close the door on. At home there was
rarely peace and quiet, or warmth. I vowed when I left home that I would
find money to keep warm - and I never had chillblains again.'
Virginia Woolf's essay, A Room of One's Own, based on talks to the girls of
Newnham and Girton, is a beautifully-written, gentle and penetrating
polemic. Why, she muses, do women not go into business or the Stock Exchange
and endow Oxbridge colleges? Why do college men eat creamed Dover sole and
roast partridge for lunch, when college women get gravy soup, boiled beef,
yellowed sprouts, prunes and custard? And what happened to Shakespeare's
sister?
She describes (or imagines) being warned off the grass of a men's college by
a beadle and being turned away from a college library. So I asked Miss
Stotter if medical men still defended their turf against women.
'Virginia Woolf nicely says that women cannot be doctors because they do not
play football. There are still areas of protection but the worst of it has
already passed. There are clubs you cannot go into.' (She was talking before
this week's vote by the Garrick Club to continue to exclude women). 'They're
not important, not to me anyway. What you miss out on is informal discussion
of important issues while you pee. That's what you miss.'
Miss Stotter is a frank person. She has, as she puts it, 'a short, sharp,
effective way with words'. Despite that, and her prematurely grey hair, she
did not strike me as the bossy matron type. On the contrary, she sometimes
giggles like a girl.
'People assume that to have got where I am now I must be very competitive.
But I'm actually a collaborator, not a competer by nature.'
Do you behave differently with your male colleagues?
'Not because I'm a woman. I tend to speak succinctly. I could be a quiet,
unassuming little flower but then I don't think I'd have become a surgeon in
the first place. I'm actually quite self-conscious and quite shy. I don't
like meeting new people. I'm awful at parties, for example, awful, awful.'
Miss Stotter, whom I met in her room at Glenfield General Hospital,
Leicester, is energetic as well as frank. 'I like to do things,' she said.
Her idea of relaxation is to go skiing or to fly her expensive glider up a
sheer Alpine escarpment.
'People always ask me if I have been discriminated against,' she continued.
I wasn't going to ask you that, I replied, hypocritically.
'Well, I won't answer it then. But the short answer is No.'
The longer answer, however, is that even if there is not overt
discrimination there is certainly a non-malign bias.
For example, other doctors tend to assume she is the dietician. Patients are
reluctant to believe that it is she who will be operating on them (and then
are usually pleased). During a long, intensive training in Britain and the
US she kept quiet about her interest in breast cancer for fear she would be
taught little else. She felt obliged to conceal the fact that she had a
social life and a boyfriend.
General practitioners tend still to refer to her patients with breast
disease rather than other cases. 'That's a problem, because one of the
things I have to do is maintain an expertise that allows me to treat
emergencies.'
Such is the competition for surgical posts, she said, that no woman could
ever prove she was turned down on grounds of her sex.
'Anyway, there is nothing to be gained even if I had felt I had been
discriminated against. I hope I would have had more sense than to bleat
about it because it would hardly have helped my cause, would it?'
I wanted to know about the men in her private life. I was thinking of
Virginia Woolf's uncomfortable observation: 'Women have served all these
centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of
reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.'
Miss Stotter was married once. It was towards the end of her undergraduate
years and it was, she said, 'a complete disaster.'
As undergraduates, she and her husband had been on a par. 'When we were
married things changed, to my eyes, in a startling and dreadful way.
Suddenly, because I was a wife it was my job to go to the supermarket, to
get the money out of the bank, to do the cooking and cleaning.
'I spent quite a lot of time protesting at this. I could have said 'Bugger
it, I'm not going to.' But I didn't, and the reason I didn't was because I
had very firmly ingrained what my role should be in life, and that included
the supermarket. The guilt of not being a proper wife was quite substantial:
an important thing about women is that they suffer much more from guilt.'
She had chosen a man who was like her own father. (She loved her father, but
felt relief when he died).
Did your husband resent your being so intelligent?
'He did worry about it. When we did our Finals I got my results before him
and I got a First - and he would not speak to me for a week except to say
that if he didn't get a First the relationship was at an end.'
And what happened?
'He got a First.' She giggled.
They never had children and Anne Stotter decided not to get married again,
not even to her long-standing boyfriend. 'There would only be disadvantages
for me in being married. I happily live in sin and have for ages - not that
there's much sin in it.'
A surgeon needs domestic support. Few men even today will provide that, but
Anne Stotter's man did. He gave up a job designing oil rigs. She keeps him
and he looks after her.
'I think it takes immense character, immense self confidence and sanity to
go against the grain. You can get beaten down by disapproval and people can
say very offensive things. At our age they are mature enough to accept it,
but if you tried it younger it would be very difficult.'
I asked if medicine is neuter - or rather, androgynous, as Virginia Woolf
said writing should be. Miss Stotter thinks it obvious that men and women
are different but that it is impossible to determine whether the differences
give one sex the advantage over the other. She just happens to have the rare
sort of temperament which thrives on hard work and pressure and is good at
deciding when, and whether, to cut.
'I think the fact I came from a working-class background in Walthamstow
rather than from Cheltenham has more influence on how I treat patients than
the fact that I'm a woman.'
'It's incomprehensible to me how I came to be the way I am,' she continued.
She seemed moved. 'Little things, like deciding at 15 to apply to Cambridge
 -it was an outrageous thing to do from my background and yet I did it and
it turned out to be the beginning of a long chain of events which has
brought me to where I am with a career that I like enormously, having left
behind a huge number of hang-ups.
'I am more confident than I could ever have imagined myself becoming. I
can't really work out how it happened. I am doing what I should be doing. I
feel I am in the right place.'
All without consciously striking a blow for women's emancipation?
'Yes. Because it felt the right thing for me to be doing as an individual. I
must have an income, yes, I must have space of my own and it must be warm,
yes. Those were the important things.'

FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: On a train to nowhere - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was Russian drama on Monday on Radio 4 and Tuesday on Radio 3.
Tuesday's was outstanding, Moscow Stations by Venedikt Yerofeev, an hour's
monologue spoken by Tom Courtenay with great skill.
We are with a drunk on the train from Moscow to Petushki, where the birds
always sing and the flowers bloom and his girl waits for him. He has lost
his job as brigade-leader on useless work, but can afford endless 'cocktail'
drinks with increasingly unlikely ingredients. Station follows station, but
'nobody ever gets to Petrushki'. The train may actually pass it, yet they
are back at Kursk station in Moscow - if they ever left - and there come
pain and a blackout that may last for ever.
Philosophic, artistic, biblical and historical references abound in the
tale, as comic as it is pathetic. There are Angels on call, but in the end
they only laugh. The fine English version is by Stephen Mulrine, and the
direction by Faynia Williams.
Radio 4's Going Under, dramatised by Ken Whitmore from Lynda Chukovskaya's
novel, is set in 1949 and has the quality of the Russian tales we know from
that period. Set in a rest-camp where writers are sent to alleviate their
deviance, it is the love-story of Nina Sergevevna, who believes her husband
to be working in the mines, and Bilibin, who knows he is not. There is a
contrapuntal theme from Veksler, a Jewish poet, who also cares for Nina.
Literary taste is allowed more importance than politics ('It's poetry that
keeps us apart'), and the tale seemed to me everyday stuff. Annette Crosbie
was Nina (she reads Bilibin's 500-page manuscript in one evening), Graham
Crowden was Bilibin and Martin Jenkins directed.
Your Place or Mine? is a promising new series for Radio 4 on Sunday
evenings. British and American documentary makers have combined in snapshots
of Provincial Britain and Middle America that will be unfamiliar to the
opposite sides.
This week we visited Sedona, Arizona, revered by the Yevepoi Apache Indians
for standing on red rock, red being sacred. The tribal chairman, Theo Smith
senior, introduced himself to us, and we were told much about Sedona's
history, which so entrances American tourists that New Age worshippers (no
connection with our lot) have settled there in strength. You get more
spiritual growth from the vortex there, said a settler, than from all the
energy of New York. The wise Apache view is that you can worship just as
effectively from anywhere you like.
American scenes to come include the snake-handlers of the Appalachians, who
quote biblical reference for the healing power of serpents, and the
followers of quasi-Nazi David Duke in Louisiana. And we? Well, there are the
Birmingham Moslems, including the English ones. There is the rivalry of
Welsh- and English-speaking students at Bangor. These may seem as odd to the
Americans as the snake-handlers to us, for the programmes are to go out on
both sides of the Atlantic.
Last night, still on Radio 4, Ray Gosling, one of the better commentators on
ordinary life, began a new series, Gosling in the High Street, telling the
history of firms we take for granted.
He discussed with Montague Burton's son Arnold how those tailors began, and
very romantic too - the first shop opened by teenage Sir Montague, an
immigrant European Jew, on a handful of money, with the idea of providing
everyone with a three-piece suit for a week's wages. To attract customers,
he added dance-halls upstairs and billiard-saloons below.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Canaletto prices strike 80s chord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAINTINGS by Canaletto fetched the kind of prices made during the boom of
the late '80s at Christie's yesterday.
The better of the two top lots, a view of the Grand Canal in Venice looking
east from the Campo di S. Vio, changed hands for Pounds 1.43m (estimate
Pounds 600,000-Pounds 800,000).
A different buyer paid Pounds 990,000 for a similarly estimated view looking
north from the Rialto bridge.
Both are excellent witness for the case against museums selling off
pictures. The Alte Pinakothek in Munich had sold them in 1939 as it was then
believed they were by Bellotto.
No one now doubts the original attribution to Canaletto. The paintings were
part of a set of four Venetian views by the master once owned by the
celebrated neo-Classical sculptor Antonio Canova. A third Grand Canal scene
by Canaletto and studio realised Pounds 297,000.
The auction went better than might have been expected. Although just under
half the lots of the morning session were bought in, the pictures that ought
to have sold generally found good prices. A small flowerpiece by Ambrosius
Bosschaert II estimated at Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000 went to a private
collector for Pounds 209,000. London trade snapped up a van Goyen last seen
on the market in 1946. It sold for Pounds 198,000.
The bargain of the morning was the pair of elegant gold ground panels by
Arcangelo di Cola da Camerino. They had been bought for Dollars 1.1m at
Sotheby's, New York in 1990. Yesterday the vendor was prepared to sell them
for Pounds 330,000.
The morning session totalled Pounds 5,286,600 with 55 per cent sold by
value.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Soft-centre Giselle - Australian Ballet's staging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The central role is the reason for the survival of Giselle. Even under the
most inimical circumstances - that creaking tent, echoing with exterior
noise, in which the Royal Ballet used to camp out in Battersea  - a great
interpretation will tell us everything about this romantic icon, as we
recall from a celebrated and be-canvassed matinee with Makarova and Dowell.
Careful opera-house stagings, hung about with every period knick-knack that
producer's mania can conceive, are of no avail without the focus of a
commanding ballerina. Youth, innocent willingness, mean little in dancing
Giselle: the justification for any performance in this 'holy ballet', as
Karsavina called it, is an apostolic succession - the handing on of nuance
and understanding from great ballerinas to their heirs.
The Australian Ballet showed their Giselle on Thursday night. It is a
sensitive, unfussed and traditional recension by Maina Gielgud. It has
felicitous touches: the appearance of the wilis, born of the nocturnal
mists, is redolent of romantic feeling, and nicely menacing. The supporting
playing is discreet, well-mannered, and in Josef Christianson we saw a fine
Hilarion, credible in his feelings for Giselle as in his terrors amid the
menacing wilis. But, like so many others, the staging is waiting for the
transforming presence of a great central interpretation to make us part of
its world, rather than mere observers of its quaint charms.
Fiona Tonkin and Steven Heathcote, the Giselle and Albrecht of this first
performance, were conscientious in all things. She was by turns shy and
adoring as the village maiden; he was loving, then remorseful. And the
ballet looked like an exercise rather than a masterpiece.
In the spectral frenzies of the forest scene - where Maina Gielgud's
production is at its best - both artists showed us that this was a poetic
drama rather than the prosaic tale that had been Act 1.
The gauzy horde of the wilis was admirable, united in style and step; Sian
Stokes, a commanding Myrtha, and Lisa Bolte and Robyn Corby, her
lieutenants, were vaporously excellent. Peter Farmer's design goes through
all the right motions, and sustains the narrative.
As a curtain-raiser (and it is good to have another ballet with Giselle:
today's ticket prices entitle audiences to as much dancing as they can get),
we were given Catalyst by young Australian choreographer Stephen Baynes. He
has turned to the Poulenc two-piano concerto, a work in which he discerns 'a
sense of conflict'. In seeking to prove this theory in dance, it seems to me
that Mr Baynes has set dogmatic limits on his response to the score. He
treats it as a case to be proved, rather than as music which might feed his
evident ability to make plotless classical movement.
His cast work very well, with Greg Horsman especially brilliant. There is an
inexplicable design of ropes and what looks like a bronze-age chandelier.
The soloists in the concerto - Nigel Gaynor and Stuart Macklin - were
excellent.
Thurday's performance was dedicated to the memory of the outstanding
Australian premier danseur and teacher, Kelvin Coe, whose death at the age
of 45 was reported that morning. Coe was a magnificent dancer and his
passing must grieve everyone who saw this sincere, generous and exhilarating
artist.
The Australian ballet season continues at the Coliseum with varied
programming until 18 July.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Avignon Festival
</HEADLINE>

   By ANTHONY CURTIS

<TEXT>
YESTERDAY the barricades went up in Avignon. The ones in front of the Palais
des Papes, that is, put there by the organisers of this year's Avignon
Festival. They are to prevent members of the audience, who swarm in the
square from 9 pm onwards, from entering the Cour d'Honneur of the Papal
Palace until the last possible moment.
At about 9.40, when the sun has started to go down, one small entry-point
appears and the crowd surges towards it. Squashed together like sardines,
people eventually enter the precincts in single file to seek the sanctuary
of a rickety seat in an auditorium roofed by the night-sky.
Appropriately enough it is a celebrated siege that is being enacted in one
of the opening productions. This is the siege of Numantia in 134 BC, carried
out by Scipio Africanus in fulfilment of the Roman Senate's delenda est
Carthago policy.
According to your point of view, you can see this as either a great Roman
victory or a feat of heroic resistance on the part of the inhabitants,
comparable to that of the Jews at Masada.
As a Spanish patriot, Cervantes, whose dramatic re-creation of the ruthless
operation is being presented, emphasises the valour of the Numantians. His
plays have always been over-shadowed by Don Quixote and are often summarily
dismissed as no more than 'a little Senecan rhetoric' (Brenan).
It will be interesting to see whether this production by Robert Cantarella
in the Cloister of the Carmelites, with a company drawn from all over France
and a new translation of the text, will cause that rating to change.
Cervantes's great rival, the immensely industrious Lope de Vega, is the
first author to occupy the Cour d'Honneur this year. His drama depicts an
equally ruthless siege, but one of the heart - the heart of Dona Ines, taken
captive by the eponymous Chevalier of Olmedo. The production is by the
Catalonian director, Llus Pasqual.
The work corresponds in Spanish theatrical tradition to our Romeo and
Juliet, but instead of a nurse to console the heroine, there is a procuress
to arrange assignations. A staging of a version of Calderon's Life is a
Dream filtered through the mind of Pier Pasolini will complete Avignon 92's
tribute to the Golden Age of Spain.
On a more contemporary, but also predominantly Hispanic, note there is Los
Caminos de Frederico again moulded by Pasqual - a recital in Spanish from
Lorca. Georges Lavaudant's play Terra Incognita about his discovery of
Mexico in 1985, is being staged out at Les Taillades, that pretty village 30
kilometers away from Avignon, put on the theatrical map by Peter Brook.
Two more voyage-of-discovery dramas are based on novels by J M G Le Clezio,
Le Livre des Fuites and Pawana. And to end this survey of some of the main
attractions, the Don Juan legend will be the theme of a ballet by
Jean-Claude Gallotta to be danced by artists from the Centre choregraphique
national de Grenoble.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: The Habsburgs in Spain - A celebration of the
consequences of a famous marriage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1496, no one would have thought that Emperor Maximilian I of the
Habsburgs had signed 'the most remarkable marriage contract in the history
of modern Europe'. The marriage of his heir, Philip the Handsome to Joanna
of Castile, second daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, was
certainly a respectable match. Then Fortune turned her wheel, and their son
Charles V, became heir to a world-empire.
Hispania-Austria is a magnificent exhibition celebrating the birth of two
centuries of Habsburg rule in Spain. It has been mounted jointly by the
Austrian and the Spanish ministries of culture and is 70 per cent the same
as the show at Toledo this spring, Reyes y Mecenas. However, the 30 per cent
difference matters, and anyone with a chance to notch up both shows should
certainly take it. (The exceptionally thorough catalogues differ
correspondingly between the German- and Spanish-language versions: Electa
Press, Sch500).
The exhibition's somewhat daunting subtitle is 'The Catholic Kings -
Maximilian I and the Origins of the Casa de Austria in Spain.' In Austria,
this means more emphasis on the absorbing personality of Maximilian the
match-maker himself. None the less, one could hardly hope to see a rarer,
better-exhibited display of art in late 15th-Century Spain (which of course,
includes many Flemish artists) than the first floor of the exhibition.
Anyone who knows how difficult it remains to glimpse, let alone see
properly, artistic treasures in Spain's sacristies and religious houses,
will relish the privileged view Hispania-Austria offers. There are dozens of
panel paintings and painted wooden sculptures, incredibly beautiful
tapestries and liturgical treasures.
The huge funeral pall of the de Velascos, Constables of Castile, looks as
fresh as if it were made yesterday. The embroidered manga (a processional
crucifix stand) was the gift to Toledo Cathedral of Cardinal Ximenes de
Cisneros, responsible for expelling the Jews and unleashing the Inquisition.
One of the most exceptional pieces is a memorial bronze from Badajoz
Cathedral of a young Spanish ambassador who died in Venice in 1506. Possibly
made by Alessandro Leopardi, it is a full-length and astonishingly lifelike
portrait of Lorenco de Figueroa, not in armour but dressed informally and
holding carelessly, almost with disdain, his sword and shield.
Added to them are treasures from Austrian collections, principally from
Vienna, and further superb loans of books, paintings, and prints, from
Brussels, Amsterdam, the Louvre, and Berlin. Among the painters, names to
conjure with are Bartolome Bermejo, Cranach the Elder, Durer, Hans
Burgkmair, Gerard David, and Pinturicchio.
There are a quantity of historic portraits, including Michiel Sittow's
lovely portrait of our own Catherine of Aragon, bride to Henry VIII. One
will linger over shows Mary of Burgundy, Maximilian's much-widowed daughter.
Recently thought to be by Michael Pacher, it is a lovely image of a lady as
pale and fine as alabaster, and, since it belongs to a private collector,
who knows when it will be seen again.
Exhibits of such quality and variety leave an unforgettable impression of
the artistic scene in Europe around 1492. And where is one to see these
exceptional riches? Not, for once, in Vienna, but in Innsbruck, capital of
the Tyrol.
Hispania-Austria marks an important break in the Austrian government's
tradition of cultural centralism. Schloss Ambras is a Renaissance castle in
the foothills of the Alps, 10 minutes' drive from Innsbruck. The exhibition
occupies three floors of the upper castle which is normally closed to the
public.
It is not just a case of matching nice objects to nice place. Schloss Ambras
is a Habsburg castle, remodelled by Maximilian's grandson, Archduke
Ferdinand. In the lower castle - assuming you have any strength left after
this huge show - do visit Ferdinand's own extraordinary collection. The
first museum to be made north of the Alps, it is full of bizarre kitsch
which speak volumes for the tastes of Renaissance princes.
On the second floor of the exhibition, which is devoted to Maximilian, the
choice of venue becomes still more satisfying. Among the Emperor's umpteen
titles was Landesfurst of Tyrol and in all Maximilian's widely-scattered
lands, there was nowhere he preferred to be than in the Tyrolean Alps.
In Innsbruck, as every tourist knows, he was betrothed and gave the famous
Golden Dachl to his bride. But sentimentality had nothing to do with
Maximilian's predilection. He loved to hunt and fish, and the Tyrol offered
the best and most perilous fun of all, scaling peaks armed with crossbows
and huge spears in search of chamois. And being Maximilian, he was ready
with the tale of how, when he lost his way on the Martinsberg, an angel
appeared and set him on the right path.
There is something deeply satisfying about looking at Maximilian's hunting
crossbow and flattering images of his hunting exploits, and then looking out
of the window at the encircling forests and snowcapped peaks. Maximilian's
money, too, which he spent with such incredible panache, came in large part
from the iron and silver the miners dug from those mountains.
In the Hofkirche in Innsbruck stand the lifesize iron figures of heroes,
guarding the tomb where Maximilian's body would have rested, had he not
squeezed the citizenry beyond endurance with taxes - and never paid his
bills. It is good to remember that fact, swept away as a visitor may well be
by the potency and persuasiveness of Maximilian's vision of his own
importance.
He wrote romances and corrected the lavish presentation manuscripts in his
own hand. He exploited the new medium of the printing press to make his
image known throughout the empire. He was the sainted, knightly hero of his
own personal romance. These days, 'historic trails' are all the rage with
tourist offices. If ever there was an exhibition which justified a trail, it
is Hispania-Austria: on the trail of Maximilian, through the Tyrol.
Runs until 20 September, daily. To book, ring +43 (512) 5924407, 5924409. No
parking at the castle but free shuttlebus from points in Innsbruck

THE PELICAN BRIEF by John Grisham Century Pounds 14.99, 371 pages
SAYONARA by Elliot Marshall Chapmans Pounds 8.99, 376 pages
THE CHINAMAN by Stephen Leather Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 312 pages
TWO US Supreme Court judges are killed on the same evening. No one can link
the murders, but the President quickly begins choosing successors who will
ensure that the court has a conservative majority for a generation.
In New Orleans, Derby Shaw, a young law student is intrigued. She
investigates and writes a brief which names an unlikely suspect. Her
professor and lover passes the brief to a friend in the FBI. Within days,
her lover is dead and she is running for her life.
From that beginning, John Grisham weaves a heady tale of deceit, treachery
and multiple killing which successfully describes the manipulative rivalries
and enmities inside the US political and legal systems.
If that sounds grim, Grisham has no doubts as to the whereabouts of
democracy's principal safety mechanism. The closing chapters of the book
make skilful use of newspaper deadlines to maintain a comfortable degree of
suspense. Once Derby Shaw's story is printed, readers can be sure that the
cover-ups and conspiracies are doomed. God Bless America and the Washington
Post.
The Pelican Brief is not as original as Grisham's first novel, The Firm, but
that may be because in ranging beyond the legal profession it calls on a
cliche too far. But it is better than the average thriller.
And it is much better than Sayonara, Elliot Marshall's depressing vision of
a United States threatened with economic thralldom by a Japan bent on
revenge and humiliation. Whereas Grisham seeks out and finds redemption
within the US system, Marshall wants only villains to blame for the post-war
loss of economic and social leadership. Who better than inscrutable
outsiders?
Marshall's description of the Japanese is stereotyped and thoroughly nasty,
just as the women in the book, even the supposedly modern and independent
types, are narrow simulacra. He paints a relentlessly unappealing picture in
which the materialist decadence of the US is not obviously better than the
backward-looking morality of Japan. Unfortunately, as Michael Crichton's
Rising Sun has already shown, this sort of dangerous xenophobia sells.
It is a relief to turn to The Chinaman, who is actually a monosyllabic
Vietnamese refugee. This inscrutable outsider wages a dignified one-man war
on the IRA to avenge his daughter's death in a bomb blast. When he starts
practising his old skills as a jungle terrorist on a Sinn Fein leader, the
tables are neatly turned. Enjoyable tosh.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Night of errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal National Theatre's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream,
directed by the French Canadian, Robert Lepage, ought to be retitled Bottom
in the Underworld or Nightmare in Hades. The company plays the full
Shakespeare text, if not the verse, but any other connection with the
original is tenuous.
Lepage has said that there is no reason why the dream should be assumed to
be a happy one and, even on a conventional reading, it has its nightmarish
aspects. Here, however, we go for the extremes, not the subtleties. There is
not a tree, let alone a wood, in sight; the only flowers are those brought
by Puck to administer his spells. The setting is something out of Dante: a
huge underground swamp in which fairies crawl, everyone else wades and
around which the lovers jog.
The swamp, although only about three inches deep, is a tremendous technical
achievement. Those sitting in the front two rows of the stalls are given
protective clothing to guard against the splashing, and one of the wonders
of the production is how the water does not drip through the boards. The
daily laundry bill for the mud-covered cast must be enormous.
One of the principal props is a bedstead. The lovers are asleep on it at the
start. It is punted around the swamp as though this were purgatory. Then it
reappears in various modes. When Titania finally makes love to Bottom, the
lovers are lying curled up in the water beneath it. At the end, the
bedstead, still in the water, serves as the precarious stage on which Bottom
and his fellow workmen give their play.
There is a great deal of athleticism, as one would expect from Lepage. In
the Dream the great physical feats come from Angela Laurier's Puck. She does
a circus-like aerial spinning act while putting a girdle round the earth in
40 minutes and spends much of her time upside down. Instead of giving Bottom
an ass's head, she twines her legs round his neck with her feet sticking out
looking likes ass's ears - a pose which is only abandoned when Titania gets
round to ravishing him.
Apart from Hades, there is a touch of the east. Hippolyta looks like an
Asian queen, the servants are distinctly Indian and when the lights go up
beyond the swamp, the background is eastern. Some Indonesian music, though
including western instruments, has been especially devised for the play.
So much for the novelties: the question is whether they work. On one level,
the answer is yes. After all, this is the National Theatre, which has so
much talent and so many resources that it could get away with playing
Twelfth Night backwards. On the more rational level, however, the answer is
no. The production makes a travesty of the play.
Whether dream, nightmare or a mixture of both, the piece is plainly set in
midsummer. But there is no midsummer in the world of Lepage. The fairies
might well be seen as somewhat sinister, but they are not primeval creatures
crawling out of a swamp. Why else are they called Peaseblossom and
Mustardseed? When Bottom asks for the honey bag, you reflect only that that
is the last thing he is likely to get in these nether regions.
Some readers may regard the Dream as a comedy, and it is true that it is
such a funny play that not even Lepage can extinguish all the laughs. Yet
his Bottom, played by Timothy Spall, is a sad figure, more frightened than
puzzled by his transformation, more in danger of going mad than into
ecstasy.
A few of the errors are more elementary. For instance, when Hermia and
Helena have their first quarrel, Demetrius and Lysander go in for a
wrestling match in the swamp. This distracts attention from the dialogue,
and indeed such carelessness with the words is a general tendency.
The emphasis on spectacle leads to some excessively slow playing. Once you
have the swamp on stage you can't get it off again, even when it has ceased
to be relevant. Those who admire the Dream for the beauty of its language as
well as its comedy are likely to be disappointed. The case for this
production is simply curiosity to see something different.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Summer listening - Spoken Word / The latest batch of
audio tapes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY POSTGATE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP of my list for summer listening is Anthony Trollope's The Last Chronicle
of Barset, first published in 1867 (Cover To Cover Cassettes CTC 061; 23
cassettes; 31 hours; unabridged). This is the story of the Rev Josiah
Crawley, perpetual curate in the parish of Hogglestock, learned,
impoverished and proud, who is accused of dishonesty over a cheque for
Pounds 20. The charge turns out to have been founded on a misunderstanding,
but his agony while awaiting trial at the assizes is appalling, and his wife
and daughters suffer with him. A magnificent reading from Timothy West, to
round off the sequence of novels that he has made so very much his own.
From Isis Audio Books, The Ladies of Missalonghi by the Australian Colleen
McCullough (TE 432; 4 cassettes; 5 hours 15 minutes; unabridged) is nicely
read by Davina Porter. the tale is set in the early years of this century in
a small town in the Blue Mountains, which is ruled by the founder's male
descendants. Unattached or widowed women have a thin time, until Missy, 33
and unmarried, and not even looking like the rest of the family's women,
starts a revolution - a cheering fairy tale for grown-ups.
Lake Wobegon Days and Leaving Home are two of the phenomenally popular
chronicles of a small Mid-Western town written by Garrison Keillor. The
author reads the stories himself on the radio, both here and in the US, and
the BBC Radio Collection has released these two together in a
limited-edition boxed set (ZBBC 1293; 4 cassettes; 4 hours). Lake Wobegon
takes itself seriously, but its creator is one of the funniest and most
endearing writers reading today. Hear him, if you have not already done so.
John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga seems to have an unending attraction. The
part-dramatisation broadcast on BBC radio and now issued as a boxed set
(ZBBC 1252; 6 cassettes; 9 hours) offers yet another account of the story of
the three generations of Forsytes, and their money, beginning in 1886. Dirk
Bogarde's delectable reading as the narrator supplies the romantic
colouration that the story itself rarely achieves, and Sir Michael Hordern
as Old Jolyon, the one genuinely warm heart In the entire chronicle, heads
an excellent cast. Only Diana Quick's Irene slightly disappoints.
In collaboration with BBC Drama, Random Century Audiobooks has issued the
recording of Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Theatre's production of Hamlet
(RC 100; 4 cassettes; 3 hours 30 minutes), broadcast in April on Radio 3 and
reviewed at that time. Suffice to say that it is an imposing addition to
Random's catalogue. (I did not like Ophelia much, nor her brother, but
perhaps one wasn't intended to.)
Argo has reissued a recording of Shaw's Pygmalion (Argo 1298; 2 cassettes; 1
hour 45 minutes; edited) made some years ago but still worth hearing, with
Diana Rigg as Eliza, Alec McCowan as Higgins, Jack May as Pickering and Bob
Hoskins as Alfred Doolittle with strong supporting cast. The message about
specific pretensions of the middle classes is dated, but the jokes are still
good, and the acting has the right Shavian crispness.
On the subject of acting, Simon Callow reads a shortened version of his own
book Shooting the Actor (Random Century RC 79; 3 hours), his diary of six
weeks spent in Yugoslavia in 1987, acting in the film Manifesto under the
direction of Dusan Makavejev and watching the steady deterioration of their
professional relationship. Makavejev's comments on the diary are
incorporated. A first-rate clash of personalities, but with something learnt
on both sides.
To return to fiction, Tim Pigott-Smith's reading of Jules Verne's Around The
World In Eighty Days (Argo 1310; 2 cassettes; 2 hours 45 minutes; abridged)
is brisk, expert and hugely enjoyable. Of course, it is a rattling good yarn
and the ending still breathless, after almost 120 years; and we still
half-believe the caricature of the imperturbable gentleman, 'a man of
heart', as we all know, 'when he has the time'.
Another period piece from Argo, Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men On The Bummel
(Argo 1304; 2 cassettes; 2 hours 15 minutes; abridged) was published in 1900
as a sequel to Three Men In A Boat. Bicycling in Germany was rather less
jolly than camping on the Thames, but the candid account of Germany, and the
Germans, at the turn of the century is full of interest. Apart from one or
two overblown accents, Jeremy Nicholas's reading is comfortably
companionable.
Once again it is possible to hear the late Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman,
reading his 1960 blank-verse autobiography, Summoned By Bells (BBC Radio
Collection ZBBC 1249; two cassettes, 2 hours), and to be astonished yet
again at how much of the man and his period and background are preserved In
it, like flies in amber. An immensely enjoyable listen.
Virgin Records has issued four CDs of Betjeman reading his poems (12 on each
CD) to music composed, arranged and conducted by Jim Parker: Banana Blush
(CASCD 1086; 39 minutes); Late-flowering Love (CASCD 1096; 43 minutes);
Britain (CASCD 1130; 42 minutes - includes Hunter Trials and A Subaltern's
Love Song) and Varsity Rag (CASCD 1154; 46 minutes). An appealing set, with
the poet's (slightly diffident) showman side prettily complemented by the
music. The recordings date from 1974-1981; Betjeman died In 1984.
Jill Balcon and the Rasumovsky String Quartet have recorded an agreeable
anthology on CD, The Sunlight On The Garden (Imperial Sound RAZCD 901), with
Louis MacNeice's elegiac poem of that title and passages from Vita
Sackville-West, Gertrude Jekyll, Laurie Lee, and others, and music which
includes Puccini, Haydn, Britten. (Ignore the small mistake in the opening
line of Jill Balcon's beautiful performance, since we all know that Francis
Bacon, Lord Verulam, actually wrote about ' ..the purest of human
pleasures', with an 's'.)

EMILY'S SHOES by Dermot Bolger Viking Pounds 14.99, 266 pages
THE LAST MAGICIAN by Janette Turner Hospital Virago Pounds 14.99, 352 pages
A FOOL'S ALPHABET by Sebastian Faulks Hutchinson Pounds 13.99, 275 pages
UNLIKE more aggressive nutters, the shoe fetishist seems a harmless,
easy-going fellow. Michael, the narrator of Emily's Shoes, simply lifts the
odd high-heeled pair from shop or jumble sale, takes it home and, as it
were, broods over it. Though he sometimes wears women's shoes, he is cagey
about it, and ashamed.
This obsession goes back to the days when, as a 10-year-old, he loses his
mother and is taken in by glamorous Aunt Emily who, like everyone else he
loves, forsakes him.
Shoes, though it is never spelled out, become all he can cope with,
man-made, external, replaceable. They won't die like his parents, or go mad
like his childhood sweetheart, or vanish into sex and marriage like Aunt
Emily. Michael's adult loneliness in a socially-awkward Dublin of oddities
and fakes, supposed miracles, pubs, churches, office blocks and slums,
becomes so intense that nothing can pierce it.
The story of his botched life is gloomy but aesthetically ebullient because
the writing is so strong, so exact, so much the right colour for each moment
and episode. The refusal to mourn, to acknowledge pain, to face the past, to
release spiritual poisons, has built up a throbbing pus of such horror that
only the banal prayer ('Jesus of every pair of women's shoes') seems
possible.
Anguish, unacknowledged but retrospectively felt, has to be dealt with
before a cure of sorts seems possible through dreams and memories. In this
way, Michael at last undergoes a sort of self-analysis. The writing is
triumphantly successful - bare, passionate, almost understating the almost
unstateable.
Janette Turner Hospital's The Last Magician has a complicated story spanning
about three decades. In its early stages, it tosses names and memories about
which only later acquire the necessary weight of feeling, but at the time
leave the reader irritatingly in the dark.
Yet from the first sentence, which echoes Dante, it has enormous energy and
power, both seemingly haphazard at the start, then gradually concentrating
on the central event which shapes the lives of everyone involved in the
story. This is the accidental death of a beautiful, loveable,
mentally-retarded child. In spite of their wild grief and sense of guilt,
all the adolescents who saw it can be called in some way responsible, and
all are pursued through life by the other's 'great beating wings' of action,
despair and memory.
This enormously ambitious book invokes not just Dante in its structure (the
inferno of subterranean Brisbane, all drugs, brothels and mayhem), but
literary figures in the writing itself, Shakespeare, Coleridge, Eliot,
Hopkins and others, often half-buried or echoed in a phrase rather than
quoted.
It seems a pity that some of the main figures from the shared Australian
childhood should have become, as adults, famous globe-trotters in television
and photography. In the early unfocused parts of the novel, that sort of
fame and life-style suggests something pop and bogus. But when real
characters emerge, this spurious air vanishes and with less curlicued
techniques (you have to work hard to reach them) the novel has enormous
punch and visual richness and becomes impressive.
Incidents are made into heightened moments of everyday reality. Everyone's
appearance becomes intensely memorable. Australia shimmers in a sort of
exotic ordinariness. Love and loyalty, strained and sometimes broken, become
the measure of everything human, and the mundane, without pretentiousness,
is given a new dimension. Extreme and extraordinary, the novel more or less
carries off its imagery and justifies its metaphors.
Sebastian Faulks' A Fool's Alphabet is, by comparison, tame and bland. It is
also pleasant, literate and a good read, a conventionally-told tale in an
unconventional narrative form. Calvino (say) might have made much of the
device; but an unusual format doesn't in itself produce unusual writing.
Twenty-six chapters, labelled from A to Z, are each set in the
appropriately-initialled place across half a century: A for Anzio, where the
hero, Pietro's father, lands with the Allies from North Africa in 1943 and
meets his Italian wife; Z for Zanica, the Italian village where Pietro is
conceived; in between, 24 other places around the world. The jerky variety
of place and time makes for an unmonotonous but, alas, unmemorable series of
vignettes: snapshots from the family album rather than the cumulative
reality of a novel.

enjoys a visit to the Marzotto collection

ALTHOUGH he died only 20 years ago, the Italian industrialist Count Gaetano
Marzotto seems a 19th century figure: an enlightened - by today's criteria
perhaps paternalistic - businessman, he created an ideal city for his
workers, established a chain of reasonably-priced, scrupulously clean and
well-run hotels in Southern Italy, where travel had long been a struggle
with discomfort and lack of hygiene, and set up the Marzotto Prizes to
reward merit in various fields.
For his private satisfaction, he assembled some 200 Italian paintings from
the latter half of the Ottocento, a collection that has been called 'the
greatest, the most complete, and the best chosen' of its period.
The Count had eight children and numerous grandchildren, and at his death,
the collection was divided among these heirs. Although some of the
individual pictures have been seen in exhibitions, there has never been a
public show devoted to the collection and the scattering of the works has
made the organisation of such a show a daunting enterprise.
Fortunately, the recently inaugurated Fondazione Magnani Rocca at Corte di
Mamiano (Parma) and the scholar Roberto Tassi faced the challenge and have
assembled almost a 100 pictures, which not only give a convincing notion of
Count Marzotto's taste but also an appealing and revealing panorama of
Italian painting between the mid-19th century and the early years of the
20th.
It is a period that 50 or so years ago was not highly regarded (and this low
opinion surely made Marzotto's collecting easier and perhaps less
expensive), and even now, while painters like Fattori and Palizzi and De
Nittis are in fashion again in Italy, they are largely unfamiliar outside
their homeland.
During the central decades of the Ottocento, Italy was politically united;
but socially and intellectually it remained a country of regions, of quite
different, even antithetical cultures.
Artists could travel more easily, but they carried the baggage of their
origins with them. Some, the bolder ones, eagerly went abroad and were
influenced by the foreign artists whom they encountered and whose works they
saw.
Clearly, Count Marzotto had a predilection for De Nittis, and the paintings
in the current exhibition represent a kind of show-within-the-show of
particular interest.
Born in Apulia in 1846, trained in Naples, De Nittis travelled in Northern
Italy, before going to Paris, where he settled in 1868. But he returned
often to Italy, sometimes for extended stays, and in Naples he made the
extraordinary series of studies of Vesuvius. Stark, even grim works,
solitary and usually unpeopled, they are in dramatic contrast with the
traditional (and lovely) views by earlier artists, with fishermen dancing
the tarantella on the shore of Posillipo as the volcano scatters glowing
lapilli and pours out bright red streams of lava.
In all, De Nittis painted more than 60 views, usually on small wooden
panels; the 12 works in the Marzotto collection include an almost abstract
scene of the crater and a sad and mysterious picture of the artist's
solitary horse, saddled and waiting to carry his master for the toilsome
ride to the plain.
Once united, Italy remained a military-minded country; and the collection
includes some army scenes, including Telemaco Signorini's large narrative
picture of the Tuscan Artillery at Montechiaro Greeted by the French Wounded
at Solferino (the artist was in the artillery himself).
But Giovanni Fattori's 'In Vedetta' (also known as 'The White Wall'), though
quieter in tone, is somehow more disturbing. This very famous,
much-reproduced picture, dating from around 1871, is one of the collection's
prizes. But, for that matter, Count Marzotto collected wisely, and nearly
all his pictures are of the highest quality. Also, unlike some collectors,
he was not afraid of big paintings. Happily, these large-scale works look at
home on the walls of the Magnani villa.
Luigi Magnani himself was a much more eclectic purchaser than Marzotto.
Rather than confine himself to a given period or school or country, he
simply bought what he admired; but like Marzotto, he wanted quality. So his
Goya, his Durer, his Titian and their companions are all first-rate. The
permanent collection is a perfect complement to this visiting exhibition
(which closes on 19 July). For that matter, a visit to the Corte di Mamiano
and the Magnani villa is, at any time, a rare pleasure.
The catalogue of the Marzotto exhibition (published by the Fondazione, with
texts by Andrea Baboni, Michela Scolaro and Simona Tosini Pizzetti, as well
as by the show's curator Tassi) is a valuable work of scholarship,
handsomely produced, with reproductions of paintings unavailable to the
curator but apposite to the exhibition.

<TEXT>
NO ONE who attempts to follow crime fiction expects to find a masterpiece
every time he or she picks up a new book. The murder fan seeks not so much a
great work as a comfortable read, a story that catches the imagination, but
allows the reader to relax at the same time. If, into the bargain, the
author writes well, so much the better.
The current stack of new thrillers happily includes some debuts of distinct
promise, even though there are no masterpieces to report for the moment.
Veronica Stallwood's Death Spell (Macmillan, Pounds 13.99, 207 pages) has
some Rendell-like skewed psychology, but also has some welcome, individual
qualities, chief of which is an evident gift for characterisation. The
protagonist is an attractive but irretrievable sloven, who lives with her
atrocious second husband in a fairly grand house near Oxford. She is
surrounded by a raft of children, some his, some hers, and the resultant
dirty linen, unwashed dishes, racket and disorder.
As you read Stallwood's wry, implacable description, you can almost smell
the burnt toast. The marginal characters - husband, neighbours, and a
splendidly efficient woman who runs a house-cleaning service - are neatly
drawn. The actual murder may be something of a disappointment (the
Rendellian element is too prominent), but the book is irresistibly readable.
Scotland has always been an ideal venue for misdeeds, but in Double Entry,
the first murder story of Margaret McKinlay (Collins, Pounds 13.99, 190
pages), the author uses local colour sparingly, and it is thus all the more
effective. This is one of those stories in which an apparently harmless,
virtually anonymous person becomes mysteriously the victim of violence and
threats of worse.
Numbed by the tragic loss of his young wife, the accountant John Leith has
not cultivated other people, and even with his girlfriend he has a somewhat
business-like relationship. His battle against evil ends with him not only
victorious, but also re-humanised. According to the blurb, Leith will be the
protagonist of future tales. It will be interesting to follow him.
A nearly-decomposed body is found in a long-neglected farm building, and a
10-year-old suspicion of murder is revived. Ninette Walters, in her first
novel, The Ice House (Macmillan, Pounds 13.99, 240 pages), bites off a lot
of story, perhaps a bit more than the reader will want to chew. But, in
allowing herself ample space, she makes it possible to develop a large cast
of closely-observed, unusual characters, their complex relationships, and
the social setting of their several dramas. Once in a while, the writer
indulges in excessively colourful prose, but for the most part the writing
is direct, telling, arresting; and the dialogue is intelligent, often funny.
Colourful prose is the name of Rowland Morgan's game, and Morgan's first
novel, Tall Dead Wives (Bloomsbury, 178 pages, Pounds 5.99), is so
outrageously over-written that, short as it is, for some readers (including
this reviewer) it will be impenetrable. A sample passage: 'An image of Peppi
came to me: emerging from the turquoise sea, surging up on glistening
honey-coloured thighs, with streaming golden seaweed hair. Incoherent
jealousy stabbed my gut, curdling the juice of crazy love.'
There is probably a story buried beneath all the adjectives, but who cares?
Answer: somebody must, because a second Rowland Morgan has followed hard on
the honey-coloured heels of the first.

verse

THE FABER BOOK OF 20th CENTURY SCOTTISH POETRY edited by Douglas Dunn Faber
Pounds 17.50, 424 pages
THERE IS a problem about Scotland, Scots and Scottishness - that much is
undeniable. Is she a province and her culture a provincial adjunct to
English culture? Or does she possess her own proud national identity and,
along with that, a culture that somehow embodies it? Or is English now the
true - in fact, the only - language of Scotland? Is it merely an act of
emotional recidivism to claim otherwise; to assert, for example, that Gaelic
culture (there are only 80,000 Gaelic speakers in Scotland) could expect
even to exist without artificial sustenance ?
As Douglas Dunn makes clear in what must be the longest introduction to an
anthology of contemporary poetry for many a year, Scotland and her writers
have been wrestling with these sorts of problems since the Act of Union in
1707, but the arguments were brought to a particularly combative head by the
great, impassioned debate between Hugh MacDiarmid and Edwin Muir in the
1920s.
Hugh MacDiarmid (he was born CM Grieve and the assumption of the MacDiarmid
identity was coterminous with his decision to become the official
representative of the Scottish Literary Renascence), a man who could be
gentleness itself when in private company but a creature upon whom a red
mist seemed to descend when he rose to fulminate from a public platform,
held that the Scottish psyche needed to be cleansed of all English
influence; the way in which Robert Louis Stevenson had expressed the
dissimilarity between the two nations - the Scots, he said, were to be known
for 'a strong Scotch accent of the mind' - was simply not good enough. What
was needed, argued MacDiarmid, was a movement that, in building a new
national literature, would construct a national identity. And that meant the
creation of a new language: Lallans.
Unfortunately, the language that he devised was a wholly artificial one,
consisting of obsolete words culled from out-of-print dictionaries that the
inhabitants of the Lowlands merely gaped at. Could such a language as this
ever hope to underpin even a literary - let alone a political - nationalism?
MacDiarmid's philological verve, his linguistic recklessness, his pillaging
of dictionaries for the most abstruse gems imaginable, remind us of his
American counterpart, Ezra Pound - they share an eccentricity of scholarship
which, when let loose in the real world of politics, quickly moved in the
direction of a naive and exceedingly dangerous demagoguery.
Edwin Muir, on the other hand, thought English the only authentic language
for Scottish poetry; MacDiarmid and others condemned that as lese-majeste.
Their quarrel became a celebrated enmity of the kind all-too-familiar to
those who have grown up in a small house such as Scotland is.
The poetry that Dunn himself has chosen to represent the achievements of
Scotland in his century gives us, as one might expect, a whole host of
equivocal answers to these questions of theory. The voice of poetry itself
seems to say: Scotland is neither a nation nor a province. For some it is
one, and to another it is the other. And to a third group - those who exist
in the naive state of spending their lives staring at plants, animals and
other people - the problem seems not to exist at all.
There are, indeed, three languages at work here - Scots, Gaelic and English
 -and they provide us with a remarkably rich and complicated story. Gaelic
has endured and its poetry does, indeed, possess a nostalgia for a remoter
and more harsh civilisation than ours. But to deny that the poets writing in
it possess authentic voices is akin to denying the authentic thrill of
archaeological discovery. Civilisations do co-exist, one upon another; and
to see and to feel with our forebears gives back to us something of what we
were and are. But Scotland's poetry also has the capacity to be
contemporaneous and richly experimental - consider the 'Glasgow Sonnets' of
Edwin Morgan, for example; and it is also being written in Tom Leonard's
Glasgow vernacular, the real speech of genuinely uncouth people.
And if many of these poems sound at times like the lamentations of a
rootless people, is it for us - or them - to condemn a finely-crafted piece
of work on the grounds of melancholia? We may as well condemn ourselves for
being alive.

CAMPING WITH THE PRINCE AND OTHER TALES OF SCIENCE IN AFRICA by Thomas Bass
Lutterworth Press Pounds 15.95, 320 pages
NOMAD: JOURNEYS FROM SAMBURU by Mary Anne Fitzgerald Sinclair-Stevenson
Pounds 16.95, 289 pages
MONROVIA MON AMOUR: A VISIT TO LIBERIA by Anthony Daniels John Murray Pounds
17.95, 493 pages
THE LINK between mouth rammers and pheromones, the fate of Africa, and why
we should care, may not be immediately obvious. Read Thomas Bass's seminal
book and find out. It not only gives reasons for not despairing of Africa;
it suggests why it is in our self-interest to help a continent in crisis.
Mouth rammers are fish found in Lake Malawi from whom we might learn more
about our evolution; their cousins could help eliminate bilharzia, caused by
water-borne parasites that debilitate millions in Africa and elsewhere.
Pheromones are the molecular words used by insects to communicate. Research
into their 'language' by a Kenyan institute could make insects our allies
rather than adversaries in the battle against crop diseases. It is this
combination of information that Africa holds, and the potential that could
be unlocked, that makes Thomas Bass's account of seven scientific
expeditions into Africa so important.
President Hastings Banda's stewardship of Malawi becomes of more than
passing concern when one learns that over-fishing Lake Malawi could threaten
'the most serious evolutionary laboratory in the world.' Its waters are home
to 1,000 species of Cichlidae, a perchlike fish. In the process of evolving,
Cichlidae have adopted virtually every form of fish behaviour, 'which makes
the lake an encyclopaedic text for studying the mechanisms of evolution'.
Mouth rammers, members of the Cichlidae family, provide one fascinating
example. They are pedophagists: they attack a pregnant female, knock the
eggs or fry out of her mouth, and eat them. If this seems an esoteric reason
for being concerned that Lake Malawi is being over-fished, then consider the
following. Cichlids may also help in the battle against bilharzia. Lake
Malawi is free of the disease because several species of cyclids eat snails,
including the type responsible for spreading the bilharzia parasites.
The fate of Kenya becomes more pressing when one learns about the work of
Thomas Odhiambo and his colleagues at Kenya's International Centre of Insect
Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE). Pheromones are used for communications
between insects; and insects and plants use other signals, known as
semiochemicals, to communicate with each other: 'If scientists can learn to
talk these languages, they should be able to direct insects among plants
like boxcars in a switching yard.' It is unlikely that the ICIPE, the only
research institute in the world devoted exclusively to the study of insects,
could survive instability in Kenya.
And if Mary Anne Fitzgerald is right, the country faces troubled times. But
Nomad, her account of her travels and travails in and beyond Kenya, is more
than a compassionate, engrossing account of Africa by one of the continent's
most remarkable correspondents. It is the story of resilience in adversity,
of how she rebounded after her expulsion from Kenya, home for 22 years, and
the insights the experience afforded her.
A white African living in limbo in London, she yearns for her homeland: 'I
needed the comforting African odour of wood smoke, damp earth and rancid
animal fat.' The way she comes to terms with this anguish makes Nomad into
something more than a good book about Africa.
The bleakest view of the continent comes from Anthony Daniels, who wrote an
entertaining and pseudonymous indictment of Julius Nyerere's Tanzania
(Filosofa's Republic, Pickwick Books). Reading his account of his visit to
Monrovia in the aftermath of Liberia's horrific civil war is rather like
travelling with a knowledgeable but opinionated companion, sometimes
thought-provoking, sometimes entertaining, and sometimes so infuriating you
wished you were in separate hotels.
His dismissive, three-paragraph treatment of the US role in the tragedy
prompted our first row. Washington sustained an evil regime, and then
abnegated responsibility when it collapsed, I argued. Realpolitik, he
replied, and could not resist lecturing me on liberals who protect Africa
from the truth about itself. You do a similar disservice to your reader in
your complacent treatment of Washington's record, I replied, getting hot
under the collar. But I did not check out of our hotel.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: Streetlamps on the road to progress - A new study on
the role of universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE IDEA OF THE UNIVERSITY by Jaroslav Pelikan Yale Pounds 20, 238 pages
This spring all three senior officers of Yale University - President,
Provost and Dean - resigned because of the financial and political pressures
put upon them; in a separate crisis the President of Columbia University has
done likewise. These great academic institutions represent only the most
visible examples of the troubled state of American higher education.
The stresses are equally serious in British universities. During the last
dozen years the government has cut resources and simultaneously pressed
universities to increase student numbers. Inevitably, standards are falling.
The relabelling of polytechnics as universities is a symptom of the change:
higher education is becoming factory-like, with volume and throughput as
governing concepts and the minimising of unit-costs as the aim.
We live in the Age of Accountancy, and ledgers determine agenda:
universities are being pressed to cut staff, squeeze larger numbers of
students into crumbling campuses, reduce library budgets, make university
terms longer and degree courses shorter. What can be expected from this?
Something utterly different from the vanishing ideal of a higher education,
and something far less good.
The hard-headed will ask, so what? Money is not in limitless supply; why
should society not get value for its money in universities as elsewhere? Why
not indeed. But what value should we get? This is the question that Jaroslav
Pelikan, sets out to answer.
His excellent book could not be more timely. Pelikan, a distinguished
scholar and university administrator, has as its aim a fresh assessment of
the role and value of the university in society. His conclusions are
extraordinarily important because of the presures on universities on both
sides of the Atlantic from left and right alike.
His discussion takes the form of a meditation on John Henry Newman's The
Idea of a University Defined and Illustrated, originally presented as
lectures in the 1850s when Newman was setting up the Catholic University of
Dublin as its first Rector. Utilitarians had argued that the value of
knowledge resides in its use as a means to such ends as controlling nature
and creating wealth.
Newman asserted that knowledge is an end in itself, worth pursuing and
having for its own sake; and that the university is the home of this
disinterested quest.
Pelikan agrees, and adds that treating knowledge as an intrinsic value must
be understood in a wider context of intellectual virtues. These include
freedom of enquiry; intellectual integrity; good-mannered debate; tolerance
of differing opinions; rationality as a supreme value; and preparedness to
submit the conclusions of enquiry to public assessment. The object is not to
impose or defend given ideologies or moralities, but to strive, with utmost
respect for truth, towards increased understanding of humanity and the
world.
It is obvious that the pursuit of knowledge on these terms is an intrinsic
good. When one adds the instrumental good - the fact that enquiry yields a
host of scientific, social and cultural benefits and produces trained minds
and professional skills to serve the community - it is obvious likewise that
the pursuit of knowledge is an absolute good. But the setting in which
enquiry occurs is all-important. Universities provide that setting because
they uniquely combine four activities: research, teaching, collecting the
materials of scholarship, and publishing the outcomes. If any one of these
mutually necessary activities ceases, the others are immediately
impoverished and soon nullified.
Pelikan argues that universities can only function if all four activities
are maintained, and at the best standards. The present crisis in higher
education stems from the fact that they, and the conditions of enquiry they
sustain, are under threat from financial cuts, from internal and external
political hostility, and because the wider public no longer understands the
importance of having universities.
Pelikan is neither star-struck nor a special pleader. He is swift with the
lash when universities deserve it. Universities and dons can, and sometimes
have, let themselves and society down. But the contribution they make is not
a luxury. Without having in its midst a continuing search for knowledge and
understanding, conducted in freedom and with vigour to the highest standards
of excellence - and producing successive generations of reflective,
knowledgeable, literate minds - a society is dead.
By reconsidering Newman's views Pelikan gives a thoughtful, eloquent
restatement of the university ideal, reminding us at this crucial moment in
the history of higher education that to cut facilities and standards in the
universities is to switch out the streetlamps on the road to progress.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: Weaving a subtle web across Latin America - A
posthumous novel by Manuel Puig
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TROPICAL NIGHT FALLING by Manual Puig Faber Pounds 13.99, 188 pages
THE Argentinian writer Manuel Puig died aged 58 in Mexico in 1990. His band
of British admirers will welcome this posthumous publication of a novel that
shows Puig's gifts remaining to the last at full strength. For newcomers
Puig offers a convenient point of entry into the exciting world of
contemporary Latin American fiction. But be warned. Puig's novels contain as
much aggression, abuse of women, blood and tears as you will find in his
better-known Latin American colleagues, Marquez, Vargas Llosa and the rest.
The difference is that in Puig violence of content is mitigated by
conciseness, ironic humour and a strict Aristotelian sense of form.
Puig's favourite trick is his use of reported conversation, diary extracts,
newspaper clippings and other forms of documentation to turn the reader into
an investigator who has to make sense of events never seen directly. As in
crime fiction, and science fiction, whose techniques Puig uses for his own
purposes of penetrating complex motivation, the full significance of what
happens often emerges only when crucial events have been described over and
over again.
Puig takes Latin America as a whole for his canvas. His characters shuttle
freely throughout the region. Many live in the great cities, Buenos Aires,
Sao Paolo, Rio, Mexico City; others inhabit the small towns and villages in
tightly-knit communities where poverty is rife. His novels embrace all
creeds, classes, ethnic strains, Indian, Spanish, Portuguese. The heroine of
Pubis Angelical (1986) is an international beauty and film star, the hero of
Blood of Requited Love (1982) is an electrical construction worker. Puig's
acute ear picks up rhythms and cadences of speech at various levels of
society, from the most affluent to the most indigent, and converts them into
revelatory patterns of dialogue.
The international scope of his fiction was a spin-off from his career. He
was born in 1932 in a small town in Argentina. He read philosophy at the
University of Buenos Aires and in 1956 he won a scholarship to study film
direction in Rome at the Cinecitta. He worked in films in Rome as an
assistant director until 1962. Then he emerged as a writer with a string of
'icily brilliant' novels - in the words of one critic  - such as Betrayed by
Rita Hayworth, Heartbreak Tango, and The Kiss of the Spider Woman. Most of
them are available here in translation in Faber paperback editions and some
have been used as the basis for films and for scenarios performed by fringe
theatre and dance groups.
The posthumous Tropical Night Falling, well translated by Suzanne Jill
Levine, shows Puig at his most adroit and entertaining. It is a sharp social
comedy of contemporary life with wry, sad undertones. The protagonists are
two Argentinian sisters, Nidia and Lici, both in their early 80s. Lici lives
in exile in Rio and Nidia is staying with her after the death of her
daughter. They are part of a sizeable Argentinian colony in Brazil, many of
whose members are refugees from previous regimes back home.
Neither sister is yet senile, and they are both avid consumers of gossip.
Their great source is Lici's neighbour Silvia, a younger compatriot of
theirs and a psychotherapist. 'She left Argentina during the era of
Isabelita' says Lici, 'and the Triple A when they had that campaign accusing
all psychoanalysts of being left wing'. Silvia has a husband from whom she
is divorced and is in the process of acquiring a lover whom she met during a
spell in hospital.
If the progress of Silvia's extraordinary amour, vigorously enjoyed during a
psychoanalytic conference on a small holiday island off the Brazilian coast,
appears to be - somewhat in the manner of David Lodge  - the main subject of
the novel, this is a typical Puig feint. It is the sisters themselves whose
lives come more and more to engage the reader's attention, their remarkable,
continuing vitality, although they are very old, immobile and isolated.
That vitality becomes even more apparent in Nidia after Puig plays his trump
card - the sudden death of Lici on a visit to her son in Lucerne. Nidia
hires a teenage girl to look after her at night. Into Nidia's prosperous
bourgeois world enters this creature whose life is lived at bare subsistence
level. With the girl's appearance a gentle comedy of old age is finally and
decisively shattered by the bloodshed and mayhem that is always waiting to
break out of the hidden depths of a society that, on its calm surface, so
closely resembles our own.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: Of Atlantis, and other lost causes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FLOOD FROM HEAVEN by Eberhard Zangger Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Pounds 17.50,
256 pages
COULD the story of Atlantis, the mythical lost continent usually placed near
the Straits of Gibraltar, really be about Troy and the collapse of the
Mycenaean kingdoms of Greece in the 12th century BC? This is the startling
theme of The Flood from Heaven.
Ho ho] It must be another crackpot notion like those about the Ark,
Stonehenge and prehistoric UFOs. People love to believe them; they do not
threaten a rational life as they are about dead-and-gone times; they always
make the experts wrong; and they sell well, despite usually damning reviews.
Such a scenario seems to have worried Eberhard Zangger's publishers enough
to make them ask Anthony Snodgrass, Professor of Classical Archaeology at
Cambridge, to write a foreword to show that this time everybody is serious.
Only Plato tells us about Atlantis. Writing in the 4th century BC, he
describes a city state that the sea swallowed up 9,000 years ago, and says
his story comes from the Athenian poet-philosopher-politician Solon, who
heard it from priests in Egypt two centuries earlier. It sounds like a
paradise: the earth was fruitful, technology efficient, laws were just and
all knew their position. Is it based on reality? Or a never-never land
version of Plato's ideal state, given mythical historicity to make it more
important? I sense that Plato was making his own new myth during a depressed
period after the prince he had tutored to be a philosopher-king had gone to
the bad.
For Zangger, the Atlantis story has the ring of truth. It is, he suggests,
an often accurate account of the great city of Troy conflated with the
Mycenaean civilisation known to us from archaeology and Homer. As an expert
on how the early people of the Aegean used the land - the key to
understanding any culture - he has worked most at the Mycenaean citadel of
Tiryns. There he has seen the damage (as Plato was the first to describe)
caused by cutting down trees: flash floods, soil erosion and alluviation
that strands towns once on the sea high and dry inland. Did this destroy
Atlantis?
It is a book of very mixed quality. It is exceptionally lively on
environmental matters, but myths tend to become facts as the book goes on,
and that is dangerous. Very little of Homer really matches the Mycenaeans'
world; Atlantis is surely the product of Plato's mind and makes good sense
in terms of his philosophy.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BORIS] Boris] they hailed him in Washington last month. But what sort of a
man is he? His image outside Russia is that of a leader at once brave and
resolute, tactless and impulsive, the man of the hour in the failed Moscow
coup, a touch naive about politics, maybe, but on the personal side a damned
good fellow who shares his country- men's fondness for vodka.
Boris Yeltsin, a political biography by two former Soviet journalists,
Vladimir Solovyov and Elena Klepikova (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 18.99)
alters this impression in one crucial respect. Yeltsin is portrayed as
genuinely egalitarian. As First Secretary in Moscow he assaulted the system
of party privileges, shops, cars, dachas. 'I cannot take imported miracle
drugs knowing that my next-door-neighbour has no aspirin for her child.'
Gorbachev's personal style is depicted as the exact opposite of Yeltsin's.
In this contrast, it is suggested, lay the roots of their hostility. As
Boris' popularity rose, so Mikhail's fell. Yeltsin's speech to the Party
Plenum, resigning from the Politburo, was the turning point, the small stone
that released the avalanche. It was, an emotional, hesitant speech, not a
prepared attack: but it was seen as treason by the comfortable, conformist,
above all undemocratic, leadership. 'I'll never let you back into politics,'
warned Gorbachev.
How he came back is the story of this flattering account, part thriller,
part political analysis. And there is a lot more to come, no doubt, as (or
if) Yeltsin goes on. A useful cross- check on these events is provided by
the well-known Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner in Eyewitness (Hodder &amp;
Stoughton, Pounds 12.99). His account, mixing his personal reaction to
events, which as a journalist endangered his own position, with an informed
perspective on the wider meaning of Kremlin politics, has the virtue of
first-hand reporting.
At the mass rally in Dzerzhinsky Square after the coup, Pozner was called by
the crowd to speak. He found the right words, though they seem now too
optimistic. 'I want to thank the junta for what it did for us . . . for
uniting us, for finally bringing us together . . . for helping us recover
our pride . . . for giving us back our army.' The fact that the soldiers had
refused to obey the junta and storm the Russian Parliament, saved Yeltsin
and saved the day, and turned a momentous page in history.
Could Gorbachev have done better than he did, Pozner wonders? Probably.
Could someone else have done a better job? Maybe. Did he miss golden
opportunities and thereby botch things - yes, he did. The coup was the
fulcrum which precipitated his downfall, but the killings in Vilnius when
the Soviet troops moved into Lithuania was the start.
Everyone who lived through those events has their own story to tell, not
least first-rate British reporters. In Out Of Red Darkness (John Murray,
Pounds 16.95) Trevor Fishlock of the Telegraph and in Goodbye to the USSR
Steve Crawshaw of the Independent (Bloomsbury, Pounds 18.99) each provide
alert, lucid and well-paced assessments of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Another way of getting the flavour, of sensing the poetic truth of why the
system failed, may be found in fiction, in the form of Alexander Zinoviev's
mordantly funny satire Perestroika in Partygrad (Peter Owen, Pounds 10.95) A
model town, where nothing has ever happened (though there is plenty to
hide), Partygrad is scheduled to become a 'lighthouse of perestroika', to
attract admiring visitors from the West. This scenario allows the narrator
to draw an anatomy of the party, its functionaries and hacks and hangers-on,
the whole spectrum of society in its muddle, wistfulness, indulgence,
inefficiency and solace in fine words and hard liquor. It is an
affectionate, in a paradoxical way patriotic, account which shows exactly
why Communism could never never work. More worrying, it implies that
perestroika has not got a chance, either.
But the voice of the people, cold and raw as vodka itself, comes through
most strongly in their own words, in two books simply recording their
feelings. A wide range of Soviet voices is given in Russia Speaks, an oral
history from the revolution to the present, by the American writer Richard
Lourie (HarperCollins, Pounds 16.99). The author travelled from Moscow to
Central Asia, from Lithuania to Georgia, and interviewed all manner of
people, from soldiers, and Gulag survivors to clowns and priests, all
longing to talk.
More sombre are the voices heard in Zinky Boys by Svetlana Alexievich
(Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 9.99). This was the name given to the young Soviet
soldiers who came back from the war in Afghanistan in zinc coffins.
Something like 15,000 lives were lost, with more than double that number
seriously wounded. Yet their families were denied even the right to express
their grief properly.
Many of these reminiscences are heart-rending. 'Both my legs were amputated
above the knee. If only they'd been taken off below the knee - that would've
been fine] I'd be a happy man]' Yet if the same circumstances arose, this
conscript says he would go back.
A useful guide to the rapidly changing world of the Commonwealth of
Independent States is provided by Russia Revised by Andrew Wilson and Nina
Bachkatov (Andre Deutsch, Pounds 9.99). It is compiled with wit as well as
hard facts. Thus under 'Cosmonaut': 'Favourite hero of Soviet small boys,
until Yuri Gagarin was ousted by Crocodile Dundee.'

THE GOOD news is that with the opening of the A26 autoroute extension
between Chalons-sur-Marne and Troyes on June 30, one can now drive from
Calais to the Mediterranean without seeing a single traffic light.
The bad news is that if you tried to do so last week, you would have been
stuck in the world's biggest jam, courtesy of anarchic French farmers and
lorry drivers.
My wife and I were lucky. Invited to attend the official opening, we drove
off Sealink Stena's Invicta at Calais and pointed the Audi 100 tdi east. Two
and a half hours and 172 miles (270 kms) later we had parked at Hotel Les
Consuls in Reims.
Over dinner at Le Vigneron (a mere two knives and forks in Michelin does it
less than justice) Didier Kreig, of Champagne-Ardennes comite de tourisme,
suggested that we await events in the morning. The opening ceremony was off.
With sang froid a stiff upper-lipped Englishman would have been proud of,
Didier proposed a drive to Epernay, a helicopter flight over the vineyards
and, naturally, lunch.
Later, when we reached the start of the new autoroute just north of Chalons,
there was not a single farm tractor or lorry in sight - and virtually no
other traffic, either. It was tempting to cruise the ultra long-legged Audi
diesel at the 100 mph (161 kmh) and more it was clearly designed for. The
new 47 mile (75 km) section links the A4 autoroute 16 miles (26 kms) south
east of Reims with the A5 near Royes. From there it is 93 miles/150 kms to
Dijon and another 118 miles/190 kms to Lyon by the A6 via Beaune.
Unlike British motorways, which seem to be open for years before service
areas are built, the SANEF company operating the A26 made sure that by June
30 a filling station, shop and restaurant, the Sommesous aire de service at
half distance, with everything a traveller could need, from showers and a
sauna to coin-operated fax machines, were all up and running.
Drivers traveling from Calais to southern or eastern France or to
Switzerland will not have to go near Paris and the dreaded peripherique
again. Instead, they should try breaking their journey at the ancient city
of Troyes. Parking may not be easy, but it is worth a visit.

<TEXT>
HONDA'S latest CRX is quite unlike the energetic little buzz-box of a
Civic-derived coupe it replaces. A two-seat convertible, it has a hard top
that lifts off in one piece and slots into the boot lid.
There are two versions, both powered by 1.6 litre VTEC engines from the
Civic. The 125 horsepower CRX ESi, with 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic,
has the acceleration of a 2-litre car, rides comfortably and handles with
precision. Topless in the sun on the switchback roads of the Border country
of Scotland, its nimbleness made it pure joy to drive.
With the power-operated rear window retracted, wind noise and buffetting
were minimal. The boot is big; roomy enough for the CRX to be used as a
holiday touring car, not just as a stylish runabout.
The CRX VTi (pictured), with 160 horsepower - a hard-to- believe output from
a naturally aspirated 1.6 litre - felt even more vigorous than the ESi. But
it would not be my choice. Lower geared for fiercer acceleration it was
fussier, harder riding and less refined.
Prices are attractive; Pounds 14,950 for the ESi, Pounds 16,450 for the VTi.
Honda says that as the CRX comes off the same assembly line as the Civic, it
can be built to the highest standards at a lower cost than low volume
sporting two-seaters.
The hood is easily lifted off but Honda plans to offer a powered version
later this year. At the touch of a button twin arms rise from the boot, lift
off the roof, stow it under the boot lid and then sink back out of sight.
James Bond would have approved.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Sport: Exquisite Gower turns off the power - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS WITH cricket, so with tennis. First everyone welcomes the dawn of a new
era - power play. In cricket the West Indian fast bowlers of the 60s, such
as the thunderous Wes Hall, made pure pace the dominant force in the game.
While the serve and volley tennis players were blasting back line tennis off
the courts.
A generation later, there are rallies in tennis, but no beautiful batting or
subtle bowling in cricket. All is hard and fast, at the expense of the
skilful. Hence the rapture among English cricket fans as there seems to be a
renaissance of touch play in Test matches. We are overdue for one. Graham
Gooch has never made a secret of the fact that he thinks batsmen are there
to score runs. The method is unimportant; the number is vital. Anyone
privileged to see his unbeaten 154 at Headingley last summer, fought out
through seven hours of rain-soaked determination, to win the first Test
against the West Indies, will understand the power of his argument.
Runs are crucial. Lovers of stylish batting would merely point out that,
under pressure, style can be as good as brute force at scoring runs. Witness
David Gower's gracious 73 in last week's Old Trafford Test, scored in the
heat of battle, with light touch and exquisite timing.
Gooch is a believer in work, sweat and training as the tools of success and
much has been made of the idea that he does not like the devil-may-care
element in Gower's cricket. Gower's flight over Queensland's Carrarra
Ground, in a 1938 Tiger-Moth, on England's ill-fated, ill-tempered tour of
Australia in the winter of 1990-91, brought him grim disapproval from Gooch
and the tour's officials. Little was made of the fact that Gower hit two
consecutive Test centuries in tough matches and his tour average was 45,
second only to Gooch's 53.
It is significant that it is to Gower that the English captain and selectors
have turned in their hour of need, with England's batting stale and
unconvincing. Not only does this move admit that style can be strong, but it
may also help to take away some of the mythology which tends to make people
suspicious of stylish cricket.
Gower is a rare phenomenon. Salim Malik, the Pakistan vice-captain, is a
more typical stylish batsman, who also uses fire and muscle. His repertoire
includes hard-hit swings, cuts and chops, as well as his elegant shots off
the front foot.
Alec Stewart bats with an air of defiance, a refusal to feel the bruises,
which often draws attention away from the handsome character of his strokes.
Just because he carried his bat (69 not out) heroically through the collapse
and chaos at Lord's, as England's second innings was destroyed by Waqar
Younis and Wasim Akram, does not mean that he did so stolidly. His footwork
was fast and many of his shots, especially off his legs, deliciously deft.
Watching Stewart deal with Pakistan's lethal bowling was delightful in the
same way that watching Waqar deliver his lethal bowling, with sudden, fierce
swings and movements of the ball, was delightful. It was fascinating and
satisfying. Waqar's is fast bowling with class, too quickly gone for easy
wallowing in its delights.
Wasim, though bowling wonderfully well at Lord's, has a less mysterious
technique and his appeal is simpler, at its searing best with stumps
spinning through the air. English crowds seldom see that kind of bowling.
The scurvy of our game is medium pace. Effective though it can be at times,
it is not inspiring. Nor would it seek to be; it wears its victims down,
batsmen and spectators alike. We are plagued with medium pace bowling in all
its prosaic abundance.
Small wonder that stylish batsmen are few; they have only occasional forays
into the subtleties and temptations of slow, flighted, spin bowling to
sharpen their wits. It was the more succulent, then, to feast on a weekend
of all sorts of bowling in the Lord's Test, with spin, swing and speed
showing off their respective splendours.
Spin bowling is stylish by nature. It has to be because it is slow and its
power lies in bewildering the batsman with the unexpected movement of the
ball. If its movements become routine, it is done for. Spin has always been
one of the glories of the game in India and Pakistan, where good leg-spin is
the supreme bowling achievement.
Mushtaq Ahmed, Pakistan's new young leg-spinner, can be wayward, but he can
spin the ball drastically from leg to off. His googly action disguises the
deception of spin from off to leg. It is enough to unnerve as experienced a
batsman as Robin Smith, brought up on bowling that does not need to be
deciphered before it is played. When Mushtaq bowled him in the first Texaco
one-day game, Smith had no idea where the ball had gone, even after it had
re-arranged his stumps.
In the Lord's Test, it was a fine sight to see Ian Salisbury, the Sussex
leg-spinner, still tossing the ball right up to the batsmen and still
seeking to turn it at the end of a full day's play, with Pakistani victory
impending. He does not spin the ball as much as Mushtaq but he stays on the
attack and he stays calm. These are valuable qualities for a spin bowler.
Too much mystique is not a good thing. It can distract the bowler as well as
the batsman and the supreme skill of spin bowling is to find the right
balance between enigma and aggression, so the batsman never feels safe.
Mushtaq and Salisbury are only 22 years old, with plenty to learn about
this. As long as they do not give up, however expensive and discouraging the
process may be, art and guile stand a good chance of coming into their own
again.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Sport: Modern sailor goes for gold - Olympic Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO sportsman hates anything more than the 'leather medal'. Fourth] So near,
yet so far that when the anthems play and the photographers surround the
rostrum one might as well have been 31st. Finn sailor Stuart Childerley
travels to Barcelona having got that particular experience out of his
system.
At Seoul he was 22 and the youngest Finn class sailor ever to represent
Britain. Fancied for gold he struggled to make fourth. 'It was like doing a
bellyflop after a series of perfect dives,' mused Childerley, just back from
Gdansk where he completed his Olympic preparations by taking the class
European championship. 'It took me a long time to get over it and even
longer to make another Olympic commitment.'
What makes this solid, powerful young man particularly interesting is that
he is almost the prototype of the modern professional sailor. He has done
nothing since leaving school but sail, carefully seeking spots on boats that
will broaden his experience. Many dinghy sailors rely on technical knowledge
of rig and sails but Childerley sees the problems much more in terms of
bringing different inputs to a campaign.
Revealingly, when the lavishly-funded Wings of Oracle campaign for the 1991
Admirals Cup began to founder, the panicking sponsor turned to Childerley to
skipper a yacht where an RAF crew were mutinying against civilian
leadership. The safe choice, would have been someone of Harold Cudmore's
generation but Childerley's calm leadership was exemplary. He made few
enemies in a situation fraught with anger and thwarted ambition.
Superficially, the Olympics looks a quite different proposition. Childerley
is, for a start, sailing in the male single- handed class. The Finn,
designed in 1950 for the 1952 Helsinki games, has a large sail area and a
relatively heavy hull calling for strength, stamina and plenty of individual
determination.
Childerley went to Seoul as he went on the water, virtually a one-man band.
'Psychologic- ally all my effort went into qualifying and winning the
pre-Olympic regatta,' he reflects. 'I thought I'd wrapped it all up before I
even got to Korea.'
When things began to unravel - beginning with the destruction of his masts
by a fork-lift truck at the airport - he was short of wise counsel.
'This time I've put together much more of a group of people - a Finn team -
with Stuart simply driving the boat. It takes a lot of the pressure off me,'
Childerley explains. Among the group is veteran sailor John Boyce, an
amiable middle-aged mainsheet man who has taken time off from his business
to travel to European regattas with Childerley this year.
'Going round Europe with a kitbag can be pretty lonely and John is someone
who's technically capable of coaching me and whose company I enjoy,' the
helmsman commented. Australian sailmaker John Welch plays a similar role in
the team, re-cutting and tuning the Finn sails at Childerley's key regattas.
He likens it to the team behind a Formula One car. The spotlight is on the
driver but dozens of people beaver away in the background. F1 is hugely
expensive and needs massive sponsorship to pay its costs. Childerley is no
stranger to that arena either.
His campaign is sponsored by PowerGen and Owners Abroad (the holiday group),
with a raft of smaller corporate supporters. So keen is Childerley to
support his sponsors that he is paying a PR company to look after their
interests. 'With so many people trying to grab a piece of the action I feel
it's vital to ensure that a sponsor gets a proper return and is as
fully-briefed as possible,' he commented.
Finn sailing is probably the most physically demanding sport on the water.
The helmsman must be strong enough to lean out from the boat and support his
weight on thigh and stomach muscles throughout a two-hour race. The low
freeboard means that he is waveswept for much of the time.
At the same time he must have a strong tactical grasp of the race going on
around him - with no crew to bounce ideas off. Small wonder that most of the
top America's Cup and Whitbread race skippers of the past decade have had
Finn experience.
Although he is too discreet to say so, it is a reasonable to assume that
Childerley's plan is to take the gold medal at Barcelona and use the victory
as a platform from which to stand centre-stage in British yachting for the
next 20 years.
All the pieces are in place. Now it is up to him. 'I've put everything I've
learned in the last eight years on this one regatta,' he said. 'But it's an
investment not a gamble.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOM Watson was trying to explain what he thought of Carnoustie as a golf
course. Watson pondered and then said he likened the course to an ugly old
woman who at least is honest with you. 'When you add up your score after
your round, she tells you what she thinks of you,' he said, smiling that
gap-toothed signature grin of his.
What does he think of Muirfield, site of the Open championship that will
start on Thursday? 'I have good thoughts about Muirfield,' Watson said. 'I
love playing links courses and Muirfield is a links course. In fact, it is
one of my favourite courses. What you see is what you get. There is not a
weak hole on the course.'
It was at Muirfield in 1980 that Watson won his third Open and in 1987,
Faldo's year, only a poor fourth round, a 74, stopped him challenging once
again for the game's oldest major championship.
The home of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, whose 13 articles,
written down in 1744 were the first rules of golf, Muirfield is generally
held to be the fairest and best of the courses on the Open rota.
(Carnoustie, where Watson won his first Open, in 1975, is a sterner test of
golf but cannot offer the requisite number of bedrooms for the caravanserai
that comprises an Open championship). It is laid out on land that has been
golfing terrain since the Honourable Gentlemen moved east from Musselburgh
in 1891.
Though it lacks the coastal setting of Turnberry, the ruggedness of Royal
Birkdale, the deadening weight of history of St Andrews, the universal
appeal of Muirfield comes largely from its peaceful setting. To appreciate
it stand outside the clubhouse and look around to all points of the compass.
To the north sand dunes in the foreground lead the eye on to the Firth of
Forth in the middle distance and, beyond, to the faint outlines of Fife. To
the east are the gnarled and windblown trees of Archerfield wood and, in the
distance, like a gigantic upturned thimble, is the volcanic mound of North
Berwick Law.
Archerfield was the setting of The Pavilion on the Links, by Robert Louis
Stevenson, who wrote: 'on summer days the outlook was bright and even
gladsome; but at sundown in September, with a high wind and a heavy surf
rolling close along the links, the place told of nothing but dead mariners
and sea disaster.'
To the west towards Edinburgh is Gullane Bay and to the south rolling away
endlessly are the rich farmlands of East Lothian. 'Muirfield,' says Ben
Crenshaw, an American golfer with a keen interest golf's history 'has no
trees, water hazards or dramatic elevation changes. It is hardly picture
postcard material. Still, it is probably the most straightforward, honest
golf course in the world.'
In July 1966, when the club was staging its tenth Open, the most honest golf
course in the world presented a terrifying sight. The late Gerald Micklem,
then chairman of the championship committee of the Royal &amp; Ancient golf
club, ordered the rough to be grown in some places to waist height and the
fairways to be narrowed to as little as 20 yards. This was the most
ferocious rough ever at an Open. Jack Nicklaus said it looked 'like a wide
expanse of wheat whipping in the wind'. Doug Sanders was reluctant to leave
the clubhouse until he was reassured 'there ain't no Apaches out there.'
There will be no Apaches this week, though I dare say a few who attend the
121st Open will complain of being scalped. Bernard Darwin once wrote,
apropos Muirfield, of 'curlews hovering over a championship crowd and crying
eerily amid a religious silence.' There will not be much silence this week.
From Greywalls, the Lutyens designed hotel over the wall from the course, to
the back tee of the sixth hole, the northernmost point of the course,
Muirfield will echo to the sounds of a modern Open, the seventh here since
the war.
It has a history of producing the greatest champions - Player, Nicklaus,
Trevino were among the predecessors of Watson and Faldo. One hopes the
sequence continues and that in eight days' time a truly worthy champion
holds up the famous trophy and basks in the acclaim of the crowd. Muirfield
deserves no less.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Friend of the humblest angler: Fishing - The writings of
Hugh Tempest Sheringham occupy a special place in Tom Fort's library
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE over a quarter of a century ago my eyes were first opened to the
possibility that there might be more to fishing than catching or, commonly
in my own distressing case, failing to catch fish. One of my elder brothers
and I, browsing in a secondhand bookshop in Reading, came upon a case of
books on angling. We were passionate fishermen, but of a severely non
spiritual kind.
Among the books we bought was one bound in faded red cloth. Its spine was
decorated with two crossed fishing rods, between which were a net and a fat
basket with lid raised to display something resembling a chub or carp. It
cost two-and-sixpence, and was called An Open Creel. The author's name was
HT Sheringham.
I read it straight through, with a swiftly swelling sense of wonder and
delight. Even now, I can recall the condition of hilarity to which I was
reduced by the chapter entitled A Day of Tribulation, in which Sheringham
describes a succession of calamities which overtook him during a day's wet
fly fishing, presumably on the Exe.
I was, at that time, making my own first, cack-handed attempts to educate
myself in the use of a fly rod. It was a great solace to find the despair
which overwhelmed me as I sought to deliver my flies in the teeth of gales
mirrored in this light-footed but deeply felt prose. Just as I had railed
against Providence, so Sheringham - having left his cast in a bush over deep
water - sat down to contrast his misfortunes with those of Job. A little
while later came the loss of the big fish on which his heart was set,
leaving me to my thoughts of Job and his exaggerated griefs.
Having devoured An Open Creel, my brothers and I (for a third also became a
devotee) rushed back to the shop in Reading, and snapped up Elements of
Angling (first published in 1908) and Coarse Fishing (1912). These led to
Trout Fishing: Memories and Morals and to An Angler's Hours. These books
were the foundation of a collection which now amounts to almost 600.
I cherish them all, even the ones I have never got round to reading. And
there are writers to whom I return again and again: JW Hills, Zane Grey,
Roderick Haig-Brown, BB, GD Luard, Frank Barker, FA Mitchell-Hedges, Richard
Walker, Chris Yates, Negley Arthur Ransome, Harry Plunket Greene. All I
regard as friends, and all I admire for the way they brought the sport to
life. Yet I have never changed the opinion I must have formed in those early
days: that Hugh Tempest Sheringham was the finest of them all.
He was brought up in Tewkesbury, where his father was vicar. The flavour of
his childhood, and the dawning of the passion for rivers, are exquisitely
captured in the opening chapter of An Open Creel, Waters Of Youth. The
affection for the chub - whether caught on worm or cheese or, best of all,
fly - was born on the Severn and Avon and their tributaries, and was never
to leave him. While his grandfather, the stern archdeacon, endeavoured to
bend him to the discipline of Latin verse, the boy's imagination ran on
water meadows, the play of sunlight on moving water, the tantalising
mysteries of the depths beneath the hanging branches of willows.
In 1903 Sheringham - who had been a classical scholar at Cambridge - became
angling editor of the Field; a job he held until his early death 27 years
later. Had he gone into the Church, or to the British Museum - which was his
ambition - he might well have joined the great throng of us whose immortal
masterpieces remain locked in our heads.
He produced a mass of writing which made him among the most cherished and
respected authorities on fishing of his day. When he died he was mourned by
the good and the great, and the not so great. As his friend, John Moore,
wrote: It was chiefly the humbler angler that he loved, and by whom he was
loved in return.
For Sheringham was a curiosity, a socialist fisherman. Although he relished
his days on the Itchen, Test and Kennet, he always fished them as a guest.
The sort of club he cared to belong to was the one he celebrated in A
Suburban Fishery, in An Angler's Hours, where a man might stalk a trout or
two, then cast a fly for chub, and finish his day watching his float circle
a shaded eddy in the hope that the perch or roach might bite.
It was in his passion for coarse fishing that Sheringham's democratic
instincts are most apparent. Yet his enthusiasm was almost heretical. The
gods of the age - such as Halford - did not demean themselves by considering
the ways of chub. Only the salmon in his Scottish torrent, and the noble
trout of the chalkstream, were considered worthy of a gentleman's time and
study. Sheringham's partiality for floats and spinners, worms and cheese, an
18 foot rod and a Nottingham-style centrepin reel, made him an object of
curiosity and ridicule among his friends.
Sheringham loved rivers like the lower Kennet, the Colne and the Evenlode,
where democracy reigned and the fish which rose to his fly was as likely to
be a chub or a dace as a trout. As for salmon, he caught his share, mainly
from the Welsh Dee and the Coquet in Northumberland. But he maintained an
air of lofty indifference to the celebrated, exclusive rivers of Scotland,
and appeared to believe that those who fished them, and nowhere else, were
not truly to be counted of the brotherhood.
As a writer, Sheringham's voice came as a fresh breeze, dispersing tired old
conventions. His manner is wise and humorous, his style delicious in its
elegance and wit. But the best of him is that he speaks of fishing as other
fishermen find it, of rare triumphs and frequent reverses. He subscribes
wholeheartedly to the axiom that it is better to catch fish than not to do
so - but knows well eno ugh that, for ordinary folk, success in fishing as
in other matters can never easily be won.
An Angler For All Seasons, a Sheringham anthology, introduced by Tom Fort,
is published on July 23 by Merlin Unwin, Pounds 16.95.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Gardening: Close encounters with top-class growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTEMPLATING the features of my colleague, Robin Lane Fox, swollen with
rage after his rail journey, I was glad of my decision to parachute into
Hampton Court Flower Show. Europe's largest flower show is a daunting
prospect, even if it is laid out much more spaciously than Chelsea.
The non-gardener might conceivably have a better time at Chelsea's eclectic
rival. There is a vast craft village populated with people selling such
mysterious items as Sugan kitchen chairs made to an ancient Celtic design,
and Karom boards. Husband and wife teams sell personalised copies of their
novels and pressed steel sculptures of 'mystic warriors'.
If, however, it is plants and nurserymen you want to see, there are eight
floral marquees crammed with vendors, eager to sell - and talk. Maybe the
exhibitors in May were just too hot this year to relish a grilling, but this
year, for once, I left Chelsea feeling rather starved of the kind of close
contact with top-class growers which makes the show more than just a
spectacle.
Under Royal Horticultural Society rules, Chelsea exhibitors must wear
jackets and ties. At Hampton Court, anything goes. As the well-dressed David
Pickard, of Meadowcroft Fuschias in Cambridgeshire said: 'Chelsea is the
gentleman's event.' I celebrated the freedom to buy on-the-spot with two of
Pickard's ivy-leaved geraniums, the variegated-leaf L'Elegant and
Barbe-Bleu, a fabulous dark cherry-red which should be more widely-grown
(ring 0487-823333) .
In the marquee given over to the National Council for the Conservation of
Plants and Gardens, I had my first deep discussion at the Norfolk Lavender
stand (0485-70384). Munstead and Hidcote are the lavenders everyone knows,
and every one sells. But are they really the right foil for old roses, or is
the purple just too eye-catching?
Now I think I have the answer in Sawyers, new last year when it was
introduced by Norfolk Lavender. The flowers are spear-shaped and a paler
shade of blue, without being dull. Sawyers grows to 27in, has a long
flowering season and it is as hardy as any lavender can be. Its leaf is a
good grey and bare-rooted stock costs Pounds 2.20.
Anyone who has wasted money on foxtail lilies, eremurus, will appreciate my
envy at Rupert Bowlby's prize-winning stand (0737-642221). How is one to
achieve, year after year, those gorgeous June-flowering spikes in shades of
yellow, orange, and apricot?
Best to play safe, was the advice, and look not at the hybrids but at the
earlier flowering E. himalaicus, which is white, and robustus, pink and
flowering in June. Apparently, they are one of the lesser-known delights of
travelling from Samarkand to the Himalayas and as that would imply, they are
happy to be baked in summer and frozen all winter. They even relish heavy
clay.
With a large budget, one might be tempted by Bowlby's new introduction,
Allium 'Beau Regarde'. It is probably a cross between christophii and
giganteum, and it looks almost alarming hefty, with heads a full 6in across.
The price is equally hefty, Pounds 18 a bulb. Wait a few years, and this
bloated onion should eventually be ours for just a few pounds.
Still thinking about expensive but troublesome bulbs, I had bearded two
helpful Dutchmen from the combined Warmenhoven and de Groot stand (20,
Purbrock Avenue, Watford, WD2 6AD). Amaryllis (hippeastrums, properly) and
crown imperials are not foolproof, but they are exquisite, especially the
former which are appearing in ever more delicious shades.
With hippeastrums, the answer is to choose a pot size only 20 per cent
larger than the bulb, and to plant them half under the soil, immediately
they arrive in September or October - no later. Then give them a frequent
meal of Phostrogen and expect, in almost every case, two stems with six
flowers. Could I economise and hope to enjoy the same display another year?
Possibly, is the answer, but only at the price of remembering to feed weekly
for seven months. Life is perhaps too short.
As for that other show-stopper, Crown Imperial, their short lives are nine
times out of ten, due to the ravages of slugs. Rats, they always say, are
put off by the foxy smell but slugs like nothing better.
My helpful Dutchman told me that the answer was plenty of sand around the
bulb to deter the beasts, although the soil must be good and rich.
So does Hampton Court or any flower show justify its entry fee? Ask
shrewdly, and, in my opinion, it should.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Pedalling to the barricades: Nicholas Woodsworth got on his
bike to search for French truckers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE an ancient black Post Office bike with rattling mud guards and a
front wheel that wobbles just slightly out of true - just the thing it was
suggested, to get me from one French truckers' roadblock to another.
'Take a beret and string of onions,' they told me; 'Best way to fit in with
the locals. Off you go.' So off I went.
Up early, an energetic pedal through West End traffic, and a frantic search
at Charing Cross for the brake van on the 7:55 to Dover Priory. An even more
frantic changing of brake vans at Ashford where the train splits in two. A
rattling whizz down the hill under the battlements of Dover Castle, a quick
bowl along under the white cliffs, and a charge across the acres of open
tarmac at the P &amp; O ferry dock. By the time the 'Pride of Calais' pulled
away from the quay at 10:30 I was watching Tweetie Bird outwit Sylvester in
the B Deck cinema and my bicycle was safely in the hold.
There is always a difference between a distant overview of a crisis and
being in the thick of it. Close up, most things are invariably confused.
The woman in the tourist office Portakabin near the unloading ramp was
pleasant and over-excited. This was her Sarajevo - she believed the truckers
were trying to starve out Calais. Together we pored over a complimentary
ink-stained photocopy of the area. Cars could get through, but Calais was
surrounded and no goods could get in or out by road, she told me.
'Les blockages sont la, la, la et la', she said decisively, making heavy X
marks with her pen on what I took to be auto-routes and interchanges. The
map was so tiny and smudged I could not be sure.
Despite all the Xs, it took me hours to find a road-block. Dressed in a
leather jacket and puffing under a warm sun I toiled along the roads,
through public housing estates on the edge of town and out towards the
highways and autoroute ramps. I cycled a mile up the Boulogne road, got
side-tracked on the road to Saint-Omer and lost myself on flyovers.
Not even the beefy pastis-drinkers in the Petit Prince, a routier's cafe on
the Dunkirk road knew where the roadblocks were. 'But we are strong; we
shall never be crushed,' they affirmed through the smokey blue air, and
ordered another round.
Finally, some distance from town I ran across a large roadblock. Scores of
trucks lay slewed across exits on an interchange, large knots of men stood
gesticulating beside them. But the gesticulation turned out to be truckers
waving cars through. Polite French lorry drivers were giving road directions
to smiling holiday motorists. Where were fraying tempers, the angry mobs?
Where were the tanks?
'We do not want tanks,' Olivier Ledoux told me, 'we do not want trouble at
all.'
Olivier, a gentle-looking soul, had long red hair and a Guns 'n Roses
T-shirt. The 60-foot semi-articulated lorry which he drives sat across the
road, but the militant image was spoiled by his girlfriend. She had ridden
out of Calais to keep him company and, sitting on her Mobylette seat, leant
Lolita-like against the side of the cab insouciantly popping bubbles with
her chewing gum.
Between bubbles she eyed me and my bicycle with a doubtful frown, an
are-you-really-a-journalist look that I was fast getting used to. Forget
berets and strings of onions; nobody, but nobody, in Calais rides a bike
like mine. Anyone who cycles around here is nattily turned out like a
Tour-de-France champion.
From that point in the afternoon onwards my burning-tyres and
flying-brickbats story, like my power to pedal, slowly grew weaker and
weaker. Olivier and I sat around talking about music and listening to his CB
radio. Nothing was happening.
When a CB report came through that a lone, frustrated Belgian driver was
blocking a street in the centre of Calais I pedalled off into town at top
speed. Half an hour later I arrived red-faced and dripping to find the
incident over. At the city police commissariat I asked for a briefing, and
was told Divisional Inspector Verdin was out at the Victor Hugo roadblock. I
raced back there to find him gone.
Olivier told me there were four British lorries and drivers stranded some
way up the A-26. Off I pedaled again. Was this my story at last? After
listening for 15 minutes to Arthur from Huddersfield debating with Reg from
Cowley whether the bloody Frogs were in bloody NATO or not, I decided it
probably was not.
Back I raced into town to meet Henri Ravisse, president of the Chamber of
Commerce. Perhaps there was an economic angle that was escaping me. M.
Ravisse was out. And so the day went - the last time I wobbled out to the
roadblock I was feeling distinctly cheesed off with the miracle of bicycle
communication.
What made it worse was that I kept on passing all those roadside things that
make France such a wonderful summertime place - seafood restaurants
displaying mouthwatering menus, delightful patisserie windows, sunny
sidewalk cafes full of smiling girls. I longed for a flat tire.
By 6.30pm it was all over - the unions had called off the roadblock around
Calais and across the country the protest was winding down. Olivier was
upset. Once again, he said, the worker's bosses been bought off by the
state. But he was not half as upset as I.
Against a stiff wind I pedalled like crazy to catch the ferry and the last
train back to London. I hadn't even the time to pick up a beret.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Property: The sabres rattle in a quiet country corner -
David Hoppit on the dispute over the future of Pounds 4.5m Heveningham Hall,
the 'grandest Georgian mansion in Suffolk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE that had been brewing for more than a decade in a tranquil corner
of East Anglia flared this week as one of England's finest houses became the
focus of a game of real-life monopoly.
The casus beli is Heveningham Hall, half way between Ipswich and Norwich,
described by the architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner as 'the grandest
Georgian mansion in Suffolk'. It is owned through default by the United Bank
of Kuwait.
Rattling the sabres are local conservation groups and the Suffolk
Preservation Trust, encouraged last week by a parliamentary question from
Tam Dalyell (Lab. Linlithgow).
The story of Heveningham Hall has become common in recent years: a losing
struggle to maintain a family home. The mansion, built in 1777, finally
passed to the stewardship of the nation in lieu of death duties in 1970.
For 11 years the estate was administered by the National Trust. In 1981, it
was sold for Pounds 726,000 to an investment trust headed by an Iraqi
businessman, Abdul Amir al-Ghazzi. Al-Ghazzi, untutored in public relations,
did not endear himself to the locals. The house was boarded up and the
formal gardens, by Capability Brown, ran wild.
Rumours of neglect and pilfering spread; a fire in 1984 added to local anger
at what was perceived as a case of heritage vandalism; however, those privy
to the 'goings on' behind the shutters maintain that a large programme of
restoration was in progress. The work gobbled money - up to Pounds 5m; some
believe the debt contributed to al-Ghazzi's death in March last year. The
bank then called in the Pounds 3m loan and took over the hall.
Now the Grade I mansion is being offered for sale by Savills with Knight
Frank and Rutley; the price suggested is Pounds 4.5m.
Geoffrey van Cutsem, of Savills, took representatives of the National Trust
and the National Heritage Memorial Fund around the mansion.
'They probably can't afford to buy it but all were very impressed by the
condition of the main rooms,' he said. 'This is a huge house, nearly 100
yards long; yet when al Ghazzi bought it there were only two bathrooms.
Architectural purists may not like the en suite bathrooms he has built in
each of the main bedrooms, but the rooms on the piano nobile have been
restored with immaculate taste.
'It is true there was a fire and, yes, thieves did smash their way in to
steal lead and a priceless fireplace; but that was not the fault of
al-Ghazzi. Had he invited the local people in to see the work in progress a
lot of the rumours and bad feeling would have been avoided.'
Heveningham Hall was commissioned in 1777 by Sir Gerard Vanneck, a merchant
banker of Dutch descent; the family had political ambition and the estate
was close to the 'rotten' (or pocket) borough of Dunwich.
By the time the house was built Sir Gerard had become the member for
Dunwich. Sir Robert Taylor, tutor of John Nash, was commissioned to design
the house, keeping the shell of the original Queen Anne house. When the
exterior was completed, in about 1780, there was a change of architects, the
young James Wyatt took over to complete the interior; it has been described
as Wyatt's finest work.
The tunnel-vaulted entrance hall is one of the finest Georgian rooms in the
UK. Some further work is needed to complete the restoration; van Cutsem
estimates that this will cost about Pounds 250,000.
'When you consider that this is only about 5 per cent of the value of the
property it is not a great deal; most house buyers expect to spend something
before they move in,' he said.
The hall, its outbuildings and the now tidy gardens are to be opened to the
public during July, except on Mondays. Those concerned about its
preservation will be able to see the fruits of the late Iraqi's labours.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Property: A Name who is trading down - Michael Hanson visits
a Lloyd's member who is selling his nine-bedroom mansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON

<TEXT>
JOHN REW had just returned from Venice, where he and three other members of
London Rowing Club took part in the Vogalonga - the three-hour 'long row'
around the lagoon by 1,500 gondolas and boats. He sat in his elegant drawing
room at Thornhill Park, Dorset and recounted how he has been sticking his
oar into Lloyd's since 1980.
As publisher of Chatset's annual Lloyd's League Tables, he has been
forecasting the present calamity at the insurance giant for some time. Three
years ago, he prophesied that 'storm cones should be hoisted' over London's
Leadenhall Street, and in his annual review this January he wrote: 'We are
now looking across an abyss of dramatic proportions.'
A year ago, Lloyd's declared a net loss of Pounds 510m for 1988, made up of
a Pounds 1bn loss by one-third of the syndicates and a Pounds 500m profit by
the rest. Rew and his joint editor, Charles Sturge, predict that by the time
the results for 1991 are known in 1994, Lloyd's will have lost Pounds 3.9bn.
Rew further predicts that as many as 6,000 Names at Lloyd's - a third of the
members - could be wiped out this year. In many cases, most of their assets
are represented by their houses, which will be difficult to realise quickly.
Having said all this, Rew denies that the sale of his own house is necessary
to meet his own losses: 'Certainly, I've got losses, but I'm not selling the
house to pay those. I'm on 35 syndicates, and I do have some sizeable
losses, but luckily I changed from giving bank guarantees to depositing
securities with Lloyd's, which can be sold.'
He bought Thornhill Park, at Stalbridge, near Sturminster Newton in Dorset,
shortly after the youngest of his five children was born in 1970. Now that
the oldest children have left home and the youngest is about to read law in
London, the nine-bedroom house is too large for him and his wife. 'We have
been thinking of selling the house for a couple of years,' he says. 'The
trouble is finding something to replace it. I would be happy with a
boathouse on a river somewhere, but I think we need something larger than
that.'
Rew comes from a long line of oarsmen: his grandfather rowed at Henley in
1860, his father rowed in the 1924 Olympics and his uncle rowed in the 1928
Olympics. He took up rowing again in 1987, after a break of 25 years, to
encourage his three sons to row.
Thornhill Park was used as a setting for the film Far from the Madding
Crowd. It stands on a knoll with panoramic views over the Blackmore Vale to
the Dorset Downs. It was the home of Sir James Thornhill (1675-1734), the
artist who decorated the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, the Painted Hall at
Greenwich Hospital and many of the saloons and staircases in the great
mansions of his day. By 1725, he had made enough money to buy back the
Dorset family estate that his father's extravagance had frittered away
before he was born. Here he built the present house, which though less grand
than some of the other country houses he designed, such as Moor Park,
Hertfordshire (now a golf clubhouse), is still a fine Palladian building,
listed Grade II* for its architectural and historic interest. He also
designed the obelisk in the park to mark the accession of George II in 1727
(and not, as the agents suggest, that monarch's marriage to Queen Caroline,
which took place in 1705, when they were still living in Hanover).
Over the past 20 years, the Rews have restored most of the house to its
original glory, especially the magnificent saloon on the first floor that
Thornhill used as his studio and gallery, but parts of the house are still
unrestored. It is for sale with 185 acres, including an entrance lodge and a
cottage, garages, stables, a squash court and a swimming pool. Offers over
Pounds 1m are being sought by the London and Sherborne offices of Knight
Frank and Rutley (071-629-8171 or 0935-812236) acting jointly with Symonds
and Sampson of Dorchester (0305-264172).

ANYONE trundling around England, either on holiday or on their way to and
from the traditional summer events being held around the country, might like
to invest in Carol Fisher's new book, The Touring Guide to Antique Shops in
England*.
She lists most of the best antique shops - from country ones in little
villages in Derbyshire or East Anglia, to the tourist routes of the
Cotswolds and the west country.
For obvious reasons she does not attempt to cover London, concentrating on
countrified areas which are less well documented and where more guidance is
needed. She gives maps and details of 12 different touring routes listing
all the shops in the historic towns, cities and village on the way.
I could have done with fuller, more opinionated entries on each individual
shop. For instance, I long to know exactly what sort of furniture, country
or formal, 18th century or 19th century, and precisely what sort of ceramics
are on sale, but she contents herself with simple lists. Nonetheless it is a
very handy guide which I propose to keep in the car's glove compartment.
*Pounds 7.99 from Harrods, the British Tourist Authority shop in Lower
Regent Street, London SW1 or direct, by mail (Pounds 1 extra to cover
postage and packing) from Carol Fisher at 162a Balham High road, London SW12
9BW.
Still on the theme of antiques, if you are heading into Essex or East Anglia
in search of country furniture, you might like to stop in at Hay Green
Antiques at Hay Green Farmhouse, Hay Green Lane, Blackmore, Ingatestone,
Essex CM4 OQE. (Tel: 0277-821275).
There Valerie and Tony Harding run an antique and reproduction pine
furniture business from the barns adjoining their Georgian farmhouse. Much
of the furniture comes from abroad and quite a lot of it is fairly ornate -
antique pine tables from Denmark (about Pounds 400 for a table 3 ft by 4
ft), carved wooden sofa frames (a Victorian chaise longue in stock is for
sale at about Pounds 850), armoires and corner cupboards, bureaux and
side-tables.
A good glazed dresser, with a cupboard base and a glazed top and some pretty
carving, would be about Pounds 595. Besides the real antiques, all of which
are restored on the premises, there is a selection of reproduction pine
furniture - made to look as if it had been around for years.
The shop-cum-home is open every day of the week except Mondays from 10 am to
5 pm.

FT  11 JUL 92 / How to Spend It: A staid fashion house with a real buzz -
Lucia van der Post discovers some of the secrets of Celine, a chic Paris
fashion business. She also goes in search of objets d'art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST

<TEXT>
THE PARIS fashion house of Celine is one of those opaque French institutions
that seems, mysteriously, to flourish although from the outside it is hard
to fathom how and why. Celine has always had about it an air of satisfied,
bourgeois comfort - respectable, but exciting? Hardly.
It is not only in Paris that Celine has flourished. The London franchise,
owned by Michael and Lawrence Feldman since 1967, has been just as
successful. Quietly, without fuss, it has grown into a good, profitable
business, even managing in these dire times to increase profits, doing 10
per cent more business in 1991 than in 1990 and another 20 per cent more in
1992 than the year before.
'We don't mind the fact that our name isn't on everybody's lips,' says
Michael Feldman, 'it gives us a certain low-key appeal.'
If it has appeal it has to be low-key, for its clothes are not much featured
in the fashion press, its Paris shows do not set the headline-writers' pens
a-quiver. Who then buys Celine and what is its secret? It is hard to tell.
But in the UK several members of the royal family are known to troop through
the door - Princess Alexandra, the Duchess of Kent, Princess Michael of Kent
as well as the Thai royal family, rich Indonesians, richer Japanese. In
Paris, besides Madame Pompidou and the well-heeled matrons of the 176th
arrondissement, actress Catherine Deneuve, Princess Ira Furstenberg, model
and actress Margaux Hemingway, television presenters and young actresses
saunter in to the chic little premises off the Avenue Montaigne.
Its secret is summed up by one of its fans: 'It's Chanel-style at half the
price.' Whereas a Chanel suit cannot be had for much under Pounds 1,200, the
newest Celine boutique on Sloane Street is filled with flirty, desirable
little numbers, with lots of zip and class at prices that start at Pounds
500. As Celine is known to use the same sub-contractors as Chanel, the value
for money is clear.
All those career women wanting a fresh, fashionable and classy little suit
to take them through the day which they can then dress up with jewellery at
night, will find lots to choose from.
Anyone wanting a handbag will find a beautifully made, fine leather number
with a pedigree look at about half the price that one of the more
high-profile names would charge.
Celine seems to be a very clever business - somehow its founders managed to
attach to the ready-to-wear label the sort of cachet and status that puts it
right up there with the haute couture houses.
It was bought from its founders, Celine and Richard Vipiana, three years ago
by Bernard Arnault, head of the French group Financiere Agache, who decided
that the thoroughly respectable Celine was just what he needed to round out
his luxury brands group. A safe, 'very clean name,' to use the words of Nan
Legeai, Celine's chairman and chief executive, the label had never been
debased.
Arnault's next move was to put Nan Legeai, an American whom he had met when
she working at Dior, in charge of Celine to ginger it up. 'Turn it into the
hottest thing in town,' he told her, 'and triple the profits in three
years.'
Three years on, taking in a world recession, the Gulf war and tough
competition, Celine may be not the hottest name in town but it is definitely
higher profile. Younger women are trooping through the door and profits have
been tripled.
Legeai says she had no doubts that Celine could be turned into a top class
international fashion name, even without the traditional engine for such
status, a haute couture range.
She is sure that there is a role for high-class ready-to-wear and that is
where Celine has carved a niche. Its style is haute couture - formal and
dressy without the relaxed insouciance of Armani or Max Mara. It is more
anonymous, more Continental than Donna Karan or Ralph Lauren. It could
happily go to Longchamps or Ascot, to cocktails or weddings. Yet its prices
are ready-to-wear.
'Modern men and women,' she believes, 'want simple, modern, well-cut,
well-tailored clothes in beautiful fabrics, excellently priced. They are
more confident in their own style and do not need to pay the Pounds 5,000
and more that a haute couture number would cost.'
Much of the cleverness has been the pricing strategy. Nearly all the couture
houses have three different lines: couture, which it is reckoned only some
3,000 women in the world can afford; boutique, very expensive exclusive
ready-to-wear; and a lower-priced diffusion line. Celine has just one
collection, priced between the couturiers' boutique and diffusion lines.
It is able to deliver this kind of quality at that kind of price because
there are no star designers on mega-buck salaries and all margins are
closely controlled.
Legeai's first task was to make sure that everything Celine shops sold
originated in Celine design studios.
'I wanted all Celine customers everywhere to be able to buy every Celine
line. Every shop throughout the world offers the same range from the same
two collections a year.'
A major task, of course, was rejuvenating the name, bringing in new, younger
customers without alienating the existing ones. This she has done and part
of the purpose in opening the new store in Sloane Street this week is to
enable the British customer for the first time to buy the new, fresher,
zappier lines.
It is a tough time to be opening a new shop in London (Michael Feldman
likens it to 'buying a deck-chair on the Titanic') but they are both
confident.
'Yes, sure, times are tough but the more competition one has, the more
difficult things are, the better one must become. Our designers have really
to think about how to do things better and less expensively. A lot of very
important things start during recessions. Next year we will add new products
 -watches, sunglasses and a fragrance.'
Hot gossip in Paris has it that Nan Legeai is likely to be given the task of
jazzing up Christian Dior but she dodges any questions on those lines very
artfully.
What might her future plans include? 'Well,' she says, 'I think Celine has
come a long way in three years but we have a lot further to go. We are
strong in Europe, very strong in Asia but we are only just starting in
America. I want to turn Celine into one of the most profitable fashion
houses in the world.
'I have just done a plan for the next three years and even looking ahead
conservatively I predict that we will grow between 15 per cent and 20 per
cent per year. Fashion is there to make people look good and feel good -
that's what Celine is all about.'

THE story began in 1985 when Michel and Elizabeth Rostaing were married.
Everything about the wedding was very English. Everything, that is, except
the champagne which Michel brought over from Oger in France.
It went down a treat. His guests (now clients) thought it excellent and, six
years on, he is still supplying friends and customers with this white grape
nectar from Champagne, called Jean Milan, Grand Cru, Brut Special (Pounds
12).
From there, it snowballed. The French consulate was enthusiastic and helped
to make the project easy; so much so that Elizabeth hit on the idea of
introducing her English friends to French duck foie gras.
In the heart of foie gras country, the Landes, in southern France, she knew
a man called Andignac who raised duck for the region's famous product. She
bought his foie gras and began selling it in England. Now, she too, has a
faithful following. I bought a loaf of her pure fresh foie gras (250g -
Pounds 12) which came vacuum-packed and kept for several weeks in the
fridge. It was the perfect answer when I was called on by my husband to
entertain important clients. How to impress them? Easy. A bottle of Sauterne
was put on ice. I served each guest with a slice of foie gras nestling in a
bed of endive and mushrooms dressed lightly with a walnut oil vinaigrette.
My husband is still basking in the afterglow of the success.
Another of her specialities is confit de canard, the essential ingredient
for an authentic French cassoulet, for which you need:
1 kg of haricot beans;  1/2 kg of brisket of lamb; 6 pork sausages (sliced);
150g of smoked bacon; 1 kg of confit and its fat; 4 onions; 4 tomatoes; 4
garlic cloves;  1/2 bottle of wine; bouquet garni; cloves; salt and pepper.
Soak the haricot beans and cook them in a saucepan of water with a
clove-studded onion, bacon, salt and peppper and wine for 90 minutes.
While the beans are cooking, open the jar of confit, keep the duck aside and
stir-fry the garlic, tomatoes, the rest of the onions, lamb and sausages in
the duck fat. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Strain the beans, reserving the stock and add them to the meat, along with
enough stock to cover the lot, and cook slowly for half an hour. Add the
confit to the cassoulet and continue cooking for 30 minutes.
Another delicious treat worth trying, too, is the foie gras entier (Pounds
14.80 for 180g) I found it very rich and smooth with a good, strong flavour.
It was served best with chunks of coarse country bread (try Sainsbury's pain
de campagne - 79p) and a salad of tomatoes and black olives.
Prices for confit de canard start at Pounds 5.50 for 750g, and there is also
a selection of terrines at Pounds 2.50 for 180g - the terrine de canard au
poivre vert is possibly the tastiest.
It is worth noting that Rostaing sells goose fat (Pounds 3.10 for 800g).
Forget butter. Any French chef worth his onions cooks with goose fat. (The
chef at Hilaire in London SW7 is famed for his salad Nicoise featuring fresh
tuna cooked in goose fat).
Rostaing's products were reasonably priced and she will deliver to Londoners
and has an efficient postage and packing service for those outside the
capital. For an order form ring 081-788-6908.
Rostaing's foie gras and duck products are all cooked. If you want to really
lash out then you can buy raw foie gras. Very few shops stock it but you can
buy the whole liver, vacuum packed from Boucherie Lamartine, at 229 Ebury
Street, London SW1. Tel: 071-730-4175. It will cost you about Pounds 41 for
a 2lb liver.
The best culinary treat to my mind is hot foie gras and for that you need
1lb of foie gras cru (raw) sliced into eight. Season it and marinate it in a
wineglassful of Armagnac. Then fry each slice in your hot goose fat. Serve
it on fried bread, decorate with a few snips of chives, and tip the juices
from the pan over each portion. It is food for the gods.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Food: An authentic taste of Cantonese food - Hong Kong
Street Food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN HOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG remains one of the most exciting and dynamic cities in the world,
as well as the home of world class Chinese cuisine. It manages to maintain
the great traditions, blending old and new, east and west.
However, if you are nostalgic for the authentic taste of good Cantonese
food, as it was before Hong Kong became an international economic power,
then you want to visit what the Cantonese call dai pai dong - which
literally means big sign street food stalls.
These are the old-fashioned food stalls that proffer treats from snacks to
full meals, to a hungry but very busy clientele. Hong Kong's street food
vendors sell their specialities out of stainless steel stalls, usually set
on wheels.
Most of them use a propane gas or charcoal burning stove, so that food is
always piping hot. I have enjoyed savoury pork dishes stir-fried with fresh
seasonal vegetables; I have vivid memories of succulent fresh prawns, slices
of fresh fish; soft, freshly-made rice noodles, soothing congees, even
crispy roast duck.
However, if you want to see these dai pai dongs, you had better hurry. In
the past, they dotted the landscape of Hong Kong and Kowloon. They were part
of the street ambience with their fragrant aromas wafting through the narrow
streets and alleys. Today the food vendors are being moved from the street
and settled indoors. They are increasingly congregated together in concrete,
sterile market complexes, losing much of their charm. Why is this happening?
Masses of people crowded together, exorbitant real estate prices, commodity
distribution imperatives, economics of scale, the need for efficient use of
space, the obliteration of local and neighbourhood facilities are just some
of the reasons.
In Hong Kong, space is at such a premium that it must be strictly rationed
in order to be fully utilised. Street food stalls are inevitably being
congregated, ordered and rationalised to obtain maximum efficiency of both
productivity and land use.
There are other reasons for this reorganisation. One of them concerns health
and food hygiene. In spite of the fact that food served up in these street
stalls is always fresh and hot, the ability of the authorities to supervise
the thousands of such outlets is sorely tested, the fear of unhealthy
conditions in Hong Kong's subtropical climate is always present.
Congregating the food stalls will improve both official supervision and
hygiene. This has never been a major concern for me as the food served was
always cooked in a very hot wok and I felt that anything which would survive
the heat of the wok probably deserves to live anyway.
As Hong Kong hurtles toward its union with the mainland, the atmosphere of
change is increasingly charged with hope and anxiety. It is my impression
that the continued popularity of the dai pai dong is related to needs
generated by these emotions.
People seek to anchor their lives in those traditional forms and experiences
that, at least in retrospect, have served them well in the past. Hong Kong
and Kowloon were known the world over for their sidewalk restaurants each
with a few chairs and tables, each purveying its own specialties.
The constant hustle and bustle around them, from early morning until very
late in the balmy evenings, imparted a vitality to street life and are
missed by many in Hong Kong. Rampant nostalgia plays a part in all this but
economics and sociology are primary. Masses of Hong Kong people are
relatively better off than they were 20 years ago. They have disposable
income and are taking more time to savour the fruits of their labour.
They eat out more often and in general have more leisure time. Thus, they
can take time to eat in proper restaurants, rather than on the local street
corner. Alas, it is part of modernisation and I am afraid it may go the way
of Singapore.
Some of Hong Kong's most successful restaurateurs began their careers as
street food hawkers. There is no better proving ground for one's
inventiveness, market awareness and appreciation of what makes the customers
coming back.
However, I still make the rounds to my favourite dai pai dongs. These
include those in the neighbourhood of Mongkok in Kowloon; on Soy Street,
appropriately enough, in Wanchai around the market; near Kai Tak Airport and
in Yaumatei. Explore the area at the back of the Peninsula Hotel and the
Star Ferry Terminal, places familiar to every tourist, and near the central
market off Graham Street on Hong Kong island.
Les Halles in Paris, Covent Garden in London, the pushcarts of Hester Street
are all gone, rationalised out of existence. The street food stalls of Hong
Kong and Kowloon are following them. However, I believe that regardless of
what happens when the colony is reunited with China, and in spite of the
rationalisation now taking place, one will still be able to experience the
joys of Hong Kong street foods in some way.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Wine: The 1991 clarets on offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TO SELL or not to sell: that has been the problem of many Bordeaux chateaux
with their 1991 clarets.
The problem arises because of three factors. First, April frost savagely cut
production of most, but not all, chateaux. Second, heavy, diluting rainfall
fell just before the vintage. And, third, there is plenty of wine from
previous vintages still on the market. En primeur demand for the 1991s is at
the very least problematical.
The damage in the vineyards was so bad that JP Moueix, the leading Libourne
company, refused either to introduce its own wines or buy from any of its
normal suppliers in St Emilion and Pomerol.
To ensure at least some sale, the very low level of the 1987 en primeur
prices was canvassed for them in the Bordeaux trade, but as the successful
1991s are certainly better, this was too much of a cut for the
first-growths, assured of a certain sale, and some of the leading seconds.
The former generally raised their 1987 opening price of FFr 130 a bottle to
FFr 160, and the others have not come out, but Pichon-Lalande and Montrose
have. I tasted both at the Union des Grands Crus tasting in April, and they
seemed excellent wines; and my favourites among the firsts were Ch Margaux
and Latour.
Wine merchants in the UK have had similar doubts to many of the chateaux
owners as to the saleability of the vintage; and a number have made no
opening offer.
Others have, and a table of their comparative prices is given here. As fewer
firms than usual have come out, and the lists are very selective, prices
have been included where there are only one or two quotations.
All prices are per dozen ex-cellars Bordeaux with shipping, duty (now Pounds
11.34 a dozen) and VAT (currently 17 1/2 per cent) and delivery to be added.
Hungerford repeats its usual claim to match any ex-chateau price lower than
its own, subject to stock availability; and Bibendum will quote on any other
chateau not listed but obtainable on the Bordeaux market, an offer, no
doubt, that merchants here would be glad to back and the depressed Bordeaux
trade only too happy to supply.
Buyers cannot look for any resale profit, but in many cases the crop was so
small that the successes may be hard to find later. Those who like to follow
particular chateaux may care to represent a vintage which will probably
develop fairly quickly.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Food: The pea, one of life's little luxuries - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE UPON a time there were fresh garden peas and dried field peas. Fresh
peas were a fleeting summer treat, sweet and tender with a hint of asparagus
flavour, one of life's little luxuries.
Catherine de Medici is credited with introducing them to the French court.
Louis XIV loved them. So did King George III; patriotic British gardeners
traditionally strove to have the first of the crop ready by June 4, his
birthday.
Dried peas, yellow and mealy, brought solid winter comfort to commoners  -
think of mushy peas, pease pudding and foggily thick pea soup.
Monarchs made use of dried peas too, occasionally slipping one under a pile
of feather mattresses to test whether princesses had the capacity to be
truly royal.
Then the frozen food fairy waved her wand and fresh and dried peas all but
vanished. Greengrocers and supermarkets were invaded by millions of
polythene-bagged, seasonless, greener-than-real-life-green frozen peas.
Tender and sweet, oh yes, but bland and characterless.
Just occasionally hopes were raised by news that so-called fresh peas might
be found on sale, but what a disappointment they turned out to be: ungraded
bullets in yellowing pods as coarsely webbed as army belts.
After years of pea deprivation, a couple of years ago I spotted some peas
from Egypt in a local supermarket. They looked juicy and fresh and tasted as
garden peas should. Manna from heaven.
This summer the news is even better. English garden peas have returned to
our shops.
For two or three weeks now I have bought them and found them a delight -
food for proper summer celebrations, to serve with other seasonal delicacies
such as sea trout and lamb, and to enjoy on their own.
PENNE WITH PEAS (serves 4-6)
Pasta and vegetables play an equal role in this dish which can be served as
a substantial first course or as a light main course. A somewhat similar
dish of peas (minus the pasta) is served at the Ristorante Sozzani in
Sondrio, capital of Valtellina in northern Lombardy, where it successfully
partners osso bucco in lieu of the more usual risotto milanese.
12 oz pasta quills or shell shapes; 1 lb peas (shelled weight - in other
words you will need about 3 lb peas in the pod); half a dozen or so outer
leaves taken from a Cos lettuce; 1 large onion; 2 1/2 oz butter or melted
bacon fat; about  3/4 pt light stock or water; a few tablespoons of freshly
grated Parmesan cheese.
Chop the onion finely. Warm the fat and stew the onion gently in a covered
pan for a few minutes. Add the peas, stir briefly and pour on enough liquid
to immerse them completely.
Half-cover and cook for 25-30 minutes until the peas are so creamily tender
that they are easily crushed between finger and thumb.
Shred the lettuce finely and add it to the pan after the first 15 minutes.
Push it well down into the pan so it wilts quickly.
Towards the end, season the peas with plenty of coarsely ground black
pepper, some salt, and a pinch of sugar maybe.
When they are ready, the vegetables should be moistened by, rather than
swimming in, a little well flavoured syrupy sauce. Remove the pan lid to
drive off surplus liquid if necessary, or add a splash more water and cover
tightly if the juices evaporate too fast.
Boil the pasta and drain it quickly. Add it to the peas and sprinkle on a
little Parmesan. Toss to mix well and serve straight away.
PEAPOD SOUP
(serves 4-6)
There is something very pleasing about making use of foods that might
otherwise go to waste.
Blackcurrant leaf sorbet and this delicate green soup are especially
delicious examples of such frugal cookery - but the soup is only worth
making with fleshy green pods fresh enough to snap juicily.
1 1/2 lb peapods; a small handful of young peas (optional); half a dozen
spring onions; a little lemon juice and sugar; a few sprigs of mint; about 2
pt water or light stock;  1/4 pt cream.
Put the well-washed pods into a soup pan with a sprig of mint, the chopped
spring onions and half a teaspoon of sugar. Pour on 1 1/2 pt water (the
water saved from cooking asparagus is ideal) or light stock.
Cover tightly and simmer for 45 minutes, crushing the pods down into the
liquid with a potato masher every now and again.
Set the covered pan aside for half an hour. Then strain off the liquid and
cook the peas in it. Meanwhile whizz the pods to a puree in a food processor
and sieve carefully to separate fibre from tender green pulp.
Stir the contents of the pea pan into the pulp. Add the cream, season with
lemon juice, salt, pepper and sugar, and thin with  1/2 pint or so cold
water or stock to taste.
Chill well and serve in soup cups or plates, each garnished with a single
mint leaf.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Travel: A dive that comes alive - Juliet Sychrava explores
coral caves in the Red Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAROL and Paul are real British divers
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the kind who struggle out of the churning waters of the North Sea laden with
knives and computers shouting: 'I told you you need a 25mm Neoprene.'
These are worrying people to find sitting next to you as you prepare to fall
backwards off a boat. But after a week of the Red Sea's brilliant waters,
even Carol had forgotten to argue with the other eight of us about the finer
points of the American demand valve.
As I set off for Hurghada, on the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea, I already
suspected I was not a British diver. I prefer to know which way up I am, and
found diving in the soupy waters off Devon last October uninspiring. 'Did
you see that scallop?' someone asked as we stood shivering on the beach.
'Oh, was there a scallop?' 'Yes, it was near the beginning . . .'
The Red Sea, by comparison, held out the promise of as much mixed seafood as
anyone could digest. On the first day of our week's trip, our heads
swivelled as a cry went up from one of the white-turbaned crew at the end of
the boat. Said, the captain, was dangling what looked like a barracuda at
the end of a line. 'Lunch,' he said, pointing at it with an enormous grin.
Lunch aside, we were careful not to touch anything while diving, not least
because the Red Sea is home to such prickly characters as stone and scorpion
fish, as well as large Moray eels which rise up like cobra from the rocks.
'One girl last week stroke him and he take a bite out of her neck,' Paolo,
our Italian diving instructor, warned us. He liked her gold necklace, he
explained.
But the eels, like most things in the Red Sea, will not bother you unless
you bother them. As a result, feeding the fish is considerably more
interesting than dropping pellets into a goldfish bowl. A hard-boiled egg is
easiest to handle underwater, and brings thousands of multi-coloured fish
crowding around your mask.
People who have not dived often imagine it to be dark underwater, but the
Red Sea is alive with light. Through caves in the white fan coral, which
waves like a miniature forest on the sea floor, hundreds of transparent
glass fish hang suspended in the water. As you look up, they mix with the
streams of your own air bubbles rising through the blue water to the
surface, clearly visible high above us.
Then, suddenly, we saw the shark. As we pointed and hovered, it moved
silently out of our vision. 'It was a reef shark,' Carol said. 'No, it had a
white band on its tail fin, it was a grey shark,' someone else said. Paolo,
the expert, landed on the boat, shivering as always. 'Yes, shark,' he said,
'shark.'
Identifying the turtles, tuna, and smaller fish we'd seen - dolphins
sometimes accompany divers - was only part of the fun. The physical pleasure
of diving is also part of it, as is the varied company. Our group included
two osteopaths, a trade unionist, an army officer and a research chemist.
Hurghada, a strip of road between the desert and the sea, is not the place
to go for sophisticated nightlife, though it is cheap. Regal Diving in
Cambridge (tel: 0353-778096) is offering an eight-day trip (Thursday to
Thursday) to Hurghada for Pounds 439 this summer. The price includes
half-board, flight, and 12 boat dives.
If you have never scuba dived before, you can go for the same time and price
and do the basic beginner's 'open water' course, run by PADI, the US diving
organisation. Diving equipment can be hired at Hurghada.
Numerous travel companies offer Red Sea packages, including Twicker's World,

FT  11 JUL 92 / Travel: On horseback in Africa - Nicholas Woodsworth visits
Swaziland, where an older way of life exists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS mid-morning and time for decisions. Submerged up to my belly button,
I sat on an underwater stool at the bar pool, leaned back, and sucked
thoughtfully at a pink lemonade. In the middle of an African heat-wave, one
must consider one's options carefully.
Out on a raised tee not far from the pool, sunburned men in spiked shoes
were belting great drives down the first fairway of the Royal Swazi Sun
Hotel's hillside golf course. These were not the feeble and erratic efforts
of weekend duffers like me; when they swung a club over their shoulders the
competitors in the Swazi Sun Pro-Am Classic actually knew what they were
about to do.
I, on the other hand, knew what I was about not to do - trot around after
them looking for clues to improve my form. On airless greens baking in
42```C (115`F) heat, enthusiastic spectators were going down like ninepins.
There was another way, though, in which I could trot around in something
like comfort. On the far side of the golf course I had spotted the hotel
riding stable. My riding seat may be no better than my golf stance, but I
could see few more pleasant means of getting to know this corner of Africa.
Trudge about on foot in this noon-day sun and you undoubtedly deserve the
company of mad dogs. Drive around in a car and you miss much of the best the
tiny country of Swaziland has to offer - spectacular hill country and a
traditional rural way of life that has yet to catch up with the modern age.
Half-an-hour later I had swung up on to the back of a tall chestnut mare
named Vitesse and with guide Peter Emmett was setting out through the
emerald fields of the fertile Ezulwini valley.
It may be the special quality of light one finds on the high plateau all
over southern Africa, or it may be that factory smokestacks are few and far
between in Swaziland. Either way, everything seemed bright and highly
coloured on this cross-country hack through village, field and bush. The sky
above was a fierce hard blue, the hills that rose all around a lush green,
the dirt road along which Vitesse walked an unabashed red. In this world the
vivid yellow butterflies that flitted along seemed only normal.
The Ezulwini valley lies only a 20-minute drive from the Swazi capital,
Mbabane, in the most developed part of the country. Nonetheless it lives in
a simpler, less complex age than our own. Leave the confines of the luxury
hotels scattered along its length and suddenly, surprisingly, life itself,
like the colours here, is reduced to its basic elements.
As very few African countries are these days, Swaziland remains
overwhelmingly agricultural and its people rural.
Fording the muddy brown water of a stream, we passed women washing piles of
laundry. Upstream, small naked boys splashed through the water like shiny
brown seals. We overtook barefooted girls padding home with old kerosene
tins full of water balanced on their heads. Beside tin-roofed houses that
had neither running water nor electricity we saw mothers weeding their maize
fields, newborn babies tied to their backs with shawls. Old men wrapped in
the traditional garb of red cloth sat under shady trees by the road drinking
beer. And in the wide rolling pastureland where we let the horses canter,
cowherds with slingshots stood guard while snowy white tick birds rode the
backs of their grazing charges.
Not surprisingly, Peter Emmett has fallen in love with this country. Nor is
he alone - more than 10,000 white residents enjoy the pace of life here.
Like him, many are South African escapees from a life of stress and racial
tension. Some years ago, inducted into a crack military counter-insurgency
unit, Peter found himself using dogs and horses to chase guerrilla fighters
through the bush of pre-independence Namibia. Today he is much happier in
his capacity as stable owner, competition rider and captain of the Swaziland
polocross team.
While half Swaziland's expatriates are British, its economy is wholly
dominated by the modern, high-tech neighbour that borders it on three sides;
from where we were riding we could see the sugar cane fields and timber
stands in which South African expertise and investment plays such a role.
All the more surprising, then, is Swaziland's striking retention of tribal
customs and a traditional, African way of life. Even witchcraft continues to
play an important role. Following, for example, a media Aids campaign in
which they were admonished to 'wear condoms at all times,' many Swazis took
to hanging unrolled condoms from their belts in the belief they had magic
power to ward off infection.
But the greatest power in the land is vested in one man. Riding up the sides
of the valley to a rocky crest, we climbed high enough to overlook the Royal
Kraal, or enclosure, of King Mswati III. In the kingdom of Swaziland this,
rather than any boardroom or government ministry, is the real seat of rule.
Mswati is very young and inexperienced, but here, advised by tribal elders,
he rules by royal decree. His great wealth is judged not by his bank account
but rather by the fact he is the largest cattle owner in the country - in
Swaziland cattle are so valued as marks of status that few owners are
willing to part with them and the country cannot fill its lucrative EC
export quota.
Mswati may be British-educated, but does not keep British habits. Already he
has seven wives, a niggling number compared to the five dozen his father
had. How traditional does the king remain on a continent that is rapidly
changing? When he recently convened national leaders and foreign diplomats
to announce gradual changes towards more democratic rule, he had them sit
before him on the grass in the Royal Cattle Byre.
On our ride I had seen plenty of cattle, goats, dogs and other domestic
animals, but later that day I made a dramatic switch to their wild cousins.
In the Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary, a reserve just minutes up the valley, I
exchanged Vitesse for a dun-coloured gelding named Skukuza, and put myself
in the capable hands of Innocent and High Noon, Innocent being a park guide
and High Noon his horse.
Few experiences can match riding along at close quarters beside a thundering
herd of wildebeest or high-bounding impala. In the softer, kinder sun of
late afternoon, Innocent and I trotted off across rolling plains knee-high
in feathery grass, along deep creeks thick with tropical vegetation, and
through fragrant pine forests where leopards find refuge.
There were animals everywhere, giraffe feeding on the trees, wart hog
rooting through the underbrush, hippo wallowing in muddy ponds, impala
dozing in the shade. For some reason, wild animals pay little attention to
cars; with horses, though, there is a direct and gratifying interaction. The
herds sniff the air, twitch their ears, stamp the ground nervously, and then
begin to run.
By sunset I felt I had all of Africa to myself. Hills and mountains glowed
mauve. The plain before me was dotted with grazing zebra, the air filled
with the smell of horse sweat and the cooler scents of coming night. Not far
away at a poolside bar, exhausted men in peaked caps were settling down to
an evening of tall tales. Soon I would be joining them. But talk of mighty
blows and escape from deadly sand traps would no longer bring out the
embarrased duffer in me. Let them set out through the African heat in
deranged pursuit of that little white ball. I had my own, more pleasant
pursuits, on four legs rather than two.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Belfast is 'a clean, crisp Hibernian Rio' (official): The
Northern Ireland Tourist Board believes battle-scarred West Belfast could
attract visitors. Tim Burt looks at the changes which make the notion
plausible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TONIGHT is bonfire night in Belfast. Piles of old timber and rubbish are
ready to burn and hundreds of Protestant children, some younger than 10
years old, are looking forward to the big event: the annual celebration of
the Battle of the Boyne.
Each year, the fires send a pall of smoke across hardline suburbs, reminding
Roman Catholic communities of their rout in 1690 at the hands of William of
Orange. Army helicopters sometimes help spread the smoke as they hover over
the crowds, shining spotlights through the haze.
And yet the Northern Ireland Tourist Board sees hardline areas as a
potential attraction. It suggests visitors seeking a glimpse of the trouble
spots should be encouraged. The board's corporate plan says: 'The
opportunity to harness this curiosity factor should not be overlooked as a
positive factor in encouraging people to visit and understand Northern
Ireland.'
The invitation from the tourist board contrasts with the advice I was given
seven years ago by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The policeman who
questioned me thumped his bullet proof vest and said: 'The Provos are trying
to kill me. What protection can I give you - a Brit - on my doorstep? I
can't do anything if they lift you . . . my advice is get out of West
Belfast.'
I was about to be charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for
gathering information which might be useful to a terrorist. Taking pictures
of security bases is forbidden in Northern Ireland and I was an easy catch,
spotted outside the Woodburn army base by high-powered surveillance cameras
mounted on a pylon over the streets.
Tension was high then. More than 27 policeman had been killed that year and
the security forces were edgy. Tension is expected to rise again tonight
with the bonfires. The security forces will be on the look out for
'clodding' - stone-throwing battles which often lead to serious violence. In
the worst parts of West Belfast stones give way to Molotov cocktails or
condom bombs, home-made explosives filled with chemicals and acid. You can
tell condom bombs by the terrible smell. Gelignite has the sweet aroma of
marzipan.
Shopkeepers will spend the night in cars outside their premises. They claim
the police will not answer calls about burglaries and looting for fear of
being set up for a terrorist attack. Officers say they can keep an eye on
many premises from the security of police stations using the type of
surveillance cameras which caught me.
The RUC hope any trouble will die out by daybreak. Tomorrow is the actual
anniversary of the battle between William of Orange and James II, but the
traditional Orange Day marches have been postponed until Monday out of the
respect for the sabbath. The interlude should give Belfast time to clean up
before the Protestant celebration begins afresh with a two-day public
holiday.
The uniforms and tunes of the marchers have not changed in years, nor have
the routes they try to take through sectarian areas. But the landscape of
West Belfast is undergoing a slow and painful facelift. Fewer shops and
offices are protected by wire grilles; two new shopping centres have been
built on the site of the old Eastwoods scrapyard; and whole areas of
derelict housing have been razed to make way for new homes.
Divis, the notorious republican ghetto which marks the gateway to West
Belfast, is being demolished as part of a Pounds 9m investment scheme. The
high-rise blocks have been one of the main targets of the state Housing
Executive which has built almost 1,000 new homes a year since 1982.
The redevelopment scheme, part of a Pounds 200m urban rehabilitation
programme, stretches from the Royal Victoria Hospital - the site of the
former Belfast and District Lunatic Asylum - to the River Lagan on the
fringe of the city. It has helped to reclaim waste ground and provided the
impetus for Europe's largest community-led environmental project: Colin
Glen, a spectacular park which cuts a green swathe through the western
suburbs.
These changes have helped make West Belfast into an area that is, in the
eyes of the tourist board, fit for visitors. Unionist politicians have
reacted angrily to the board's proposals, claiming tourist officials are
trying to package the troubles for outsiders. A claim which the officials
reject.
They are not the only ones who take a kindlier view of tourists. Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA, offers tourists a guide to the protest murals
and army bases. And privately, police officers say visitors are unlikely to
be detained for taking pictures of security installations.
Many of the improvements, however, are only cosmetic. Smart railings have
replaced the concrete blocks that used to line grassy areas of the city to
deter joyriders. But joyriding is as prevalent as ever.
The local economy has been drained by years of neglect during which the
government directed investment to areas of political preferment. That has
left unemployment averaging 36.7 per cent, rising to more than 60 per cent
in pockets of the Catholic Falls Road and Protestant Shankhill Road.
With little prospect of work, many low income families live on estates
suffering from vandalism and apathy. Most Belfast children never encounter
violence or see a bomb thrown, but those who face the dole are not so lucky.
They are ripe for racketeering and paramilitary recruitment.
The tourist board ignores all this and describes Belfast as 'crisp, clean
and inviting . . . a Hibernian Rio'. If the city centre compares to that
Brazilian metropolis, then West Belfast is its favela: spirited but poor.
There is, however, a group of entrepreneurs backed by the Industrial
Development Board, which sees investment as the panacea for the problems.
The West Belfast Business Opportunity group claims an enterprise culture is
flourishing, with new companies taking advantage of cheap premises and
labour.
The economic optimism has been fuelled by this week's face-to-face talks
between Ulster leaders and the British and Irish governments.
Local community leaders say there is a ripple of hope rather than a wave.
Too many residents have had expectations raised before only to see them
dashed by industrial closures, recession and violence. The Phoenix Trust, a
development group, says there is still 'severe multiple deprivation'.
Eamon Hanna, chief executive of the trust, says: 'This would be a problem
town even if a shot had never been fired . . . it's an uphill battle.' Hanna
and other business leaders say winning the economic battle depends on
overcoming the area's poor image. That image could take a further knock this
weekend if the bonfires become a prelude to violence and the clodding
persuades outsiders to follow the advice I received - get out of West
Belfast.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: High-tech wind in his sails -
David Blackwell on a man trying to transform a cottage industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAIL MAKING in England has suffered too long from being a basic cottage
industry. That is the view of Nicholas Gray, who speaks with the authority
of a lifetime's interest in sailing - and who has made his hobby his
business by buying from the liquidators a sail making business in Neyland,
Milford Haven, Dyfed.
In early 1990, for Pounds 25,000, he found himself the owner of one of the
few purpose built sail lofts in the UK, complete with sewing machines and
stocks. With a little more capital and a bank overdraft facility the
business, originally set up only a few months earlier with some help from
the Welsh Development Organisation, went from zero turnover to Pounds
100,000 in the first year.
From the start Gray, a solicitor who left London for west Wales four years
ago so that he could spend more time sailing, recognised that the local
market for sails was not going to be big enough to support the business. He
was seeking to rationalise and modernise an industry which would still be
recognised by a sailmaker from the 19th century - panels of cloth being cut
and stitched together.
'There are lots of sailmakers all doing the same thing,' he explained. While
everyone is up to date with computer assisted design and computer laser
cutting for cloth, few sail makers outside the US have divorced production
from their sales outlet.
'In other words all sails are made where they are sold, which leads to
enormous duplication.'
He had an eye to the big sailing market in southern England, and seized the
opportunity to buy for Pounds 15,000 Stephen Ratsey of Southampton, a
well-established family firm which, in his words, had 'lost its way a bit'
since the death of Stephen Ratsey three years ago.
His strategy was to close down the manufacture in Southampton, retaining the
premises for sales and service and make the sails in the Neyland loft, which
is in an enterprise zone and has low overheads.
'Where neither business was profitable in its own right we have got rid of a
whole layer of overheads with no reduction in service. The thing is
beginning to make sense,' he said. The company now employs six people in
Neyland and three in Southampton, and is expecting to turn over Pounds
300,000 this year.
Stephen Ratsey has a reputation for making big sails for classic boats, and
as Gray intends to stay in that market, he renamed the business Stephen
Ratsey &amp; Copp. His marketing drive has taken him to Brest this weekend where
1m visitors are expected to attend a show of traditional and classic boats
from all over the world.
But the other huge advantage of buying Stephen Ratsey was that the company
was considering a link with Doyle of Marblehead, the Cowes of the US east
coast.
Doyle is highly successful in what Gray terms the 'racing yacht and
mega-yacht field.' The company was looking for a UK outlet to promote sales
and service existing Doyle sails. Gray has tied up a deal with Doyle to
operate as Doyle UK, selling their sails in the UK from Southampton.
'They are selling to quite different markets - Doyle to racing and Ratsey to
traditional classic boats and cruising boats,' he said.
The link with Doyle is expected to provide a further boost to turnover
within a year. But in addition, Doyle is at the leading edge of sail
technology, and Gray is convinced the days of cottage industry sail making
are drawing to a close. 'I wanted a US tie up to make sure we know all about
and can take advantage of modern technology.'
Sophisticated computer software is becoming established in sail design. The
materials and techniques themselves are on the verge of change, with carbon
fibre sails and welded seams in the offing. 'A small business just would
never get hold of that sort of technology on its own,' says Gray, who has
ambitions to become one of the biggest sailmakers in the Pounds 15m-a-year
UK market.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Bavarian hospitality: As They Say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Economic Summit drew the familiar hangers-on and international financial
groupies to Munich last week. The last occasion they had gathered in such an
out-of-the- way place was when the IMF and World Bank met in Bangkok last
year. The comparisons were odious. As Daniel Hofmann of the Neue Zurcher
Zeitung put it: 'If they can get it right in a Third World country why can't
they do it here?'
'Getting it right', in this context, meant organising everything smoothly
for the media. That may be the ultimate test of a summit since reporters are
more prepared to see it as a success if they are happy. Hence, the acclaim
for last year's summit in London which was compact and slick and got
everything wrong. In Munich, home of Siemens electronics, the electronics
were what annoyed people. Deutsche Telekom is convinced it runs the world's
best communications system, but it is short of modern phone systems and made
few concessions to coupling systems which prevail elsewhere.
The press room was too hot when the sun shone, too cold when it did not,
with noise and ants. Electronic links between the two main centres were
rare, so if you wanted to hear what the Americans were saying you had to
travel the half hour needed to get there.
Enough of complaints, so now for some compliments. The thing about German
tabloids is that they have a go at everybody, not just those designated as
political enemies. So they had a good summit.
Bild Zeitung gave a fascinating account of the private tastes of the world's
leaders. President Mitterrand, it seems, does not drink, so his bar was
cleared of alcohol and filled with freshly-squeezed fruit juices. John
Major, however, has an unexpected reputation - he was given a vast
assortment of Bavarian beers and Franconian wine. Die Welt reported that the
hotel where the Japanese prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, stayed, rented a
large number of Japanese to stand around the lobby so the honoured guest
would feel at home.
The real test came on the first day. Munich Day had become what Bild called
'A mad house.' The authorities handled a few hundred anti-summit
demonstrators with that rigorous intolerance of unorthodox opinion that most
of the rest of Germany has overcome. The police formed a ring around the
demonstrators in which they were held for hours. 'If only Franz-Josef had
seen it,' was Bild's headline, a reference to the most famous of Bavaria's
post-war leaders, Franz-Josef Strauss. It was this populist conservative who
had decided that this summit should be held in Munich: perhaps he would have
rather enjoyed it for he revelled in the confrontation it provoked. The
headline in the tz, which is a local rival in the tabloid war, read: 'This
is the Summit: Brass bands and beatings.' It continued, 'The 'World City
with a Heart' shows the world two different faces.' When the Bavarian prime
minister, Max Streibl, defended the police action, the paper shouted, 'A
mistake, Herr Streibl] We Bavarians are not bullies.'
Among German journalists this led to an outbreak of inter-regional contempt.
As one noted hack told me, 'This could never have happened in North Rhine
Westphalia.' The verdict of the tabloids on the summit came in a review in
tz of a local production of Carmen - 'Just like the Summit: very expensive
and not much in it.'
The headline of the week came from another annual event, the Tour de France.
When the Spanish cyclist Miguel Indurain took the lead, Liberation cried,
'Singing Indurain arrive au top.'

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Tax on a mortgage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF I were to take a mortgage on my own home, on which I currently have no
loan, for the purpose of buying a property let or available for letting at a
commercial rent (probably a shop investment), can you confirm that interest
on the loan would be allowable as an expense against rent and not subject to
the restrictions (Pounds 30,000 limit and base rate only) that apply to a
loan to purchase one's own residence?
If so, would the Revenue require the mortgage and the purchase to happen at
the same time. I assume I could not take the mortgage now in the hope of
purchasing a suitable investment, possibly at auction, in due course.
The interest would be an allowable expense subject to the more-than-26-weeks
letting conditions set out in section 355(1)(b) of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Section 367(2) requires a loan to be made 'on
the occasion of, or within what is in the circumstances a reasonable time
from, the application of the money', and the proceeds of a loan must not be
'applied for some other purpose before being applied' for a qualifying
purpose.
The solicitors who act for you in the mortgage and conveyancing will be able
to guide you through the tax pitfalls, of course.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IS IT possible to establish a capital gains loss in a building society
account? Does this apply to share and deposit accounts? Does the account
have to close for this purpose?
We take it that your first question does not relate to share accounts
passing on death etc. That being so, the answer is no - except where the
share account was opened before March 1982 and a universal rebasing election
has been made (under section 96(5) of the Finance Act 1988). If this is so
and you wish to make a rebasing election (if the time limit has not yet
expired), ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14.
Only share accounts are within the scope of CGT (as they have been since CGT
was introduced, on April 7 1965). Deposit accounts are excluded by section
134(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, in conjunction with section 29(2)
of that Act, (as they have been since 1965). The account would not have to
close for this purpose.
Remember, indexation of share accounts (which was introduced on April 6,
1982, and extended to losses on April 6, 1985) was withdrawn by the Finance
Act 1988 retrospectively from July 4, 1987.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Back to the futures . . . - Beverly
Chandler is positive about a negative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BEVERLY CHANDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managed futures sound risky, but they can cheaply deliver what almost every
investor wants - diversification.
This is an industry with an image so negative in Europe that until recently,
in many cases, more of its members' time has been spent trying to convert
the unconverted than in managing money.
But the strongest argument for the inclusion of derivatives - futures,
options and warrants - in a portfolio, is that the managed futures sector
tends to move in the opposite direction to other assets such as bonds or
equities.
This has been the subject of long-running debate, but it seemed to be borne
out by Credit Lyonnais Rouse's Systemtrend, one of the first-established
offshore futures funds, which triumphantly achieved 14 per cent growth
during October and November 1987, while stock markets crashed.
If investments in managed futures portfolios go up when equities are down,
then they have a role to play in the balanced portfolio.
The strength of this argument, supported by a move towards probity as the
cowboys started to hang up their hats, has started a slow reconciliation of
managed futures funds with regulatory authorities across Europe.
However, while many in the UK welcomed the creation of two authorised
futures unit trusts - the Fof (futures and options fund) and Gfof (geared
futures and options fund) in July 1991, many more feel that the restrictions
on the funds are too limited for efficient portfolio management.
Fofs were met by only two contenders, Legal &amp; General with Tactical Asset
Allocation trust and John Govett Unit Trust Managers which has now launched
nine Fofs.
The Tactical Asset Allocation trust bases its investment decisions on a
computer model which indicates which type of asset - equities, gilts or cash
 -to invest in and when. Futures are used for investment exposure because,
according to Michael Hayden, of L&amp;G, 'Index futures are a cheap,
cost-effective means of achieving the model's recommended exposure without
the risks associated with the selection of individual shares.'
L&amp;G has raised Pounds 10m for its fund since launched on December 30 last
year, but the fund is bottom of its sector over six months, to July 1
according to Finstat. This reflects poor performance in the managed futures
industry which showed an average loss of 12.9 per cent in the year to May
31, according to the Managed Account Reports futures fund index, the only
measure of futures fund performance currently available.
This bears out the argument that the performance of derivatives is
diametrically opposed to that of equities. The FT A World Index for the same
period shows growth of 12.4 per cent. The fund requires only a Pounds 1000
minimum subscription unlike John Govett's funds which are offered to more
'professional' investors with a minimum of Pounds 100,000 subscription.
John Govett's funds cover four indices twice. For example, for the UK there
is a tracker fund which uses futures to track the FT-SE index, and a bear
fund which aims to achieve broadly the opposite of the index. The ninth fund
is a cash fund.
John Govett has raised Pounds 60m since launch in December from
discretionary fund managers and broker bonds.
But fund managers' dissatisfaction with the existing regulations is shown by
the fact that these two companies have not been joined by others.
Industry watchers originally looked to the Prudential for the first launch
of a managed futures unit trust in the UK. Under Alan Wren, the Prudential
took a high profile, carrying out a series of roadshows explaining the joys
of managed derivatives funds.
But once the rules were published, there was silence from the Pru. Wren
says: 'Little will happen at the Prudential until the SIB changes the rules.
We want flexibility of charging structures, single pricing and a
clarification of terminology, particularly where the guarantee is
concerned.'
The guaranteed fund has easily the greatest marketing potential of the
managed futures products.
Guaranteed funds were first used offshore by E D &amp; F Man International with
their range of Mint Funds. Each fund has a fixed lifespan of either five or
seven years. The money under management is split into two funds, with the
larger amount going into high quality bonds designed to return this part of
the fund to 100 per cent of the original value by the fund's termination
date.
The rest is invested in futures and options. The aim is for the investor to
be certain to get his original capital back and to have the return on the
derivatives on top.
E D &amp; F Man is a big European player, with slightly more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 520m) under management in a range of over 20 offshore managed
futures funds. The UK's restrictive legislation has put them off launching
funds here.
Colin Barrow, managing director of E D &amp; F Man's fund division, said: 'We
wish the others the greatest success, but I think that the regulatory
regime, with the difficulty of creating a guaranteed fund, does not suit
us.'
Hugh Dumas, marketing director of Credit Lyonnais Rouse, says: 'Managed
futures funds have shown that they are an asset class in their own right
with the MAR (managed futures) index beating the equity and bond indices on
a straight comparison over eight years. UK investors must be allowed to
access managed futures through properly authorised funds.'
As an answer to the many complaints, the Securities and Investments Board is
planning a conference at the end of November 1992, hoping that industry
participants will come along and air their views. It could be a lively
event.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Abbey's silent minority
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DO YOU know anyone who has repeatedly turned down the chance to be given a
free gift worth Pounds 273 - or even Pounds 546? It may seem unlikely that
anyone would look a gift-horse of this sort in the mouth, but according to
Abbey National there are many such people around.
They are soon to be given a final chance to claim a gift of free shares
which they should have taken in 1989.
The people concerned are some 390,000 customers of the former building
society, Abbey National, which dished out 100 free shares to 5.4m members
when it was floated on the stock market three years ago.
Just why anyone should refuse repeated exhortations to fill in a form which
will bring them a free allocation of shares is a mystery. Since the shares
were issued in 1989 they have risen in value from Pounds 130 to Pounds 273
and annual dividends have been paid out twice on them.
Even if a good proportion of the missing customers are long-since dead,
there must be tens of thousands of people around who are entitled to claim
the shares.
Few of them seem inclined to step forward. Last time Abbey National wrote to
the 390,000 silent customers, it got only 5,000 replies.
Presumably most of the people concerned who are still alive have had
envelopes coming through their doors at intervals in the last few years.
Perhaps they thought they were junk mail or dire warnings about falling
behind with their mortgage payments.
If you were an Abbey National member at the time of the float and did not
receive your shares, perhaps because you changed address, then you should
consider whether the shares are owing to you.
To qualify for the shares at the time of the float, an Abbey National saver
had:
to have at least Pounds 100 in their account between December 31, 1988 and
April 11 1989 and
to be the first named person on the account and over 18 years old by April
11 1989.
Abbey National borrowers had to meet similar qualifications, but were
required to have borrowings of more than Pounds 100 from the society between
the same dates.
Individuals could qualify for two allocations of shares if they were both a
saver and a borrower, so there must be some people who, if they but knew it,
are entitled to nearly Pounds 550 worth of shares from Abbey National.
If you think you are eligible, then you must fill in a claim form giving
details of your accounts with the society at the relevant dates. If you do
not receive a letter from Abbey National, a free 24-hour helpline has been
set up which you can call.
The number of the helpline is 0500 - 500 - 202.
Abbey National proposes to sell unclaimed shares in the market in 1993. Most
of the cash will go straight into its reserves (which is good news for
existing shareholders as it will improve the earnings per share).
A small proportion of the money raised by the sale will be given to the
Abbey National Charitable trust for donation to selected charities.
If for some reason, you do not get in touch with Abbey National before the
shares are sold off, do not despair. The bank will still have to repay you
the money any time until six years after the flotation. Money on the
dividends paid before the shares are sold off can be claimed for up to 12
years.
Meanwhile, other building society customers must be wondering who will reap
a bonanza when the next large society converts into a company.
That day may still be some way off. Jon Foulds, chairman of Halifax, the
largest building society, this week said that chances of Halifax having a
stock market flotation were negligible for the next three to five years at
least.

The weak stock market has had two effects on director dealing activity.
First, with few exceptions, the cash value of directors' sales is smaller
than usual, even if the actual number of sales is little changed.
Second, the volume of directors buying their own stock has risen - a swing
which is consistent with the historic pattern of such movements. It is worth
noting that only one of the sales in this week's column resulted from the
exercise of an option. Scarcely surprisingly, directors choose to defer the
exercise and sale of options when the market is unfavourable.
Microvitec stands out as an exception on the lower cash value of sales. John
Martinez-Perez, non-executive director, has disposed of almost 310,000
shares at between 31p-32p. His residual holding is 2.74m shares, still the
largest shareholder on the board.
During the last 12 months certain sectors of the economy have had to face an
unpalatable truth - they are not immune to recession. The waste management
industry is such an area and Shanks McEwan is the sector's largest company.
Final results published last month revealed a drop in earnings, the first
setback since Shanks came to the market. Hugh Runciman, chairman, sold
150,000 shares at 190p, near its low for the year.
BM Group, the acquisitive engineering company, has been in the headlines
since the resignation of Roger Shute, chairman, because of ill-health. The
share price has fallen sharply from more than 400p only weeks ago. Shute
bought 100,000 shares at 100p just before he resigned.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The true price of going Dutch -
Investing in . . . the Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVEST in the Netherlands and you expose yourself to the US economy. In
spite of its small size in both area and population, the Dutch tradition as
a trading nation means that it still exerts a disproportionate influence on
the world stage.
As the graph below shows, this also makes it by far the most sensitive
European market to the movements of the American market and economy. Richard
Harding, European fund manager with Henderson, says: 'There are those who
argue that Holland is the last state of the USA.'
This goes a long way to explaining its continuing popularity with British
fund managers, particularly of European funds - for example Henderson has a
12 per cent weighting compared to a benchmark index rating of 10 per cent.
It has a very liquid market compared to some continental European rivals,
and is regarded by some as 'just like trading in London'.
The Dutch trading spirit has also ensured the growth of several massive
companies with a worldwide influence which is again disproportionate to the
size of their home country - for example Royal Dutch Shell, one of the
world's biggest oil companies, Unilever, the consumer products conglomerate,
and Philips electronics.
These three alone represent almost 40 per cent of the main Netherlands
index, but there is a clutch of slightly smaller companies which are still
worldwide household names, and which trade in heavy volumes popular with
investors - for instance KLM, Heineken, Fokker, Daf and Elsevier.
Harding adds that Dutch accounting policies allow for the most transparent
figures available in continental Europe. The awesome linguistic ability of
many Dutch people further eases the job of investing for foreigners.
However, the Netherlands is still at the heart of the move towards European
union, and like other economies on the continent it is sensitive to events
in Germany. According to Paul Loos, a fund manager with the Amsterdam-based
company Kooijman Capital Markets, which manages a Benelux fund for Clerical
Medical International among others, more than 25 per cent of Dutch exports
are to Germany.
The Dutch guilder is tied tightly to the D-mark via the exchange rate
mechanism which, in turn, ensures that short-term interest rates are high.
This has not been good for the economy.
However, Kooijman detects signs of a tentative recovery. Industrial
production rose a seasonally corrected 3 per cent in April, following a
meagre 0.6 per cent rise for the first three months. It also notes that
consumer optimism has increased considerably since the end of last year,
according to official figures.
Kooijman has also cut its predictions for unemployment which it now expects
to remain stable this year at 320,000, compared with a previous estimate of
350,000.
Opinions vary on the best sectors to invest in at present. Loos is
concentrating on the oil business and food, both of which are viewed as
defensive sectors. He, like Harding is also keen to buy American exposure,
as he sees room for recovery in the US, and this means Elsevier, a
publishing group based in Holland which does most of its business elsewhere
in the world.
Harding sees opportunities to profit from falling interest rates via a
holding in ABN Amro. This is a big bank formed by a merger, and its stock
market valuation still seems to reflect adverse sentiment at the time of the
deal. It is trading on a 6.8 per cent yield, and a p/e ratio of 7.5. At
these levels, Harding believes it is a cheap way to buy into the likely
resurgence when interest rates come down. Kooijman is interested in life
insurers such as Aegon.
The Netherlands is also the dominant market within Benelux, which is often
treated as a homogenous economic area. Belgium falls much more under the
influence of Germany, according to Loos, and lacks the vast companies which
make Holland so attractive. It is also not as liquid. However, it does have
cyclical stocks which would be helped by a German recovery, and most methods
of buying into the Netherlands allow ease of access to Belgium.
It is as well not to get too excited about the Netherlands - exposure to the
US may not be wholly welcome at present, and there is also room for doubt
about whether Germany has yet reached the bottom.
But few European markets offer such ease or simplicity to investors, and no
others of equivalent size present such an array of strong international
companies.

<TEXT>
OWNERS Abroad, the holiday company, is expected to announce half-year
pre-tax losses on Thursday of between Pounds 23.5m and Pounds 26m, compared
with Pounds 21.4m last time. The figures in themselves are of little
interest. Holiday companies have large costs in the first half and receive
most of their payments in the second.
More eagerly awaited will be a statement on high season bookings and the
dangers of continued discounting. A sluggish season could signal another
price war.
Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate run by Greg Hutchings, is likely to
report on Monday an increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended April of
around 15 per cent. The consensus forecast is Pounds 131m against Pounds
112m a year earlier. The US continues to provide the group's growth, with
the latest period benefiting from a full-year contribution from Philips
Industries, now operating under the umbrella of Tomkins Industries, the
group's predominantly US arm.
While the market is always interested in where Hutchings' acquisition
ambitions might take him next, he is unlikely to give many clues with the
results.
Ellis and Everard, the chemical processor and distributor reporting on
Monday, has recently suffered a minor profit downgrading to around Pounds
13m pre-tax for the year ended April from Pounds 17.5m year earlier. The
downturn reflects the recession and a likely exceptional charge.
Wednesday is Cider Day, with Taunton Cider closing its share offer and H P
Bulmer (Holdings) producing its annual figures. The latter will have the
better of it. Pre-tax profits at Bulmer have risen to about Pounds 16m from
Pounds 14.4m thanks to growth of the UK market.
Although Taunton has enjoyed similar gains, its offer is unlikely to appeal
right now to shareholders giving a wide berth to any new issue.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Markets: Another fine mess you've got us into - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S ALL your fault. You, the great British consumer, were supposed to lift
the economy out of recession by pouring all that cash you have been
stockpiling into new cars, houses and consumer goods. Turn to the 'How To
Spend It' page immediately and do your duty.
Those readers who are still with us may know exactly what went wrong with
the economic recovery. It takes confidence to rush out and spend money on
flim-flams and confidence is just what consumers are short of right now.
Any spare cash is going to pay off existing debts rather than run up new
ones. Government statistics released this week showed that consumers repaid
Pounds 146m of their credit card and finance house debt in the three months
to May.
The rate of repayment has fallen a bit, as the graph shows. That could be
taken to mean consumers are beginning to get less worried about their debts
 -or that they are so hard up they cannot even bring down their credit card
debt any more. Retail sales are still looking poor.
At least 'top people' in the service of the public will be better off. Their
pay rises are being limited to 4 per cent, but the inflation rate, announced
yesterday, is only 3.9 per cent. All those judges and generals enjoying a
real increase in their incomes will, one feels sure, do their bit for
Britain.
Three months ago you could ask a selection of economists when gross domestic
product numbers would turn positive, and a good proportion would give the
answer 'this quarter'. With consumer spending accounting for about
two-thirds of the economy, many wonder if the upturn will even come this
year.
That makes the third false dawn the stock market has had to cope with in the
last 18 months. The post-election jump in share prices has been reversed.
The mood in the market is gloomy, even though the FT-SE 100 index is only
down 6.3 points over the week, to 2,490.8. As well as having no good news
from the UK economy, the market is getting no help from Wall Street or
Germany either.
British consumers are not just failing to buy houses, cars and goods. The
retail investor is not buying shares either, judging by the poor response
met by companies launching themselves on the stock market.
Yesterday the public offer by MFI Furniture Group - worth Pounds 157.5m -
closed undersubscribed. The final number of applications has yet to be
announced, but it is fair to assume that the institutions who underwrote the
offer will be taking a large proportion of it.
Earlier in the week Anglian Group, the double glazing company, saw only 6
per cent of the shares it offered to the public taken up. Investors put in
bids for Pounds 2.7m worth of shares out of a public offer of Pounds 44.1m.
Wednesday was the first day of dealings in shares of The Telegraph, whose
flotation the week before was less than one-third taken up by public
investors. The shares ended their first day at 283p, 42p down from the 325p
offer price. At that price some analysts said the shares were cheap, and by
yesterday's close they were 293p.
It is not just retail investors, though. Institutional investors are also
cutting down on shares and taking a look at bonds again. All over the City
asset allocation committees are concluding that gilt-edged stock is a better
bet than shares.
This might seem curious as the government's borrowing requirement is going
to be so high this year that there will be a flood of gilts being issued.
One might suppose with such huge supply that investors would be cautious.
But then, when the government needs to sell so much stock it must make it
look attractive - rather like privatisations. Low inflation makes the
hedging characteristics of equities less important, while dividend cuts by
companies emphasise the security of the high yield on gilts.
It is also worth remembering that investors would have been better off
keeping their money in cash or bonds rather than shares over the last five
years.
News from the corporate front this week has reinforced the feeling that
consumers just are not consuming. The likes of Dixons, the electrical
retailer, and Rank Organisation, the bingo to Butlins group, see no
lightening of the gloom. Albert Fisher, the fresh produce company, bemoaned
a glut of food and falling prices - surely one piece of good news for their
customers - and saw its shares plunge 25p to 41p on Thursday, closing
yesterday at 39p.
With the interim results season opening shortly, there is likely to be yet
more bad news from companies. Certainly stockbrokers are downgrading many
more profit forecasts than they are upgrading.
But it is not uniformly black. The regional electricity companies do appear
able to extract money from consumers, but then it helps to be a monopoly
supplier with a captive market. At least Seeboard, which covers the south
east of England, has the grace to give some of the profits back to its
customers, through a Pounds 10 rebate.
It must also be encouraging for Abbey National, the building society turned
bank, to know that 390,000 of its customers are so well off that they can
afford not to claim 39m free shares, worth Pounds 108.4m at yesterday's
closing price of 278p, that they were due as part of the company's 1989
flotation. If only they could find them they could draw up a mailing list
which others would clamour to buy.
But perhaps the best indicator of consumer confidence comes from Eurocamp,
the camping holidays specialist. At one and the same time it claims to have
an upmarket clientele and cheaper holidays than many package tour groups.
Its bookings are more than 15 per cent up this summer. The ABC1 classes have
discovered the joys of sleeping under canvas.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Markets: The rising cost of a ripe old age - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS Britain is not a 'nation of inheritors'. The boom in home ownership
and in house prices since the Second World War had led many commentators to
expect a resurgence in inherited wealth. Millions of people in their middle
age would suddenly have no reason to work again because they had inherited
their parents' house.
But a survey by Christopher Hamnett, visiting senior research fellow at
Nuffield College, Oxford suggests that the predicted rise in inherited
wealth will not happen. Instead, the costs of old age will eat into life
savings and force people to sell their homes before the inheritance gets
near their children.
The social implications of this finding go far beyond the fact that
Wodehousian 'drones' will not be making a come-back - they reveal a
financial problem of huge magnitude which the UK has scarcely begun to
tackle.
Hamnett's arguments against the 'nation of inheritors' theory are as
follows: fewer people are dying each year, because they are living longer
(not something which ought to be a problem), while Inland Revenue statistics
show that the number of homes passing at death each year has been more or
less constant over the last 20 years.
Most importantly, older home owners are selling or at least transferring
ownership of their houses before their death. They do this either to pay for
nursing care or just to generate additional income.
Let me put that another way. The longer lives we can now expect have created
a financial problem. Our life savings plans, based on out-of-date
assumptions of longevity, are no longer adequate. To keep heads above water
in retirement, the elderly are being forced to sell their homes.
Hence what Hamnett calls the 'missing billions' which the nation's
disappointed heirs will not, after all, inherit. He is even able to put a
rough figure on this. Between 120,000 and 190,000 people enter care homes
each year. Nearly half own their own homes, and around two-thirds of these
need to sell them to pay for care. Hamnett says these homes are worth at
least Pounds 2.5bn. Money from these sales has helped force the housing
market further downwards and has paid for health care  - the cash is not
going to the nation's middle-aged masses.
So much, then, for John Major's widely quoted vision of wealth 'cascading
down the generations'. It was always a pretty silly vision. Research by
Hamnett and others, published last year, showed that the extra inherited
wealth would have gone to those who were already wealthy, deepening
divisions in what was supposed to become a 'classless society'. Inhabitants
of inner-city council estates, excluded from the housing chain, would have
felt all the more alienated.
But the problem which faces us instead is even greater. The British pensions
industry seems to have enough problems in the week that the man responsible
for regulating it offered to resign, and the Securities and Investments
Board published a sharp criticism of its own appointed watchdog.
Robert Maxwell's bulky shadow continues to wreck the public's confidence in
pension provision, and in those who regulate it. The problems of security
which he revealed must be addressed urgently.
However, in the long run an even greater problem is lurking for those who
want to save for the future. No one is sure how to pay for our longer lives.
The government has already been driven to bribe people into opting out of
the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme - a sign that the state foresees
difficulties paying the future bill. However, one does not need to be a
socialist red in tooth and claw to see some possibility of increased state
funding for residential care.
Meanwhile, several private sector life and health insurers - including PPP
Lifetime which commissioned Hamnett's report - have launched ambitious 'long
term care' insurance policies. They are truly innovative, although many
believe that they are too expensive. The potential demand is limitless -
people already accept that they need a pension, so they might soon accept
that they also need extra help in 'old old' age.
Other companies object that it would be better just to encourage even more
long-term saving. On this argument, the spiralling costs of long-term care
just make saving more important.
Another possibility is partnership between the public and private sectors,
achieved via tinkering with the tax system. Laurentian Life is campaigning
strongly for this, with the idea that pension legislation should be altered.
In essence, savers would put money into a 'long-term savings' account, and
the government could later allow further tax privileges if the money is used
for residential care. Companies already offering long-term care insurance
object. They claim as they might be expected to, that their products are
attractive enough without tax relief.
All these ideas require urgent consideration. This country badly needs a
system which can be relied on to stop a crook robbing a pension fund. That
is justifiably the short-term priority.
But we should not allow it to stop us from coming to terms with the rising
costs of old age. We can do without the inheritance bonanza - the people who
stood to gain had not earned it anyway. But long life should be a blessing,
not the burden it threatens to become.

FT  11 JUL 92 / The Long View: The cost of safe pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST there are indications of a shift in investment strategy by British
pension funds. It looks as though they began to buy gilt-edged securities
during the second quarter of the year. And the recent persistent weakness of
UK equities suggests that some of the funds for the government bond
purchases may well have come from sales of equities. Certainly the pension
funds, and other institutions, have been highly choosy participants in the
current troubled round of equity flotations.
There are sound investment reasons for this rebalancing exercise. But there
is also room for concern that legal and regulatory pressures may be starting
to influence pension funds too. In the wake of the Maxwell scandals pension
schemes face a new wave of controls and restrictions, including the possible
introduction of a compensation scheme. It is already time to think about
what the investment implications might be.
The investment strategy of British corporate pension funds reached a
uniquely aggressive extreme earlier this year. During the first quarter UK
pension funds were buyers of Pounds 2.8bn of UK and overseas equities and
sellers of Pounds 200m of gilts. By the end of March, according to Caps,
which measures pension fund performance, the average fund's total exposure
to equities had reached an all-time peak of 84 per cent.
Around the world this strategy is unparalleled. True, in many countries
pension funds must comply with laid-down investment guidelines. Governments
which happen to have large borrowing requirements say that in the interests
of prudence (naturally) pension schemes must invest a large percentage of
their resources in government bonds. But even where pension schemes have
complete investment freedom it is rare for their equity exposure to be much
more than 50 per cent.
Equities are, of course, risky. Share prices can be volatile and in 1987
they dropped by 25 per cent or so overnight. Back in 1974 the UK equity
market reached such a freakishly low level that it threatened the solvency
of various financial institutions and triggered the otherwise unnecessary
collapse of Burmah Oil. In the long run equities offer the best returns. But
institutions can only endure a high exposure to equities if they are
insulated from short-term price fluctuations.
British pension funds enjoy an infrastructure that gives precisely that
protection. They are valued not on the basis of market prices but on a
so-called actuarial valuation basis which focuses upon income. The huge
pension fund surpluses in recent years have arisen not so much from buoyant
stock markets as from the surge in dividends. In 1992, it is true, dividend
growth has come to a halt, but during the five years to 1989 dividends
almost doubled.
I have a vivid memory from my period as a trustee of the FT pension scheme.
In 1987, just after the crash, the trustees gathered apprehensively to
discuss the investment performance. We need not have worried. There was no
problem, the actuary assured us, dividend income had risen and so the
actuarial value of the fund had gone up.
This protection extends to the accounting methods. UK companies report their
pension fund contributions according to the SSAP 24 accounting standard
which accepts the highly smoothed results of the actuarial valuation method.
Compare this with the equivalent US standard FAS 87, based on volatile
market values. Surpluses or deficiencies resulting from market movements
have to be provided for in company profit statements. Understandably, US
companies would be alarmed by the risk to their share price if their pension
funds were to build up a large exposure to the equity market.
British companies have no such worries, but problems loom. One is over
discontinuance liabilities. Pension schemes must contain enough assets to
cover the liabilities if they were wound up tomorrow. In the past, schemes
always held a vast surplus on a discontinuance basis because if the scheme
were wound up the liabilities would be frozen in money terms, whereas
schemes are funded to provide for benefits linked to final salaries and
therefore expected to rise over the years. But now the law provides that
benefits must be upgraded in line with inflation up to 5 per cent. There is
a much greater possibility that after a market crash the scheme could become
insolvent on a 'mark to market' basis.
The second problem could arise from the design of a possible compensation
arrangement. If scheme members are to be protected against all contingencies
they will require cover against a collapse of the fund's asset value.
Indeed, other pension fund sponsors are going to be unwilling to pay into a
compensation scheme if they fear they will be required to bail out some fund
which is following an imprudent investment policy. The imposition of a
compensation scheme might trigger a rethink of the whole basis of investment
risk exposure.
In some ways this would be a pity, because occupational pension schemes
paying benefits linked to final salaries are positioned to take the very
longest investment view. This does not mean it is always right for them to
be 100 per cent committed to equities: market conditions vary from time to
time. But they are ideally placed to supply risk capital.
It is reckoned that almost a third of the shares of British listed companies
are owned by occupational pension funds. If pension funds were to decide
that, as in the US, an equity exposure of between, say, 50 and 60 per cent
would be more appropriate a massive volume of equities would have to change
hands.
It would be unfortunate, but logical, if in reducing the risks of pension
scheme members we were to reduce the ability of pension funds to supply risk
capital.

FT  11 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Japan's biggest broker says Japanese stocks are cheap, as Nomura did
this week, it is time to sit up and take notice. A good part of Nomura's
argument is that everyone, whether in Japan or outside it, thinks the market
can only go down. Given the depth of universal gloom and the fact that the
market has fallen 60 per cent from its peak, it might indeed be asked what
kind of disaster is not in the price already.
One obvious and familiar answer is the collapse of the Japanese financial
system as a result of the downward spiral in asset values. But there are
paradoxes here. There are various steps which the Japanese authorities could
take to help, from cutting the discount rate and pushing through a large
supplementary budget to reducing property taxes. There seems general
agreement in Tokyo that the return of asset inflation is simply not a
threat. The absence of action by the authorities thus seems to suggest they
do not take the possibility of financial collapse seriously. It might
therefore be asked whether the market would find action reassuring or
alarming.
Perhaps another way to approach the issue is to ask what scope there is for
a bounce in corporate earnings when recovery finally does arrive. The market
is, after all, a discounting mechanism. There is thus every reason to
suppose that it will turn before the earnings cycle hits bottom. The chief
difficulty here is that recovery in Japan, as elsewhere, is expected to be
fairly anaemic. In that case it may be asked whether Japanese corporations,
with their limited scope for cost-cutting and lay-offs, can expect much of
an earnings bounce at all. Nomura could be right in arguing that 16,000 is a
floor. The question is rather how long the market will stay there.

FT  11 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Hafnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps they just got carried away by anti-Maastricht sentiment. Whatever it
was, local institutions must now deeply regret that, with more than a hint
of chauvinism, they turned down Skandia's offer for Hafnia at a price more
than double the level of the Danish insurer's languishing B shares. As
yesterday's admission that employees other than the dismissed deputy general
manager were involved in unauthorised and costly share transactions further
underlines, Hafnia is in a frightful mess.
Thanks to some generous underwriting the company will at least receive the
DK2bn proceeds from this week's rescue rights issue. Unfortunately, though,
its long-term survival can only be assured if it can dispose of stakes so
expensively and rashly acquired first in fellow Danish insurer Baltica, and
then in Skandia. The annual carrying cost on these investments is DK500m
alone. By all accounts the 33 per cent Baltica holding has been widely
hawked around, but no serious takers have emerged. Skandia's spread of
interest might be more enticing for an institution with pan-European
ambitions - but then the Swedish group's defensive voting structure is a
turn-off for all but the most persistent adventurers. Given the continuing
market pressures on the insurance industry elsewhere, this year's
excitements in Scandinavia may turn out to be little more than a sideshow.

FT  11 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK house prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market was wise not to read too much yesterday into Thursday's
announcement by the Halifax Building Society that house prices in June rose
0.7 per cent. Memories of last October apart - a month when the Halifax
index momentarily blipped up before resuming its downward path - the mood of
UK housebuilding companies at the moment is almost unremittingly glum. Price
cuts of 5-10 per cent were not untypical in the first half of this year.
More worryingly it looks as though current pricing strategies will be
insufficient to achieve most companies' year-end target volumes. Tarmac for
one admits that prices may have to drop further, or incentives be sweetened,
if its goals are to be met.
To be fair to the Halifax, its suggestion that prices should stabilise in
the second half is tentative. This is not surprising, perhaps, given its
rosy predictions at the start of 1991 and its forecast in January of a
modest increase in prices this year.

FT  11 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's sterling effort
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be no doubt, from last night's speech to the European Policy
Forum, about the chancellor's determination to stick with current exchange
rate policy. The alternatives were dismissed with such determined precision
that he would have to resign rather than switch course. That awareness may
go some way towards stifling the devaluation talk that has helped cut 3
pfennigs off sterling's value since the authorities' botched intervention in
the money markets a week ago. Still, sterling is not necessarily in for an
easy ride.
Admittedly, part of the trouble is simply that sterling is caught in the
crossfire between a weak dollar and rising D-Mark. Yesterday's UK consumer
price figures may help as they show a steep drop in underlying inflation.
But the rate is still well above that of France, where an ability to control
inflation over the long term commands the respect of the financial
community. International investors, who have been grudging buyers of gilts
since the election, piled into a FFr3bn, 31-year bond for French railways
last week. Even with this trust, France has not been able to undercut
short-term German interest rates.
Whatever Mr Lamont says, the exchange market is unlikely quickly to forget
last week's money market confusion. The implicit pressure for lower interest
rates suggests a measure of desperation about the economy somewhere in the
government machine. Lady Thatcher's reported warning of a 'financial
accident' hardly helps. Nor does continuing Maastricht uncertainty, or a
possible Bundesbank decision to tighten policy after next week's review of
Germany's wildly overshooting money supply.
Sterling may thus spend much of the summer close to its wide-band floor
within the ERM. It was there before the election, of course, but not without
periodic worries about the ERM commitment possibly requiring higher interest
rates. That is scant comfort for the equity market, but by now much of the
new economic pessimism must already be in the price.

Wall Street and the dollar continued to influence continental trading,
writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN rose on widespread short-covering ahead of the weekend but there was
little natural buying. The Comit index rose 9.03 to 442.24, down 0.4 per
cent on the week, in turnover estimated at more than Thursday's L98.9bn.
The market was also lifted by technical factors linked to the options expiry
day on Monday and the end of the monthly trading account on Wednesday.
Among industrials, Fiat rose L79 to L5,130 and Montedison was up L40 at
L1,417.
FRANKFURT ended mildly easier, with the FAZ index down 0.65 to 693.85 on the
day, and 0.7 per cent lower on the week, and the DAX closing 3.16 and 1.3
per cent down respectively at 1,754.48. Volume fell from DM4.7bn to DM4.0bn.
Commerzbank hailed this in a weekly report, saying that the bourse had
weathered weakness in Wall Street and the dollar's steep decline.
Speculative stocks moved, Asko rising another DM18 to DM728 for a gain of
DM92 since last Friday - when it fell DM109 on return from suspension.
PARIS eased in thin trading ahead of the four-day Bastille Day weekend. The
CAC 40 index lost 2.40 to 1,859.44, down 1.3 per cent on the week, in
turnover of FFr1.3bn.
The poor weather in France was blamed for the FFr15.90 or 3.9 per cent fall
in the drinks company Pernod Ricard to FFr385.10.
ZURICH rose with the dollar, the SMI index closing 9.8 higher at 1,856.5,
0.7 per cent lower on the week.
SMH registered topped the active list and rose SFr65 to SFr1,325 after two
acquisitions earlier in the week. Roche bearers put on SFr50 to SFr5,250.
OSLO added signs of improved tanker chartering rates to the dollar effect
and the all-share index climbed 3.71 to 396.68, 0.9 per cent higher on the
week.
Uni Storebrand A fell NKr2 to NKr34, depressed by a Norwegian newspaper
report that it was planning a NKr1.4bn equity issue.
STOCKHOLM recovered further in thin trade, the Affarsvarlden General index
closing 12.2 higher at 897.3, still 1.9 per cent lower on the week.
VIENNA fell again with its most actively traded share, the oil company OMV.
The ATX index closed 11.18 lower at at 889.07, 4.7 per cent lower on the
week as OMV dived another Sch47 to Sch737 after Thursday's surprise
resignation of its chairman, Mr Siegfried Meysel, and before OMV announced
heavy losses after hours.
AMSTERDAM gave up its early gains as Wall Street opened lower. The CBS
Tendency index lost 0.1 to 122, down 0.8 per cent on the week.
BRUSSELS saw a 2.4 per cent rise to BFr4,760 in the utility, Electrabel, on
talk of lower interest rates as the Bel-20 index rose 3.63 to 1,171.71,
slightly lower on the week.

FT  11 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Cyclical sectors clear stage for
defensive stocks - The biannual ballet spectacle which calls itself
international equity strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIANNUAL ballet which calls itself international equity strategy is
playing again this year, as the switch between cyclical and defensive stocks
takes place.
On June 8 there were four consumer durables leaders among the top 10
performers in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index - Volkswagen, Pirelli SpA, Volvo
and Philips - and BMW was running a close 11th. On June 30 all of those had
gone, partly because the move to defensive stocks had already begun.
However, the shift was partly structural. Changes in the Eurotrack
constituents brought a number of new contenders into the ring with effect
from June 22. These included Michelin, top performer eight days later, and a
motor industry supplier; Investor, the Swedish investment company at the
heart of the Wallenberg family industrial empire, which owns Saab-Scania and
stakes in a number of other top Swedish companies; and Pryca, the Spanish
supermarket group.
On the German carmakers Mr Keith Hayes, motor industry analyst at Paribas
Capital Markets, notes that a 12 per cent fall in German car sales for May
caught the domestic equity market by surprise. 'Now', he says, 'the focus
has moved on to costs, particularly for Volkswagen which has very ambitious
volume assumptions and would find a drop in volume a threat to its
productivity targets.'
However, June 30 found Michelin, a tyre company, emphatically in top place.
Why? The answer involves, first, a dramatic reduction in the workforce, 16
to 18 per cent of the total in the past two years, and a big reduction in
costs in other areas.
Secondly, the industry has seen fierce price competition in the last five to
six years, particularly in original equipment for the motor industry. Price
increases, however, began with around 16 per cent in the European
replacement market towards the end of last year; and this year there was a 5
to 6 per cent rise in the US after-market.
Next in the top 10 are Asea and Brown Boveri, the Swedish and Swiss-quoted
manifestations of the ABB Asea Brown Boveri group which merged in 1988. Mr
Hayes's colleague, Mr Francis Woollen, says that recession worries brought
their share prices back in the second half of 1991.
Then, last December, Siemens and GEC Alsthom started convincing analysts
that the prospects for power engineering was excellent; and ABB, says Mr
Woollen, is the purest power engineering play.
Roche, the pharmaceuticals company, has shown marked strength since the end
of 1987. A growth stock. Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs liked it in early
June, measuring a 1992 p/e of 16 against an estimated earnings per share
growth rate of 20 per cent per annum over the next five years.
The leaders also take in Investor, a recovery proposition after a painful
end to 1991; St Gobain, in glass, packaging and abrasives, driven by hopes
of a US recovery and higher glass prices; and Pryca, described as over-rated
by Mr Miguel Olabarri of Schroder Securities.
Atlas Copco, in compressed air machinery, is another cyclical but one where
the effects are seen relatively late; Olivetti, a limited antidote for the
depressed Italian market, was lifted by computer industry recovery hopes and
Digital's plan to take a 10 per cent stake in the company; and Sandoz
combined cyclical recovery prospects in chemicals with the defensive
qualities of its pharmaceutical products.
Six Italian companies feature in the bottom 10, reflecting a six-month fall
of 10.6 per cent in Milan's Comit index over the period against a 4.5 per
cent gain for Europe, excluding the UK, in the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
One of the most painful losers was Stet, the telecommunications group, which
fund managers had seen as a safer way to maintain a stake in Italy when
other avenues, like Fiat, looked distinctly dangerous.
Stet's defensive qualities, however, were little protection when the whole
market became an open wound. It is joined in the bottom 10 by its Spanish
equivalent, Telefonica, which performed well last autumn after bullish
presentations in Tokyo, London and New York; but the move of Telefonica's
pension fund into the Spanish social security system involved a huge
increase in the fund for already retired staff, rises in personnel expenses
for active staff, and the question of how much the company would have to
pay.
This matter has been resolved and most analysts are sure that telecoms will
not feature in the bottom 10 in six months' time. A recent European strategy
note from Baring Securities, pushing defensive stocks as a short term
strategy, has both Stet and Telefonica in its buy list.
Right at the bottom lies Skandia, the Swedish insurance company, a victim of
takeover rivalry between its Nordic neighbours, Uni Storebrand in Sweden and
Hafnia and Denmark, which resulted in stalemate and a potential overhang of
around 43 per cent of the Skandia equity. The free shares have recently
fallen to a 39 per cent discount against estimated net assets.
Last, but not quite least, a Mickey Mouse company. Euro-Disney produced
figures for its first 50 days of trading after a spate of rumours, gave a
profit warning, postponed by a year the opening of a second theme park on
its site near Paris and disclosed admission figures which cast doubt on its
prospectus traffic assumptions.
Traffic, in fact, is a painful word. More recently, French farmers blocked
entry into the Euro Disney park; and French lorry drivers went further,
bringing roads to a standstill and ensuring that tourists would have to be
extremely determined before taking a trip to Euro Disney in early July.

FT  11 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases on
arbitrage-related selling
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE-related selling left the Nikkei average marginally lower, after a
brief rise above 17,000 for the first time since mid-June, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 64.94 lower at 16,783.72, 0.4 per cent up on the week. It
rose sharply in the morning in trading related to the July options expiry,
reaching a day's high of 17,023.89, but profit taking and arbitrage-related
selling brought it back to a low of 16,715.58 in the afternoon.
Volume rose to 310m shares from 258m. Some 150m shares changed hands in the
first hour of trading on option related activity. Declines led advances by
499 to 401 with 188 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
fell 1.35 to 1,283.58 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.96 to
1,009.46.
Dealers took profits on theme stocks. Institutional investors were absent,
citing the lack of commitment from authorities to support the stock market
as well as the slumping economy. Traders said that investors wanted to wait
until Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, came back from his European
trip next week.
Fuji Heavy Industries, the most active stock of the day, rose Y9 to Y395 as
dealers tried to promote the 'mergers and acquisitions' theme; small car
companies, active this week on speculation that they may become takeover
targets as they face a profits squeeze due to the slump in the auto market,
saw Suzuki Motor fall Y4 to Y805 on profit taking.
Raito Kogyo, a civil engineering company, fell by its daily limit of Y400 to
Y2,130. Reports that the company was involved in substandard construction in
a domestic dam project triggered heavy selling. The company later said that
while a reconstruction would cost Y100m, forecast earnings figures would be
met.
High-technology blue chips were mixed. NEC advanced Y14 to Y854, but
Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y10 to Y1,300. Traders said despite the
declines of some issues, pension funds buying orders at cheaper levels
indicated underlying support.
Isetan, the department store fell Y80 to Y1,500. The Tokyo Stock Exchange
announced that the stock would be placed under daily surveillance due to its
volatile price movements. Isetan's price has been unstable due to rumours of
financial troubles at Shuwa, the land and stock speculator and Isetan's
leading shareholder.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 82.04 to 19,370.02 in volume of 9.9m
shares.
Roundup
WALL STREET gave most of the region a boost.
HONG KONG saw bargain hunting as the Hang Seng index jumped 55.84 to
5,981.36, still 1.3 per cent lower on the week. Turnover stayed
comparatively low at HKDollars 3.34bn, up from HKDollars 2.46bn.
Brokers said that many retail investors switched to second and third liners.
MANILA recovered, the composite index ending 40.76 higher at 1,476.28,
almost unchanged on the week, although the rally was described as technical.
Turnover climbed from 243.3m to 305.5m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR extended Thursday's surge on strong index-linked and
speculative buying, volume rising from 69.4m to 95m shares as the KLSE
composite index rose 7.85 to 611.57, 2.6 per cent higher on the week.
SINGAPORE was dominated by trading in Malaysian stocks, and the Straits
Times Industrial index, 6.03 higher on the day at 1,487.05, ended a mere
fraction up on the week.
NEW ZEALAND ignored Wall Street as selling in Fletcher Challenge dragged the
NZSE-40 index down by 10.87 to 1,566.92, 1.0 per cent higher on the week.
Fletcher, New Zealand's biggest company, ended 9 cents lower at NZDollars
3.48 in light volume, much of the pressure coming late in the day.

US equities were narrowly mixed in slow, summer trading, writes Karen Zagor
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 6.48 higher at 3,330.56 in volume of
less than 167m shares. Other market indices also posted gains, with the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 0.39 at 414.62 and the Nasdaq composite rising 2.96
to 567.71. On Thursday, the Dow climbed 30.80 to 3,324.08.
The stock market's reaction to a favourable inflation report, based on the
June producer price index, was muted. The index advanced 0.2 per cent over
the month. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the core PPI
rate fell by 0.1 per cent - the first decline in the core index since
February 1987.
The beginning of the second quarter result season has started to have an
impact on Wall Street.
Among featured issues, Conner Peripherals, which makes Winchester disk
drives, climbed dollars 1 1/4 to dollars 20 3/8 in active trading.  The
company reported second quarter net income of 77 cents a share, up from 45
cents, late on Thursday.
Dallas Semiconductor advanced dollars 1 to a 52-week high of dollars 10 on
stronger-than-expected second quarter net earnings of 18 cents a share
against 16 cents the previous year.
In contrast, Sierra Pacific Resources plunged dollars 5 1/4 to a 52-week low
of dollars 18 1/2 following a cut in its quarterly dividend to 28 cents from
46 cents. The utility group has also said it will restate its earnings from
1980 through 1991 to lower levels.
Shares in British Petroleum tumbled dollars 1 to dollars 47 1/2 in spite of
improved earnings projections from an analyst at Kidder Peabody, who
increased 1993 predictions to dollars 2.75 a share from dollars 2.50.
A number of blue chip stocks were actively traded on the big board including
Glaxo, down dollars 1/8 to dollars 26 7/8, Citicorp, up dollars 3/8 to
dollars 21 1/8 and Philip Morris, off dollars 3/8 to dollars 79 1/8.
Computer issues dominated Nasdaq trading. Apple Computer slid dollars 1/8 to
dollars 45 3/4, Dell Computer rose dollars 1 1/4 to dollars 17 1/2 and
Microsoft advanced dollars 1/2 to dollars 69 1/2.
Unilab tumbled dollars 1 1/8 to dollars 5 1/8 in heavy trading after the
clinical laboratory testing service provider said it would take a second
quarter pre-tax charge of dollars 12m to convert its northern California
billing system. New York-based Unilab also expects revenues in the quarter
to fall below expectations, although it expects them to exceed the previous
year's dollars 51.8m.
Canada
Toronto's share prices ended little changed in moderate trading.
The TSE 300 composite index closed up 7.80 points at 3447.55, for a gain of
27.5 on the week.
Advances led declines by 291 to 237. At 24.5m, the volume of shares traded
was below yesterday's 31.8m, and trading value was CDollars 278.3m against
CDollars 437.8m.

FT  11 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures ended the trading account on a dull note as worries
about the outlook for the UK economy outweighed better than expected figures
on UK inflation, writes Joel Kibazo.
After opening at 2,528 the September contract on the FT-SE drifted lower in
quiet trading to reach 2513 by 10 am. The release of better than forecast UK
inflation figures caused a turnaround in September and sent the contract
forward reaching 2,537 around midday. This proved to be the high for the
session with dealers thereafter focussing on the negative aspects of the
economy. A firm Wall Street had no impact and September eventually closed at
2,509, down 12 on Thursday's close and around 5 points below its fair value
premium to cash of about 25. Turnover reached 7,194 contracts.
Turnover in traded options improved to reach 33,867, against Thursday's
31,998 lots. Volume in the FT-SE option was also better reaching 12,066 lot.
Asda was the busiest stock option with 2,015 total trades while the HSBC
stock option which began trading yesterday recorded 640 trades by the close.

FT  11 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling raid on Costain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK of widespread gloom in the housebuilding and general contracting area
of the market culminated in another bear raid on shares of Costain, the
international construction and mining group. A big slide in Costain stock
was triggered by one US investment bank attempting to unload a large block
of shares into the market.
At one point Costain shares had fallen to 29p, the lowest since 1976 after a
host of bearish stories - all subsequently denied by the company -
circulated in the market. Costain's Hong Kong interests and its Channel
Tunnel operations were all rumoured to have been encountering problems.
Costain shares reached a peak 366p in the autumn of 1987. By the close of
trading yesterday, the shares had rallied to end the day a net 8 down at 30
1/2 p, a fall of almost 21 per cent. Since the start of the year Costain
shares have more than halved.
Mr Tom Slee, Costain's Finance Director, later denied that the group had any
problems with its bankers. The group was also reported as saying the
proposed flotation of its Australian interests was going smoothly.
Fisons setback
End-of-account speculation forced Fisons down to its lowest level for nearly
seven years. Despite the disbelief of many and the insistence of the company
that the speculation was unfounded, the shares slumped 18 to 189p on heavy
turnover of 6.4m.
Dealers were saying that one Sunday newspaper would carry a hard-hitting
story on the pharmaceuticals group. Fisons said yesterday that it had spoken
to the journalist involved and been told that a story had been written on
the new management but the article was positive rather than negative. There
was no assurance that the story would appear this Sunday.
Fisons has languished since a profits warning in mid-June which sent the
shares down 100 points in a day. Analysts said yesterday they saw no
recovery in the price until Opticrom, the company's eye treatment receives
approval for use by the Food and Drug Administration. Opticrom was withdrawn
from the US in 1989 and is now unlikely to be relicensed in time for the US
rag-weed season which starts in August, observers say.
A series of downgrades in the big building stocks continued with Mowlem said
to have been downrated and BZW said to have lowered profit expecations for
Taylor Woodrow. Dealers said BZW had erased their previous Pounds 25m
profits expectation for the group and now looked for the company to do no
better than break even this year. For next year the broker chopped its
previous forecast from Pounds 42m to Pounds 35. Taylor Woodrow shares eased
to 78p.
Racal Electronics was the heaviest traded stock in generally active
electronics/telecoms sector after visits by analysts at least two leading
brokers firms. The shares rose 2 1/2 to 67p on turnover of 12m.
Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W) gave a ready response to a story carried in the
Financial Times Telecoms Markets newsletter suggesting that Mercury, C &amp; W's
telecoms subsidiary is to take a stake in TeleWest, thre UK's largest cable
operator, owned by TeleCommunications of the US and US West. The stock
initially rose to 529p but later dipped to close 3 off at 522p.
Vodafone lost 8 more to 302p but dealers expect the shares to respond to a
series of presentations to institutions expected shortly. Amstrad dropped 1
1/2 to 31 1/2 p with analysts said to be concerned at the company's refusal
to return calls about current trading.
A switch recommendation, out of Barclays and into NatWest, issued by Mr
Derek Chambers, banks specialist at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, saw the former
slip 2 to 320p on 3.7m and the latter move up 7 to 335p on 3.3m.
The Carr analyst reduced his interim profits forecast for Barclays from
Pounds 378m to Pounds 150m and for the full year from Pounds 600m to Pounds
450m. He expects NatWest to achieve profits of Pounds 300m for the interim
period and Pounds 750m for the year.
A host of buy recommendations, notably from Goldman Sachs, Carr Kitcat and
BZW, produced another strong showing from Prudential whose shares ran up a
further 5 to 247p, after 249p, with turnover increasing sharply to 11m.
A growing conviction in the market that not only Japanese investors but also
US institutions are taking a much cooler view of the forthcoming Wellcome
share flotation hit the shares. Wellcome fell 20 to 875p.
Glaxo extended recent gains as SG Warburg Securities repeated its buy
recommendation. The house is looking for profits of Pounds 1,425m for the
year just ended. The shares jumped 22 before settling for a gain of 3 at
710p
Speculation that US investment bank Goldman Sachs had attempted to offload a
10m share stake in ICI gave an opportunity for a bounce of 14 to 1163p. ICI
has been depressed by worries over the possible overhang of stock after
Goldman Sachs acquired 20m shares from Hanson on May 8, reportedly for 1400p
a share. However turnover yesterday was only 2m shares.
Aegis, the holding company for the world's largest group of media buying and
planning specialists, dropped a further 17 to 39p after a sell note from
agency broker James Capel hit clients desks. The shares have fallen from
around 90p in the past week since Capel first slashed its profits forecasts,
initially by Pounds 20m but then adjusting in the note to a cut of Pounds
17m to Pounds 32m for 1992.
Dealers said big institutions were unwilling to touch the stock and that
even small selling was sending the share price down sharply. However, Capel
believes that at 40p the risk-reward equation is balanced and that the
shares are beginning to look attractive.
More gloom descended on an oil sector still affected by the recent slide in
crude oil prices, a weak dollar and a host of profit downgrades as Shell
hosted a presentation to analysts.
The Shell presentation was described as 'bearish' by one analyst who said
the company had spoken of inexorably rising costs in the North Sea
operations which were putting pressure on profits.
Shell shares reacted predictably to the gloomy news from the presentation,
delivered in London, and fell 9 1/2 to 482 1/2 p on keen turnover of 4.2m.
There was no let up in the selling pressure on BP. Overnight selling in the
US, resulting from the series of UK broker downgrades on Thursday, and a
constant flow of selling orders from UK institutions left the stock a
further 6 weaker at 203 1/2 p with turnover a hefty 16m shares. Enterprise
Oil, also upset by recent broker downgrades, fell 7 to 378p.
Food retailer Argyll gained on a reported recommendation from Hoare Govett
ahead of the group's annual meeting next Wednesday. Dealers said Hoare
argued that Argyll's current trading was going well and expected the
company's agm statement to be upbeat. The shares gained 8 to 357p on
turnover of 1.7m.
Shares in engineering group Vickers recovered from earlier weakness that
followed a Smith New Court deal in which the broker bought a block of around
3.8m shares at 129p and sold it at 131p. Having shed 1 1/2 p to 132 1/2 p,
the shares recovered to end at 134p, unchanged on turnover of 8.5m shares.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Dollars 160m Saudi sale
savages silver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Commercial Bank of Jeddah has once again stolen the headlines
in the London bullion market - this time with a huge sale of silver.
The private Saudi Arabian bank, which has close links with the royal family,
is thought by some traders to have sold between 40m and 50m troy ounces, or
1,244 tonnes, worth Dollars 160m in two hours on Tuesday. Only such an
amount could have knocked the price from Dollars 4.06 an ounce down to the
year's low of Dollars 3.82, they argue.
The bank itself denies that it sold so much. An NCB official told Reuters on
Wednesday that the sale was less than 20m ounces and was 'a purely
commercial transaction' on behalf of big Saudi clients.
However, traders immediately linked the sale with the announcement of the
resignation of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the bank's deputy general manager
and chief operating officer. He was indicted in the US last week on charges
related to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Sheikh
Khalid has described the charges as 'completely unwarranted and without
justification.'
Separately, it emerged on Thursday that he had been fined Dollars 170m by
the US Federal Reserve Board for violations of US banking law. Dealers were
quick to point out that, as one put it, this week's sale 'fits the fine.'
Analysts believe the market will take some time to absorb such an amount of
silver, which is equivalent to more than 10 per cent of annual worldwide
demand. The metal closed yesterday at 3.94 a troy ounce, down 11 cents on
the week having recovered about 50 per cent of Tuesday's fall. Some dealers
were surprised yesterday when the price hit a high of Dollars 3.98, pointing
out that the Dollars 4 mark was likely to make a tough near-term target.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that
the NCB hit the gold market in a similar way in March 1990, selling 100
tonnes and driving the price down by Dollars 20 to Dollars 368 a troy ounce
in a few hours. Then the market had reacted similarly, quickly recovering
about 50 per cent of the fall as it searched for direction.
Gold yesterday moved above Dollars 350 on the London market as speculators
tried to push Comex up ahead of yesterday's expiry of August options with a
put price at that level.
But the London afternoon fix was Dollars 348.70, and the market closed at
Dollars 348.45 - still a rise of Dollars 2.45 on the week. Most of that rise
was accounted for on Wednesday on relief that the NCB had not sold gold
again. Sentiment remains bullish, however, and another test of Dollars 350
cannot be ruled out next week.
On the London Metal Exchange most attention has been directed towards the
copper market, where the justification for high prices (three-month metal
has been trading above Dollars 2,500 a tonne) has been questioned.
Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest
mining group, said in Tokyo on Wednesday that he was surprised by some
copper price forecasts as there was no evidence of the recession ending and
he thought it unlikely that the metal would reach Dollars 1.50 a lb. Mr Paul
Hansen, president of the Highland Valley Copper company in Canada, said
there was not enough underlying demand for the market to maintain its
momentum. 'North America and Japan are still mired in recession and we
really don't see the fundamentals in place at this point.'
This week's upward move peaked on Thursday with cash metal closing at Pounds
1,332.50 a tonne in spite of the completion of a new labour contract by
Asarco, one of the big US producers, and in spite of the widely expected
news of a strike from July 20 at Poland's giant KGHM combine.
Yesterday the reaction set in, and cash copper shed Pounds 38 to close at
Pounds 1,294.50, down Pounds 18 on the week.
Both London's robusta coffee and cocoa prices have moved ahead this week,
September coffee closing up Dollars 69 on the week at Dollars 776 a tonne
yesterday, and September cocoa up Pounds 24 at a two-month high of Pounds
614 a tonne. Cocoa has risen mainly on the continued absence of sales from
countries of origin, particularly the Ivory Coast, which appears to be
waiting for the outcome of the Geneva talks on a new international pact.
The improvement in coffee appears to be mainly technical, and dealers expect
a limited trading range ahead of the next talks on a new coffee pact in
London at the end of the month.

FT  11 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Account closes with renewed losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORAY into the FT-SE 2,500-plus territory proved only too brief yesterday
and the UK stock market ended the two week trading account firmly on the
downward path again. Good news on domestic inflation had been largely
discounted and served only to depress shares in the retail store companies
which have been forced to trim prices in the face of weak demand.
In very early trading, the market was ahead by more than nine points for a
Footsie reading of 2,507.0. The mood was brightened by the 30 point gain in
the Dow Industrial Average overnight. But the buying orders in London
represented little more than the final fling of the bear-closers, needing
stock to meet previous selling commitments. Once these technical traders had
finished, the market was left to the mercy of the depressing economic and
corporate background, enlivened in places by some highly speculative
features.
The FT-SE Index closed down 7.1 at 2,490.8, moving uneasily in late trading
as Wall Street made a slow start to the new trading session. SG Warburg
Securities cut its year-end forecast for the Footsie from 2,900 to 2,750
yesterday.
News that the UK June Retail Price Index had risen by only an annualised 3.9
per cent helped government bonds for a while but gilt-edged stocks were
shading easier at the close.
Although it lost only 6.3 last week, the Footsie has shed 43.3 points, or
1.7 per cent over the two week trading account. Investors' confidence has
been shaken by downgradings of corporate profit forecasts by brokerage
houses and by a flow of misfortunes in the new issue market, ranging from
the price reduction of the MFI issue and the failure of The Telegraph share
sale.
The rally prompted by bear-closers towards the end of the week has been
strengthened significantly by heavy demand from the US for the
pharmaceutical leaders; Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham have risen sharply -
but not Wellcome, whose share placing closes in a fortnight. Some US funds
are believed to have turned firmly against the Wellcome placing and are
applying funds once earmarked for Wellcome to increasing weighting elsewhere
in the sector.
Seaq volume moved higher yesterday, totalling 519.5m shares compared with
487m on Thursday, when retail business climbed above the Pounds 1bn mark for
the first time this account.
Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained at very low levels
this week as investors have shied away from a nervous market.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling fails to gain from RPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING had another very volatile day on the foreign exchanges yesterday,
sandwiched between a strengthening D-Mark and good UK inflation figures for
June, writes James Blitz.
In morning trading, the British currency dropped to a low of DM2.8667
against the D-Mark. Sterling sellers were partly taking account of a new
round of losses for the dollar in overnight trading in Asia, which took the
US currency down to a low of DM1.4945.
Compounding this were fears that the Bundesbank council will tighten
monetary policy at its meeting on Thursday. M3 money supply, a key gauge of
future inflation prospects, has been holding at an annual rate of 9 per cent
for five months, overshooting the Bundesbank's target ceiling of 5.5 per
cent.
These fears were temporarily put to one side at around lunchtime, when the
retail price index for June showed that the headline inflation rate had
dropped to 3.9 per cent, its lowest level for 8 months. As the figure came
out, traders reported a big buying order for sterling from Germany. The
inflation figure also allowed Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, to
reiterate his commitment to the European Monetary System, after a week of
growing speculation that Britain might unilaterally devalue.
The currency was also helped by rumours in the market that the Bank of
England had intervened to support the pound. But the rally petered out
towards the end of trading and sterling closed  3/4 of a pfennig down on the
day at DM2.8725. Against the dollar, it closed higher at Dollars 1.9215 from
a previous close of Dollars 1.8965.
The dollar edged lower in late European trading with operators again
becoming bearish about its future trend after the see-saw movements in
dollar/D-Mark that dominated the week.
The June US producer price index helped keep alive suggestions that the
Federal Reserve could ease interest rates again. The index rose an expected
0.2 per cent, but the core rate, excluding food and energy, fell 0.1 per
cent, the first decline in this measure since February 1987. By the end of
European trading, the dollar was down to DM1.4955 from a previous close of
DM1.5190. In late American trading, the US currency was slightly softer at
DM1.4952.
The D-Mark ended stronger against most European currencies yesterday. It
closed up against the lira at L757.3 compared to a previous close of L756.6.
The Bank of Italy sold DM53m at the midday currency fixing in a bid to ease
pressure on the Italian currency. But the lira is still reaping strength
from the recent rise in the Italian discount rate. The D-Mark also closed a
shade firmer against the French franc, closing at FFr3.377 compared to a
previous close of FFr3.373.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Short dates firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORTER dated cash rates in the sterling money markets ended slightly firmer
yesterday after dealers had difficulty removing a shortage of Pounds 500m
forecast by the Bank of England.
Although the shortage was, for the second day running, a good deal smaller
than had been anticipated, a number of technical factors made it a sticky
day in the market. Dealers believe that next week will see another round of
big shortages, encouraging them to hold on to paper now. There was also a
repeat of the common problem with middle-sized shortages: namely, that
dealers in one discount house are often waiting for the others to remove it,
and in the end, nobody does. As a result, the Bank ended the day providing
late assistance of around Pounds 360m.
In the morning, shorter dated money softened slightly as the shortage was
declared. Adding to confidence was the good news on the retail prices index,
with inflation falling to its lowest level for eight months after a sharp
fall to 3.9 per cent in June. In the afternoon, rates firmed, however:
1-week money ended at 10 1/8 per cent from a previous close of 9 7/8 per
cent and 1-month money ending unchanged at 10 1/16 per cent.
Longer dated rates ended softer, swayed by hopes that the RPI figures will
make a base rate cut more likely in the more distant future. Compounding
this was a more stable performance from sterling on the foreign exchanges
after two days of heavy losses. 3-month money ended the day softer at 10
1/32 per cent from 10 1/16 per cent, 6-month money remained unchanged at 10
per cent and 1-year money was at 9 7/8 per cent, down from 9 15/16 per cent.
Trading in sterling futures plotted a similar trajectory to the cash
markets, with the September contract rising to a high of 90.20 following
news of the inflation figure. But in the afternoon, confidence petered out,
and the contract ended down four ticks from its previous close, at 90.08.
The December contract ended down 3 ticks from its previous close at 90.37.

FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y takes CDollars 1.4bn
write-down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK has wiped out its entire equity by writing down the value of
its property portfolio and other investments by CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars
1.2bn).
The write-downs, which do not include the Canary Wharf project in London's
Docklands, pushed the ailing Toronto-based property developer to a CDollars
2.1bn loss for the year ended January, 1992, compared to a CDollars 359m
loss in the previous 12 months. The loss is among the biggest ever recorded
by a Canadian company.
O&amp;Y's investment in Canary Wharf is carried on its books at a cost of almost
CDollars 3.6bn. But auditors, Price Waterhouse, said in a note qualifying
the accounts that the value of the project, which was put into
administration on May 28, has been 'materially impaired'.
The financial statements released yesterday mark the first time that the
once-secretive O&amp;Y has made such information public.
The Reichmann family, which owns the company, previously shared only an
abridged version of the accounts with their main bankers in O&amp;Y's offices.
O&amp;Y filed for court protection from its creditors in Canada on May 14 and is
in talks to restructure the bulk of its CDollars 13.5bn debt. It is due to
present a debt-restructuring plan by August 21.
Gerald Greenwald, named president three months ago, said at a press
conference yesterday the company will in future publish quarterly
statements. He said results for the first quarter of fiscal 1993 will
include an 'appropriate' writedown on Canary Wharf.
Mr Greenwald confirmed that the Reichmanns are still trying to put together
an investors group to provide the capital needed to complete Canary Wharf.
He declined to give further details, except to say that some investors have
expressed interest.
Mr Greenwald said O&amp;Y has three immediate objectives: to complete the
debt-restructuring; to form the Canary Wharf investors group; and to hold
down operating costs. He expressed confidence that the value of its assets
will improve over time 'to the benefit of lenders and shareholders'.
According to the financial statements, O&amp;Y had a shareholders deficiency of
CDollars 134m on January 31, against equity of CDollars 2.1bn a year
earlier.
The company estimates, however, the 'real market value' of its properties is
CDollars 2.3bn more than their book value. Mr Greenwald said the balance
sheet also does not do justice to O&amp;Y's continuing 'franchise value' as a
respected developer and landlord.
Revenues fell to CDollars 5.5bn in the latest fiscal year from CDollars
6.2bn. But there was a small rise in rental income. The operating loss
widened to CDollars 641m from CDollars 205m, while cash flow from operations
shrank to CDollars 77m from CDollars 583m.
Less than half the CDollars 1.4bn in write-downs relates to O&amp;Y's property
investments. The write-down on its buildings in the US and Canada is only
CDollars 218m, with the value of preference shares in affiliated property
companies cut by CDollars 335m.
The rest of the write-downs relate largely to investments in resource
companies, such as newsprint maker Abitibi-Price, energy producer Gulf
Canada Resources and Santa Fe Energy Resources.

into Continental Air

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BANKRUPTCY court hearing has been set for July 22, at which a proposal
from an investor group, headed by Charles Hurwitz, to invest Dollars 350m in
Continental Airlines, when the carrier emerges from bankruptcy, will be
considered. The proposal would give the investor group a 72 per cent equity
stake in return for the capital infusion.
Mr Hurwitz heads Maxxam group, a Houston-based company which acquired a
range of industrial interests with the help of junk bond financing in the
1980s. The proposal to help finance a reorganisation of the heavily-indebted
airline is being made in conjunction with Kidder, Peabody, the Wall Street
investment bank, and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage.
The Hurwitz proposal has the backing of Continental's creditors committee,
but must still overcome various other hurdles. It could be topped by better
bids - Continental has had talks with numerous US and foreign airlines in
recent months - and requires bankruptcy court approval.
Continental must also resolve difficulties with the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the federal agency which has argued that Continental is
responsible for Dollars 700m of unfunded pension liabilities at Eastern
Airlines. Eastern, now defunct, was Continental's sister airline, both being
previously owned by Mr Frank Lorenzo.
Continental sought bankruptcy protection in late-1990, and filed a
reorganisation plan earlier this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE SENIOR executives of a subsidiary of the Hafnia insurance group were
dismissed yesterday after management had discovered fresh irregularities.
Hafnia, Denmark's second largest insurance group, has teetered on the brink
of collapse for the past two weeks following steep declines in the value of
its strategic shareholdings in domestic rival Baltica and Swedish insurance
company Skandia.
A week ago a group deputy general manager was dismissed when he was found to
have committed the group to share transactions, of which the board was not
aware, causing a loss of DKr350m (Dollars 60.2m).
Yesterday the group dismissed three managers at Hafnia Trust &amp; Investment
Bank when it found that they had failed to report shareholdings of more than
5 per cent in four listed companies to the stock exchange, thus ignoring
disclosure legislation.
On Thursday Hafnia Holding, the parent company, reported shareholdings in
six listed companies to the stock exchange which had not previously been
disclosed.
Hafnia also reported that its 1991 published losses of DKr1.2bn were
improperly reduced when a block of shares was sold at a price above stock
market value. The share transaction reduced the year's loss by around
DKr200m.
Despite these disclosures, institutional investors have agreed to guarantee
a rights share issue raising DKr2bn for Hafnia. The issue was launched this
week. The group's banks have also agreed to meet its liquidity requirements.
On July 2, the group reported that its equity capital was negative, but in
yesterday's statement to the stock exchange it said that no new transactions
requiring additional loss provisions have been found.

FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank acquires 30% stake
in Gerling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's largest bank, has taken a 30 per cent stake in
Gerling, Germany's largest privately-owned insurance group which in the
current year is expected to generate group gross premiums of around DM11bn
(Dollars 7.2bn).
The bank gave no clue as to the price of the purchase, although Bob Yates at
London stockbrokers Fox-Pitt Kelton said the likely outlay for a transaction
of this size would be between DM1.5bn and DM2bn.
Deutsche Bank said simply that it was buying the stake in order to ensure
that the Cologne-based insurance company retained its character as the sole
family-owned internationally-active German insurance company.
It added that the transaction would allow Gerling to strengthen its role as
an independent partner to German industry, a hint at the problems the
insurance company has been experiencing in the fiercely competitive German
industrial markets.
From the sparse text of the announcement, it seems likely that Deutsche Bank
will in the short-term treat the shareholding as a financial investment.
The bank set up its own life subsidiary, DB Leben, in 1989, saying that such
personal business was a natural extension of its investment services.
But so far, Deutsche Bank has steered clear of combining a fully-fledged
insurance business with its banking activities.
For several years, Deutsche Bank has participated in a joint venture with
Gerling, selling life products via industrial companies. It has
traditionally directed reinsurance business to Gerling. Analysts speculate
that Deutsche Bank could hope to sell Gerling's products to its own
industrial clients; they do not rule out a full takeover in the long-run be
ruled out.
The Gerling group is at present wholly owned by Rolf Gerling, the son of the
late Hans Gerling, the insurance entrepreneur who built up the business
before the Second World War, rebuilt it after the war, lost control as a
result of the company's involvement in the collapse of Bankhaus Herstatt in
1974, and bought back majority control from Friedrich Karl Flick, the
industrialist, in December 1985. Mr Hans Gerling died last year.
Gerling itself made no comment as to why the stake was being sold. In
1990-91, the Gerling group generated gross premium income of over DM8bn and
net profit was DM65.9m.

FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: Elf, Sumitomo in Dollars 5bn gas
study
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELF Aquitaine, the French oil group and Sumitomo, the Japanese trading
company, have launched a feasibility study for a joint Dollars 5bn gas
liquefaction and distribution project at one of the world's biggest gas
fields, in Qatar.
They expect to start deliveries to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea at the end
of the century from Qatar's North Field, which is big enough to to provide
the Gulf emirate with large amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the
next 200 years. Construction is due to start in 1996.
Last year, Qatar attributed part of the North Field to Elf, representing an
estimated 200bn cubic metres out of total reserves of between 4,500bn and
6,000bn cubic metres. The deal allowed Elf to supply 4m tonnes of LNG per
year for 25 years.
LNG still accounts for only a small percentage of world gas output. But it
is expected to grow fast in the next few years in response to the growing
environmental pressure for cleaner energy.
The Elf-Sumitomo feasibility study will take up to 18 months and cover the
construction of a plant in Qatar, tanker shipments to the Far East and the
possibility of inviting other partners to help shoulder the costs.
Elf, which is state-controlled, is to be operator of the project, which
covers offshore production and liquefaction at a plant, to be based at the
Ras Laffan industrial site.
Sumitomo will be in charge of project finance and shipping and will will try
to strike gas sales contracts with Japanese electricity utilities, needed
before the project can start. Its financial strength makes Sumitomo a
suitable partner for a project of this size, with its long lead time before
the first sales.
LNG delivery prices are agreed in advance with the buyers, unlike in the oil
industry where prices are set after production. However, oil analysts
estimate that Qatar's first LNG supply contract, signed in February 1991,
under which Japan's Chubu Electrical Power is to buy 4m tonnes per year, is
worth Dollars 630m annually. This gives an indicator of the possible value
of the Elf-Sumitomo project.
Most of Japanese utilities are already committed until the end of the
decade, which is one reason why Qatar has been slow to find takers for
long-term contracts. But energy analysts expect Japan's gas needs to grow as
its nuclear energy expansion slows.
Japan is also expected to import LNG from south-east Asia, other Middle East
producers and Alaska. There has been talk of developing gas supplies from
the Russian Far East.

profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian oil group which the government is planning to merge with
the Verbundgesellschaft utility, expects to make a positive operating profit
this year.
The company said it would make operating losses of around Sch500m (Dollars
47.2m) for the first half of 1992 but would end the year with a
significantly positive result.
Wolfgang Ruttensdorfer, finance director, said the final figures for the
half-year were not yet available but he expected OMV's second-quarter
performance to match the first when an operating loss of Sc247m was
incurred.
Richard Schenz, who has just replaced outgoing OMV chairman Siegfried Meysel
as interim company chairman, said he expected the company's performance to
improve in the second half.
Mr Schenz said a two-pronged cost-cutting programme attacking unnecessary
investment and personal costs was under discussion by the company's
supervisory board.
The company still plans to undertake a Sch6bn investment programme this
year, to be mainly financed from cash-flow, Mr Ruttensdorfer said.
The company's energy operations, suffering from bad oil refining profit
margins, had poor results in April and May. But there was a significant
improvement in profitability in OMV's energy operations in June.
Results at OMV's petrochemicals and chemicals areas remained 'unchanged and
negative', Mr Ruttensdorfer said.
Plans to merge OMV with Verbund are part of the process of reorganising
Austria's state-owned industrial companies. If it goes ahead, the deal would
create an energy group with a turnover in excess of Sch85bn.

<TEXT>
A 17-MONTH quest by Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa to take full control
of Cavendish International ended yesterday when the company's shareholders
approved a HK5.50-a-share offer.
An extraordinary general meeting voted 96 per cent in favour of the offer
which valued Cavendish at HKDollars 16bn (USDollars 2.07bn) and required an
outlay of HKDollars 5.8bn by Hutchison for the 36.63 per cent of the company
it did not already own.
Hutchison first bid for Cavendish in February last year. But, in a rare
upset for Mr Li, shareholders rejected the then offer of HKDollars 4.10 a
share.
Cavendish was formed in 1987 to act as a holding company for some of Mr Li's
property and energy interests. Aside from property, it owns a third of
Hongkong Electric and 24.5 per cent of Husky Oil of Canada.
Although the current offer was still well below Cavendish's net asset value
of around HKDollars 6.40 a share, the strength of the Hong Kong stock market
allied to Cavendish's under-performance left investors little option but to
take the money and run.

FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: C and W talks with US West threaten BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE AND WIRELESS, the telecommunications group, is negotiating to sell a
stake in its Mercury Communications subsidiary to US West, the North
American telephone company, for several hundred million pounds and a stake
in TeleWest, US West's cable television joint venture in the UK.
The deal would create a formidable alliance to challenge the dominance of
British Telecommunications in the UK. TeleWest, which provides local
telephone services would link up with Mercury's long-distance network.
Advisers to both groups said the talks, which have been led by Lord Young,
chairman of C and W, and Mr Dick Callahan, president of US West
International, were likely to be lengthy.
The move is part of C and W's strategy to seek partnerships with
international telecommunication companies for specific projects following
the break down of talks earlier this year with American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph to form a global alliance.
US West was one of the groups formed following the break up of AT&amp;T in 1984.
Although C and W refused to comment on the negotiations yesterday, Lord
Young, said recently: 'We are in talks with everyone about the possibility
of establishing individual partnerships over individual projects.'
TeleWest is a joint venture between US West and TeleCommunications, the US
cable television group. It is the largest UK cable operator with 17
franchises serving 2.9m homes.
As part of a deal with C and W, TeleWest would buy more cable franchises.
US West and C and W have already pooled their interests in personal
communications networks, the next generation of mobile communications.
Advisers said this deal brought the two groups closer together and paved the
way for the current negotiations.
The Department of Trade and Industry and Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator, are thought to be sympathetic to a deal because it would lead to
more vigorous competition for BT.
But US West may need to receive permission from the US regulatory
authorities to take a stake in Mercury because it holds an international
licence.

<TEXT>
OCEANA, the South African-controlled investment company, expressed regret in
its annual report yesterday that the management of Etam, the fashion
retailer for which it made an unsuccessful hostile bid last year, was not
co-operating with it.
In his statement in the report, Mr Stanley Lewis, Oceana's chairman, said:
'Our only regret is that we have thus far been unable to persuade the board
of Etam to meet and discuss how our experience and expertise through board
representation can be made available. This is disappointing.'
Oceana launched a bid for Etam in June last year, but only managed to raise
its stake to 34.4 per cent.
Etam resisted the bid, and has requested the Financial Reporting Review
Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog, to inspect the accounts.
As predicted in its preliminary statement earlier this year, Oceana has used
equity accounting to include 34.4 per cent of Etam's profits for the second
half on its own profit and loss account.
The accounting policies state that it is Oceana's policy to equity account
for earnings and tangible net assets for its investments in Etam, as well as
two other companies, Gioma and Handbags. It has changed its policies to
writing goodwill off immediately against reserves. It has written off Pounds
17m in goodwill in the year to March 31, leaving an unrealised gain of
Pounds 9.8m which has not been credited to the revaluation reserve.

Technology
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest personal computer
manufacturer, has decided unilaterally to terminate its distribution
contract with Technology, a leading UK personal computer reseller which was
acquired last week by ICL.
A second large computer manufacturer, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of
the US, will not renew its contract with the UK distributor in view of the
takeover, but is continuing to supply it without contract until the end of
September.
An urgent meeting has been arranged between Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman,
and Mr Geoffrey Shingles, DEC (UK) managing director, to resolve the
situation.
Mr Derek Lewis, chairman and chief executive of Technology, said IBM had
decided to terminate the contract without discussion. He believed IBM was
wrong to do so and the company would be contesting the decision legally.
He said he was surprised by IBM's response to the change of ownership
although he had been aware that the controversial nature of the takeover
could cause problems with his existing suppliers. It would have meant that
ICL would have been marketing rival products in competition with its own.
ICL bought Technology for about Pounds 30m with the intention of becoming
the largest supplier of pcs in the UK, ahead of the US makers IBM, Compaq
and Dell. Technology's suppliers include Compaq and Toshiba of Japan. Mr
Lewis said he understood that ICPI, a wholly-owned IBM subsidiary would be
happy to supply Technology with its products.
ICL, which is based in the UK but owned by Fujitsu of Japan, has remained
profitable throughout the recession while IBM's revenues and profits have
declined.
IBM was not available last night to discuss the severance of the contract.

FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Molins settles six-year US patent
infringement suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOLINS, the tobacco machinery maker, said yesterday that it had agreed a
settlement in a six-year US patent infringement suit, the roots of which lie
with the company's pioneering work on flexible manufacturing systems (FMS)
in the 1960s.
Molins has agreed terms with Cincinnati Milacron, one of the biggest US
machine tool makers and one of the principal defendants in a lawsuit based
on the exploitation of a system fundamental to factory automation  - the
centrally-controlled linkage of different machine tools.
Although terms were not disclosed, Molins said it considered the outcome of
its negotiations with Milacron to be satisfactory, justifying 'the
confidence which it has consistently expressed in the strength of its legal
position.'
Molins' royalties fight has been overshadowed in the past four years by five
attempts from hostile shareholders to win control. Last night, the company
said the deal would not have a major impact on its profits, but did involve
an unspecified payment.
The settlement with Milacron comes a few weeks after the death of Dr 'Theo'
Williamson, who pioneered the development of numerically-controlled machine
tools while working with Ferranti, before joining Molins in 1961.
At Molins he developed System 24, which was launched in 1967 and linked
tasks previously carried out by separate machine tools. In the early 1970s,
however, Molins pulled out of research and development of System 24, and let
all its FMS lapse except those covering the US.
Since 1986, Molins has been trying to enforce its FMS patents in the US
courts. Litigation is continuing with other defendants, principally Kearney
&amp; Trecker, the US machine tool company now owned by Giddings &amp; Lewis, and a
number of German machine tool suppliers.
In 1991, Molins had a trading profit of Pounds 300,000, on sales of Pounds
3.3m, in its 'other activities' - license income, the net cost of its
research centre, and several small business ventures.
It is actively pursuing its licensing programme, and last year granted
licences to two non-US users of FMS Equipment, Mercedes-Benz and Fanuc, for
the import into the US of FMS-made goods. The German and Japanese companies
joined FMS users such as Ford, Caterpillar and General Motors, and machine
tool makers Litton Industries and Mandelli, in negotiating licences with
Molins.

FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: What everyone wants is a partner for Green
 -The background to Amber Day's recent share slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A MAN at bay, Mr Philip Green is remarkably chirpy. The chairman and
chief executive of Amber Day has seen shares in his discount retailing chain
collapse in recent months, reducing its market value from Pounds 157m to
Pounds 51m.
Mr Green, 40, is an ebullient character who elicits strong responses - both
positive and negative. He left school at 16 and built his fortune in the
clothes trade, selling the jeans company Jean Jeanie to Lee Cooper in the
mid-1980s. He owns 7.7 per cent of Amber Day, a stake which has reduced in
value by Pounds 8m.
The collapse follows a series of bear raids and stories in some Sunday
newspapers and Private Eye, which have made hostile comments about Mr
Green's business associates, commercial deals - and even the financial
affairs of his wife.
Mr Green says these criticisms were scrutinised by his advisers, bankers
Samuel Montagu, stockbrokers Smith New Court and auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, and he has been able to reassure them on all points.
However, bears were given something more substantial into which to get their
teeth last month, when Amber Day downgraded profit expectations and
announced the departure of its finance director and only non-executive
director, both within a year of joining the company.
The downgrade came because sales were running below budget at What Everyone
Wants, the Glasgow-based discount chain which Amber Day bought for Pounds
46.7m in 1990.
Analysts reduced their profits forecast for the year to August 2 from more
than Pounds 14m to below Pounds 12m. That is still ahead of last year's
figure of Pounds 10.1m, which itself was triple the previous year's level.
Mr Green had been criticised over the lack of consultation and irregularity
of board meetings by Mr Leslie Warman, the former Lloyds Merchant Bank
director. Mr Warman was appointed as non-executive director at the time of
last summer's Pounds 24.4m rights issue, at the behest of the institutions.
Mr Green said Mr Graham Coles, the finance director, was headhunted by a
bigger company, First Leisure, and the timing of the announcements was an
unfortunate coincidence.
However, an adviser to the company said: 'What upset the finance director
and non-executive was that Philip Green was running around doing all these
deals without letting them know what was going on. But we are satisfied that
these deals have been done for the benefit of the company.'
Mr Green said: 'Amber Day is not a one-man band, but you do have to be very
hands-on in this business.'
Mr Green certainly proved too hands-on for the founders of What Everyone
Wants (WEW), Mr Gerald Weisfeld and his wife, Vera. Although they agreed to
stay on the board of Amber Day for two years after selling their company,
the Weisfelds resigned after nine months and sold their 16 per cent stake
following policy disagreements.
Despite this alarming turnover at boardroom level, Mr Green has kept almost
all of WEW's 2,000 employees. His financial advisers and employees in
Glasgow pay glowing tribute to the way he has enhanced the performance of
WEW's 54 stores, which are mainly in Scotland and the north of England.
Watching Mr Green going into his main store in Glasgow's Argyll Street is to
see a man in his element. He knows the supervisors by name and immediately
starts quizzing them about which lines are moving and criticising the
display of some items.
Mr Green has appointed five regional managers and is installing a labelling
system which will give weekly reports of stocks and sales in every store.
Ms Elaine Gray, Amber Day's buying director, joined the Weisfelds straight
from school. She said: 'In the old days, we were flying by the seat of our
pants. On Mondays we used to get an overall stock figure - but no breakdown
of what lines were selling where.'
Both Mr Green and Ms Gray acknowledge the achievement of the Weisfelds, but
say their policy of buying up other retailers' and manufacturers excess
stock would have faltered in recession, as production runs and overstocking
fell.
Mr Green blames the recent profits downgrade partly on discounting by more
upmarket competitors and partly on the fact that WEW has not always been
fully stocked with basic items such as socks and lingerie.
His response has been to place firm advance orders for an increasing
proportion of the stores' merchandise - much of it from the Far East, which
he knows well.
The principal trading concern about WEW is that as it grows it will need
further controls and overhead costs, squeezing the stores' profits margins,
which rely largely on low wage and property costs.
Mr Green is confident that more profits can be obtained from the present
stores by improving the buying and allocation functions. WEW's break-even
figure is estimated at 70 per cent cent of current turnover levels, and Mr
Green is confident that he can increase annual sales per sq ft from Pounds
135 to nearer Pounds 180.
Mr Green sees no end in sight to the present recession, and is not counting
on recovery to achieve his targets. Even when any upturn comes, he does not
believe people will stop wanting to buy bargains.
The main question mark over Amber Day, however, concerns Mr Green himself,
who has agreed to split his role with a new chairman. It is clear his
financial advisers are seeking someone with a strong City background. It is
even clearer that if Mr Green and the new chairman cannot work together,
then the blame is unlikely to laid at the door of the new man.
One adviser said: 'It is really a case of taming Philip Green. You need a
bloke on top who says 'you can't go off and do these deals without involving
the rest of management.''
His backers stress that they are anxious not to lose what they call Mr
Green's 'Factor X', his ability to strike deals on merchandise which attract
shoppers into the stores. One estimated that Mr Green's dealmaking flair was
directly responsible for about 15 per cent of the group's profits.
Cynics suggest that institutional shareholders are not too unhappy to see
Amber Day's share price at its present low level, since it will be cheaper
to oust Mr Green, should that become necessary.
One adviser said: 'We've got a battle plan for dealing with Philip without
stifling him.' The new chairman will handle relations with the press and
shareholders.
Mr Green said he was wary of being set up, but was confident that he could
work well with a new chairman. His parting words were defiant: 'I've always
wanted the chance to build something. I should be given the opportunity to
prove what a good business this is.'
If Mr Green can work alongside whoever is appointed as chairman, his many
critics may well be confounded. If not, expect further boardroom ructions at
Amber Day.

FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Less than half MFI's offer shares taken up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLICATIONS were made for less than half the public offer of shares in MFI
Furniture Group, the retailer of kitchen and bedroom furniture. Counting had
not been completed yesterday, but bankers involved reckoned the level of
applications would not be far below the 50 per cent mark.
The company and its advisers had set the offer price at 115p, well below
earlier hopes, when it became clear that market conditions were not
favourable.
The offer, which closed yesterday morning, was of 136.97m shares, a quarter
of the total number of shares sold by MFI and its existing investors. The
rest were placed with institutional investors or financial intermediaries.
Shares not taken up in the public offer will be bought by underwriters. Most
of the institutions which took shares in the placing also took underwriting
in the same proportions.
However, underwriters were able to offset any shares they applied for
through the public offer against their underwriting commitments. A number of
underwriters did this, making the true level of applications for the public
offer lower.
Dealings in the shares start next Friday, July 17. Analysts are hoping that
the shares will not open at a big discount because the price was set low in
the first place.

FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Carlton pays Dollars 15m for 10% stake in
Savoy Pictures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Communications, the television production and services group has
paid Dollars 15m (Pounds 7.8m) to take a 10 per cent stake in Savoy Pictures
Entertainment.
Savoy was set up five months ago to become a distributor of movies in the US
and was founded by former senior executives of Columbia and Tristar studios
before their acquisition by Sony. Mr Victor Kaufman, chairman and chief
executive of Savoy is a former chairman of Columbia Pictures.
Mr Michael Green, the chairman of Carlton which last year won the London
weekday ITV licence, believes Savoy could become a major force in the film
industry.
A more immediate reason for the stake is a five-year output deal with
Carlton's film processing and video duplication subsidiary, Technicolor.
Under the deal Technicolor will process Savoy pictures and the company has
already agreed a 12-film deal with Home Box Office the US film subscription
channel.
Other shareholders in Savoy include Mitsui, and Mr Frank Pice the former
chief executive of Universal Pictures.

FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Costain share sale triggers fall in price
to lowest for 16 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the troubled British construction group, yesterday denied it was
having difficulties with its bankers after the company's share price slipped
to its lowest level since 1976.
The shares fell by 8p to close at 30 1/2 p last night compared with 220p
just 16 months ago and a peak of 366p in autumn 1987.
The latest slide appears to have been prompted by the sale of a large
tranche of about 400,000 shares through the London arm of a large US
investment bank.
At one point Costain's share price fell to 29p yesterday, the lowest it has
been since December 1976. The fall led to increased speculation in the
market about the state of the group's finances prompting the denial that
Costain was in problems with its bankers.
Mr Tom Slee, finance director, said: 'We continue to have very amicable
relations with our banker and nothing has happened to change this.'
Costain, in a bid to reduce its borrowings, announced at the end of last
month that it would be selling a stake in its profitable Australian coal
mining subsidiary which it intended to float later this year.
Mr Slee said last night that a statement giving further details of the
flotation was expected in the next two to three weeks.
Costain failed to pay a final dividend after making a pre-tax loss last year
of Pounds 69.2m. It sold its British investment property portfolio in
December for Pounds 101.3m in an earlier move to reduce borrowings.
Net debt at the end of last year had fallen by Pounds 143m to Pounds 168m
reducing gearing from more than 100 per cent to 53 per cent.
The figures, however, excluded Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet debt on the
proposed Spitalfields office development in east London and Pounds 38m of
convertible preference shares.
Mr Slee said that borrowings, which normally increase during the first half
of the year, had risen to Pounds 208m by the end of June. This was Pounds
20m less than had been expected. The increase was also lower than at the
same stage last year. This was before taking any account of proceeds from
the Australian flotation.

FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Greene King extends its Pounds 103m bid for
Morland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENE KING, the East Anglia based brewer, has extended its Pounds 102.6m
hostile bid for Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, until Friday, July 24.
The offer was to have closed yesterday. But Greene King said it wanted to
give investors more time to make their decision following the recent ruling
from the Takeover Panel preventing it publishing its results for the year to
May 3.
The Panel decided that publication of the results, due to take place
yesterday, could have affected the outcome of the bid. Greene King has 46.9
per cent of Morland.
In a separate move Morland sent a circular to shareholders accusing Greene
King of not being 'entirely frank' in its documents.
Sir Humphrey Prideaux, chairman of Morland, said: 'Its difficulty is that
Morland, we believe, is a far more successful company . . . It (Greene King)
has therefore, had to resort to the absurd suggestion that past and current
performance of a company are no guide to its future.'
Morland has forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.6m for the year to
September 30, compared with Pounds 5.9m.
Over the past few weeks Greene King has been challenged by Morland to issue
a similar profit forecast for the year which was why Greene King wanted to
announce its full year results.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Letter: Exchange rate mechanism remains valid alternative to
single European currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MANFRED J M NEUMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Charles Bean and seven other professors try to defend the Maastricht
road to European Monetary Union (Personal View, July 3) by claiming that the
only long-term alternative is a more flexible regime of floating rather than
a continuation of the current exchange rate mechanism (ERM). They expect the
ERM to become unsustainable on the grounds that it may come under
speculative attacks in the absence of capital controls.
However, such attacks are likely only with respect to currencies of
countries whose perceived fiscal position becomes unsustainable (eg Italy)
or who are hit by a large country-specific real shock. In these rare events,
attacks can be prevented by proper realignment. Thus, it seems that the ERM
remains a valid alternative to a single European currency, provided
realignment is not tabooed and the Bundesbank's lead of monetary policy is
accepted.
Bean et al also assert that the European central bank (ECB) will be as
independent as the Bundesbank. They fail to see that the national governors,
serving in the ECB-council, can be made dependent on their home governments
by providing them with only a five-year term and a reappointment on
conditions to be determined by national legislation. The German central
bankers, by contrast, enjoy an eight-year term and can rely on an automatic
reappointment within the normal limits of age. Similarly, they can rely on a
general reluctance of German governments to manipulate the dollar/D-Mark
exchange rate.
Given the interventionist attitude in some EC countries, it is less likely
that the Commission will be similarly unwilling to intervene. After all,
exchange rate policy can be used to force the ECB on to more expansionary
growth.
Finally, Bean et al convey the impression that the 60 German economists who
criticised the overly hasty Maastricht move to monetary union used the
German unification experience as an illustration of the dangers of European
union. In fact, the German economists did not mention this experience at
all.

What disturbs many Danes is that only the Commission can suggest new

FT  11 JUL 92 / Letter: Goal posts moved to get trains in on time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN MCEVOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Citizen's Charter promised us, among other things, a better service
on British Rail. It looks as though it will lead to the opposite.
When I first began to use the Intercity 125 between London and Bristol
Parkway in 1975 the non-stop service took 1 hour 4 minutes and occasionally
we pipped the hour. Last year the fastest non-stop 125 took a scheduled 1
hour 11 minutes and it was sometimes late. Then came the British Rail
Charter ensuring us of punctuality and compensation for delays and what
happens? The summer timetable issued last month shows the non-stop 125
service will now take a scheduled 1 hour 22 minutes, the two-stop service 1
hour 30 minutes (previously 1 hour 22 minutes) and the three-stop service 1
hour 37 minutes (1 hour 28 minutes). At a stroke they lose in two critical
areas - reduced customer satisfaction and reduced potential utilisation of
trains and track by 15 per cent - which makes it even harder for BR to reach
its business targets.
The salt was rubbed in the wound by our senior conductor proudly announcing
one morning that the service had arrived in Paddington eight minutes early
when last month it would have been two minutes late. And station staff in
Bristol Parkway have installed a notice board to demonstrate their new
'punctuality'.
I'm not sure which is more depressing - the transparency of the confidence
trick on passengers or the bankruptcy of ideas in British Rail that the only
way it can tackle moderately challenging targets is to make the goal posts
wider. How will it ever improve?

FT  11 JUL 92 / Man in the News: Tycoon with a disdain for cash - Taikichiro
Mori
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fabulous wealth apparently amounts to nought for Mr Taikichiro Mori, the
Japanese property developer who was named this week by Forbes magazine as
the world's richest businessman. He acknowledged the announcement with a
short, self-effacing statement that a land-price spiral had probably
exaggerated his riches.
Mr Mori, 88, is worth an estimated Dollars 13bn (Pounds 6.8bn). Most of that
money is built into the 82 buildings owned by his private company, Mori
Building; little of it has trickled down to the self-consciously simple
habits of the tycoon, who brings a lunch box to work.
The alcohol-free Mr Mori lives in a modest but comfortable apartment in an
upper-class area of Tokyo. He listens to classical music, watches sumo
wrestling, drives a Nissan not a Rolls-Royce, and wears a hakama, a
traditional pleated skirt, on the three days a week that he now goes to the
office. He and Hana, his wife, had an arranged marriage in 1932 and rarely
eat out. The executive work of Mori Building is gradually being handed down
to their two sons.
Having accumulated his buildings over 33 years - continuing the family
landlord tradition - Mr Mori has a dislike for the younger Japanese
speculators and their dedication to the accumulation of money, imported
luxury cars and French impressionist paintings. While many speculative
empires have crumbled in Tokyo over the past year, the cautious Mr Mori has
survived in the face of the property-market downturn.
The enigma of Mr Mori and his generation of postwar executives is that such
regard for Japanese tradition is combined with an eagerness to bulldoze over
the past. Many Mori buildings stand on what used to be one of Tokyo's more
colourful districts, full of craftsmen and small merchants. Views differ
over whether he has efficiently modernised an ageing city or cemented over
its character.
Along with his industrial contemporaries, Mr Mori's disdain for money is
balanced by a remarkable ability to create and accumulate wealth. Like the
founders of Honda, Matsushita Electric and YKK, the world's largest zipper
company, Mr Mori has contempt for fancy financial engineering, and faith in
the virtues of 'making things' and 'contributing to society'.
'I became sceptical about receiving unearned income from the renting
business. But it was explained to me that, while profits are important, it
is more important to contribute to society and make people happy. We will
gain profits in accordance with the degree of the contribution,' he
explained in a recent autobiography.
His desire to contribute grew naturally out of a Japan devastated by the
second world war. There was a shared conviction that the defeated country
must be rebuilt, physically and spiritually, and there were significant
opportunities for those property developers able to convince small
landholders to sell in the interests of modernisation and the new Japan.
Mr Mori took over the family business in 1959, inheriting 5,000 sq m of real
estate. He left an academic career that had included a specialisation in
sericulture, or silk production, and a post as professor of business studies
at Yokohama City University. The academic background gave a sense of
intellectual distance from the struggles of other developers, and his
sophisticated manner helped convince small property owners to take the money
or trust in his vision, or both.
Having studied the volatile Japanese textile market during the early 1950s,
Mr Mori concluded that companies attempting to make money by exploiting
price fluctuations tended to go bankrupt, while those concentrating on the
quality of their product were less vulnerable.
'It is the same in urban development and building management. First you
think about creating a good environment, not about making money from the
land. And once you have started, you can't stop half way. You must believe
in your success,' he said.
His first 45 office buildings were named by their numbers. Number 1 Mori
Building was followed by Number 2 Mori Building, although the nomenclature
has since become more creative. He explains that the buildings are
'children', in the tradition of Number One Son and so on. The time taken to
complete a project, he says, equals that of childhood - from the first
negotiations to the christening of one complex takes about 20 years.
Mr Mori believes that construction and redevelopment are a god-given
responsibility. It is his belief in this responsibility that has driven an
otherwise humble man to impose his will, and his architectural taste, on
Tokyo.
The semi-spiritual sense of vocation, along with the 'build a strong Japan'
nationalism, has been an important source of economic motivation. It is in
evidence at YKK, where the corporate slogan is 'Cycle of goodness',
spreading prosperity to all, and at Matsushita Electric, with its 'Human
electronics for the benefit of mankind'.
Cultivated from a blend of Buddhism and Confucianism, this type of value
system is not burdened with reservations about the importance of money as a
commodity, but regards the relentless pursuit of money itself to be as
destructive of character as excessive drinking or obsessive womanising.
But vaguely defined 'goodness', 'happiness' and 'prosperity' do not explain
how Mr Mori managed to deal with the often brutal Japanese gangsters and
their demands for protection money, or to argue with his bankers over
interest rates. Nor does it explain the lack of remorse at closing down a
district's last kimono maker to create space for Number 36 or Number 37 Mori
Building.
'In building a new city, the trust of the small landowners is indispensable.
You could compare this developer-owner relationship with that between a man
and a woman,' he said.
'In order to survive in a severe environment, you must contribute to society
by making a superior management plan that others can recognise. We should
show them the reason for our existence, then we can feel proud.'

FT  11 JUL 92 / A year of living patiently: Disappointment is the watchword
for most international investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been so far a year of frustration and dashed hopes for the world's
leading stock and bond markets. Anticipated declines in interest rates have
by and large failed to happen and predicted profit recoveries have mostly
proved illusory.
Sharp movements have, however, been rare. True, the Tokyo stock market has
taken a well-deserved further dive, and Hong Kong has soared. But elsewhere
the ups and downs of equity markets have been within a fairly narrow range,
and the same is true of bond markets.
Now some more optimistic investors are wondering whether the delayed upturn
will begin to come through in the second half of the year. But it is
probably true to say that the predominant mood is one of mild apprehension,
as significant elements of the global economy continue to puzzle the
economic pundits and investors worry that Wall Street, after a lengthy
tightrope walk, will eventually lose its balance and take a tumble.
At the beginning of the year there were grounds for being bullish. After the
economic slowdown of 1991, when growth of the 24 member states of the
Organisation for Economic Co-ordination and Development averaged only 1 per
cent, inflation and interest rates were expected to fall. Meanwhile economic
growth was forecast to pick up, creating plenty of scope for company profits
to rise.
To some extent this has worked out, but Europe has been held back by high
interest rates arising from Germany's overheating problems, and the recovery
in the US has been disappointingly sluggish. The OECD has just trimmed back
its 1992 global growth estimate.
The securities markets have been restrained by two particular factors.
First, they have been buried by new issues of both stocks and bonds. Equity
issues in the US, for instance, hit an all-time peak of Dollars 41.3bn in
the first six months, and international bond issues reached Dollars 143bn.
Second, the two biggest stock markets in the world, in the US and Japan,
which at the start of 1992 represented some 70 per cent of global stock
market value, simply appear to have been too pricey.
Japan has embarked upon the second stage of the puncturing of its 1980s
bubble market which had reached its maximum stage of overinflation at the
end of 1989. The Nikkei average had already fallen from 39,000 to 23,000 in
the first two years of the shake-out. Now it has fallen even further, to
less than 16,000 at one stage in June.
On Wall Street the popular impression has been of further progress, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting several new highs, culminating in an
all-time peak of just over 3,400 at the beginning of last month. In fact the
broader market indicators have moved sideways at best: the FT-Actuaries US
Index of 522 leading stocks is slightly lower on the year so far (and has
moved within a remarkably narrow range). To foreigners, Wall Street's
performance looks still worse than this because the dollar has been edging
lower.
The dollar's slide, which has intensified in recent weeks, reflects the fall
in short-term interest rates which has been the notable feature of US
economic policy in the year so far. But long bond rates have actually been
edging higher, boosted by the high pace of government borrowing. The recent
cut in short rates to 3 per cent, the lowest figure for 29 years, has been
associated by many investors more with desperation than with inspiration.
Returns in the Japanese bond market have also been unexciting. The yield on
Japanese government bonds, at less than 5 1/2 per cent, is already the
lowest in any big national market. In Germany, usually the international
investor's favourite for hard-currency investments, yields have been kept up
at about 8 per cent by the weight of official borrowing, together with
concerns about inflationary trends in the wake of unification.
The German factor has dominated the European region, with an unexpected
twist in early June when the Maastricht treaty was rejected by Danish
voters. That brought an abrupt end to the 'convergence' phase which had
brought disparate European national bond market yields closer together in
anticipation of eventual monetary union.
Some of the more financially marginal countries like Spain and Italy were
hit hardest. Their bond yields jumped and Italy was even forced to raise its
short-term rates by a percentage point last weekend. The UK was affected
too, but overall the main factor influencing British markets has been the
unexpected Tory victory in the April election. The impact has propelled the
gilt-edged market to the very top of the international bond market
performance table for the first half of the year. UK equities looked good at
one stage, but they have suffered a serious setback since mid-May because of
concern about fading economic recovery hopes.
Equity investors have become subdued elsewhere too. There are worries that
business activity is being suppressed by financial problems in the US and
Japan and by the dampening impact of high D-Mark interest rates in Europe.
At the start of 1992 there were hopes that D-Mark rates might be coming
down, but few now expect them to move much before the end of the year.
International investors seeking excitement have been driven out to the
fringes: to Hong Kong, where the colony is thriving on the back of the quiet
capitalist revolution in southern China, and to South America, where until
last month emerging markets specialists were feeding eagerly on fragile bull
markets in Argentine, Brazil and Colombia. However, last year's shooting
star, Mexico, has been going backwards fast since the spring.
After enjoying a decade of generous stock market returns in the 1980s,
professional investors are concerned that more cautious strategies may be
appropriate for the 1990s. Although foreigners keep hoping that Tokyo is
close to the bottom, many have already burned their fingers badly by
prematurely moving money back into Japanese stocks last year. There is a
widespread fear that the Nikkei average may lurch down to 12,000 or even
10,000 before it finally bounces off the bottom.
As for Wall Street, the torrent of retail money flowing into the stock
market continues to perplex professional fund managers and undermine their
concepts of how to price stocks. So-called 'value' managers complain that
they have to go back to the notorious 'nifty fifty' days of 20 years ago to
find stock market data on which their computer models will choke so badly.
The reason is that many American savers have been stunned by seeing returns
on certificates of deposit collapse this year to a dismal 3 per cent, and
have transferred the money into bonds, stocks and mutual funds in search of
a more acceptable return. Net new investment in stock mutual funds has been
running at something like Dollars 7bn a month.
US stock prices have therefore been pushed up beyond generally accepted fair
value. The backward-looking price/earnings ratio on the best-known broad
market index, the Standard and Poor's 500, stands at an amazing 28. It is
true that analysts are expecting a huge earnings bounce this year, possibly
as high as 50 per cent, partly reflecting the prevalence of one-off
provisions against company earnings during the recession last year. But
there is inevitably nervousness as a sluggish economic recovery casts doubts
on whether that assumed profits surge can be achieved. And even if it
happens on the calculated scale, the market would still look rather
expensive in historical terms.
The unusually high stock market ratings have caused corporate treasurers and
new-issue promoters to rub their hands and generate the blizzard of new
offerings, to the extent that in recent weeks the appetite of investors has
finally appeared to be sated. This can be seen as the reduction of the US
corporate sector's debt after the financial excesses of the late 1980s. It
may also be interpreted as the eager exploitation by corporate America of an
overvalued stock market.
We are now in the often seasonally unexciting summer period, leading up to
September and October which have sometimes produced panics and crashes in
the past. Many national stock markets perform significantly worse in the
second six months of the year. On the other hand November and December often
produce good returns, as investors look forward optimistically to the scope
for growth in the new year. A late rally could still turn 1992 from a
tedious into an acceptable year for global investors.
The bulls are focusing on the prospect of more rapid economic growth and at
the same time generally lower inflation in 1993. The OECD projects that
average real GDP growth will recover to 3 per cent and inflation edge down
to 3.2 per cent. This environment would be good for bonds and even better
for equities, which tend to move on to a higher valuation basis at times of
low inflation.
However, this story is getting a little shop-soiled. Mainstream economists
seem to have little clue about what is going on in several leading
countries: they have got the UK completely wrong and are hazy about what is
going on in the US and Japan. Debt problems have to be worked out and are
holding back the asset markets: apart from the stagnation in stocks, a more
or less worldwide property crash has been going on.
Meanwhile Wall Streeters face political uncertainties: they cannot yet be
entirely confident that President George Bush will be re-elected in
November, and Mr Ross Perot threatens to create waves that the stock market
could find disturbing. As for the US economy, if recovery does come through
strongly there might be a quick flip up in short rates, and a withdrawal of
the retail money which has pushed the equity market to this year's highs.
Alternatively, if the recovery fizzles out the earnings projections will be
left high and dry and share prices would be vulnerable to a sharp setback.
Too many countries are running excessive fiscal deficits. Without strong
economic growth these will get even bigger; budgeted deficits of OECD
countries for 1992 have jumped to 3.2 per cent of GDP against 2.4 per cent
last year. To an extent this is good for certain kinds of investors, because
the torrent of issues (the British government, for instance, now issues
gilt-edged bonds in lumps of about Pounds 2.5bn at a time) is holding real
long-term interest rates high. On the other hand private-sector activity is
being damped down by the high cost of capital; share prices cannot be
expected to show much strength in these circumstances.
Securities markets have been held in a kind of uneasy equilibrium so far in
1992, and investors hoping for some action may continue to need patience.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Audit regulators debar two members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO CERTIFIED accountants were debarred from conducting audit work during
the first six months of the new self-regulatory mechanisms established by
the government last year, it emerged yesterday.
Officials at the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants have
restricted the practising certificate of two of their members since audit
regulation work began in October.
The figures emerge in the first submission to the Department of Trade and
Industry on audit regulation until the end of March, during which 94 visits
took place among the 3,000 certified accountants registered to conduct
audits.
Separately, the joint monitoring unit, which scrutinises auditors registered
with the three Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in
Scotland and in Ireland, has made no disqualifications.
Its more up-to-date figures show that the unit has refused to register as
auditors 1,108 accountants from the 10,509 who had applied up until last
week.
The unit has carried out 44 visits to determine whether to register
accountants as auditors, and 80 visits to those already registered. That
includes 13 in response to complaints and 49 that were routine. It has
pledged to visit all the auditors of listed companies every five years.
There are 163 such auditors.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants yesterday refused to give
the names of the two accountants who were debarred. The DTI launched the new
mechanism of regulated auditors through the professional accountancy bodies
in October. Some critics have said it is impossible for the bodies to
regulate their own members, but the officials have called for time to prove
their effectiveness.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Crown is referred to police in ferry row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGAL wrangle over one of the oldest ferry routes in Europe took a new
turn yesterday after the operators of the cross-Thames service announced
that they had passed files to the police alleging that the Crown Estate
could be prosecuted if it forces the closure of the service.
The rights to the crossing, which has been operated without interruption
since 1086, are owned by the Crown Estate. It has told White Horse Ferries,
operators of the Tilbury-Gravesend ferry service, to stop journeys on the
route.
The Crown Estate, which manages property owned by the sovereign, says the
route licence held by the previous operator - Sealink Stena - was
non-transferable. White Horse took over the service last year.
The company has defied the order to halt services and is seeking damages for
loss of revenue and a fall in passenger numbers caused, it says, by the
Crown Estate's action.
White Horse has now sent to the police details of legal judgments indicating
that the commissioners acting for the Crown Estate may risk committing an
offence if the service is closed. White Horse says it is an offence if a
ferry owner breaches its common-law obligation to operate a service.
Essex police confirmed yesterday that they had received the documents.
Copies of the judgments have also been sent to the Crown Estate. An official
said the commissioners were seeking legal advice.
Talks aimed at resolving the dispute failed to reach agreement last week.
The Crown Estate denies that it has an obligation to maintain the service if
White Horse is forced to withdraw its ferry.
The official said the Crown Estate wanted to renegotiate a licence with
White Horse.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Date set for tougher toxic waste rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER strengthening of the already tough regulations governing emissions
from incineration of toxic waste by Rechem International at its Pontypool
plant will take effect in the autumn, Mr Gwilym Jones, a junior minister at
the Welsh Office, assured the Commons yesterday.
He urged Labour MPs who had sought a public inquiry into the plant to await
the outcome of a survey being undertaken by Professor Lewis Roberts of the
University of East Anglia.
Its findings on the levels of contamination by PCBs (polychlorinated
biphenyls) near the plant are expected to be announced in January.
Mr Jones acknowledged the anxiety of people living near the plant but
maintained that the need for an inquiry or other form of investigation could
best be decided in the light of the survey's findings.
The more stringent regulations to be introduced in the autumn, he said,
would stem from the Environmental Protection Act.
Rechem had already announced that it would invest Pounds 2.5m to improve
emissions from the incinerator stack. The Pollution Inspectorate has served
it a notice to improve matters by next May.
Mr Jones promised that every effort would be made during Britain's
presidency of the European Community to hasten a ban, sought in a directive,
on imports of toxic waste from developed countries outside the EC.
Defending the continued imports of toxic wastes from underdeveloped
countries, Mr Jones emphasised that a ban might lead to illegal or
environmentally unsound dumping - 'the worst of all crimes against the
environment'.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Commons committee dispute deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY exchanges among Tories about membership of Commons committees took a
new turn yesterday - and may threaten the places of some senior
Conservatives when MPs vote on the proposals on Monday.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, maverick former Tory chairman of the health
committee, tried to retaliate against government business managers' attempts
to use his length of service as an reason to unseat him.
He listed, in a Commons motion, three other Tories and six Labour MPs who
had served for a similar period but had been renominated. His move further
embarrassed Conservative whips who, though insisting the Commons committees
are matters for the House to decide, have heavily influenced the selection.
Already an amendment has had to be tabled to remove the similarly
long-serving Sir John Wheeler from the list for the home affairs committee
he used to chair. Sir John, MP for Westminster North, plans to make a
personal statement to the Commons on Monday.
The confusion - which will lead to a succession of votes on Monday night -
increased the suspicion among many Tory MPs that the party's business
managers had concocted the long-service rule simply to unseat Mr Winterton.
Sir Marcus Fox, Tory chairman of the selection committee that approved the
original lists,
said: 'We took the view that it is absolutely right that after 13 years and
three parliaments, any member who was on a select committee in 1979 really
ought to make room for other people.'

FT  11 JUL 92 / Boost for rented housing sought

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to hold talks with institutional investors to see whether
a fresh initiative can be taken to build up the private rented housing
sector, Sir George Young, housing minister, said yesterday, David Barchard
writes.
'My vision is of good-quality, professionally managed accommodation for
rent, backed by long-term institutional investment,' he told the Council of
Mortgage Lenders.
'I believe that there is now a consensus that the time is ripe for a fresh
initiative and I have invited to my department representatives of major
institutional investors to identify how we convert this consensus into
homes.'
He told mortgage lenders to tell their customers that there is a range of
options if their circumstances change and they fall into arrears. The
minister believes that will help to build confidence in people about to
enter the housing market.
Sir George sharply rebuked critics of the mortgage-rescue scheme agreed
between the government and lenders last year.
'The mortgage-rescue package is forecast to rescue 55,000 people, many more
than originally forecast last December,' he said.

THE decision by the nine-member Western European Union (WEU) to send
warships to the Adriatic to enforce sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro,
is more a political than a military move, it was admitted yesterday.
Mr Relus Ter Beek, the Dutch defence minister, said sending forces to the
Adriatic was 'a political decision in the sense that we cannot enter the
ships, we cannot force them to stop, we cannot control their cargoes. All we
can do is monitor. It is a political gesture aimed at applying more pressure
on (Serbian president Slobodan) Milosevic.'
Attempts to enforce sanctions by patrolling the Adriatic would only be
effective if it were followed up by other measures.
'If the United Nations Security Council decides to really enforce the
embargo against Serbia, then it seems to me that surveillance along the
Danube is the first priority,' said Mr Willem van Eekelen, WEU secretary
general.
Diplomats at the CSCE summit said most of the sanctions-busting was taking
place along the river Danube.
Both here and on the Adriatic, the UN had not set up any mechanism to
monitor the flow of goods in or out of Serbia when it imposed sanctions
against Belgrade on May 31.
'We simply have not got the manpower,' the UN says.
British and Italian businessmen who have temporarily closed their offices in
Belgrade, said sanctions busting was taking place in a number of areas.
These include:
The port of Bar in Montenegro. Goods were being shipped across the Adriatic
to Bar and then transported by train or lorry to Serbia. 'That port, like
Belgrade, is packed with mafia gangs who are making money out of the
sanctions and growing shortages in Belgrade,' a British engineer said.
The port of Constanta in Romania. Oil, and possibly even weapons, are
getting through to Serbia via Romania. 'I am not saying that Romania is
sanctions busting. What I am saying is that Yugoslavia has a large fleet of
barges - about a dozen. They dock at the Romanian port of Constanta,' a
western oil exporter said.
'No international body is patrolling the Danube. With backhanders, and zilch
monitoring of invoices and end-users, goods can get through to Belgrade,' he
added.
The Yugoslav fleet has very close links with Genex, the giant Belgrade-based
foreign trade company. Mr Milosevic has practically controlled Genex since
his rise to power in 1987 when he started placing his supporters in the top
echelons of the company.
'Genex knows what trade and business is all about. It knows how to avoid
getting caught,' said a British exporter.
Arms sales. Western and eastern European diplomats said a UN and European
Community arms embargo was being breached. According to a US diplomat, since
Croatia's independence was recognised last January, 'tons of weapons have
gone into Croatia, by air, or maybe via Austria. The controls are far too
lax. It would not surprise me if some of the republics of the former Soviet
Union are shipping weapons to Serbia up through the Danube.'
Air space. General Ratko Mladic, the head of Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia,
and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the nationalist head of Bosnia's Serbs, fly to
Belgrade on Yugoslav army helicopters, and helicopters are used for supplies
from Serbia to Bosnia.
Western military attaches yesterday said the time had not yet arrived for
closing down Yugoslavia's internal air space.
'It would need a security council resolution, and an agreement on who would
monitor the air space,' a Dutch diplomat said.
He added that the decision by the WEU to send ships to the Adriatic was a
first step.
'It will not stop the killing. But the WEU has taken responsibility in
contributing towards making the UN sanctions more effective,' he said.

MR Milan Panic, prime minister designate of the rump Yugoslavia, yesterday
made an unexpected visit to Helsinki to tell the world why Serbia deserved a
hearing.
His loquacious press conference was punctuated by slogans insisting that he
harboured no nationalist feelings, that Croats and Serbs really did like
each other, and that he would 'eliminate politicians' who stood in the way
of peace.
It coincided with a unanimous declaration of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe which placed the 'prime responsibility' on Belgrade
for the violence and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Panic, whose US citizenship will not be withdrawn when he takes up his
new job, had earlier met US secretary of State James Baker.
Mr Baker told Mr Panic that 'acts and not words' were needed to resolve the
crisis. 'The message I gave to him was clear ..the human nightmare in the
former Yugoslavia must cease ..and that Serbia and Montenegro must abide by
the UN resolutions,' Mr Baker said.
Mr Panic, a businessman specialising in pharmaceuticals, said he would stop
the killing by withdrawing all heavy weapons from Bosnia, place them under
UN control, and then sell other weapons to revive the Serbian economy.
But Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, who helped draw up the declaration
on the Yugoslav crisis, said Belgrade continued to support Serb irregulars
and Serbia's proxy army in their efforts to carve up Bosnia.
The destruction and killing in Bosnia-Hercegovina was finally, and publicly
acknowledged in a Bosnian-inspired text simply called a Declaration on the
Yugoslav crisis.
Russia had opposed the draft document, on the grounds that it was too
one-sided, and that it wanted some of the text agreed by the G7 summit in
Munich to be incorporated. Some other republics of the former Soviet Union
wanted a CSCE declaration on Nagorno-Karabakh.

FT  11 JUL 92 / West struggles to resist pull of Bosnian vortex: The big
powers' dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE western powers are reluctant to intervene militarily in Bosnia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but the decisions taken in the margin of the 51-nation security conference
summit in Helsinki give exactly the opposite impression.
How, it will be asked, can governments claim that they oppose military
intervention while, in the next breath they decide to send warships and
helicopters to patrol the Adriatic coast. How can you oppose intervention
while promising 'air cover' for land relief convoys to Sarajevo, if those
are found to be necessary and feasible, as Mr John Major, the British prime
minister did yesterday?
And what, if not the use of military means, was President George Bush
talking about when he said he strongly supported action to ensure that
United Nations sanctions against Serbia were respected and relief supplies
reached Sarajevo, 'no matter what it takes?'
The answer is that diplomats and political leaders talk a different language
from the man-in-the-street. The former distinguish between 'military
intervention' in a conflict with the aim of imposing a specific political
solution, and non-belligerent action, be it by military personnel and with
the use of military equipment, in support of an internationally-sanctioned
embargo or humanitarian relief operation.
So far, all the operations, including those decided yesterday by the Western
European Union to help enforce UN sanctions against Serbia, are taking place
under the umbrella of existing UN Security Council resolutions. Moreover,
all the nations involved or likely to become involved in the Bosnian crisis,
have made it clear that a new UN resolution would be required if it were
decided that land convoys, with air or troop cover, were needed to ensure
the transport of aid to Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'Any operation concerning the establishment of humanitarian corridors would
have to be subject to further decisions by the Security Council and be
co-ordinated with the UN, in particular, for the aspects concerning
protection,' the WEU ministers stipulated.
Ground forces are almost certainly needed to provide adequate protection.
Yet among all the confusing statements on the subject of military
intervention, one thing has been made perfectly clear: most of the major
powers are reluctant to provide ground forces for an operation which would
risk dragging them progressively into a prolonged conflict, with unforeseen
political consequences.
Both Mr Bush and Mr Major have repeatedly ruled out sending ground troops
even to protect land convoys, while even President Francois Mitterrand of
France, who was generally considered to be more open to sending ground
troops to Bosnia and has already agreed to contribute 700 military personnel
to the UN contingent in Sarajevo, also expressed serious reservations
yesterday.
'France carries out the decisions of the UN,' Mr Mitterrand said. 'But if
someone were to ask us (to provide combat troops), we would say that we
would prefer other solutions.'
The big unanswered question is whether events on the ground will lead to an
uncontrolled escalation of military action, regardless of the firm political
positions adopted by the participants in humanitarian aid and embargo
enforcement operations.
There have already been reports of troops of the Canadian UN force returning
the fire of snipers. The more military forces there are in Bosnia, be it
under the umbrella of the UN, the greater the risk of a recurrence of such
incidents, possibly leading to much more serious clashes between local and
foreign troops.
That is why the latest measures will have to go hand-in-hand with greatly
increased efforts to find a negotiated solution to the ethnic and other
problems provoked by the break-up of the Yugoslav federation - whether in
the framework of the European Community's peace conference chaired by Lord
Carrington or a wider UN-sponsored international conference.
As successive declarations on the Yugoslav crisis issued by various
international forums have underlined, military measures taken by outsiders
cannot solve the political problems which are at the heart of the conflict.
Only a will for peace on the part of the warring factions and a genuine
desire to replace shooting with talking can do that.
It is for that reason that the world's leaders have been so hesitant to take
more extensive military steps and will remain extremely reluctant to do so
in the future, in spite of their outrage at the bloodshed in Bosnia and the
suffering of its people.

<TEXT>
MR Peter-Michael Diestel has become an east German folk hero since
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) ousted him as head
of the CDU in Brandenburg state.
The enigmatic east German politician was catapulted into the vanguard of the
still-unnamed east German bipartisan movement, to be launched today, which
seeks to tap the widespread discontent in the economically battered region.
According to the movement's co-initiator, Mr Gregor Gysi, head of the PDS,
the former Communist party, grass-roots committees are to be formed in an
attempt to alleviate mass unemployment, de-industrialisation, the
destruction of agriculture and the 'humiliation' of east Germans.
Politicians of the mainstream parties, particularly the CDU, whose
popularity has plummeted among easterners, attacked the new movement for
allegedly turning east Germans against west Germans. Mr Diestel claimed it
could become the nucleus of a political party.
The 40-year-old Mr Diestel was long a thorn in the flesh of the CDU
leadership in Bonn for criticising the colonial-style 'subjugation' of east
Germany. But the surge in his popularity was nonetheless remarkable, as he
was ousted for an interview in which he defended ex-informers of the Stasi
state security police against 'one-sided' accusations.
While Mr Diestel was criticised for his Stasi remarks by the Social
Democrats (SPD) in Brandenburg, who are coalition partners of the CDU, his
expulsion was denounced by Mr Manfred Stolpe, the SPD prime minister of the
state, as being typical of west German high-handedness.
Nearly three-quarters of east German production workers have lost their jobs
since 1990 or are on short-time work. The majority languish in retraining or
job creation programmes which offer them little future. Psychologically,
says Mr Heiner Winkler, an east Berlin journalist, 'they are worse off than
before'.
Under the Communists, labour was scarce and workers openly complained about
their lot without fear of dismissal. 'Now they keep their mouths shut, as
everyone is afraid of being sacked,' he says. An entire generation of east
Germans above the age of 45 - skilled workers, engineers, academics and
officials - has been relegated to the scrap heap. Yet east Germans are
reluctant to take to the streets to express their discontent and instead
sink deeper into resignation.
East German members of the Bundestag previously tried to form bipartisan
alliances to press for the interests of their constituents but failed in the
face of strong opposition from the west German-controlled parties, which saw
a danger in obscuring party lines.
Mr Diestel's alliance with his fellow lawyer, Mr Gysi, has alarmed both
conservatives and social democrats, who have sought to isolate the PDS. Mr
Gysi is a brilliant speaker and tactician and in local elections last May
the PDS scored a stunning upset by becoming the strongest party in east
Berlin's borough legislatures.
But Mr Diestel's erratic behaviour during his rapid rise to prominence in
post-Communist east Germany gave him a reputation for inscrutability. As
interior minister of the last, freely-elected East German government, he
antagonised Bonn officials by employing former senior Stasi officers as
advisers. He also argued against opening the Stasi files to the public,
predicting that it would lead to acts of violence within families and
between neighbours.
But it was Mr Diestel's purchase of a big villa belonging to the Interior
Ministry which raised questions about his integrity. He bought the lakeside
villa for DM193,000 (Pounds 66,500) in July 1990 when it was estimated to be
worth nearly DM1m. The German government is demanding that he return the
house, which it claims he bought without the approval of the east German
parliament and, in effect, sold to himself.
Mr Diestel, an avid body-builder, responded to the charges by insisting that
he would fight the case to the highest court. Seeking to portray himself as
yet another victimised east German, he added that he was in the 'best
company' of citizens who also faced eviction from their homes by former west
German owners.
If Mr Diestel succeeds in his attempt to set up an east German coalition
movement, a number of east Germans such as Mr Wolfgang Thierse, the astute
deputy chairman of the SPD, believe it would backfire by deepening the
mistrust between east and west Germans.
'East German problems will either be solved in an all-German way or not at
all,' he cautioned recently. Mr Thierse instead advocated introduction of a
minority veto on important legislation affecting the east German states in
the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament.
On one thing, however, all East German politicians are agreed. Unless the
voice of east Germans is heard more loudly in Bonn, the danger will grow of
the extreme right wing profiting from their frustrations in future
elections.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS MEXICO prepares for its most important state elections of the year, seven
groups of observers have jointly concluded that the 'necessary conditions'
do not exist 'for the celebration of clean elections', while the leftist
opposition appears to be preparing massive protests in anticipation of
fraud.
The states of Michoacan and Chihuahua will vote for new governors tomorrow
in elections that are widely seen as tests of popularity of the opposition
in its former strongholds, and of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
party's (PRI) commitment to a more open democratic system.
The centre-left Party of Democratic Revolution is already planning to
demonstrate in Michoacan against what it sees as the inevitable fraud. The
army is ready to move in, and a tense and violent post-electoral period is
expected.
The protests will coincide with President Carlos Salinas's July 15 summit
with US President George Bush in San Diego and, if they last, with
President's Salinas visit to the UK, Spain, France and Hungary later in the
month. They will add to a growing list of worries afflicting the president,
including recent sharp drops in the stock market, and delays in wrapping up
negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The election observers concluded that the 'apparent unlimited use of
government resources, favouritism of electoral authorities and virtual
monopoly in the media, among other factors, create a scene propitious for
manipulating the popular will in favour of one party, and permit the federal
government to decide in the political terrain the result of the polls.'
The observer groups have offered no evidence for many of their allegations,
such as rigging of the electoral roll. But no-one questions the huge
disparity in resources between the PRI and opposition.
The leftist PRD is expected to lose in Michoacan, which would be a
considerable setback and make it difficult, if not impossible, to mount an
effective challenge in the 1994 elections.
In the border, and more urban, state of Chihuahua, the centre-right PAN is
running neck-and-neck with the PRI in the polls. If it were to win, it would
be only the second time that the PRI has lost a gubernatorial election, the
first being in 1989 when the PAN won in another border state, Baja
California. The PAN was also handed a governorship in Guanajuato last year
after charges of fraud undermined the PRI's victory.
The electoral situation is much less tense in Chihuahua, as the PRI and the
PAN have signed a series of pre-electoral accords designed to promote a
peaceful process. In Michoacan, by contrast, the PRI has used all means to
crush Mr Cardenas's party.
Mexico's consumer prices increased by 0.7 per cent in June, the lowest
inflation rate for the month in 20 years.

<TEXT>
MR Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, warned yesterday that further
cuts in government expenditure were likely to be implemented this year to
keep borrowing projections on target.
Speaking to the Dail (parliament) in its last session before the summer
recess, he said: 'While the recent half-yearly Exchequer returns show a
somewhat better picture than in mid-1991, it is clear that adherence to this
year's budgetary parameters will require some corrective action. Accordingly
I have initiated a review of all areas of public expenditure to see where
expenditure can be pared back. I intend to ensure that there is no
significant slippage from our budgetary targets this year.'
The government is aiming at a ceiling on the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement
of IPounds 600m (Pounds 552m), or 2.5 per cent of gross national product for
1992.
Mr Ahern said the cost of pay awards in the public sector 'continues to be
an area of concern.' He said future wage negotiations would emphasise
improved efficiency 'to offset any increases in pay' and 'more weight is to
be given to 'ability to pay' and budgetary considerations.' Deferred pay
awards are expected to bring government finances under increased pressure in
1993 and 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM should consider cutting back its generous unemployment benefits,
according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The OECD's 1992 report on the Belgian economy, published yesterday, says
that it is essential that Belgium clean up its labour market if it wants to
reduce its large budget deficit.
Belgium is straining to get its deficit - which stood at 6.3 per cent of GDP
last year - down towards the European Community target of 3 per cent by
1996, as part of the push towards European economic and monetary union.
The four-month-old centre-left coalition has already passed a stringent
emergency budget for 1992, including much-criticised initial measures to
rein in the social security system.
The government is likely to produce a draft budget for 1993 towards the end
of this month.
The OECD says that further cuts will certainly be needed and adds that 'the
sooner these measures are taken, the less draconian they will have to be'.
The OECD also criticises the Luxembourg government for continuing to support
its manufacturing companies through state aids. It says the policy is one
reason for the continued deterioration of the Grand Duchy's public finances,
the largest black spot on an otherwise reasonably healthy European economy.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Italians to lose 'golden' pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN pensioners have long been the most privileged in Europe. Yesterday's
reforms approved by the new Amato government are a belated attempt to reduce
the state's generosity and bring Italy more into line with European
Community practice.
The main innovations are the raising of the pensionable age to 65 years for
both men and women, an increase in the minimum contribution period from 15
to 20 years, and equalisation of state and private schemes.
There have been three previous proposals for reform since 1984. All
suggested changes similar to those announced yesterday but foundered because
no party was prepared to court unpopularity by reducing benefits. The latest
proposals, to be presented to parliament as a decree, stand a better chance
of acceptance simply because the budget can no longer afford the existing
system.
Pensions for 14.2m people account for more than 80 per cent of social
spending and are equivalent to 14 per cent of gross domestic product. If the
system were to continue, pensions would absorb the entire budget in under 20
years. Alternatively, it would require something close to a 50 per cent
contribution from salaries to balance contributions and payments within 30
years.
Until now, women have been able to retire at 55 and men at 60. The reforms
envisage a range of incentives for people to stay at work until 65 and
disincentives to discourage early retirement. Some workers in arduous jobs
such as mining will be excepted, and allowed to retire five years early.
There is also an attempt to tidy up abuses of early retirement in the state
sector, where men have been able to retire after only 20 years' work, as
opposed to 35 years in the private sector. A recent study showed 87 per cent
of all state employees retired early. The authorities are also committed to
examine claims for early retirement on health grounds with greater rigour.
No fewer than 4.2m, one third of all pensioners, receive disability
pensions, many of which have been granted as political favours or through
payments to compliant health officials.
The government also intends to stimulate the growth of the undeveloped
pension fund business. This is seen as the most effective way both of
expanding Italy's capital markets and of ending the anomaly whereby state
employees have no pension fund - their pensions have been covered out of
current annual budget expenditure. At present a state employee can receive
up to 94 per cent of final salary. There is now likely to be a ceiling of 80
per cent.
Many state employees have abused the pension scheme and taken advantage of
early retirement to take up other jobs because they have been poorly paid by
the public administration.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Estonia hails troops pledge: Yeltsin pull-out promise seen
as step forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESTONIA has cautiously welcomed President Boris Yeltsin's promise to pull
all ex - Soviet troops from the Baltics but criticised the Helsinki meeting
of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe for failing to
force the pace of the withdrawal, Reuter reports.
President Arnold Ruutel said yesterday he was satisfied that Mr Yeltsin, who
made his public pledge in Munich before flying to Helsinki, had not named a
fixed date far in the future.
'The real dates will be worked out in bilateral talks. But for the Baltic
states it's an important step forward that Russia has made the real
political decision to pull out all troops,' he said.
Earlier, Mr Ruutel told the CSCE that Estonia had been disappointed in the
conference's failure to phase out what he called a holdover from the Cold
war.
'Ever since Estonia became a member of the CSCE in September of last year,
we have hoped and believed in its ability to help resolve one of the most
important problems facing our nation - the need for complete withdrawal of
all ex-Soviet troops. Unfortunately, our expectations have yet to be
fulfilled,' he said.
The CSCE called for talks and an early withdrawal, but refused to back
demands by the three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) that the
presence of some 130,000 ex - Soviet troops be declared a violation of
international law.
Speaking to local journalists afterwards, Mr Ruutel softened his tone.
'Maybe it could have be stronger,' he said of the CSCE position. But he said
he understood the principles of the Helsinki summit required dialogue. 'No
one tells anyone what to do.'
Mr Yeltsin issued his promise after talks with Group of Seven leaders, and
said Russia had already stopped sending new conscripts to the region.
'Since our period of service is two years, in practical terms after two
years there will be no more rank-and - file soldiers left there,' he said.
However, he added that Moscow could not yet give a deadline for completing
the withdrawal because of the enormous problem of housing troops repatriated
from Germany and the Baltics.
On Wednesday the CIS naval commander-in - chief, Admiral Vladimir Chernavin,
said that more than half the potential conscripts to the Commonwealth armed
forces managed to dodge their military service.

FIGHTING has flared again in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh,
despite a ceasefire pledge by Azerbaijan, Armenia's ambassador to Russia
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Felix Mamikonyan told a news conference that despite a ceasefire that was
due to begin at midnight, Azeri troops had bombarded villages in north and
east Karabakh. 'Azerbaijan and Armenia agreed to suspend their armed
activities but the Azeri side has already broken its obligations with a
series of attacks,' he said.
There was no immediate comment from the Azeri side.
Itar-Tass news agency later reported that Karabakh Armenians had repelled an
Azeri attack on villages in Mardakert district in the north of the enclave,
scene of heavy fighting between the majority Armenian population and
Azerbaijan.
About 2,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting in
Nagorno-Karabakh, which was administered by Azerbaijan throughout the Soviet
period. Karabakh Armenian authorities now say the enclave is an independent
republic.
The latest round of bloodshed began in May when Karabakh Armenians drove out
their ancient foes and punched a land corridor through Azeri territory to
Armenia. Azeri forces launched a counter-attack in June.
Exploratory talks in Rome on a peace conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, to be
held in the Belarussian capital Minsk under the auspices of the Conference
on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), were suspended on Tuesday.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Arts: Music and funding in Zurich - The city's June Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While most cities have taken Rossini, Columbus or other open-ended themes as
the starting point for their 1992 festivals, Zurich belatedly chose Brazil -
effectively ruling out any useful contribution from its music institutions.
Just as other European cities are latching on to the festival concept as a
form of international marketing, Zurich wants to stop subsidising its annual
June Festival. Whereas most arts companies thrive on strong leadership,
Switzerland's biggest city seems unable or unwilling to attract suitable
candidates.
Here is a city with a high international profile in banking and commerce,
with a cultural tradition at Europe's crossroads, with a beautiful lakeside
setting and the raw materials - in quality of buildings, repertoire,
audiences and musicians - to match most rivals. Yet its musical potential
remains largely untapped: Zurich lacks a dynamic or distinctive profile.
The June Festival (running from late May to early July) has become a dead
duck. This year's Brazil theme may have thrown up one or two surprises, but
it suffered from short-term planning and offered no scope to the Zurich
Opera House. When the Tonhalle Orchestra tried to venture beyond the music
of Villa-Lobos, it found itself footing a SFr25,000 bill for a special
Brazilian concert which sold only 200 tickets. As in previous years, the
major companies were left to market their festival wares independently. The
cash-strapped city government has now announced plans to cancel its
SFr700,000 subsidy after 1994.
All this is in marked contrast to other Swiss cities with less impressive
resources. Basle, with a tradition based on the work of Felix Weingartner
and Paul Sacher, boasts an outgoing contemporary music programme and has
just appointed Walter Weller as music director of both opera and concerts.
The Geneva-based Orchestre de la Suisse Romande may not match the quality of
the Tonhalle but, unlike its Zurich counterpart, it tours and records
regularly, and has a respected chief conductor in Armin Jordan. This
summer's open-air concert series in Geneva - promoted by the city government
and entitled 'Dialogue between Europe and Latin America' - has just the kind
of broad scope that the Zurich festival lacked.
Despite the economic squeeze, Zurich's problem is not lack of money. The
main arts companies continue to receive two-thirds of their budgets from the
city and cantonal governments, and audience figures have not been affected
by higher seat prices. Nor is there a lack of ideas: the 1991-2 season had
some good concert programmes, and the city's orchestras occasionally excel
themselves.
No, the real problem is the dearth of strong artistic personalities. There
has never been a driving force behind the June Festival such as one finds at
Lucerne, Edinburgh or Salzburg, because it is treated as little more than an
administrative function of the Zurich city government.
Likewise the Tonhalle, which has a near-monopoly on concert life: artistic
decisions are made through a series of slow-moving committees (as if
Switzerland's democratic principles had ever been conducive to art). Since
Rudolf Kempe in the mid-1970s, the orchestra has had a string of weak music
directors, and the post is now vacant.
The organisation lacks vision, spark and flexibility. The musicians have no
incentive to do more than turn up for their weekly subscription concerts.
There is little pressure for change. Zurich seems to like it that way, which
is why - beneath the sophisticated exterior - it remains a provincial city
in the heart of Europe.
But the potential is there. Just what can happen when a dynamic personality
arrives has been demonstrated at the Opera House these past 12 months.
Alexander Pereira, the company's young Vienna-born director, has persuaded a
nucleus of world-class singers to devote a substantial amount of their
working time to Zurich, for smaller fees than they receive elsewhere. He is
nurturing talented representatives of the younger generation and building
performances around a small stable of conductors of the calibre of Santi,
Harnoncourt and Inbal. He has found SFr3m from banks and other sponsors.
The repertoire has been an attractive mix of the modern, the exotic and the
popular. Next season opens with Bellini's Il pirata with Mara Zampieri,
followed by Massenet's Herodiade with Carreras and Bumbry and a Jonathan
Miller staging of Schreker's Die Gezeichneten (to coincide with a Klimt
exhibition at the Kunsthaus). True, the past season's new productions -
including Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre - offered few interpretative insights.
But the Zurich public has responded enthusiastically, and there's a buzz
about the house that has been lacking since the early 1980s.
It was bad luck that the end-of-season production of Capriccio did not show
the Opera House at its best. Strauss's Konversationsstuck is a work that
should thrive on the company's ensemble policy and the intimate, traditional
atmosphere of its theatre. But Cesare Lievi's production, designed by Paul
Lerchbaumer and Luigi Perego, treated the work like an anti-opera.
The characters and entertainments of Countess Madeleine's chateau were
transposed to a semi-abstract theatre setting of our own day - on the
premiss, perhaps, that the opera's aesthetic arguments deserve closer
attention than its music or visual trappings. The stiff, doll-like costumes
and a few select props paid lip-service to the 1770s period intended by
Strauss, but otherwise the performance unfolded in an atmosphere of extreme
artificiality, with little sense of context or style.
The music fared better, thanks to an orchestra on top form and to the
conductor, Ralf Weikert, whose fluent tempi and sense of instrumental
balance showed exemplary understanding of the meanderings of late Strauss.
Gabriele Lechner's Countess was ample and feminine, with enough whimsical
dignity, vocal elegance and stage presence to carry off the final scene.
Cornelia Kallisch, another young artist promoted by Pereira, made a
courageous stab at Clairon, but missed the diva-like hauteur of the
glamorous actress. Roland Hermann's gauche, melodramatic Count was totally
misjudged. Douglas Ahlstedt's tight-voiced Flamand and Olaf Bar's
disappointingly pallid Olivier were lacklustre suitors.
The Countess would have been better turning to Robert Holl's La Roche, a
sturdy man-of-the-world who used his rich timbre and wide expressive range
to create a genuine character.

NEWS of a fall in unemployment claims, improved store sales and sporadic

At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.80 at 3,324.08. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also firmer, up 3.95 at 414.23,
as were the Amex composite, 1.98 higher at 381.84, and the Nasdaq composite,
up 7.13 at 564.70. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 209m shares, and rises
outpaced declines by a ratio of more than two to one.
After falling more than 60 points in the last four trading days, the market
was due for a rebound yesterday, and early news of a 4,000 decline in weekly
jobless claims and of solid increases in department and chain store sales
provided the necessary spark.
Institutional buyers were spotted in the market early, and computer programs
buying a wide range of stocks added to the gains.
Among the blue-chips believed to have benefited from the programs and
renewed institutional interest were Caterpillar, up Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars
52 3/8 , Philip Morris, up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 79 1/2 , Ford, up
Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 44 3/8 and McDonald's, Dollars 1 5/8 higher at
Dollars 45 5/8 .
Among the retail stocks aided by the news of higher June sales were Gap
Stores, Dollars  3/8 firmer at Dollars 33 3/4 , Wal-Mart, up Dollars 7/8 at
Dollars 55, AnnTaylor Stores, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 19 7/8 , and JC
Penney, up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 70 3/8 . Lower sales, however, hit the
Limited, down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 19 7/8 .
Union Corp dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 after the company warned
that net income in the year ended last month would be between Dollars 1 a
share and Dollars 1.05 a share, well down on the Dollars 1.20 it earned in
the previous year.
Dow Jones edged Dollars  1/8 higher to Dollars 33 after the company reported
second quarter operating earnings of Dollars 89.3m, up 25 per cent on a year
ago.
Digital Equipment rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35 7/8 after winning an
estimated Dollars 750m 10-year contract to develop the world's first fully
digital telecommunications network for Optus Communications of Australia.
North American Mortgage made an impressive debut, with the stock finishing
at Dollars 12 1/8 in turnover of 1.8m shares after the company's 5.5m shares
were issued at a price of Dollars 11.50 each.
On the Nasdaq market, St Paul Bancorp rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 20 5/8
after posting second quarter earnings of 78 cents a share, up from 53 cents
a share a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO stocks posted a solid gain in active trading. According to
preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index rose 21.37 points, or
0.63per cent, to close at 3,439.75.
Advancing issues led declines by 347 to 247. Trading volume was 318m shares,
up from 24.3m previously, and trading value was CDollars 437.8m against
CDollars 268.9m.
Ten of the 14 sub-groups closed higher. The financial services group was up
1 per cent on index. Golds were up 0.97 per cent, as the New York spot gold
price was up Dollars 1.15 to Dollars 348.9.
Mining, industrial products, consumer products and energy all increased
somewhat.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Romanian farmers wait to see
how the land lies - A vast majority has not received titles to redistributed
property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAN Claudio Tanasescu, the mayor of Mogosoaia, a small farming village on
the outskirts of Bucharest, made the national media last month when he
became the first mayor in the county to complete distribution of land
ownership certificates.
To the outsider this may not seem a great achievement but in Romania the
farmers of Mogosoaia are among the lucky few. The Ministry of Agriculture
says that more than 70 per cent of agricultural land in the country is now
in private hands, but 18 months after the passing of a land law
re-establishing inheritance rights, less than 120,000 of Romania's 5.1m new
land owners have received titles to their property.
Difficulties in implementing the land law and carving up more than 8m
hectares of land surface are at the centre of the problems besetting private
agriculture in Romania which was one of Europe's richest farming nations
before communist rule.
With state farming, which still dominates livestock, milk and egg
production, showing a steady decline, Romania needs to boost private
agriculture to offset food shortages and cut agricultural imports, which
cost the country Dollars 243m in the first five months of this year.
Without titles to their property, private farmers cannot raise capital using
land as collateral. And without capital they have been unable to buy enough
seed or fertiliser, let alone invest in the new machinery needed for the
small plots of farmland that have taken over from large state co-operatives.
The Ministry of Agriculture estimates that more than a fifth of last year's
potential grain harvest was lost because of fertiliser shortages.
The absence of full ownership rights has also restricted the buying and
selling of property, leaving the country's private agricultural land in
uneconomical units of up to 10 hectares, the maximum amount granted to
re-instituted owners under the land law.
With plantings for many key crops - in particular, barley, maize and sugar
beet - well down on last year, prospects for the 1992 harvest seem gloomy.
Anticipating further shortages, the government has already banned the export
of most staple food items, while the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that
the country will import 1.5m tonnes of grain this year.
Some help is on the horizon. Last month month the World Bank announced a
loan of Dollars 100m for credits to private farmers. The Romanian government
has already set aside Dollars 26m to be lent to farmers at an interest rate
of 15 per cent, less than a fifth of the base rate, while part of a 32m Ecu
grant for agriculture from the European Community is being used to buy
measuring equipment needed to speed up the division of land.
However, many believe the key to revitalising agriculture in Romania lies in
re-awakening the population's interest in the land.
'With their policy of industrialisation, the communists tried to destroy
agriculture. Cities like Bucharest have more than doubled in the past two
decades at the expense of rural areas, which are now severely
under-populated,' says Mr Vasile Hreamata, an agriculture specialist at
Codif, a local consultancy firm, partly owned by Charterhouse Bank, the
UK-based merchant bank. 'Romanians have to be encouraged to move back to the
countryside: agriculture is where our future lies.'
Mr Hreamata believes there are already some positive signs. 'Up to 15 per
cent of the residents of Bucharest spend their weekends and holidays working
on land they have recently re-inherited, if it is within 100 km (60 miles)
of the city,' he says. And with unemployment expected to double to more than
1m, about 12 per cent of the workforce, this year, he expects that many will
find it profitable to move out of the cities permanently.
Mogosoaia's Mr Tanasescu agrees. 'There is renewed interest in farming and
initiative-taking,' he says, pointing to the speed with which local farmers
formed groups to work the land while ownership disputes were resolved.
Nearly 90 per cent of private land in the village is being farmed this year
by the three new associations that have replaced the state co-operative.
The mayor estimates that private farmers are twice as productive as the
co-operative was. 'There is a big incentive - with Bucharest less than 20 km
away, farmers can sell their produce in the markets very easily and
profitably. People are beginning to realise this.'
He believes productivity in the country will increase dramatically once
other mayors follow his example.
But returning the land to its rightful owners is a difficult and expensive
task, and in villages larger than Mogosoaia, the process is likely to take
much longer. It took the communists 12 years to collectivise Romania's
farmland. With the country desperately short of funds, the country's rich
farming potential may go unexploited for some time to come.

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Bond 'bridge' delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE launch of the link between Euroclear and Cedel, the two international
bond settlement houses, has been delayed for at least two months due to
technical problems.
The so-called 'bridge', which was finally agreed in March after prolonged
and at times acrimonious discussions between the two sides, was scheduled to
have been launched on October 9.
In a joint statement, the two said yesterday that problems in early tests of
the system had forced them to delay full tests.
The launch is now planned for early December, though no exact date has been
set.
'We're getting into areas of multiple processing we haven't done before,'
said Euroclear. 'We thought it was best to let the market know as early as
possible.'
Cemex, the Mexican cement company which is bidding Dollars 1.25bn for its
Spanish competitor Valencia de Cementos Portland, will have its Ba2 senior
credit rating reviewed for possible downgrade by Moody's Investor Service,
the US credit rating agency, Simon London writes.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank casts shadow over German paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bonds fell back yesterday as market participants
speculated that the Bundesbank could move to tighten monetary conditions at
next week's regular bi-weekly council meeting.
In the cash bond market, the 8 per cent Unity bond maturing January 2002
closed at 100.16, from 100.28 on Wednesday, for a yield of 7.96 per cent. On
the London international financial futures exchange, the September bund
contract closed at 88.05, from 88.09 at the opening. Volume was heavy at
nearly 60,000 contracts.
Most analysts said the authorities were unlikely to raise interest rates
across the economy. However, it is possible that the central bank will
tighten money market conditions.
For example, some traders suggested that the Bundesbank could limit the
amount borrowed by banks at the Lombard rate - at 9.75 per cent, the
emergency funding rate for financial institutions.
Alternatively, the Bundesbank could nudge the Lombard rate higher but stop
short of raising the discount rate.
In the past, the authorities have presented such action as a purely
technical move, because overnight call money is trading too close to the
Lombard rate. Yesterday, overnight money was trading at 9.61 per cent.
THE ITALIAN government bond market was volatile yesterday as traders took
positions ahead of meetings today at which ministers will try to reach
agreement on budgetary cuts.
On the Liffe, the September bond futures closed at 95.69, little changed
from the opening level, but slid to 95.33 during the day. In the cash
market, the 10-year benchmark fixed rate government bond also closed little
changed at 95.20.
The government is committed to cutting L30,000bn from this year's budget in
order to hit a deficit target of L128,000bn.
Treasury officials denied rumours that the government is considering raising
withholding tax by half a point to 13 per cent, but analysts said that some
tax increases were likely.
LONGER-dated UK gilts recovered some of their composure yesterday, shaking
off some of the effects of sterling's slide this week and rumours yesterday
that the next move in German interest rates might be up rather than down.
Shorter-dated bonds edged up only slightly, reflecting the greatest unease.
The 10 per cent bonds due 1994 advanced by  1/16 percentage point, to 101
3/8 .
Longer-dated issues, however, performed more strongly, with the 9 per cent
gilts due 2011 gaining  3/8 of a point to 101 3/32 , a yield of 8.77 per
cent.
AFTER early weakness related to the digestion of the Dollars 9.77bn in new
seven-year notes sold on Wednesday, US Treasury prices recovered to stand
firmer late yesterday on short-covering by dealers.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104,
yielding 7.592 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up 1/32 at 101
3/16 , yielding 4.348 per cent.
Although the seven-year auction went relatively well, dealers had to sell
securities at the shorter end of the maturity range to make way for the new
issue.
Sentiment was also not helped by a 4,000 fall in weekly state unemployment
insurance claims, although the decline was in line with market expectations.
Treasuries consequently spent the morning in negative territory.
Prices turned around later in the day, however, when buyers came in at the
lower levels and dealers covered their short positions.
JAPANESE government bonds closed in Tokyo little changed from Wednesday's
levels following a late rally.
The benchmark No 129 issue closed on a yield of 5.18 per cent, from 5.2 per
cent on Wednesday.

than first feared
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BELL ATLANTIC, one of the 'Baby Bell' US regional telephone companies,
yesterday said it would reduce its workforce less dramatically than it had
announced previously.
Bell Atlantic now expects to cut 3,450 jobs by the end of the year, below
its April estimates of 4,000 to 6,000.
Mr Charlie Crist, vice-president of human resources at Bell Atlantic, said:
'To date we've accomplished downsizing via voluntary means, and we will make
every effort to continue to use voluntary means in the future.'
The company, which employs about 75,700 workers, is reducing its workforce
to remain competitive. 'The Bell Atlantic telephone companies face
competition in every phase of our business except residential dial tone -
and competition for dial tone is coming in short order,' said Mr Crist.
Bell Atlantic said it would include 'specific mechanisms' for accomplishing
the job reductions in its contract negotiations with the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
which began in June. The existing contracts expire at midnight on August 8.

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Shaky consumer confidence holds
back US store sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF the biggest US retail groups yesterday reported same-store sales
increases for June that fell below the rates of improvement in April and
May, while some retailers suffered a sales decline, suggesting that consumer
confidence is still shaky.
The Limited, a specialty clothing chain, startled Wall Street by posting a 4
per cent fall in comparable store sales for the month ended July 4. The
company's share price fell Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 19 7/8 in New
York, having earlier touched a 52-week low of Dollars 19 5/8 . The Limited's
total sales increased 9 per cent in the five weeks to Dollars 585.3m.
However, the Gap, another specialty clothing retailer, saw same store sales
advance 5 per cent while overall sales rose 18 per cent to Dollars 242m.
Wal-Mart, the aggressively-expanding discount chain which is the biggest US
retailer by sales, turned in an 8 per cent advance in same-store revenues
compared with June 1991. The company's total sales climbed 23 per cent over
the previous year to Dollars 4.28bn.
Rival discount chain K mart reported a 2 per cent advance in comparable
store sales and an overall rise of 7.2 per cent, to Dollars 3.52bn.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, blamed the slim sales increase on unusually
cold weather in May and June. He added that there were two fewer days of
pre-Independence Day sales in 1991, and the company's reporting period ended
on July 1 this year compared with July 3 a year earlier.
The cool weather also hurt comparable domestic store sales at Sears Roebuck,
the Chicago-based stores and catalogue group, which fell 2.6 per cent. The
company said gains in clothing and home office equipment sales were offset
by a decline in air conditioning and related equipment in June. Overall,
sales slipped 1.7 per cent to Dollars 2.13bn.
However, JC Penney, the department store and catalogue group, said a
successful Father's Day fuelled strong clothing sales. It reported an 11.2
per cent increase in comparable store sales while total sales rose 11.4 per
cent to Dollars 1.47bn.
Other mainstream department store groups managed single-digit sales gains.
Dayton Hudson saw same-store sales rise by 2.1 per cent, while May
Department Stores managed a 3.3 per cent improvement and domestic comparable
store sales for Woolworth edged 0.6 per cent higher.

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Carmaker ratings under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREDIT quality of the world automotive industry is likely to remain
under pressure through to the mid-1990s because of slow demand for new cars,
shortening product life cycles and stiffened global competition, according
to Moody's, the US credit rating agency.
In its annual report on the motor industry, Moody's says there will be
greater variation in the financial strength of stronger and weaker players
in the US, Europe and Japan.
American manufacturers are expected to face a particularly difficult time.
The report says General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler face huge worker
healthcare and retiree benefit costs and will continue to have significant
disadvantages relative to Japanese companies which have set up plants in the
US.
The Japanese share of the US car market, currently running at 31 per cent,
is expected to continue rising as Japanese plants in North America gear up
to full production.
However, 'renewed competitiveness of US automakers, combined with the
diversion of Japanese expansion in Europe, should slow the pace of Japanese
expansion in North America during the second half of the decade or earlier'.
The most vulnerable US manufacturer will be Chrysler, which has the lowest
Moody's rating (B2) of any of the world's leading car groups.
The report says the company's recent equity sales will help support
operations while the company's new LH range of cars are introduced this
year.
But it adds that unless these new models 'achieve strong market acceptance,
a strategic alliance may prove critical to Chrysler's long-term survival'.
In each of the major markets, it adds, companies must invest large sums on
new models and production efficiency at a time of slow demand and
increasingly global competition.
This will be a particular challenge to medium-sized manufacturers and those
with primarily national sales.
The industry's average credit quality, which slipped from Moody's Aa range
in the mid-1980s to A2 now, is forecast to deteriorate to A3 over the next
year or two.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor, announced yesterday it would be
spending Dollars 957m to repurchase some 30 per cent of its stock from
investors at a price of Dollars 72 1/4 a share under a buy-back plan it
revealed last month.
The company announced on June 8 it would buy back up to 13m of its shares,
at a price of between Dollars 65 3/8 and Dollars 75 a share, under a
so-called Dutch auction tender offer.
This method, which became popular in the US in the 1980s and is now used for
most share repurchases, involves investors specifying a price at which they
would be willing to tender their shares.
The company then works out the lowest price which allows it to buy all the
shares it is seeking and offers that price for all validly-tendered shares.
The Dollars 72 1/4 price is the same as Wednesday night's close and compares
with the Dollars 65 3/8 at which the company's shares were trading before
the tender offer was announced.
General Dynamics said 13.2m shares were tendered at or below Dollars 72 1/4
. It would be exercising its right to increase the number of shares to be
bought and would therefore accept all properly tendered stock.
The share repurchase is part of a 'plan of contraction' announced by Mr
William Anders, chairman of General Dynamics, who is slimming the company to
four core defence businesses and returning excess cash to shareholders.

<TEXT>
A POTENTIAL impediment to the restructuring of the Foster's Brewing group,
the Australian brewer, has been removed with the withdrawal of legal action
by the National Mutual Life Association.
NML, Australia's second-biggest life office, yesterday dropped the legal
action it brought last week against Wardley Australia as agent for a
consortium of banks known as the Vextin syndicate.
The action challenged the appointment by BHP on June 2 of receivers to the
International Brewing (IBI) group, the major shareholder in Foster's. That
appointment prompted Wardley to request payment from NML of about ADollars
105m (USDollars 78.3m) under standby commitments on loans to IBI.
NML's writ claimed the funds should not be payable, but the Vextin syndicate
subsequently appointed its own receiver to IBI. Yesterday, Wardley said it
had received the amounts due from NML.
With the legal action withdrawn and two receivers appointed at IBI, interest
is focusing on the likely sale of group's main asset,a 38 per cent stake in
Foster's.

growth

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semi-conductor manufacturer, yesterday
reported second-quarter net income more than doubled from a year ago.
But the figure was 50 per cent lower than in the first quarter due to a
computer chip price war with arch-rival Intel.
The company warned at the start of this month that sales revenue was likely
to drop 15 per cent compared with that of the first quarter because of
severe price pressures on 386 microprocessors.
Yesterday it reported net income of Dollars 41.45m, or 43 cents a share
after preferred dividends, compared with Dollars 17.27m, or 17 cents a
share, in the same period of last year, and Dollars 84.90m, or 90 cents a
share, in the first three months of this year.
Revenues totalled Dollars 350m, up 18 per cent from the Dollars 296m of last
year, but down 14 per cent from the first quarter's Dollars 407.4m.
Mr WJ Sanders, chairman, said 'the quarter to quarter decrease in revenues
was attributable to severe price pressures in 386 microprocessors and a
decline in unit volumes.
'There was an abundance of supply, coupled with fierce price-cutting by our
major competitor.'
He added that personal computer manufacturers were confident that supplies
of 386 products would remain plentiful and had dramatically reduced their
inventories.
AMD's other product lines had shown 'strong growth' in the quarter.
For the six months the company reported net income of Dollars 126.35m, or
Dollars 1.33 a share, compared with Dollars 21m, or 19 cents a share, in
1991. Sales rose by 33 per cent to Dollars 757.6m.

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y wins 5-week extension to
debt scheme deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York yesterday gained a five-week extension from an Ontario court
to the deadline for filing a plan to restructure the bulk of its CDollars
13.5bn (USDollars 11.2bn) debt. The date has been put back from July 13 to
August 21.
Justice Robert Blair said the company was left without enough time to
negotiate a restructuring plan with its lenders because of the number of
other issues in dispute in the eight weeks since O&amp;Y and 28 subsidiaries
filed for protection from its creditors.
Justice Blair ordered O&amp;Y to file a brief report detailing the progress of
the restructuring plan on August 6 and a weekly report on the sale of
unencumbered assets to fund general, administrative and restructuring costs.
The ailing developer also disclosed yesterday that it had abandoned its
original strategy of negotiating simultaneously with all its creditors.
Instead, it plans to deal first with lenders to 11 specific buildings,
followed by other secured lenders and finally unsecured creditors.
Mr Steven Sharpe, an O&amp;Y lawyer, said the company expected to present
initial proposals next week to the project lenders.
When O&amp;Y Developments and 28 Canadian subsidiaries filed for court
protection in mid-May, they were ordered to present a restructuring plan by
July 13.
But this work has been overshadowed for the past two months by other
priorities, including the creation of creditor committees, arguments over
the distribution of administrative and restructuring expenses, and numerous
court applications.
According to Mr Sharpe, 'the company has spent time developing litigation
rather than negotiating strategy'. The O&amp;Y team, headed by Mr Steve Miller
of the US investment bank James D Wolfensohn, has recruited Mr Bill Kennedy,
who helped spearhead the restructuring of Campeau Corporation, the Canadian
property and retailing group which had a brush with bankruptcy in 1990.
O&amp;Y expects to complete its plan by August 21.
In another development, creditors are considering appointing an outside
adjudicator to decide on the extent to which the Reichmann family, O&amp;Y's
owners, should disclose its private wealth.
The creditors have expressed frustration at the reticence of O&amp;Y and the
Reichmanns to provide a full tally of assets which might be sold to augment
the company's cash-flow.
A lawyer for Royal Bank of Canada said yesterday that creditors were seeking
a mechanism 'which would provide all the information we need with a minimum
of fuss and a minimum of intrusion into private affairs'.
The dive in property values which has contributed to O&amp;Y's problems was
reflected in a deal involving two buildings outside Montreal, in which O&amp;Y
has a 20 per cent interest.
O&amp;Y and its partners are selling the properties for CDollars 350,000, which
is little more than half the mortgage owed on them.
OLYMPIA &amp; York (US) Holdings is in technical default on many of its office

'O&amp;Y US is in technical default on a great many obligations,' the spokesman

He said O&amp;Y technically defaulted on the 60 Broad Street building in

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: PDVSA cuts Dollars 1bn off
spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, is cutting its 1992 investment and
operating budgets by more than USDollars 1bn, according to Mr Gustavo
Roosen, the company's president.
PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies, was forced to reduce its
general budget primarily because of lower-than-expected oil prices on
international markets.
However, the fact that the company must pay its owner - the Venezuelan
government - a very high tax rate means funds available for capital
investments are severely squeezed. The group pays taxes in Venezuela
equivalent to 82 per cent of operating profits.
In Caracas, Mr Roosen said the company's capital investment outlays would be
reduced this year by around Dollars 530m, or 10.5 per cent, falling to
Dollars 4.5bn, while operating expenditures would be cut by some Dollars
485m (10.2 per cent) to Dollars 4.3bn.
He also said the company so far this year had arranged international
financing of Dollars 1.4bn for its investment programme, and it expected to
line up another Dollars 1.2bn over the next few months.
Much of this financing for the 1992-97 capital investment programme involves
supplier credits backed by government import-export institutions.
PDVSA officials have warned that the company's high tax burden would
seriously harm plans for investments.
Last year, PDVSA reported total international revenues of Dollars 22.3bn.

DOW JONES, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, yesterday reported a 25.2
per cent rise in second-quarter net income as the recovery in advertising
demand continued.
Dow Jones reported net income of Dollars 43.5m, or 43 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 34.7m, or 34 cents, in the second quarter of last
year.
Revenues rose 5.6 per cent to Dollars 467.5m. Operating earnings were 25.4
per cent higher at Dollars 89.3m. For the first six months of 1992,
operating income was up 30.6 per cent at Dollars 154.2m.
The company said the increase in net income for the three months ended June
30 was due chiefly to higher advertising lineage at The Wall Street Journal.
Compared with the same period of 1991, lineage increased by 6.4 per cent in
the second quarter and by 7.7 per cent in the first six months of 1992.
Earnings were also helped by lower interest expenses and by improved
performances at both Telerate, the electronic financial information service,
and at the Ottaway community newspaper subsidiary.
Operating income at the business publication division, which includes The
Journal, was 36.9 per cent higher at Dollars 44.7m in the second quarter.
Revenues in the division increased by 6.7 per cent to Dollars 209.9m.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones share price closed at Dollars 33, up Dollars
1/8 on the day.

EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest producer of photographic equipment,
yesterday said it planned to sell 10 non-core businesses, including its Atex
and Desktop Document Imaging operations which are now in the hands of
investment bankers.
Kodak, which is in the throes of its fifth restructuring since 1982, said it
had received offers for its Datatape, Estek and Videk businesses and for a
project that is part of the company's government contract business.
Mr Leo Thomas, president of Kodak's imaging group, said: 'We are still
determining how to proceed with the other four (businesses). This action is
in line with our commitment to exit businesses that are not well aligned
with the company's long-term strategy in imaging."
Kodak also said it had expanded an informal alliance with Canon, shifting
the focus to office products. The earlier office imaging arrangement with
Canon, which began in 1984, had concentrated on
original-equipment-manufacturer supply projects and technical exchanges.
The new arrangement will allow the companies to embark on joint development
and manufacturing projects.
Mr Thomas expects the terms of the Canon alliance 'will work to enlarge the
business by providing our customers with even better products and services.
The copy businesses represents significant sales and growth potential and
our new 1500 and 2100 copiers represent real product leadership.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Victory for American in TWA
gates bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WILMINGTON, DELAWARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines, one of the largest US carriers, yesterday won US
bankruptcy court approval for its proposed purchase of Trans World Airlines'
(TWA) three gates and 40 landing slots at Chicago's O'Hare airport.
Its victory came after United Airlines, American's big rival, withdrew a
competing offer for the assets in the middle of a court hearing yesterday.
TWA, the heavily-indebted carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, has been operating
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code since January. The need for court
approval over the proposed sale to American gave United an opportunity to
start a bidding contest.
United, based in Chicago, has an established presence at the key O'Hara hub.
American, however, has been trying to expand its operations there.
United had offered a slightly higher price for the assets - notes with a
stated value of Dollars 235m, against American's Dollars 211m. But TWA and
its creditors argued that a deal with American was more likely to close
quickly. Accepting a United bid, they claimed, could expose TWA to lengthy
litigation with American.
Under the deal with American, TWA will get two notes - a 'slot note' which
will continue to act as collateral for Shawmut National Bank, and a 'gate
note'. TWA can ask for the latter to be 'pre-paid' in cash, bringing in a
much-needed Dollars 41m. The pre-payment value of the slot note is Dollars
109m.
MAXXAM and Continental Airlines Holdings said they had a preliminary
agreement whereby a Maxxam-led investment group would invest Dollars 350m in
the bankrupt US carrier, Reuter reports. The companies said 'the investment
is to provide Continental with the financial resources to enable it to
emerge from Chapter 11 (protection from creditors) and assure its continued
operation as an independent company.'
The agreement, which is to become effective when Continental emerges from
Chapter 11, calls for the investors to get Dollars 325m in the restructured
Continental's secured notes. Investors would also receive 65m Class B common
shares with three votes per share and warrants to buy 130m class a common
shares.
The company's unsecured creditors will get 60m Class A shares, and other
constituencies could receive up to 15m Class A common shares.
After such a transaction, the Maxxam-led group would control about 72 per
cent of Continental, on a fully diluted basis.
Maxxam, based in Houston, Texas, operates in three main businesses,
aluminium, forest products and real estate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED overheads helped Stanley Leisure Organisation, the betting shops,
casino and snooker clubs group, increase pre-tax profits by 10 per cent,
from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 7.8m, for the year to May 3.
Turnover increased from Pounds 187.6m to Pounds 203.3m.
Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said it continued to be difficult to improve
sales in the two main divisions of racing and casinos, with the effects of
recession still apparent.
The casino division produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.9m, compared to
Pounds 5.3m, as margins improved and overhead costs were tightly controlled.
Profits from racing inched ahead from Pounds 6.12m to Pounds 6.22m. The
average number of shops trading during the year increased by 7 per cent to
325, reflecting the acquisition in November of the 25 Mawdsley shops for
Pounds 4.3m.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.3m related to the loss on the disposal
of the printing division.
A proposed final dividend of 3.3p makes a total of 5.2p (4.85p). Earnings
per share rose from 14.4p to 15.4p. There is a 1-for-4 scrip issue.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Jeyes seeks clean growth on the continent -
A look at BP's sale of its 75% stake in Globol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEYES, the cleaning products group, has announced an expansion into
continental Europe that will take sales from Pounds 61m to Pounds 100m and
elevate the company from the Unlisted Securities Market to a full listing.
The group is paying DM52.2m (Pounds 18.1m) for Globol, a 75 per cent owned
subsidiary of BP, which is based in Neuberg and makes domestic insecticides,
lavatory cleaners and air fresheners.
The acquisition will be financed through a 3-for-7 rights issue underwritten
by Barings at 385p, an 85p discount to Jeyes closing price yesterday.
The deal marks a turning point for both Jeyes, which emerged from Cadbury
Schweppes in a 1986 management buy-out and BP.
BP's sale of its 75 per cent stake fits with its new strategy of selling
peripheral activities and returning to the core business of oil exploration
and development. Late last year BP approached Mr Jimmy Moir, the managing
director who led the Jeyes buy-out, with the idea of the sale.
For Jeyes, which has grown rapidly since the MBO and has traded for much of
that time with Globol, the expansion provides a timely new business area to
develop.
Jeyes' bleach and disinfectant divisions are currently responsible for about
half of its sales. Its Parozone bleach brand is among the market leaders in
domestic bleaches and Jeyes fluid is the clear leader in disinfectants. Both
markets are mature in the UK and both shrank in volume terms last year due
to the recession. By comparison its automatic solid block lavatory cleaning
materials business is growing rapidly.
The group has commited large amounts of research to developing blocks for
cisterns and sticks for the inside of lavatory bowls. It has lifted its
market position to just behind Reckitt. Japan, in particular, has shown
dramatic growth where two years ago there was no market.
Nevertheless, to secure a longer term future, Jeyes recognised the need to
generate more cash and higher margins through the development of other
business areas and through international expansion.
Not that the group has been unsuccessful since the buy-out and its arrival
on the USM two years later. Mr Moir sold the plastic bottle blowing facility
and withdrew from distribution, thereby easing the demands on capital and
reducing exposure to risks not directly related to the main business.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 1.77m in 1987 to Pounds 4.93m last year
on sales doubled at Pounds 61.76m. Earnings per share grew in 1991 by 20 per
cent to 19.6p, despite the recession.
Jeyes bought Rufus Forpacknings of Sweden last year, expanding Jeyes in the
moist wipes market which has been the fastest growing grocery category in
the UK for the last two years.
But while wipes is a promising area, Jeyes still needed a more substantial
new business leg. It hopes Globol will provide it.
The acquisition will add domestic insecticide and air freshener products and
immediately give Jeyes direct access to the German market. The company will
also gain a more sophisticated research and development facility.
Once Globol is assimilated Jeyes' dependence on its bleach and disinfectant
output will be much reduced. Of the combined sales of about Pounds 100m some
30 per cent will come from lavatory cleaners, 17 per cent from bleaches, 16
per cent from insecticides, 14 per cent from disinfectants and 10 per cent
from wipes.
Mr Moir believes the greatest immediate opportunity is to reverse the
decline in Globol's operating profit margin. In 1988 it stood at 10 per
cent. The following year it had fallen to 8 per cent and by last year it was
3 per cent as a result of overheads rising faster than sales and a dramatic
increase in marketing expenditure.
That compares with 8 per cent for the Jeyes businesses, a level which Mr
Moir does not think is yet adequate to sustain internally financed growth.
Mr Moir has one distinct advantage in tackling the assimilation of Globol.
The Jeyes which he bought from Cadbury has certain similarities with Globol
under BP; both had tired brands, runaway overheads and sometimes lacked the
tight financial management displayed by smaller companies driving for
earnings per share growth.
While Jeyes has not trumpetted the fact, Globol will be faced with some
stringent financial targets not known since it was run by the family of Mr
Fritz von Philipp, the holder of 25 per cent of the stock. He is selling the
stake to Jeyes and joining the main Jeyes board.
Mr Moir is confident Jeyes' growth will continue rapidly this year.
Yesterday he confirmed that both sales and market share were growing in the
UK and that the board intended to declare an interim dividend of 3.1p, up 19
per cent on last year.

It is planned to develop the company into an industrial group by
acquisitions.
In the year to March 31 Carflow reported pre-tax profits, before exceptional
items, of Pounds 572,000. Channel is paying an initial Pounds 2.25m with a
further profit-related maximum payment of Pounds 300,000. Channel is making
a conditional placing of 6m shares and an underwritten rights issue of 2.93m
shares on a 2-for-1 basis at 20p, against a suspension price of 46p. Of the
proceeds, Pounds 1.38m will be used to pay part of the Carflow consideration
with the balance for working capital.
Most of the board is retiring, leaving only Mr Patrick Rogers who becomes
chief executive. He is joined by Mr Ling as chairman, Mr Barry Treacy,
executive director, and Mr Desmond Mitchell, finance director.
For the 1991 year Channel Tunnel Investments reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 10m (Pounds 806,000 profit). Losses per share were 0.8p (earnings
0.04p). At December 31 net assets were Pounds 225,000 with net assets per
share of 15p.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Hydro ahead 35% to Pounds 125m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP increase in sales south of the border enabled Scottish
Hydro-Electric to achieve a strong increase in profits in its first year
since flotation.
For the 12 months to March 31 profits at the pre-tax level rose 35 per cent
to Pounds 125.3m on a pro forma basis.
A proposed final dividend of 6.91p makes a 10.16p total - a level covered
2.5 times by earnings of 25.3p.
Total sales of electricity and related services rose 18 per cent to Pounds
638m. But within this, sales to England and Wales were up 58 per cent at
Pounds 116.8m reflecting the group's strategy of targeting the non-Scottish
market for its fastest growth.
A portion of the rise in profits also came from lower than expected fuel
costs. High rainfall enabled the group to draw more heavily on its hydro
resources, while oil costs fell slightly. Against this there were higher
coal and nuclear costs.
The retail business saw turnover rise 9.3 per cent to Pounds 29.4m, where it
yielded a profit of Pounds 1.2m - a small rise on the previous year.
Sir Michael Joughin, chairman, said the reported level of profits was
necessary to improve the group's power stations and distribution network.
Mr Roger Young, chief executive, said there were a number of projects in the
pipeline that would add to profits in the years ahead.
These included the start-up of the flow of low-cost gas from the Miller
field to the group's plant at Peterhead later this year, improvements in the
electrical connections with England over the next two years and the start-up
in early 1995 of its joint venture power station with Norweb at Keadby in
south Humberside.
Mr Young said the group's aim was to raise its dividend by 6 to 8 per cent
in real terms at least until the regulatory review of electricity pricing in
1995.
COMMENT
The result was slightly better than market expectations but the shares
closed 5p lower at 199p. One reason was that Scottish companies have always
commanded a premium in the market because of their stronger image and the
tighter terms on which they were launched. But the result also contained
hints of possible limits on future growth. Analysts felt that the profit
'kickers' that management has talked about in the past - like Miller gas -
could be less powerful than once thought. Emission controls will also define
the expansion of output. Next year's profit growth will be much more modest,
possibly only in single figures, emphasising that the first flush of
privatisation is over. The prospective multiple is about 10.5.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon's Pounds 6.3m loss triggers
plunge in share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARLAND Simon, the control systems specialist which saw its shares plunge
from 585p to 79p following a profits warning in February, yesterday watched
as they dived again, losing 28p to close at 40p.
The company announced a number of exceptional items which resulted in
pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.32m for the year to March 31, compared with
profits of Pounds 9.88m.
The accounts were also qualified by accountants Price Waterhouse. The
company said it was a 'technical qualification' about ownership of shares in
a loss-making information network company, PIL.
Mr David Mahony, who returned as chairman in February following the
resignation of Mr Roy Ashman, said the issue would soon be resolved and
Harland Simon would own 67 per cent of PIL. Mr Ashman has refused to sell a
27 per cent stake he retained in PIL.
Exceptional provisions of Pounds 5.1m were taken to cover all money owed by
PIL to Harland Simon. A Pounds 500,000 investment by Harland Simon's pension
fund in PIL will also be reimbursed and has been included in the provision.
Other exceptional costs totalled Pounds 3.57m and included a Pounds 300,000
pay-off to Mr Ashman, and bad debt provisions of Pounds 1.6m which included
disputed payments due from two companies controlled by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell.
A sell-off of non-core businesses is under way, and shareholders' approval
is being sought for the Pounds 8.1m disposal of Vickerys, a blade and screen
maker. Harland also said it was in discussions to sell Contraves, which was
acquired last year, and the loss-making Pro-Aqua and NEF.
Following these sales, Mr Mahony said, net borrowings would fall from Pounds
11.8m to 'very low levels'.
There was a loss per share of 36.5p (earnings 38.6p). In the February
profits warning, the company promised to maintain its final dividend.
However, the exceptional provisions almost used up distributable reserves,
and there is no final dividend.
Sales were Pounds 81.8m (Pounds 75.7m) due to inclusion of Contraves. But
administration expenses rose to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 7.96m).
COMMENT
Now that Harland's market capitalisation has fallen from over Pounds 100m to
just Pounds 7m, the easy conclusion is that it is either a screaming buy or
a basket case. The difficult bit is which. Assuming the confusion about PIL
is cleared up in the accounts, which the company is promising, and the
various disposals go through, its longer-term viability looks secure as a
much diminished company, possibly facing break-up. But despite protestations
to the contrary, sales this year must be hit by Harland's very public
problems. Analysts, who were not impressed by their meeting with the company
yesterday, are guessing on profits of between nothing and Pounds 2m. The
optimistic figure gives a multiple of 5, although any dividend must depend
on disposals. With so much up in the air, only rich speculators need pay
attention at this stage.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider flotation faces mixed
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAUNTON CIDER, the next flotation that the public has to consider after
furniture retailer MFI's offer closes today, would appear to have a lot
going for it.
The Pounds 78.5m share offer is an opportunity for investors to enter one of
the few growth areas in the drinks market - cider sales have been growing
consistently over the last five years, whereas the overall beer market is
shrinking - and Taunton has been sneaking market share from its larger and
already quoted competitor, Bulmer Holdings.
Of more questionable merit, Taunton also has an enviable record of
introducing new brands, particularly in the higher margin premium end of the
market - new brands carry a higher risk of failure as well as higher growth
potential if they take off.
At 140p, however, the issue is not cheap as it comes to the market at 15.1
times its historic earnings, and at about the same level as established
Bulmer. Half the 58.39m shares on offer have already been placed with
institutions and the balance underwritten at this price.
But what appears to be emerging from the gloom of a nervous market and the
poor public demand in The Telegraph Group and Anglian flotations is a retail
investors' strike now that the sale of shares through book-building has
effectively killed off the stags.
In the long term Taunton, like Anglian and MFI, is no doubt a sound
investment in good management and a growing market. But even if Taunton were
priced as a good buy, which it is not, there seems little to be lost from
waiting to see how the aftermarket develops rather than clawing back shares
from the underwriters.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at Colorgraphic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLORGRAPHIC, the adver-tising and direct mail group, has gone into
administrative receivership. The company had been in talks with its bankers
after breaching banking covenants.
Mr David Lovett and Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen have been appointed
joint receivers and hope to sell the company as a going concern. Analysts
said it looked unlikely that shareholders would recoup any of their
investment.
Colorgraphic's shares were suspended at 25p on June 30, valuing the company
at Pounds 4.2m. On the same day Mr Nick Winks, chief executive, and Mr Alan
MacLeod, marketing director, left the company. Mr Ron Welch, founder and
executive chairman, resumed the chief executive's role. He was not available
for comment yesterday.
The company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.3m in 1991, blaming the
recession. The 1991 accounts, published in March, received an unqualified
auditor's report. Net debt and finance lease obligations totalled Pounds
5.8m compared to shareholders funds of Pounds 8.8m.
Mr Welch, who holds 27.5 per cent of the shares, said in the annual report
that the board was confident it was 'very well placed to resume growth again
in 1992'. The report also showed that four leading institutions held
significant stakes in the group.
Analysts were surprised by the speed of the downfall. One said: 'It is hard
to reconcile the year-end position and the position now.'
Earlier this week Colorgraphic put two of its subsidiaries into
receivership. Its US and Dutch subsidiaries and The Decisions Group, its 50
per cent-owed UK associate, are not in receivership.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Setback for Hongkong Bank share trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON-BASED marketmakers yesterday backed out of quoting sterling prices on
the largest portion of shares in HSBC Holdings, parent company of Hongkong
and Shanghai Bank.
Although marketmakers will trade UK-registered shares, most HSBC stock will
continue to be traded in Hong Kong.
The decision could affect the company's weighting in UK stock indices.
Trading in the new sterling-denominated shares in HSBC is set to go ahead at
2.30pm today, after its Pounds 3.6bn offer for Midland Bank goes
unconditional.
Plans to quote a sterling price in Hong Kong-registered shares were
abandoned yesterday, when marketmakers decided there was insufficient
business to warrant a marketmaking commitment.
The decision has scuppered plans to use a SEAQ-listed quote in Hong
Kong-registered shares in the compilation of the FT-SE 100 share index.
That would have created a 'sensible weighting', reflecting the size of the
company, said Mr John Brumwell, a director of Prudential Portfolio Managers,
who sits on the FT-SE 100 Steering Committee. The committee meets this
morning to decide how to weight HSBC.
The move has raised fears among traders that the company will end up without
its full weighting. If all shares in the company are included, the company
would have a weighting of about 1 1/2 per cent in the index, compared with
only  1/2 per cent, if only UK-registered shares are included, analysts
said.
There are two classes of shares in the company: 800m ordinary 75p shares,
and 1,600m HKDollars 10 shares.
'A change in the expected composition of the index will alter the way index
funds behave,' said one equity analyst. A fund manager who tracks the FT-SE
index may buy the corresponding proportion of shares, and some investors
could decide they can stay away from the stock altogether, if it represents
only a small portion of the index, one dealer said.
HKDollars-denominated Hong Kong registered shares will continue however to
be listed on SEAQ International, the Stock Exchange's international
quotation system, but these shares are unlikely to be actively traded,
according to dealers.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Abbey to sell 39m shares unclaimed since float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL, the bank, is to sell off more than 39m shares left unclaimed
from its 1989 flotation and will give part of the proceeds to charity.
Mr John Fry, group services director, said the shares would be sold during
1993 but no decision had been taken about the timing or whether they would
be put on the market in a single allocation.
'We will not drip-feed them on to the market,' he added.
The shares, about 3 per cent of the total outstanding, have been held by
Abbey National since 1989 while it tried to find their owners.
Analysts yesterday welcomed the move, saying they expected it to add about
0.5p to Abbey National's earnings per share, expected by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
to be around 30.7p this year.
Abbey National is to write for a seventh and final time to the 390,000
customers who should have received the shares out of 5.5m eligible people,
telling them that they could still claim them. Mr Fry said Abbey National
did not know why so many of its customers had not taken up their offer of
100 free shares, worth Pounds 130 at the time of the float and around Pounds
273 today.
It will publish notices in six national newspapers on July 20. Customers who
believe they are entitled will have to complete forms demonstrating their
eligibility.
Abbey National will place between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the cash it
receives from the shares in Abbey National Charitable Trust which
administers its charitable donations.

FT  10 JUL 92 / MacGregor plans levy toprotect holidaymakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT moved swiftly last night to protect British holidaymakers
after the travel industry warned there was a strong possibility that a tour
company could collapse this summer, leaving customers stranded abroad.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said he would seek parliamentary
approval to bolster the fund which returns customers' money and brings them
home if their travel company collapses.
Mr MacGregor intends to impose a levy on the travel industry to replenish
the Air Travel Trust Fund, administered by the Civil Aviation Authority. The
fund was depleted by last year's collapse of the International Leisure Group
(ILG).
The levy is likely to be passed on to consumers. The Association of British
Travel Agents (Abta), yesterday suggested that a Pounds 1 levy be paid by
every purchaser of a charter package holiday.
Mr MacGregor said that, until legislation was introduced to provide for a
levy, the government would offer a guarantee to enable the fund to borrow
money.
Mr MacGregor acted after the CAA's accounts, published yesterday, showed
that the fund stood at Pounds 5.1m at the end of March after provisions,
compared with Pounds 26.7m a year earlier. Tour company failures since the
year-end will result in further calls on the fund of about Pounds 1.5m.
The CAA warned: 'There have been failures already in the present year, and
the market prospects for summer 1992 are unsettled. It is possible that
either a single failure of a relatively small company in the peak season, or
a number of small failures at the end of the season, could exhaust the
fund's assets.'
Abta said yesterday that 12 relatively small tour operators had collapsed
this year.
The two largest travel companies, Thomson and Owners Abroad, have warned
that continued price discounting could lead to the collapse of another
holiday company this summer.
Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson's managing director, said: 'You can't continue
to sell holidays at a large discount without losing money, and some people
haven't got money to lose.' Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad's chairman, said
that, if the current overcapacity in the holiday market continued into the
high season, a medium-sized company would probably collapse.
The fund is part of the system of consumer protection established in the
wake of the collapse in 1974 of Court Line, and its Horizon and Clarkson
Holidays subsidiaries. All providers of charter-based package holidays have
to arrange a bond, equivalent to between 10 and 15 per cent of their annual
turnover, to ensure payments are returned and holidaymakers repatriated if
the company collapses.
The trust fund is used if the bond is insufficient. The fund is more likely
to prove inadequate if a company fails during the summer, as this is when
the largest number of its customers require repatriation.
The CAA said it had made provisions in this year's accounts to cover
uncertainty over the final cost of the ILG collapse, currently the subject
of litigation.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Patten pledges to 'stand up for Hong Kong'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS PATTEN, Hong Kong's 28th and almost certainly its last governor,
declared yesterday that the colony's successful transition to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997 would provide a 'shining example to the world' of
partnership and co-operation between peoples and nations.
Mr Patten, speaking after his swearing in by Sir Ti-liang Yang, the colony's
Chief Justice, pledged to devote all his energy to representing the
interests of the people of Hong Kong as 'strongly and wisely' as he could.
'I will stand up for Hong Kong as you would wish me to do, courteously and
firmly,' he said.
'What we have to do in the closing years of this tumultuous century is to
turn from earnest hope to firm reality that historic and far-sighted concept
 -'one country, two systems'.'
The hope of a smooth transfer is in stark contrast to the current
acrimonious state of Anglo-Chinese relations. The two sides have failed to
agree on the terms of financing the colony's multi-billion-dollar airport -
a deadlock which has the potential to undermine confidence in the colony if
not settled soon - and China is suspicious that Mr Patten will attempt to
accelerate the pace of democracy in Hong Kong.
Mr Patten used his address to try to begin repairing relations with Beijing,
stating that good co-operative relations were his 'sincere aim and profound
wish'.
He said he would do all that he could to remove misunderstandings and build
trust. But he reminded Beijing that 'trust is a two-way street'.
He did not explicitly raise the issue of democracy, but, in what might have
been an oblique reference to it, he said he had no 'secret agenda'.
'My only agenda is the one I have laid before you today. It is clear. It is
public. And so it will remain.'
The new governor did not, however, shrink from reminding his audience of the
need to preserve and safeguard Hong Kong's way of life and freedoms.
On domestic politics, Mr Patten promised an 'open and accessible' style of
leadership, but one based firmly on the premise that the ultimate
responsibility of leadership rests with himself 'in what is and will remain
an executive-led government'.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Fight for the consumer's ear: The two different formats
seeking to replace tape recorders are in fierce competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's biggest consumer electronics companies are bracing for battle.
The prize is the lucrative market for the next generation of portable music
players. For the protagonists, Sony on the one side, Philips and Matsushita
on the other, victory could determine whether they consolidate, or slip
from, their positions at the top of the industry during the 1990s.
The mega-contest centres on mini-products: Sony's MiniDisc, and the Digital
Compact Cassette which has been co-developed by Philips and Matsushita. The
MiniDisc, a small recordable disc, will be launched by the end of this year.
The digital compact cassette will reach the high street sooner - by the end
of September - thus gaining an important head start over its rival.
In both cases, the new products are aimed at replacing the traditional tape
recorder and tape cassettes, for decades the dominant portable music system,
but now facing decline. Sales of prerecorded cassette tapes, which peaked in
1989 at about 780m units, last year amounted to just 638m units. Industry
analysts expect a further decline this year.
Consumer electronics companies believe that the market for portable audio
equipment - 'ghetto blaster' tape recorders, Walkmans, car stereos and other
portable audio equipment - is also at risk. They fear that the market, which
is worth nearly Dollars 10bn in the leading industrialised countries alone,
according to BIS Strategic Decisions, the high-technology consultancy group,
will follow the downward path of cassette tapes.
Industry executives draw a parallel with the LP, which started to decline in
sales from about 1978, even before CDs were introduced by Sony and Philips
in 1982. 'The LP had become old-fashioned,' says Mr Gerry Wirtz, senior
product manager at Philips in charge of DCC.
Sony is particularly worried that the declining popularity of cassettes
threatens sales of the Walkman, the portable cassette tape recorder which
has revolutionised music-listening habits since its introduction in late
1979.
'The Walkman is 12 years old and 100m units have been shipped already,' says
Mr Norio Ohga, president of Sony. 'We must think seriously of replacing the
Walkman.'
While Philips executives agree with Mr Ohga that the days of traditional
tapes and tape recorders are numbered, the two companies differ over the
reasons for their decline and how they should be replaced.
Philips is firmly committed to the tape format for portable audio. It claims
its studies show that people who like to carry their music around with them
prefer to do so on tapes, rather than discs. CDs are perceived as vulnerable
to physical shocks and therefore not an appropriate medium for portable
equipment, says Mr Wirtz.
The Dutch group believes the main reason consumers have lost interest in
cassettes is because they do not provide the crisp, clear sound of digital
CDs. It also assumes that, while consumers want something better than
cassette tapes, they will not be willing to throw away the tape collections
they have accumulated over the years. As a result, DCC players have been
designed to play the old analogue cassettes as well as the new digital ones.
Sony takes a very different view of the development of the portable audio
electronics market. It sees the declining interest in cassette tapes largely
as the result of consumers' disenchantment with tapes as a medium.
'Tape is a 30-year-old format,' says Mr Eric Kingdon, technical managing
director of Sony UK. 'Putting the word 'digital' in front of tapes is not
going to stir a market that is losing momentum.'
Consumers, according to Sony, want digital sound, but they also want random
access - the ability to find the beginning of a certain track without having
to wind a tape forwards or backwards. Discs can provide this feature,
cassettes cannot.
'The main reason why cassettes have fallen in sales is because they lack
this feature,' says Mr Ohga. 'DCC is not the right medium to address the
demands of consumers.'
Sony says that it is not particularly concerned by the fact that consumers
will have to throw away their old cassettes, or continue to use two formats
if they switch to MiniDisc. The company points out that CD players could not
play vinyl discs, and that did not prevent them from replacing record
players. Similarly, the 8mm video format is not compatible with VCRs but it
is still the dominant camcorder system.
As with CDs and video cameras, the problem facing Sony and Philips is that
there is likely to be only one winner in the battle between the MiniDisc and
DCC. Few in the industry believe the market is big enough to sustain two
competing formats. 'I don't think co-existence is possible,' Mr Ohga states
unequivocally.
For both companies, the stakes are raised even higher by the business
difficulties they currently face. Philips is in the middle of a group-wide
restructuring programme aimed at slimming operations and raising efficiency
and profitability. While the Dutch group did return to profit in 1991, it
has continued to suffer from weak consumer demand. Last month it warned that
a deepening crisis in the consumer electronics market could reduce profits
for the full year below last year's figure. Shares fell by almost 20 per
cent on the day of the announcement.
Sony is also facing problems. Last year, operating profits from its
worldwide consumer electronics business fell sharply to Y113bn (Pounds 481m)
from Y249bn. The parent company in Japan suffered its first operating loss
since 1958, falling Y20.5bn into the red, compared with a profit of Y72.2bn
in 1990.
It has also suffered the humiliation of seeing Betacam, its VCR format,
driven out of the world's main markets by the VHS system developed by JVC, a
Japanese manufacturer of audio-visual products. Sony's Digital Audio Tape, a
pioneering digital tape format, has also proved a commercial failure.
Both companies are therefore in pressing need of a new hit product. The
introduction of a successful heir to the cassette tape recorder presents the
perfect opportunity to achieve their objectives of boosting income and
establishing control in a new product area.
In terms of technology the two systems are fairly well matched. Both produce
high-quality, digitally recorded sound, and while Philips' DCC will be able
to play old analogue cassettes it will not record on them. Nor will the new
tapes be playable on conventional tape machines. Similarly, while the
MiniDisc player offers random access it will not play any other format and
MiniDiscs themselves cannot be played on CD players.
The deciding factors in the contest are therefore expected to be the extent
to which Philips and Sony succeed in signing up software suppliers - in
particular the large record labels - and in licensing their technologies to
hardware manufacturers.
As demonstrated in the 1980s by the competition between the two rival video
systems - VHS and Betamax - the success of a new format depends crucially on
how much software is available to be played on it. Licensing technology to a
wide range of hardware manufacturers is also vital to ensure that a format
becomes the dominant system in a particular market.
In both respects, Philips appears to have a slight edge. It has put together
an impressive marketing and publicity machine through which it has managed
to convince the big hardware manufacturers, many of which are Japanese, to
license its technology and bring their own DCC machines to the market.
Matsushita, a co-licensor of the DCC technology, has already announced plans
to bring out its players by Christmas.
Philips has also won agreements from leading record producers, including
even Sony Music, to bring out hit songs on DCC. Artists whose music will be
available on DCC include Bryan Adams, U2, Elton John and the Fine Young
Cannibals.
What is keeping many record companies from signing up for MiniDisc is their
fear that it is likely to prove more damaging than digital cassettes to
sales of CDs. Their argument is that if consumers like MiniDiscs, they may
replace their CD collections with the smaller discs. On the other hand, they
believe, the DCC tapes are sufficiently different from CDs to form a
separate market.
Mindful of protecting the CD market, which has seen worldwide sales rise
steadily to 900m units last year from about 738m units in 1990, many record
companies are therefore leaning towards the Philips format.
As a result, Sony is looking somewhat lonely with its list of supporters.
The main record companies such as Time Warner and PolyGram, which is 80 per
cent owned by Philips, are conspicuously absent.
Unless Sony can win over the record companies in time for the launch of
MiniDisc, it will be facing a formidable opponent in the marketplace with
little more ammunition than a conviction that the consumer will fall for its
vision of the portable market. The Japanese company's convictions have often
proved right in the past; the Walkman and the Handycam video camera are the
most noteable examples. But winning the consumer over in the current fray is
likely to be more difficult.
One reason, in addition to the strong competition from Philips, is the
confusion faced by potential buyers. People who replace their cassette tape
players will not know for several years how long their chosen format will
survive. Those who choose wrongly may have to invest in another system
within a couple of years.
Both Philips and Sony claim that they have done their best to achieve a
smooth transition to thereplacement for cassette tapes. Each side blames the
other for rocking the boat and for failing to collaborate on technologies to
replace the tape machine. But neither has been willing to bend its position
to avoid burdening consumers with the uncertainty of competing formats.
Ironically, the consumer may well think it best to sit tight until a victor
emerges from the fray. If that happens, the battle to replace the humble
tape recorder may in fact extend its lease of life.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Arts: Reactions to vintage Verdi - Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The way Europe looked at the start of 1867, it was taking a risk to
designate the Universal Exhibition in Paris a symbol of peace and harmony.
On July 1, prize-giving day, Napoleon III received the news he dreaded:
Emperor Maximilian of Mexico had been shot by a firing squad. How one
staunch republican reacted to the news is the theme of a highly original
exhibition at the National Gallery: Manet: The Execution of Maximilian.
Maximilian's story reads like vintage Verdi. He was an under-employed young
Habsburg who, disastrously, agreed to let a French expedition install him in
Mexico. The French army pulled out when the Americans turned menacing and
the republicans, led by Benito Juarez, too strong to smash.
The emperor's wife, Charlotte, begged for perfidious Napoleon's help, then
went mad. She was shut up in a castle in Belgium and died in 1927.
Maximilian's troops were overwhelmed, he was tried, then shot at the Hill of
Bells with Generals Miramon and Meja.
The whole of Europe was enthralled by the tragedy. For Edouard Manet, it
suggested a painting which would pull in the crowds at his one-man
exhibition which still had months to run.
At once he started a monumental canvas showing the instant when the bullets
found their mark. In fact, as he learnt, the wretched Emperor needed to be
finished off with a double coup de grace from the figure Manet shows waiting
on the right.
As more and more such details of the execution appeared in the newspapers,
Manet started afresh. In the end, he painted three versions. These now hang
together for the first time this century: the first version from Boston, the
National Gallery's own fragmentary second version which was rescued by Degas
after Manet's death, and the completed version from the Stadtische
Kunsthalle in Mannheim, where the exhibition will also be seen.
One change was to replace the Mexicans' sombreros and flared trousers with
the correct, French-style uniforms. The emperor was shown grasping the
Indian general's hand, and in the Mannheim version the execution takes place
by a cemetery wall, over which peek a crowd of grieving Indians. Sunlight
floods the scene and behind the mourning cypresses the sky is a brilliant
blue: Maximilian reportedly said: 'I always hoped to die on a day such as
this.'
However, Manet's realism did not mean that he felt bound to produce a
substitute for a non-existent photograph. Juliette Wilson-Bareau's
fascinating exhibition book, (National Gallery, Pounds 12.95) brings out
still more clearly the wilful discrepancies in the Mannheim version.
The generals were shot in the back as traitors. Maximilian did not stand,
Christ-like, in between them. Mexican soldiers did not wear spats, but
Manet's composition needed the slashes of white against black. How strongly
the bold simplicity of military uniforms appealed to Manet's eye, we see
from his famous portrait of the boy fife-player, lent by the Musee d'Orsay.
Another of the exhibition's themes is political censorship. As usual, the
censors were inconsistent and ineffectual. Whereas the press were allowed to
churn out heart-rending accounts of the Mexican disaster, the censors in
advance banned both Manet's painting and his superb lithograph.
However, they were defeated by a bizarre craze for cartes de visite
photographs showing the firing-squad, Maximilian's mummified corpse, and his
bullet-shredded shirt.
For Manet's circle, the accessible version of his masterpiece was the
intensely dramatic oil-sketch, on loan for the show from Copenhagen. He gave
it to his last mistress, Mery Laurent, who hung it behind her piano.
Lithographs and a remarkable watercolour from Copenhagen show Manet's
anguished response to the Paris Commune of 1871. It is a little
uncomfortable to discover Manet actually went to watch a military execution
of Communards.
But then, it is the triumph of this exhibition to present a Manet who is not
the dandy, strolling about Paris in search of 'the heroism of modern life',
in Baudelaire's famous phrase.
Here instead, is a painter of popular icons of heroism. Although it is
somewhat diluted in Manet's portraits of left-wing politicians,
old-fashioned heroism is at full strength in his scene of the naval battle
between the English and the Americans and in The Escape of Rochefort, the
'red' aristocrat and journalist.
Bravery in fancy dress made the bullring irresistable to Manet, even before
he visited Spain. His Dead Toreador from Washington is immaculate in black
and white, a trickle of dark blood under his shoulder. Yet another coup de
theatre is for this famous painting to be seen beside a little-known
17th-Century Italian painting, The Dead Soldier.
This extraordinarily haunting work has been in the National Gallery since
1865. Previously, it was in a Paris collection, where Manet could have seen
it and - given that it was considered to be by Velazquez - he almost
certainly did.
As one critic pointed out at the time, the two corpses look remarkably
alike. Yet we also learn from the artists' very different intentions. The
soldier is a vanitas image, meant to make viewers reflect on the futility of
worldly ambition.
Manet's painting belongs to a secular age: what counts is the gaze of the
public, not that of the Deity. In the bullring, as on the Hill of Bells, it
took a mere split-second to end a man's life.
The artist could take that instant and, through the magic of his brush edit
it into an enduring monument to the nobility of the human spirit.
National Gallery, London. Manet runs to 27 September. Information on (071)

FT  10 JUL 92 / Arts: South African theatre after apartheid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GREIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken the visit of an American director to stir the stagnant waters
of South African theatre. Two decades of cultural isolation, combined with
the widely-felt need to testify against apartheid, have created a local
drama scene in South Africa of much energy but little variety. Now
directors, writers and actors face new possibilities. But inevitably many
find it difficult to shift their focus, to find new ways of saying and
showing.
Professor Richard Schechner of New York University is the first
international director of repute to work in South Africa for a long time. He
is a guest director at the current Standard Bank National Festival of the
Arts in Grahamstown, the elegant university town which was once at the heart
of 19th century settler-Xhosa wars.
Schechner, who was jointly sponsored by the bank and the US government, has
brought August Wilson's play, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. He cast and
rehearsed it in Johannesburg, using mainly unknowns, before opening it at
the festival this week.
The play is set in a Chicago blues recording studio in the Twenties and is a
cameo of racial attitudes then and now. Unlike most of the 120-odd plays at
the festival, it is not set behind a proscenium arch; instead, Schechner
uses the entire auditorium as a stage. Thus the focus falls on the stage,
rather than circumstances alluded to; on direction rather than performance;
and on unspoken intimacies and nuances of relationship rather than
statements. This obliqueness is foreign to the often strident realism and
rhetoric of local theatre as it has succumbed to the twin pressures of
reduced public funding of the arts and anti-apartheid orthodoxies.
The production represents one fruitful direction for the future. Others are
emerging as artists face what Nadine Gordimer, echoing the psychologist
Erich Fromm, calls the 'fear of freedom'.
For the first time, a state-sponsored arts council, the Performing Arts
Council of the Transvaal, has staged a work by the Nobel Prize-winning
Nigerian poet and dramatist, Wole Soyinka. His Death and the King's
Horseman, staged with statuesque simplicity, depicts the conflict between
British colonial values and tribal custom. The tribal scenes are written
with often operatic flamboyance, the colonial with easy, sardonic wit. The
production boasts several fine performances, notably one of weary cynicism
by one of the country's most impressive actresses, Nomhle Nkonyeni, who
started her career with Athol Fugard's Serpent Players in Port Elizabeth in
the Sixties.
A variant of the focus on the local is the blending of Fugardian
psychological realism with the exuberant expressionism of song-and-dance of
black improvised theatre. The blend is still uneasy, with marked
gear-changes from action within the stage, which the audience observes, to
action intended to arouse the audience. Breaks in narrative flow for a
toyi-toyi performance (toyi-toyi is the march dance used by black militants)
to underline a politically correct sentiment demand a degree of flexibility
of the audience.
This artistic eclecticism is seen, for example, in Life imn Hostels by the
Zakheni Cultural Group, which also demands trilingualism, being performed in
an insouciant mixture of English, Afrikaans and Zulu, like many workshopped
plays. The play takes place in a hostel for migrant mine-workers: intense,
poignant revelations of degradation break suddenly into rousing tribal songs
and dances; horrifying disclosures are swiftly followed by mordant comedy.
Such violent disjunctions are smoothered in Ekhaya-Museum Over Soweto by
painter/writer Matsemela Manaka. His musical is about a returning exile's
dream of establishing Soweto's first museum. A band is on stage; the master
of ceremonies is drunk and libellous; uplifting speeches are made at the
audience, and calabashes of beer passed round. The ritual of the opening
ceremony is intentionally blurred with the rituals of performance.
Multi-culturalism is more smoothly achieved in The Nuga Moya Cinderella by
Natal's Theatre for Afrika. Their musical burlesque is set in a rural post
office, complete with a gallery of South African types: the officious
postmaster, the right-wing clerk, the resentful, militant son of the dead
tea-lady. To raise money for his education, the post office staff stage a
version of Cinderella for the village, setting their version in a Zulu
kingdom. The white right-wing clerk plays the king; the handsome prince is
played as a Soweto rock singer who is not too interested in rural grandeurs;
the ugly sisters are played by a white and a black clerk. Ostensibly a light
comedy, it consciously creates an image of hope and co-operation,
identifying what is and what might be in the country at large.
Facing new freedoms has also encouraged South African playwrights to deal
with topics previously considered insignificant: preserving wildlife; sexual
inequality; sexuality itself. A bizarre feature of this new freedom is some
nostalgia for the immediate past - of about three years ago. An Afrikaans
duo has disinterred early Boer and Afrikaans songs, which they perform with
all the flair of cabaret and disco. When they do the national anthem, Die
Stem and come to the verse which talks of dying for the country, black
audience members are stalking out, to the performers' apparent surprise.
White audience members took the same line when the country's best-known
satirist described sex with identical twins in what is his first mature,
well-made play, Die Vleiroos (The Marsh-Rose). Pieter-Dirk Uys's play is his
first to plumb beneath political surfaces. Like a surprising number of new
South African works, it features a motif of a father-figure, dead but still
influential, whom strong, living and often crazy women fight against. It's
an apt metaphor for the emergent South African theatre.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Management (GEC at the Crossroads): The shape of things to
come - Part Five, Charles Leadbeater concludes his series with a look at
what the future holds for the group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attractive 19th century country house in the village of Dunchurch just
outside Rugby in the Midlands was the setting this spring for an event
almost without precedent in General Electric Company's history.
On the evening of Sunday March 8 about 150 of the company's top managers
from around the world gathered in the oak-panelled dining room of GEC's
management college to discuss the group's future.
Usually the Stanhope Gate group, the small team of top executives from the
company's London headquarters, dreams up and discards ideas about how GEC
should develop, and managers of subsidiaries plan the future of their own
businesses. The only previous occasions when managers from operating units
had gathered to address the future of the group was during two brief
conferences in the 1970s.
Describing the Dunchurch gathering, Mr Murray Easton, managing director of
the Yarrow shipyard in Glasgow, says: 'It was the first time that many of
the people there had met and there were some businesses I did not know were
in GEC.'
The conference, entitled GEC In The '90s, began the following morning in the
lecture hall. Proceedings got off to a light-hearted start.
Lord Weinstock, the group's managing director, praised the way Lord Prior,
the chairman, had trailed around the world drumming up orders. Lord Prior
shot back: 'But Arnold, you always tell managers: 'Don't praise people
because they will just ask for more money.'' Lord Weinstock replied: 'From
now on you can get praise or money, but not both.' Thereafter the discussion
became very serious.
The group has rarely faced a set of challenges as great as those it faces
now. Lord Weinstock outlined how the group had to expand through joint
ventures in continental Europe and into new markets, if it was going to
offset the decline of traditional defence and public-sector markets in the
UK.
Mr David Grant, the recently appointed technical director, urged executives
to develop visionary plans to use new technology and open up markets, while
Mr David Newlands, finance director, described how GEC's financial controls
could be tightened further.
GEC executives are not the only ones thinking seriously about the company's
future. Earlier this year the Prudential, GEC's largest shareholder,
completed an exhaustive six-month study of the group.
The Prudential team gave GEC a clean bill of health. A senior executive at
the Pru explains: 'GEC's operating units are generally in good shape, run by
good managers. Not much more could be squeezed out from them than has been.
Our judgment is that GEC will now tick over quite nicely delivering earnings
growth of 7 per cent or 8 per cent a year, which for the 1990s with
inflation at about 4 per cent will be a good performance.'
The GEC-Alsthom joint-venture will make large sums of money. But this raises
a question that will haunt GEC through the 1990s. Can the group spend this
cash to generate growth in areas such as communications and services,
consumer and medical electronics which will compensate for the contraction
of its traditional UK public-sector markets? If it cannot, GEC could become
a shrunken shadow of the mighty industrial combine which it was designed to
be when it was created in the late 1960s.
And the answer to the question will not just affect the welfare of GEC's
employees and the wealth of its shareholders. GEC is more than simply a
private company; it is the industrial mirror of many of the strengths and
weaknesses of British society. Its performance has always been public
property because it is a reflection of public policy. For almost three
decades the group has struggled beneath a heavy burden of public expectation
that it could become Britain's national champion in electronics, an
instrument of manufacturing revival. The company has always straddled, and
sometimes been caught between, the public and private sector, business and
politics, industry and the City.
It has had a tangled, symbiotic relationship with the British state. In the
late-1960s, the Labour government sponsored its creation, through the
acquisition of Associated Electrical Industries and English Electric. That
merger in 1968 was supported by both the then Board of Trade and the
Industrial Reorganisation Corporation. Since then it has supplied successive
governments with everything from telephone exchanges to torpedoes, radar
systems to railway rolling stock. In the 1980s it was rudely shocked by the
Thatcher government's policies of privatisation and liberalisation which
ripped through its once cosy markets.
The high hopes which were invested in GEC have exposed it to great
disappointment. Over the past two decades accusations of short-termism,
insularity and complacency have accumulated at its door.
This welter of criticisms boils down to the allegation that GEC has lived
off some of the best assets inherited from Britain's industrial past,
without doing very much to secure its industrial future. In its very
creation it was supposed to help arrest industrial decline, instead it has
merely profited from it. Lord Weinstock, his critics allege, has made money
from the course of history when he should have tried to change it.
Most of the controversy about the group can be traced to the innocuous
four-page documents which Lord Weinstock first issued to his managers in the
late 1960s. It is the monthly financial report which the managing directors
of subsidiaries have to send back to him each month.
The report is disarmingly simple. About seven financial ratios compare such
items as sales, stocks, average pay, and capital employed against the
previous year and the budget for the coming year. On the final blank page
managers describe their plans for the business.
These monthly reports are the outer extremities of GEC's nervous system.
They are how the subsidiaries communicate with the brain at Stanhope Gate.
The financial details provide GEC headquarters with the common denominator
to assess the performance of its widely differing subsidiaries.
Mr Ron Turner, managing director of the New Jersey-based GEC-Marconi
Electronic Systems, which was acquired by GEC in 1990, explains: 'The
dialogue with GEC is mainly financial rather than about technology or
strategy.'
The company's finance officer gets two or three phone calls a day from GEC
headquarters; the technological exchange, which is partly constrained by US
Department of Defense regulations on technology transfer, is much less
frequent.
Lord Weinstock pores over the reports each month, often marking them in red
felt-tipped pen and scrawling criticisms on the back page. If he finds a
number he does not understand or an unwelcome development such as ballooning
stocks, he pushes a short code on his telephone which links him to his
manager and the interrogation begins.
Managers know that Lord Weinstock may call them at any moment to pounce upon
an aberrant number. As a result they are rarely far away from their ratios.
Most managers are like Mr Paul Barron, the manager of the Rushton Gas
Turbines factory in Lincoln, who keeps his ratios in the top drawer of his
desk, ready to be pulled out if the telephone rings. Mr Bill Korb, the
managing director of Gilbarco, the petrol-pump maker based in North
Carolina, goes one step further. He keeps duplicates in his office, at home
and in his car in case Lord Weinstock tracks him down when he is on the
move.
The climax of this financial ritual is the annual budget meeting. In the
early months of the year small knots of managers can often be seen waiting
nervously in the lobby at Stanhope Gate as they prepare to squeeze into one
of the small lifts which will take them to the upper floors for their annual
grilling. The intimidating team of interrogators usually includes Lord
Weinstock, his son Mr Simon Weinstock, Mr Newlands, Mr Malcolm Bates, deputy
managing director and Mr Grant.
Mr Carey Nolan, managing director of Picker, the Michigan-based maker of
medical scanners, takes about three months to prepare his plans before
flying to London. He says: 'No one tells me what ratios to aim for, what
profits I should earn. They expect me to come in with an aggressive budget.
It is my budget, my plan for the business.'
For the managers their annual audience with Lord Weinstock is nerve
wracking. One US executive explains: 'Once Lord Weinstock gets hold of
something he will not let go. You have to be prepared to be questioned on
any aspect of the business in the most minute and trivial detail.'
This simple set of disciplines is the source of GEC's enduring strength, its
financial security. It serves two main purposes.
First, it is the way the small team at GEC headquarters keeps a check on
what is going on in the subsidiaries, that reported profits reflect reality.
Mr Jeff Johnson, Gilbarco's finance director, explains: 'You could not
fiddle the figures when you are reporting this clutch of ratios because if
you tried to boost profits artificially it would soon show up somewhere else
in the numbers. Lord Weinstock would spot it in an instant.'
Second, the top management uses the ratios to drive the subsidiaries to
improve their performance. Mr Nolan says: 'It can be a pain but we are
constantly challenged on different aspects of the business. Lord Weinstock
is a terror about capital employed. I guess we would be more casual about
the management of our assets if the top-line profits kept growing, but
Arnold breathes down our neck.'
It is commonplace for GEC's financial controls to be described as rigorous.
However, they can be surprisingly lax in identifying problems in the
businesses.
Mr Maurice Dixon, who oversees GEC's metrology division - mainly Gilbarco,
Avery the weighing machine maker and GPSL, the semi-conductor manufacturer -
says: 'A business can seem all right through the numbers but it can be going
bad. Or the numbers can suggest a business is struggling while it is
actually getting better.'
A prime example of this was GPT, the telecommunications business. The
figures showed this was earning handsome profits from its core business
supplying British Telecom with large switches. But in reality by the
late-1980s it was seriously adrift, with little prospect of new business
growth to offset the impending decline in its BT business.
Mr Peter Gershon, GPT's managing director, explains: 'GPT was overmanned and
heading for serious problems in some areas. The management team was
introspective. It was not aware of the wider market outside BT and how
competition and technology were affecting its position. The traditional
sources of profit were falling and there was insufficient attention given to
how to create new sources of income, a lack of understanding of what was
needed to succeed in international markets. Business planning here used to
be a nightmare. The process was so complex it required an army of people.
The company was lost in a morass of plans. In the last 12 months we have
bitten the bullet. But it should have been done a lot earlier.'
GEC's financial controls are not as ruthless as those of Hanson, the
acquisitive conglomerate. But they are short-term. The horizon is next month
or next year.
Managers say this does not constrain their investment plans. Lord Weinstock
will approve investments if the short-term financial performance shows the
business is being well run. But the financial system produces its own
inhibitions. People censor themselves and hold back on proposals which they
know are unlikely to be approved.
The system can be good at identifying opportunities for cost savings within
an individual business, but it fails to identify cost savings that might
come from co-ordinating several businesses.
The most glaring example of this is the state of GEC's consumer-appliance
businesses, Hotpoint and Creda. Obvious opportunities to cut costs by
pooling their activities - joint purchasing of components, for instance -
were not taken because they reported their financial results separately.
Lord Weinstock, however, does not believe the financial system is the
company's life blood. He says that comes from the way its technology,
markets and management combine. These three elements are his yardsticks for
judging the company's strengths.
But has GEC got the right managers to develop the technology to exploit
growing, profitable markets?
GEC's approach to research, development and technology has been subject to
heavy criticism. It spends less on research and development and files many
fewer patents than most of its big international competitors.
The caricature of the group as technologically hollow, however, is highly
misleading. Its technical staff are of a high calibre. Marconi, its defence
arm, has very strong technology - laser guided weapons, satellite
environmental monitoring, sophisticated video telephones.
GEC is one of the largest software houses in Europe. Across the group it
spends about Pounds 400m a year on software which is becoming increasingly
important to all its products.
Nevertheless, Mr Grant recognises there is room for improvement. He wants a
more formal system of technology planning to run alongside the financial
planning so that managing directors are more aware which technologies are
critical to the future of their businesses.
Keen that GEC companies should work together more by sharing research, he
says: 'I can identify solutions from the centre, which people cannot see
from the subsidiaries.' GEC subsidiaries sometimes plough ahead on projects
in ignorance of the work that other companies within the group have already
done on the same topic.
However, Mr Grant's main worry is that GEC managers sometimes lack the
vision of how they might develop technology to meet emerging consumer
demands. His vision is for GEC to excel as an applier of technology to
products. It should not do any basic research, he believes.
On this view, GEC will not be driven by technological invention. Spending on
technology will be pulled by demand from GEC's markets. That means the
future of GEC as a high-technology company is inextricably linked to its
ability to open up new markets. This is its greatest problem.
GEC's approach to marketing is generally poor. It is good at selling its
existing products in familiar markets. Yet, apart from a few exceptions such
as the avionics division in Rochester, Kent, which has just won big orders
from Boeing, its attempt to open up new markets are feeble.
GEC is far more at home in slower-moving markets, where it has to deal with
a few large customers, than in open, fast-moving consumer markets where it
has to reach thousands of customers. This explains the failure of its
attempts to break into the US office equipment market through its
acquisition of AB Dick.
The limitations of the company are a reflection of the peculiarities of its
main customer, the British public sector. The classic example is in
telecommunications. Like other British manufacturers the company relied too
heavily on orders from the Post Office and the Commonwealth rather than
attempting to push its way into more internationally competitive markets.
The Post Office insisted on idiosyncratic and over-engineered products which
GEC has since found very hard to sell abroad.
GEC's technological shortcomings are partly a product of its insular
approach to markets, but also of the mind changing and short termism of its
British public-sector customers, whether over the System X telephone
exchange, the Nimrod radar or the nuclear power programme.
The quality of the managers who run GEC's operating units is mixed. But it
is generally as high as anything available in British industry. GEC has
strength in depth at its grass roots. Its subsidiaries are usually run by
long-serving executives who combine a background in engineering with a sharp
commercial sense and a strict financial discipline set from above.
The trouble is that these managers' horizons usually extend no further than
the boundaries of their own business. As a senior Stanhope Gate executive
puts it: 'This company is a collection of good small businesses run by good
small businessmen.'
GEC's main management weakness has been its missing middle. The subsidiaries
report financially direct to Stanhope Gate. The supervisory managers who
oversee groups of GEC businesses, such as electronic metrology, office
equipment and even Marconi, have traditionally had little power to bring
their charges together to pool activities and cut costs.
The justification for the missing middle is very powerful. In most companies
attempts at greater central direction have led to layers of unproductive
bureaucracy which inhibit change.
Travelling around GEC, however, examples abound of how subsidiaries could
learn from one another without incurring much cost. A prime example is in
manufacturing modernisation. The US businesses have taken great strides to
streamline manufacturing through total quality programmes. Picker's
de-unionised computer tomography factory on the outskirts of Cleveland,
Ohio, has cut its management layers from nine to three, reduced job
classifications from 188 to six and pared average product costs to 58 per
cent of what they were four years ago. It is making 270 scanners a year with
a staff of 82, working in self-directed teams, compared with the 120
scanners it used to make with 180 staff.
This has been the main force behind Picker's strong performance in the last
three years: return on capital employed has risen from 14.5 per cent to 20
per cent, sales growth has increased from 4.5 per cent a year to 10.5 per
cent and sales per employee are up to Dollars 200,000 a year, from Dollars
120,000 in 1989.
With such impressive examples of manufacturing efficiency available within
the company, one might expect staff at Stanhope Gate to instruct a stream of
British managers to visit the US. Yet there seems to be no concerted effort
to spread the best practice from these US plants around the group.
Outside Stanhope Gate change is afoot. Managers at Marconi, GPT and
GEC-Alsthom are all attempting to integrate the management of their
companies more, to drive them forward in a more concerted way. But at
headquarters the Stanhope Gate group has two main weaknesses. Its members
are good at operating like a merchant bank, dreaming up ideas for how the
group might develop through acquisitions. But they show no sign of being
able to galvanise the company and drive it forward in the way that Mr Jack
Welch has transformed GE of the US or Pierre Suard has pushed Alcatel into
the top ranks of the world's telecommunications companies.
The Stanhope Gate group also has an ad hoc approach to management
development which sometimes seems to amount to managers falling in and out
of favour with Lord Weinstock. And its biggest failing may yet turn out to
be an inability to secure an orderly succession to Lord Weinstock. As a
former senior Ministry of Defence official puts it: 'Apart from Weinstock
who has a view of how the whole business works? Who could take over? There
is no one.'
GEC is a well-run company by any standards. It has combined financial
stability with high technology, a rare mix for the UK. Its lasting
achievement will be the rationalisation which saved the British electrical
industry and enabled it to find a strong European home in alliance with
Alsthom. While it was far less active in the 1970s than it should have been
it came through the two recessions of the last decade in better shape than
British Steel or Imperial Chemical Industries. GEC has Pounds 876m of ready
cash, enough to buy British Aerospace, which only two years ago was boasting
of being Britain's largest manufacturing group. It has ridden the upheavals
which have struck the world electronics industry far better than many of its
competitors, such as Thomson, AEG and Philips, by steering clear of many of
the markets they have invested in.
But this means the company's growth outside the electrical industry is
patchy and haphazard. Last year its pre-tax profits of Pounds 829m were just
Pounds 100m higher than in 1985, barely any real growth at all in spite of
buying half of Plessey and a large chunk of Ferranti.
The company's subsidiaries are scattered and small. Their strengths are
rarely pulled together effectively. It is adept at saving money but
sometimes ill-judged at spending it; good at acquiring medium-sized niche
companies, less sure in making big acquisitions which could set it on a new
growth path. It is too often a follower rather a leader. It is strong where
its companies are large and used to facing stiff competition; weak where
they are small and used to protected markets. Even when there is an immense
amount of activity at GEC, there is little sense of momentum about the group
as a whole. If you take away Lord Weinstock, the top management seems
competent but not inspiring.
So could it have been different? Certainly it could have been a lot worse.
Alternative management methods were tried and failed at many of GEC's
British peers, some of which - Morphy Richards, Hawker Siddeley, STC - have
disappeared while others, such as Ferranti and Thorn, are a shadow of their
former selves.
And could it be different in the future? The next few years will be telling.
If Siemens of Germany pulls off its rationalisation of Siemens-Nixdorf and
its semi-conductor business, it could be the dominant European force in
computing as well as powerful in telecommunications and power engineering.
Alcatel will be a world leader in telecommunications and power engineering.
So what of GEC?
It is extremely unlikely that GEC will suffer any kind of financial crisis.
However, unless there is the right kind of management change at the top of
the group it could suffer a gentle decline, slowly shrinking, even though it
may be returning healthy profits. As things stand its most likely future is
as a financial holding company, at one remove from the management of a third
of its assets which are tied up in joint ventures. On a pessimistic view its
other activities could be a rag bag of niche businesses clustered around
Marconi which is struggling to come to terms with its uncertain future.
The far-flung resources of the group need to be pulled together more
effectively to capitalise on expertise in software, after-sales services and
in contracting. Around the group, managers thirst for its prudence to be
combined with ambition.
Lord Weinstock's management style was ideally suited to the task of
squeezing waste and eliminating duplication from traditional heavy
industries. The group now needs someone with marketing vision to pull
together and drive it forward into new markets.
It is not written in stone that there is only one way that GEC can or should
be run.
Travelling around the group - from 19th century factories in Lincoln which
used to make tractors to the very latest electronic warfare research
laboratories in Stanmore, from the huge turbines made in long halls at Rugby
to the printed circuit boards which come from Portsmouth, from the brutal
realism of GEC factory managers to the intellectual agility of staff at
Stanhope Gate - one cannot fail to have great admiration for Arnold
Weinstock's achievements.
Yet it is also hard to escape another conclusion. GEC has huge potential in
technology and management tucked away in its subsidiaries. That potential
will lie untapped if the company continues to be run in the same way.
The time has come for change, led from the top. That will require more than
a reshuffling of the pack. When Lord Weinstock created GEC he represented a
younger generation of managers with new ideas about how business should be
run. The time is nigh when another generation of managers should shape GEC's
future.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers hint at delay in
Maastricht progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strength of Tory opposition to the Maastricht treaty has prompted senior
ministers to prepare the ground for a possible delay until early next year
in government efforts to ratify the accord on European political and
monetary union.
Mr John Major is said by his colleagues to remain keen that the ratification
process gets under way again before he hosts the Edinburgh EC summit in
early December.
That would mean a renewed Commons debate - and a direct confrontation with
Tory opponents of the treaty - soon after MPs return in October from their
summer recess. The prime minister remains convinced that in spite of the
promised revolt he will secure a majority for the legislation.
He is also concerned that his government should be seen during its
presidency of the Community to be living up to its commitment to the accord.
But in what is being seen at Westminster as a calculated attempt to give the
government maximum flexibility, ministers are letting it be known that the
legislation might be delayed until the beginning of 1993.
They are pointing out that the detailed committee stage of the Maastricht
bill will involve intensive and exhaustive debate over several weeks. Scores
of amendments have been tabled by Conservative and Labour Euro-sceptics, who
have promised lengthy filibusters to delay the passage of the legislation.
Against that background, some of Mr Major's colleagues are floating the idea
that debates running late into the night for a number of weeks might dilute
the efforts of ministers to secure a successful outcome to the Edinburgh
summit. It might be more sensible, they argue, to defer the legislation
until January.
No firm decisions on timing will be taken until after the French referendum
on the treaty in September. Assuming that produces a Yes vote, the
government will then wait for the Danish government's promised plan to
reverse the anti-Maastricht vote recorded in a referendum last month. Those
proposals are also expected in late September or early October.
Mr Major will by then also have a much clearer idea of the Labour party's
strategy towards the legislation. Mr John Smith, the opposition's
leader-in-waiting, will not oppose the principle of ratification but he
might support the disruptive tactics promised by the Tory rebels.
Ministers insist, however, that there is no question of delaying the
ratification process until it is certain that the Danish government will
overturn its electorate's rejection of the treaty.
The view in Whitehall is that a second Danish referendum is unlikely to take
place before next spring and that it would be impossible to delay the
British legislation until then.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Field lists City names forhearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRANK FIELD, chairman of the Commons social security committee in the
last parliamentary session, yesterday issued a list of leading City figures
whom the committee would like to call to testify.
Mr Field said he had been contacted by an informant familiar with the
intimate workings of Robert Maxwell's private interests and had been
provided with information about them.
Mr Field said he believed that instructions for the movement of pension fund
assets were given to Maxwell's Liechtenstein-based trusts after his death,
although there was no suggestion that any of those he wished to call had
given instructions or even knew of them specifically.
Among those he is seeking to call is Mr Philip Morgenstern, senior partner
at Nicholson Graham and Jones, a City corporate law firm specialising in
pensions law.
The firm acted as solicitors to the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme.
The firm said that Nicholson Graham and Jones had acted for Maxwell's
private interests and that when it had done, Mr Morgenstern was typically
involved.
However, the spokesman said that neither Mr Morgenstern or the firm would be
likely to make any comment until a formal request to appear before the
committee was received.
Mr Field also said he would like to question Lord Spens, whose former
employer, the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, handled the announcement of
US-based trust PH(US), an investment company which has been under
investigation for receiving money from Maxwell public companies and which is
outside the scope of the UK administrators.
Lord Spens was prosecuted in the Guinness affair last year, the prosecution
being halted after charges against his co-defendant, Mr Roger Seelig, were
dropped on health grounds.
Lord Spens was unavailable for comment last night but Mr David Lake, his
assistant, dismissed any connections with PH(US).
'As far as I'm aware, there is absolutely no connection (between Lord Spens
and PH(US)),' he said. 'Mr Field is running up a blind alley.'
He said he knew of no links between Lord Spens and the Maxwell business
empire.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour 'runners' line up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE starting gun for Labour's shadow cabinet elections was formally fired
yesterday amid expectations that a record field of up to 60 candidates for
18 places might let several dark horses through to serve in Mr John Smith's
administration.
In fact, the race began almost as soon as the new parliament was sworn in,
as candidates jostled for support from the 271 Labour MPs, who form what was
once dubbed the world's 'most sophisticated electorate'.
With Mr Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett now universally expected to win the
leadership and deputy leadership, two positions will automatically become
vacant. A further space comes from Mr Gerald Kaufman's decision not to run.
Many MPs also believe that Ms Jo Richardson, the veteran champion of women's
causes, is highly vulnerable, having come bottom in last year's poll with
107 votes.
Among those frequently cited as potential winners are Ms Harriet Harman, the
party's voice on health, Mr David Blunkett, local government spokesman, and
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, voice on City affairs.
Campaigners calculate that the larger number of candidates and MPs this year
means that between 95 and 105 votes should prove sufficient to guarantee a
place. As rules require that at least three votes must be cast for women,
there is some speculation that women's representation might rise from the
present four places to six or more.
Nominations opened yesterday and close next Thursday with the issue of
ballot papers. The election itself will be completed, however, only on July
23 - a full five days after the winners of the leadership and deputy
leadership are known.
Meanwhile, the race for the chairmanship of the parliamentary Labour party
looks set to be a photo-finish.
In the second round of the exhaustive ballot, Mr Doug Hoyle, widely deemed
the anti-establishment candidate, scored 93 votes against 72 for Mr Ernie
Ross.
Mr Allan Rogers and Mrs Gwyneth Dunwoody have been eliminated, leaving a
run-off next week. Another vacancy is in the Lords, where Lord Cledwyn of
Penrhos has announced he is stepping down from leadership of the Labour
group.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pay body is rebuffed on MPs' cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT proposes to grant MPs the cost of an extra
quarter-of-a-member of staff and a Pounds 4,000-a-year rise to take account
of general office expenses, even though more radical changes were proposed
by the Top Salaries Review Body.
The increase will take the maximum an MP can claim from Pounds 28,986 to
Pounds 33,190 for the present financial year, including the equivalent of
the annual uprating according to the existing formula.
The allowance will now reflect an assumption that an MP employs 1 3/4 staff
rather than 1 1/2 , which is the basis for the present arrangements.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said yesterday that the increase
'represents a fair balance between taxpayers' interests and the needs of MPs
for sufficient support to enable them to carry out adequately their duties
to their constituents'.
The review body recommended:
That the allowance should be put on the basis of two staff per MP, and that
salaries should be kept separate from other costs.
That there should be central arrangements for procuring equipment such as
computers and fax machines and, in the meantime, a one-off acquisition grant
of Pounds 5,000, instead of a continuation of each MP making his or her own
arrangements.
That MPs who based their offices in their constituencies - and thus did not
benefit so much from the free lighting heating and telephone lines at
Westminster - should receive an extra Pounds 2,000.
That a Westminster personnel office should be created to advise MPs and
staff on pay and conditions of service.
Those would have taken the maximum allowance that could have been claimed to
between Pounds 37,360 and Pounds 42,360.
The government rejected the idea of compartmentalising the allowance, in
spite of the arguments about greater accountability and better conditions
for staff, in the interests of flexibility for MPs to choose how to use
their allowance. The idea of a personnel office was turned down because of
the 'concern of many MPs about possible external intervention in the
relationships between themselves and their staff'.
In spite of its reservations, however, the government is content for the
Commons information committee to consider the TSRB's points about provision
of office equipment.
Government business managers are conscious that there may be a backbench
rebellion when MPs debate the increase on Tuesday night - the day after they
will have discussed changes to rationalise the working week at Westminster.
On both the last two occasions, MPs have had the chance to influence the
annual increase in the allowance, in 1986 and again in 1987, they voted for
an amount larger than ministers had in mind.
Even in a recession and in the midst of tough public spending negotiations,
it is easier for MPs to argue for an increase in their office costs
allowance than for an increase in their own salaries, since the money can be
seen directly in their service to constituents.
A clash between the government and the review body was in prospect even from
the terms of reference. Ministers did not see the need for a fundamental
review, while the body itself said a thorough inquiry was needed because of
the changing pressures on MPs.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: SIB details 'inadequacies' of Imro
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board announced its action yesterday over the
report from Imro on its regulation of two Maxwell companies.
The report covers Imro's relations with Bishopsgate Investment Management
(BIM) and London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management plc
(LBI), both Imro members, and Maxwell Central and East European Partners, an
applicant for membership.
In the report, Imro accepts that its supervision of those companies fell
short of the standards that should be achieved by a financial services
regulator. Imro acknowledges that:
Its approach to monitoring was too mechanistic;
Its analysis of information was insufficiently critical;
It failed to recognise the potential risks associated with the companies,
and to give proper weight to the risks that were identified;
It was unduly ready to rely on the good faith and professionalism of those
with whom it dealt;
Its monitoring activity was insufficiently alert and responsive to
information available to it; and
Its response to the crisis after Robert Maxwell's death was inadequate.
SIB's response
SIB recognises that in many respects Imro has shown itself to be a committed
and effective regulator and that it has taken a conscientious approach to
evaluating its own performance. But the report discloses serious weaknesses
in Imro, and SIB draws certain more severe conclusions from the report than
does Imro.
The SIB board has had to decide whether Imro's failings are so fundamental
that its recognition should be withdrawn, or whether its recognition should
be retained based on appropriate strengthening. The board unanimously
believes it should be the latter.
Imro's report indicates that it was the recipient at key points of
incomplete and inaccurate information from persons in positions of
responsibility in the firms concerned, and did not benefit from any
whistle-blowing.
The affair nevertheless provides a salutary reminder for all Financial
Services Act regulators that the day-to-day operational activity of
regulation - authorisation, reviewing returns by regulated firms, monitoring
visits, dealing with queries - requires a continuous high alertness to any
indicators that cast doubt on fitness and properness (honesty, competence,
solvency), a willingness to probe until satisfied that the full picture is
known and understood, an alertness to information in the public domain
(including in the media), and an application of a spirit of critical inquiry
in relation to assurances or information given.
SIB believes that Imro's monitoring failures in this case reveal a more
general lack of market awareness and scepticism in dealing with information
about transactions and in monitoring returns. SIB views that with particular
concern.
Imro concludes that its admissions procedures for BIM and LBI were
adequately thorough and properly followed, and that BIM and LBI were
properly admitted. While SIB agrees that the decisions to admit to
membership were properly taken, SIB nevertheless considers that the
thoroughness of Imro's admission arrangements needs further scrutiny.
In addition, SIB believes that the report indicates that Imro's ability to
react effectively to situations of investor risk and its rules on the
handling of the private interests of board members need to be strengthened.
Imro's report considers whether its regulation of BIM would have been
different if BIM had been an ordinary member rather than a member subject to
Imro's special Occupational Pensions Scheme regime (under which a number of
Imro's general requirements are disapplied). Imro concludes that was not
material to its admission of BIM.
The report also concludes that it was not material to its monitoring of BIM
except to the extent that, had BIM been an ordinary member, Imro might have
received additional and earlier information relating to accounts and audit.
SIB's conclusion is that the fact that BIM was subject to that special
regime was not a material factor in Imro's performance of its regulatory
responsibilities in relation to BIM. SIB and Imro had agreed that in
parallel with its review of its regulation of BIM, Imro should conduct a
separate review of the OPS regime. Imro completed the review and issued a
consultative document in May 1992.
SIB's monitoring
SIB has, since Imro was recognised in 1988, been required to exercise
continuing oversight of Imro's exercise of its functions under the Financial
Services Act. SIB has taken a carefully considered decision that the
exercise of that supervisory role should not entail detailed tracking of a
recognised body's handling of its relations with each member.
Rather, SIB has placed heavy reliance on individual self-regulatory
organisation's supervision of day-to-day work; on reviewing with each SRO an
annual assessment by the SRO's board of the SRO's discharge of its
regulatory responsibilities; and on SIB's day-to-day contacts with the SRO
both on cases and on policy. That has been the approach with all the
recognised bodies for which SIB is responsible. SIB must now reconsider
whether that way of carrying out its supervisory role is appropriate.
Actions in hand
Action is being taken at three levels: by Imro itself, by SIB working with
Imro, and by the SIB board.
First, as far as Imro's actions are concerned, Imro has announced that its
chairman Mr George Nissen has resigned. His successor will be announced as
soon as possible; in the meantime the board of Imro is being chaired on an
interim basis by Mr Charles Nunneley. Imro also has in hand recruitment of a
successor to its chief executive, Mr John Morgan.
Imro has also put in hand organisational change and has decided to
strengthen its monitoring resources. SIB has also requested the board to
produce proposals for strengthening:
The experience, skills mix and organisation of its monitoring staff. That
will involve Imro members being prepared to provide greater practitioner
input into Imro'swork.
Its arrangements for dealing promptly and effectively with situations of
potential and actual investor risk.
Its rules on board members' interests.
Second, SIB is to review urgently:
Imro's admission procedures and practices, to ensure that its current
arrangements are satisfactory.
Imro's approach to monitoring its members, to ensure that the lessons of
this particular case are applied generally.
Third, the report makes clear that there was a shortfall in regulatory
standards at Imro that SIB had not identified. The SIB board has asked its
chairman to re-examine how it carries out its own regulatory
responsibilities and to ensure that the significance of lessons learnt in
the affair is taken into account in carrying out its duties to ensure that
the regulators whom it supervises meet their recognition responsibilities on
a continuing basis. The re-examination will have regard to considerations
both of investor protection and efficiency.
Wider issues
For its part, SIB will be pursuing in particular:
(i) Custody of Assets: SIB is to conduct, with the SROs and in consultation
with interested parties, a review of the supervision of the custody of
investor assets. The review will take into account not just the Maxwell
affair but such other factors as practical experience since safe custody
requirements for authorised firms came into force in 1988, the increasing
use by investment firms of nominees, the development of stock lending and
the introduction of Taurus. (It should be noted that the provision of
custody or nominees services as such is not an authorisable activity under
the Financial Services Act.)
(ii) Accountants and Regulators: SIB will review with SROs and the
accountancy bodies relations between auditors and regulators, in particular
the mechanisms by which auditors may pass critical or relevant information
direct to regulators and the operation of s109 of the FSA. SIB will also
wish to consider similar issues in relation to other professions.
(iii) Inter-Regulator Communications: SIB will review with other supervisory
authorities whether the arrangements and practices for the communication
among them of information relevant to investment business regulation work as
effectively as they could.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM accused over role of committees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was accused by a Tory MP yesterday of allowing government
business managers to interfere in the Commons select committees responsible
for scrutinising Whitehall.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, has called for an
early meeting with the prime minister after being left off the list of MPs
selected for the health committee, which he used to chair. He cited a letter
Mr Major wrote to him in March last year: 'Every member of a select
committee is free to vote for the person of his or her choice if a vacancy
arises for the chairmanship,' it said. 'That has always been the case and
will continue to be so.'
The row may dominate the Commons debate on the membership of the select
committees next Monday. Mr Winterton will try to win Labour backing for his
reappointment to the health committee. The committee of selection's
proposals were announced yesterday and confirmed that no minister who was
returned to the back benches after the general election has been given a
place on a committee.
Mr Tim Renton, former arts minister, was tipped for the chairmanship of the
Treasury committee, but has taken on consultancy work in the City. Mr
Kenneth Baker, former home secretary, has also been excluded.
Besides Mr Winterton, another casualty appears to be Mr James Cran,
Conservative MP for Beverley - who usually backs the government except in
his strong Euro-scepticism. He has lost his place on the trade and industry
committee.
Among new MPs winning places are Mrs Judith Chaplin, Tory MP for Newbury and
former Treasury adviser, and Mr Gyles Brandreth, the former TV game show
host, now Tory MP for Chester. He joins the national heritage committee.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Thoughts of devaluation gain currency: Economists are
starting to think the unthinkable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE grim cocktail of economic fragility, a sliding pound and tension over
the Maastricht treaty is forcing financial markets to think the unthinkable.
They are dusting off theories about a possible sterling devaluation.
Even though Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected in a speech in
London tonight to repeat his strong opposition to such a move, some
private-sector economists are pondering the circumstances that might force
him into it.
Mr John Shepperd, of SG Warburg Securities, the London investment group,
says: 'The longer the recession drags on and the Bundesbank keeps German
interest rates high, the stronger the possibility of a devaluation.'
Mr David Brown of the London office of Swiss Bank Corporation says: 'This
week the markets have caught the devaluation jitters. It's going to be a
difficult few months.'
For all such talk, the government is a long way from thinking seriously
about devaluation. Any action to reduce the pound's DM2.95 central rate in
the European exchange rate mechanism - or to leave the ERM - would be seen
as a huge backward step. It would end the UK's policy of trying to control
inflation by linking the pound to the D-Mark, and severely damage Britain's
European credentials.
Others view devaluation as a sensible measure to enable UK interest rates to
be reduced and end the longest recession for 50 years. Because German rates
are so high, Mr Lamont is unable to reduce UK borrowing costs without
risking a fall in sterling that would breach its ERM limit.
Several factors explain why devaluation - for all its negative connotations
 -is starting to figure in economists' talks.
Economic woes: The end to the recession still appears some time away. Many
economists expect a further economic contraction this year, after a 2.4 per
cent decline in 1991. In those circumstances, base rates at 10 per cent are
extremely high, especially with inflation at about 4 per cent to 5 per cent.
Any move that could help in a reduction in loan rates might appear
attractive.
According to Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, the best way
to do that would be to leave the ERM and let sterling find its level beneath
its central ERM rate.
Sterling's slip: Partly because of the economic gloom - and helped by the
recent rise of the D-Mark against the dollar - the pound has lost ground
heavily in recent weeks. From about DM2.94 at the end of May, it touched
DM2.8585 yesterday before closing against a weaker German currency at
DM2.88. The weak pound makes it all the harder for Mr Lamont to cut rates.
Maastricht muddle: With progress towards European economic and monetary
union far less certain than it appeared earlier this year, worries are
surfacing that an unravelling of the Maastricht treaty might shake
investors' faith in the ERM. That could lead to heavy selling of weaker
currencies - including the pound and the lira - with the resultant strain
either necessitating a currency realignment or leading to the collapse of
the system. A senior British official says: 'Emu is very important to the
ERM. If Maastricht comes unstuck, perhaps after the French referendum result
(in September), managing the ERM might become difficult.'
Bundesbank obduracy: Top officials at the Bank of England are not expecting
any cut in German rates until the late autumn. That is because inflation and
monetary growth - both given a strong push by reunification - are still too
high for the liking of the German central bank. That seems likely to give
Britain little leeway to cut rates over the next few months.
Much depends on economic data to be published over the next month or so.
Although ministers do not have to worry about facing voters for another four
or five years, many other groups - backbenchers, industrialists and
investors - are in a position to apply pressure to stoke a recovery.
Against that is the theory that reducing sterling's value might not lead to
a long-term lowering of interest rates. Confidence in sterling might be
shattered by the huge step of either leaving the ERM or arranging a
realignment. As a result, the UK would be back to its position in the 1980s
of having to cope with periodic sterling crises and rapid changes in
interest rates - the very events ERM membership was meant to avoid.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Tory unease on economy spreading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers stepped up pressure for a change in the government's
economic strategy yesterday in spite of a renewed effort by ministers to
calm markets by insisting there would be no 'quick fixes' or policy changes.
At question time, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, dismissed the notion of
devaluation within the European exchange rate mechanism as 'pure fool's
gold' that would do nothing to turn round the economy.
Questioned from both sides of the Commons, he insisted that the only means
by which Britain would increase its exports was to keep a firm hold on
inflation and raise competitiveness.
But the Treasury's steady-as-she-goes strategy is coming under increasing
criticism in the Commons as MPs voice concerns over high interest rates,
sterling's exchange rate and the general health of the UK economy.
It is also clear that the sluggish state of the economy is now spreading
disquiet well beyond Conservative Euro-sceptics and into the mainstream of
the party.
As the Treasury and Downing Street insisted that the government remained
'firm and resolute' on holding sterling's DM2.95 central ERM rate, unease
was fuelled by reports that Baroness Thatcher had warned of an imminent
'financial accident' if policies were not changed.
Although Lady Thatcher's remarks at a private dinner with businessmen last
week were dismissed by her office as 'nothing new', they provided fresh
ammunition for Labour.
Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, seized on the government's unease to
highlight an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast
predicting that UK manufacturing investment would fall 3.8 per cent in the
current year.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, countered that 30 per cent
investment growth between 1986 and 1989 meant that Britain was starting from
a high base with first-quarter figures showing a marked improvement.
For the government, however, the more worrying criticism is coming from its
own backbenchers.
Yesterday Sir Peter Tapsell, Tory MP for Lindsey East, asked why the
government had to have 'its hand held' by German bankers. Outside the
chamber, Sir Rhodes Boyson, MP for Brent North, said good businesses were
under intense pressure because real interest rates were far above those of
European competitors.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Fears for jobs begin to recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEAR OF unemployment is beginning to recede, according to a survey released
yesterday. It shows mild optimism about a slow recovery later this year.
Business Strategies and Gallup, the research organisations, say a balance of
31 per cent of individuals were worried in the second quarter about losing
their jobs, against 41 per cent in the first quarter.
The survey also reports a slow improvement in general consumer sentiment
about growth. Only two regions - north-west England and Wales - expect the
economy to worsen in the next 12 months.
The results support indications that a hesitant upturn may be starting about
now, although people's willingness to take on debts and increase spending
remains low.
The organisations say consumer spending - which accounts for two thirds of
UK output - will show a slight increase in the second quarter against the
first quarter. Even though that implies a year-on-year fall of 0.3 per cent,
the quarterly increase, if borne out by official statistics, would be the
first since early 1990.
In the second quarter, a balance of 11 per cent of people in the survey  -
the balance being the difference between those expressing positive and those
giving negative views - thought the economy would improve over the next
year. Between January and March this year, the survey shows a balance of 4
per cent taking a pessimistic outlook.
Among individual households, a balance of 5 per cent said their own
financial state would improve in the next year, while in the first quarter
the balance was zero.
The survey is based on questions posed each month in the second quarter to
2,000 people around Britain.
Regional Consumer Survey. Quarterly. Business Strategies, 10 Kendrick Mews,
London SW7 3HG. Pounds 125 annual subscription.
THE NUMBER of companies going into receivership fell 30 per cent in the
second quarter of this year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy
firm, Diane Summers writes. There were 948 recorded receiverships, compared
to 1,362 in the first three months of the year.
However, the overall level of receiverships has continued to grow during the
past six months. There were 2,310 in the first half of the year compared
with 1,976 in the second half of last year.

FT  10 JUL 92 / House prices 'up 0.7% last month'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES rose 0.7 per cent last month, a possible sign that prices have
begun to stabilise after sharp falls in the past few years, Halifax,
Britain's biggest building society, said yesterday.
Its findings conflict with a survey published last week by Nationwide, the
second-largest society, which said house prices fell by an average 0.5 per
cent last month.
Halifax said that, allowing for seasonal fluctuations, prices rose by 0.3
per cent in June, the first seasonally adjusted rise since October.
There was no sign of any increase in the number of house sales. Purchasers
and sellers, the society said, had been deterred by concern over rising
unemployment and the state of the economy.
Halifax said: 'The general election result appears to have had little impact
so far despite predictions that the decisive outcome would boost confidence
by reducing uncertainty.
'The temporary suspension of stamp duty has also had only a very limited
effect on transaction levels.
'With some increase in house sales over the next few months, house prices
should then move on to a gently rising trend during 1993.'
It said that in spite of last month's price rise, the Pounds 65,361 average
cost of a home in the UK was 5.6 per cent lower than in the corresponding
month last year. In London, prices during the second quarter of this year
were 10.6 per cent lower than during the same months last year and 2.2 per
cent lower than in the first quarter this year.
Halifax said: 'House prices remained generally weaker in the south of
England in the second quarter of this year, but small quarterly declines
were also recorded in Wales, west Midlands and northern regions. Only in
Scotland are house prices currently higher than they were a year ago.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / Body Shop wins back six stores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BODY SHOP, the international franchise chain, won back control of six of its
branches in the south-east yesterday.
Sir Peter Pain, in the High Court, granted Body Shop an injunction removing
Mrs Pauline Rawle from control of the branches - at Maidstone, Bromley and
Canterbury, in Kent; Romford in Essex; and two at Croydon, south London.
Body Shop has issued a writ claiming Pounds 340,000 from Mrs Rawle in
respect of products supplied.
Sir Peter said Mrs Rawle had become involved in a religious sect which was
known as the Victory Church.
She insisted on staff attending 'mystic violence courses' run by the church,
and dismissed more than 50 of her staff, alleging they were disloyal to her.
There was a clear case, on the face of it, that she had repudiated her
contract with the organisation.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Top-quality furniture proves irresistible: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIE'S held a successful sale of important English furniture yesterday.
The top lots were far from fresh to the market but were of a quality,
interest and condition that proved irresistible.
Most spectacular was an Etruscan-style satinwood and marquetry bow-fronted
commode designed by Robert Adam for Derby House in Grosvenor Square, London,
and supplied by Mayhew and Ince in 1775 for Pounds 84.
This richly ornamented piece, embellished further with painted ovals of
Venus and Cupid, was consigned by Mrs Barbara Piasecka Johnson, who had
bought it in 1988 for Pounds 140,000. It attracted numerous bidders before
selling way above target to another collector for Pounds 660,000.
Also on offer was a group of pieces sold in 1986 from Harewood House, near
Leeds, which gave Thomas Chippendale one of his most celebrated and valuable
commissions.
Of particular note was the pair of 'Exceeding neat &amp; Rich carv'd Gerandoles
finished in burnished silver', supplied for the yellow damask sitting room.
These silvered, wall-mounted oval mirrors, originally with candle branches,
are the only ones of there kind that Chippendale made. Lord Harewood paid
Pounds 40 for them in 1775, and in 1986 they fetched Pounds 280,800.
Christie's sold them yesterday for Pounds 319,000.
A pair of oval giltwood mirrors, almost certainly supplied by Chippendale
for the dining room at Harewood, realised Pounds 104,500.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Tribunal upholds dockers' complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH sides claimed victory yesterday when the Employment Appeal Tribunal
delivered judgment on the legal battle between the Port of London Authority
and 19 dockers sacked in 1989 at Tilbury.
The 65-page judgment broadly upheld the dockers' complaint of unfair
dismissal for being union activists, but overturned an industrial tribunal
order that the authority re-engage 12 of the men. It said the tribunal had
erred in law in making the order.
The dockers began action against the authority for unfair dismissal in
August 1989. The industrial tribunal sat for 198 days - the longest UK
hearing.
The dockers were sacked after a dispute over the abolition of the National
Dock Labour Scheme - the agreement that covered their minimum terms and
conditions - and the subsequent decision by employers to abandon national
collective bargaining.
The tribunal said the question of responsibility for the 'appalling
industrial relations' was not 'one coloured black and white' but 'the
clearest possible case of shades of grey'.
A majority of the tribunal said the membership of some of the dockers of the
National Port Shop Stewards Committee pointed to 'obvious militancy' and
said the sole purpose of the committee was 'as a tool in the militant
domination of working practices at Tilbury.'
The case has been sent back to another industrial tribunal so that
compensation for unfair dismissal can be reconsidered. The authority was
given leave to appeal.

FT  10 JUL 92 / 'Aunt Sallys' resigned to their pay rebuff: 'More clout,
less dosh' attracts high-flyers to Civil Service Changes to job security
stressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHEN we join the public service, we recognise that we are Aunt Sallys. If
we wanted to make a fortune, we would have gone elsewhere.' That was the
response yesterday of one Whitehall mandarin when the government announced
it was overruling the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB)recommendation for
leading civil servants, judges and the military.
Instead of the average 19.7 per cent recommended by the body, those people
will have to make do with 4 per cent this year and further instalments over
the next two years.
The mandarin continued: 'The problem of setting top people's pay is so
thorny that ministers set up an independent pay review body to do their
dirty work. Despite being stuffed with anti-public-sector businessmen, it
finds that senior civil servants are earning much less than what they would
earn in the private sector for similar jobs.
'But the politicians cannot bring themselves to do the decent thing by the
people they rely upon to advise them and to carry out their policies. So
when the predictable row breaks, they take the easy way out and run for
cover. It makes me sick.'
The rebuff is unlikely, however, to encourage him to seek another job. Nor,
according to Mr Stephen Bampfylde of headhunters Saxon-Bampfylde, will it
necessarily make it much harder to fill top jobs in the future. Although
there is a minimum salary level below which recruitment and retention would
become difficult, salaries in top public-sector jobs do not need to match
those in the private sector.
'The pro bono publico feeling is alive and well in Britain,' says Mr
Bampfylde, who has helped fill 15 top public-sector posts in recent years.
'Enormously talented people are prepared to take salary cuts for jobs which
carry great prestige.
'The management challenge in many of these jobs is so great that they can't
turn them down. 'More clout, less dosh' just about sums it up.'
In spite of yesterday's furore, many senior public servants are likely to be
more understanding in private of the government's position than they suggest
publicly.
'I would guess that if someone offered a rise of Pounds 30,000, they are not
going to turn it down,' said one recently retired general now working in
industry. 'But the top three already earn over Pounds 100,000, which is not
bad really. And there are other rewards in honours and esteem.'
Another serving top civil servant acknowledged that public sympathy was
probably thin on the ground. 'BBC TV's Yes Minister has a lot to answer
for,' he says. 'It makes us look so aloof and scheming. I'm not sure that I
would be in favour of the TSRB award if I was outside the Civil Service.'
Mr Ivor Manley, who retired last year as deputy secretary at the Department
of Employment, said pay rises of anything like 24 per cent would have set a
bad example and that many of those covered by the review body realised that.
'I do not believe many civil servants are solely motivated by money,' he
said. 'When awards have been phased in in past years I cannot remember any
heated conversations about it in the Civil Service canteens.'
However, Mr Manley - who used to interview graduates for jobs - said that in
the past five or six years there had been signs of a shortage of really good
candidates to start as high-flying civil servants. 'Some of us worried about
the recruitment of people of quality if salaries were being pegged below the
market rate,' he said. 'There is a danger of the ablest candidates going
elsewhere.'
There was evidence of that during the boom years of the 1980s. Successive
reports from the Civil Service commissioners implied that while there was no
shortage of candidates for the fast stream, the quality of applicants was
falling off as the best graduates headed for the City.
That concern has lost force with the economy in recession. This year there
were 9,000 applications for just 160 places, with 2,000 for 30 mature-entry
places.
At higher levels, jobs are increasingly filled by open competition -
advertised on the open market with salaries set at whatever level is needed
to attract the right candidate. The posts of 53 of the 81 chief executives
of the new executive agencies were advertised in open competition, with 30
coming from outside the Civil Service.
Even in the core Whitehall departments, 13 of 66 jobs filled last year were
openly advertised - including that of director of public prosecutions.
One option would be to move towards open competition for all top Civil
Service posts, with each salary determined by negotiation.
However, attracting suitable candidates on the open market might require
much higher salaries than those set by the review body. It took Pounds
140,000 a year, for example, to lure Mr John Chisholm from industry to run
the Defence Research Agency. He reports to Sir Christopher France, permanent
secretary at the Ministry of Defence, who must get by on Pounds 87,600 a
year after yesterday's increase.
Doing away with centrally agreed pay scales might be attractive to
politicians who want to avoid political controversy. The consequence might
be that the bill for top people's salaries ended up much bigger once market
forces began to operate.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Court rules in insurance case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by four companies in the London United Investments insurance group,
which collapsed two years ago, to put together schemes of arrangement for
the benefit of their creditors, have been boosted by a judgment of the Court
of Appeal. The case concerned the powers of the Policyholders' Protection
Board.
The four companies - Kingscroft Insurance, El Paso Insurance, Lime Street
Insurance and Mutual Reinsurance - are in provisional liquidation. Their
gross liabilities total Dollars 2.5bn and their assets about Dollars 1.7bn.
They believe the proposed schemes, which would enable them to run off their
business in the normal way and pay a percentage of the claims, would be more
beneficial to their creditors than liquidation.
The court's ruling, the effect of which was to increase the board's ability
to participate in the schemes, was that the board was liable to pay on
contingent claims on the four companies as they materialise and not just on
claims agreed at the date of liquidation.

MRS GILLIAN SHEPHARD, employment secretary, yesterday warned Training and
Enterprise Councils that they could face cuts in funding in the next public
expenditure round.
Mrs Shephard said at a conference in Birmingham attended by chairmen and
chief executives of Tecs: 'Tecs cannot expect to get additional funding this
year. Our funds could be less.'
Nevertheless, she wanted Tecs to improve overall performance. 'I suggest a
key task is to raise performance, to bring the rest up to the level of the
best and to ensure our best continually improve,' she said.
She wanted to encourage a shift towards Tecs being paid for achieving
results, such as qualifications, rather than for the number of weeks
trainees spent on courses.

THE GOVERNMENT yester-day tried to head off threatened disruptive action by
dentists, Alan Pike writes. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
announced a review of dental remuneration that would report by the end of
the year.
She urged dentists to 'think long and hard before taking any action that
would damage patients or jeopardise the improvements in dental health
achieved in recent years.'
Dentists this week voted in favour of partial withdrawal from National
Health Service treatment after the government reduced their fees by 7 per
cent.
Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, former head of the Civil Service in Northern
Ireland, is to review the pay system.
The review will be overseen by Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister. He said
the British Dental Association had told the government it believed the
review must have an element of independence, and ministers had responded by
appointing Sir Kenneth.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Tory housebuilding plans attacked on two fronts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans for releasing land for housebuilding in London and
south-east England to the year 2011 were attacked on two fronts yesterday.
Housebuilders and environmentalists objected to an announcement from Mr
Michael Howard, environment secretary. He said there should be no increase
in the amount of land made available for housebuilding, which should be
maintained at a rate of 57,000 homes a year.
The Housebuilders Federation, whose members build four fifths of private
homes under construction, said that would mean that many people would be
unable to buy homes in the region in the next 10 to 15 years. Mr Howard was
sowing the seeds for the next house-price boom.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England, which had been pressing Mr
Howard to reduce land for housing in the south-east, accused him of
backtracking on government commitments to protect the environment.
The decision means planned housebuilding rates in the south-east will remain
unchanged - the number of new homes to be built between 1991 and 2006 is
expected to be 855,000.
Mr Howard has asked local-authority members of the South East Regional
Planning Conference (Serplan) to prepare plans for how the 57,000 new homes
might be distributed throughout the region. Other organisations are being
invited to comment, and the government will also consider the study of the
potential of the east Thames corridor, which is likely to be completed by
early September.
In a letter to the Earl of Carnarvon, chairman of Serplan, Mr Howard said
the proposed rate represented 'a realistic response to the need of the
south-east region to provide for the housing needs of its people while
maintaining the quality of its environment'.
The number of households in the region in the period until 2011 is forecast
to rise by an average annual rate of 53,600, with sharper than average
increases in the first 10 years.
The Housebuilders Federation said the government's figures took no account
of the existing shortage of homes in the region or the fact that housing
demand was likely to be much higher during the early part of the period.
MR MICHAEL HOWARD has given Countryside Properties, the developer, approval
to build 900 homes on 240 acres south-west of Bishop's Stortford,
Hertfordshire. Countryside said the development, the subject of a public
inquiry last summer, would include shops and community facilities.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Satisfaction gained from service: Three former public
servants recall their attitudes to remuneration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Michael Palliser, former head of the Diplomatic Service, is blunt about
the attractions of pay for the civil servant. 'You do not go into the public
services if you want to make a lot of money,' he said.
Sir Michael resisted the lure of the City 40 years ago and enjoyed a
distinguished career. 'I decided to stay in the foreign service and I have
never regretted it,' he explained.
'Money played a part in some leaving, but my impression was that it was only
one of several reasons in most cases. The money did not affect the calibre
of civil servants.'
After his retirement, Sir Michael became chairman of Samuel Montagu, the
merchant bank.
For General Sir Hugh Beach, Army pay was not a significant factor in
planning a career. 'It never crossed my mind that someone in ICI should or
should not be earning three times as much as me.'
Sir Hugh saw active service in France in 1944, rose to deputy
commander-in-chief, UK land forces, and was director of the Council for Arms
Control until three years ago.
As a young officer, he says, businessmen were described as 'boxwallahs', a
derogatory term for hawkers in India. Salaries were not mentioned in polite
company.
'One's chief satisfaction was moving steadily up the ladder,' says Sir Hugh.
'And the gilt on the gingerbread was the occasional gong. We just wanted a
comfortable life.'
Sir Frederick Lawton, 80, who retired in 1986 after 11 years as a High Court
judge and 14 years in the Court of Appeal, said money was not a decisive
factor for most barristers in accepting appointment to the High Court bench.
Like most successful barristers who become judges he took 'a very
substantial drop in income' when he was appointed. It would have been
'totally unrealistic to have expected judges' salaries to match my income at
the Bar.'
Sir Frederick said that for him and for most barristers becoming a judge was
a natural career progression. The motive for accepting an appointment was 'a
continuing desire to be involved in the administration of justice.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / Public-sector pensions lose their edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONAL assumptions that greater job security and pension rights in the
public sector justify the pay gap between it and the private sector can no
longer be made, according to the review body.
In recommending pay rises of up to 24 per cent, which the government
yesterday refused to pay in full, the review body's nine members point to
changes in the relative values of job security and pensions in the two
sectors.
An evaluation for the review carried out by Price Waterhouse, the
consultancy, shows that the Civil Service pension scheme is worth less to
the recipient as a percentage of salary than schemes provided in the private
sector at comparable levels.
The report says: 'The low contributory rate and index-linking of the Civil
Service scheme are no longer sufficient to outweigh other advantages of
typical private-sector schemes.
'Our pay comparison study revealed that 60 per cent of the private-sector
comparators to our Civil Service and armed forces remit groups were in
pension schemes which had given increases fully in line with inflation in
the last few years.'
The report says relative job insecurity in the private sector is
substantially offset by generous compensation packages. Moreover, most chief
executives in Next Steps Civil Service agencies are on short-term contracts
and staff reductions of 20 per cent are planned in the armed forces.
Among other reasons put forward to explain the recommended salary rises, the
review body says that since its last fundamental review in 1985 the pay of
the group covered - at present numbering 2,140 - has risen 7 per cent in
real terms. Meanwhile, average earnings for comparable employees in the
private sector have risen 40 per cent.
Figures compiled for the report in March show that private-sector jobs
similar to those of permanent secretaries commanded salaries of Pounds
189,000 - more than Pounds 100,000 above the pre-review pay of permanent
secretaries.
The review body says top jobs in the public sector are among the most
responsible in the country. 'As a matter of principle, pay levels must be
set so as to maintain in the long term an adequate supply of people of the
highest quality to fill them,' it says.
On recruitment and retention, the review says there are no shortages of
talented staff in the armed forces and Civil Service. In the judiciary,
problems are less pressing than in previous years.
'However, our concern is essentially with the longer term,' the report says.
A failure to realign the relative pay of those covered with the private
sector might weaken morale and eventually undermine long-term succession
planning.
The review body also draws attention to difficulties of differentials with
groups of workers immediately below those covered by the report.
'The compression of differentials can have damaging effects . . . An
inadequate differential is easily felt to be a devaluation of the worth of
the post and the individual, with a consequent potential loss of
motivation.'
As well as pegging the rises recommended by the review body, the government
has rejected an increase in London pay for grade three civil servants.
The review body also made recommendations for increases in pay differentials
between various levels of the judiciary to reflect the increase in the
workload and administrative responsibilities taken on by certain judges.
The recommendations were defeated, however, by the government's imposition
of the flat-rate increase for all members of the judiciary, leaving
particular difficulties experienced in recruiting county court judges and
circuit judges to be addressed at a later stage.

FT  10 JUL 92 / 1,200 oil jobs to be cut: Fears for local economy as
Highlands yard halves workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest private employer in the Highlands yesterday announced it was
cutting 1,200 jobs at its oil platform yard in Ardersier, near Inverness.
After McDermott Scotland said it was halving its workforce, Highlands and
Islands Enterprise, the development body, warned that the redundancies -
believed to be the largest ever jobs loss in the region  - might cost the
local economy more than Pounds 30m a year.
More than 900 contract workers for the US-owned company will be laid off in
August, with 80 salaried staff and 200 employed by subcontractors.
Mr Jim Franklin, general manager, said the redundancies were a result of a
severe downturn in the fabrication market, coupled with an increase in total
fabrication capacity.
Mr Jimmy Gray, shop stewards' convener, said workers were 'shattered and
stunned'.
'No one expected anything of this magnitude,' he said. 'In this industry we
are used to peaks and troughs, but this is the largest single pay-off in the
history of onshore construction in the UK.'
Highland Regional Council held an emergency session and has demanded an
urgent meeting with Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister. There was no comment from
Mr Eggar's office yesterday.
Sir Russell Johnston MP - in whose Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber
constituency the yard is situated - flew with fellow Liberal Democrat Mr
Charles Kennedy, MP for neighbouring Ross, Cromarty and Skye, to meet
management and unions. Their joint statement said the job losses were 'grim
and ominous news'.
'The crucial importance of the oil yards to the entire area cannot be
underestimated,' they said.
They added it was essential to explore whether a change in the North Sea tax
regime might promote development and bring forward orders.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise said the job losses would have a
significant knock-on effect for many local companies, particularly those
supplying goods and services to the McDermott's yard, and shops and
businesses catering for the needs of oil industry workers.
HIE said it would examine the possibility of retraining and stimulating new
businesses. It would also press the government to grant assisted-area
development status to Inverness and Nairn, and for Objective One status
within the EC, which would make it elegible for special EC funds.
Some employees affected are itinerant workers but many live in the Inverness
area.
McDermott's is one of two oil platform constructors in the region. Highlands
Fabricators, further north at Nigg, in Easter Ross, employs about 1,500
people.
The job losses highlight the gloomy outlook for the offshore fabrication
industry, which is suffering its worst downturn since the 1986 oil-price
collapse.
As average field sizes in the North Sea grow smaller, the trend towards
smaller and fewer platforms, with more use of subsea satellite wells, has
taken its toll. So, too, has the small number of developments over the next
few years.
The Offshore Manufacturers and Constructors Association, which represents
the seven leading construction yards in Scotland and north-east England,
says the UK's fabrication capacity is 26m man-hours a year. The workload for
1992, however, is estimated at only 23.5m man-hours, and is expected to fall
more than 50 per cent to 10.7m man-hours in 1993. Recovery is not expected
until the middle of the decade.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, insisted at the
Financial Times conference on the North Sea oil and gas industry this week
that there would be no change in the North Sea tax regime.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Accountancy firms ranked by growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the UK's sixth-largest accountants by fee income, and Price
Waterhouse, the third-largest, were the top firms for potential
profitability and growth last year, according to an analysis by Datamonitor,
the consultancy firm.
The examination of market positioning is radically different from rankings
by fee income, and elevates several medium-sized firms to high positions.
The analysis takes into account the provision of different business services
provided by the firms against the estimated profits, growth rates and
volatility of those services.
Management consultancy and tax are rated the highest business sectors for
growth and profitability, followed by insolvency. Audit and accounting work
is rated the lowest.
Rankings by competitive performance - which considers staff numbers, listed
clients, fees per professional and staff per partner - reflect rankings by
fee income more closely.
The survey suggests there may be tensions in creating multidisciplinary
partnerships in combination with lawyers, because fees per partner are so
much higher in solicitors' firms.
In a ranking of firms, Arthur Andersen - in third place - is the only
accountancy firm in the top 10 measured by fees per partner. There are six
accountants among the top 20, while most come at the lower end of the table.
Arthur Andersen is the most diversified accountancy firm, with 76 per cent
of its income derived from non-audit fees in 1992. A number of the
medium-sized firms are also highly diversified, however.

FT  10 JUL 92 / CAA plans to curb aircraft fees at Manchester Airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Civil Aviation Authority yesterday proposed a more rigorous pricing
formula for landing and aircraft parking charges at Manchester International
Airport as part of its general efforts to hold down UK airport costs and
improve airport operators' efficiency.
Annual increases in airport charges at Manchester will be capped at 3
percentage points below the rise in the retail price index for the next five
years, according to the CAA proposal. The previous five-year formula was RPI
 1 point.
The CAA proposal follows a similar recommendation by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, which every five years investigates the charges and
activities of UK airports under the 1986 Airports Act.
The CAA will decide on the pricing formula for Manchester next month.
The regulatory agency last year imposed a tougher formula for the south-east
England airports of BAA, the airports operator. After consultations, the
formula for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted involved RPI -8 points in the
first two years, RPI -4 points in the third year and RPI -1 point in the
last two years, giving a weighted annual average of RPI -6 points.
On the basis of the MMC's findings, the CAA has asked Manchester Airport to
provide more information to users on costs associated with baggage handling,
check-in desk charges, other ground handling facilities and the levy on
fuel.
At least three ground handling agents should offer services in Manchester's
Terminal One no later than April 1997, the CAA proposed. At present, there
is one agent, a subsidiary company of the airport, which is owned by the
county councils of the Manchester area.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Royal row prompts review of the press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER review into press self-regulation is to be conducted on behalf of
the government by Sir David Calcutt QC after widespread criticism of the
press's coverage of the private lives of members of the royal family.
Sir David, who chaired an earlier investigation into privacy and the press,
has been asked by Mr David Mellor, national heritage secretary, to consider
whether the present self-regulation should be modified or placed on a
statutory basis and whether further measures are needed to deal with
intrusions into privacy.
The government promised a review of press self-regulation when the committee
on privacy and related matters reported in June 1990. It said the
effectiveness of press self-regulation would be reviewed once the Press
Complaints Commission, which the committee recommended should be
established, had been in operation for 18 months.
Since then, there has been evidence of restraint by the media over personal
privacy, but there has also been criticism of some papers for treatment of
the marriage difficulties between the Prince and the Princess of Wales.
Mr Mellor told the Commons yesterday: 'I believe that a further independent
analysis based on recent experience of self-regulation will be of great
assistance in determining the way forward in this difficult and sensitive
area. In view of his chairmanship of the earlier committee, Sir David is
uniquely qualified to carry out this task.'
The Press Complaints Commission was set up under the chairmanship of Lord
McGregor of Durris, former chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority,
to replace the Press Council.
At the time Mr Mellor, then at the Home Office, warned newspapers they were
'drinking at the last-chance saloon.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Economics binds those whom politics
divides - A look at the difficulties facing an attempt at co-operation by 11
Black Sea states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NICOSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT required some skilful seating arrangements to accommodate 11 heads of
government at the same table in Istanbul last month to sign an economic
co-operation agreement between Black Sea countries, given that six of them
are in open conflict with each other.
That may well turn out to have been the easy part, as experts from Turkey
and the eight former socialist states of the Black Sea, with late additions
Greece and Albania, try to puzzle out how to turn this region of 400m
consumers into a working marketplace.
The framework agreement between Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Albania calls for
co-operation on transport and telecommunications, infrastructure and the
environment. Its broad objective is to improve on the current negligible
trade ties between the former Comecon partners and their market-oriented
neighbours.
But at this stage the accord is still driven more by the politicians than
businessmen, many of whom remain confused as to its purpose.
Turkey has been the prime mover, clearly flattered that these newly emerging
democracies should look to it as a role model. For Turkey, the project could
provide, if not an adequate alternative to EC membership, at least a
fall-back position. Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, says: 'If
Europe is going to work it must establish strong ties with the co-operative
schemes around it.'
Behind Turkey's backing of the project lies the fear of growing ethnic
tensions in the region. Economic co-operation is seen as a bridge-building
exercise aimed at ameliorating political differences.
Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, all roads led to Moscow. The task
now is to redirect many of these economies not only to a different
marketplace but to a market philosophy.
The initial challenge is how to get off this 'first base'. The Istanbul
meeting and a follow-up gathering of businessmen and government officials,
organised by the Swiss-based World Economic Forum, raised more questions
than answers.
Should governments invest in infrastructure to encourage the region's trade?
Would this require a new development bank? Is there a need for a
secretariat? Should there be a common currency? Is the eventual aim to form
a customs union?
The politicians talk boldly about joint infrastructure development in ports,
rail links and telecommunications. Many bankers are anxious to know how the
politicians propose to finance such investment. Mr Sarik Tara, a Turkish
contractor with a decade's experience working in the former Soviet Union,
cites the dramatic fall in Russia's energy exports as evidence that the real
problem is not the lack of infrastructure but the lack of a working market
mechanism. Even in the area of telecommunications, which every businessman
recognises as a key priority, western experts say there is insufficient
'traffic' to justify financing a big new network.
To promote trade, some officials suggest the Turkish lira could become a
common currency, using the example of the French franc zone in west Africa.
The lira is, after all, now convertible. However, it is far from stable and
has fallen against major currencies in the past year.
It will be difficult to get commercial banks involved in trade finance in
the region. Turkey's Eximbank has plans to extend credits to these
countries. But as one leading banker asks: 'To whom? Can a commercial bank
really assess a financial institution in those countries?'
Moreover, the debt provision that a western bank would have to make in such
a market would wipe out the returns on a commercial loan.
Mr Demirel says the aim is the free circulation of goods and services,
although officials concede that some of the newly emerging states may not be
ready for the full blast of competition even if that competition is from
Turkish goods.
The best hope may be barter and counter trade. Turkish trade with the former
Soviet Union and now with Russia has been underpinned by a Dollars 300m
(Pounds 157m) gas deal. One minor snag - if Russia becomes a member of the
International Monetary Fund, Turkey could find itself in breach of its own
obligations with the Fund not to enter into non-cash transactions.
Afghanistan's new govern-ment has applied to join Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and
five former Soviet republics in an Islamic regional economic club, the
Iranian news agency IRNA said Reuter reports from Nicosia.

FT  10 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Japan to fight on in dumping row with EC -
Cassette dispute set for Gatt panel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is expected to ask a Gatt disputes panel to rule on its complaint that
the European Community has unfairly imposed anti-dumping duties on Japanese
audio cassette tapes, after an unsuccessful attempt at conciliation by
Gatt's anti-dumping committee yesterday.
Dumping is the sale of goods at less than the price charged in the home
market, or less than the cost of production.
Under Gatt's anti-dumping rules Japan must wait until next October, three
months after the conciliation failure, to request a panel. If it does so, it
will be only the second time Japan has taken a trade dispute to Gatt since
it joined the world trade body in 1955. In 1990 Japan secured a panel ruling
against EC anti-dumping duties on mainly electronic goods assembled in the
Community by Japanese 'screwdriver' assembly plants.
The present case involves duties of between 15 and 25 per cent on audio
tapes imposed by the EC last May. Japan claims that the duties are excessive
and that the EC broke Gatt anti-dumping rules by failing to prove that its
tapes were hurting the domestic industry. Although EC imports of audio
cassette tapes from Japan rose slightly between 1986 and 1988, their share
of the EC market fell from 41 to 35 per cent, according to Tokyo. The
European Commission found 'injury' to home producers in only one member
state but the duties were being applied Community-wide.
Japan also argues that its cassettes are in a higher price bracket and so do
not compete directly with cheaper EC tapes.
Brussels maintains that the Japanese complaint is a back-door attempt to
re-open the wrangle over anti-dumping rules in the Uruguay Round of world
trade talks, ostensibly closed by publication of a draft accord last
December.
The EC says the four Japanese companies involved dominate a closed domestic
market and use profits from high prices at home to subsidise exports and
establish plants abroad. It claims the market share of EC producers in the
Community has fallen to 15 per cent because of dumping, while Japan's
imports of cassettes were 0.05 per cent of consumption last year.
Separately, yesterday's meeting of Gatt's anti-dumping committee agreed to a
US request for a disputes panel on anti-dumping duties imposed by Canada on
imports of US beer. This is the third Gatt panel on beer involving the two
countries. Earlier panels have ruled against Canadian restrictions on
imported beer and against US rules that discriminate against beer imports.

vice-presidential credentials seriously and who has found little to please
him in Mr Clinton, criticised the Clinton-Gore partnership as 'a fairly
narrow ticket'.
'It takes two wings to fly and here you have two of the same wing,' he said
yesterday.
But the selection of a running mate with a broadly similar political
philosophy to his own may in fact offer Mr Clinton a better opportunity to
present a coherent candidacy than the traditional choice of someone from a
different region or political camp.
In fact, Senator Gore does balance Mr Clinton in a number of significant
respects.
As a Vietnam veteran, and one of the few Democrats to have given strong
support to the Gulf war, Mr Gore could offset the questions raised over
whether Mr Clinton dodged the Vietnam draft.
As the Senate's most prominent spokesman on ecological issues, he could
underpin Mr Clinton's environmental platform, where Republican campaign
managers believe his record as governor of Arkansas leaves him vulnerable.
As a second-term senator who can boast that he actively influenced US
nuclear missile policy in the 1980s, Mr Gore also balances Mr Clinton's
relative inexperience in foreign affairs.
Perhaps most important, Mr Gore succeeded in inhaling when he smoked
marijuana in college.
Analysts differ, however, on whether Mr Gore will repair his partner's
perceived weaknesses or merely underline them.
Political strategists are also rethinking the strengths and weaknesses of an
all-Southern ticket in the November election, when Mr Clinton is likely to
face not just President George Bush but also Mr Ross Perot, the irascible
Texas billionaire who seems all but certain to run as an independent
candidate.
An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll published yesterday showed the three men in
a statistical dead heat: Mr Perot stood slightly ahead with 33 per cent, Mr
Bush second at 31 per cent and Mr Clinton third at 28 per cent, but 60 per
cent of those questioned indicated only weak support for their favoured
candidate.
At 44, Mr Gore is two years younger than Mr Clinton, but he has a long
political pedigree. Son of a senator, he first ran for Congress in 1976, and
in 1988 made a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Although he
won six Southern states in the Super Tuesday primaries, he lost Florida and
Texas to Governor Michael Dukakis, the eventual Democratic nominee, and his
campaign collapsed after a flop in New York.
He decided against a second try in 1992, citing his wish to spend more time
with his family, especially his young son, who was severely injured in a car
accident three years ago.
Supporters say that in 1988 he started campaigning too late, and he has
unquestionably gained in national stature since then - principally by his
stand on the environment - yet doubts remain about his ability as a
campaigner.
His speeches are often soporific, yet his undoubted brains and command of
detail should present a formidable challenge to Vice President Dan Quayle in
the one televised debate between the two vice-presidential candidates.

SENIOR Democrats in the US Congress yesterday demanded the appointment of a
special prosecutor to investigate claims that Bush administration officials
had committed crimes in aiding President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, before his
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
The demand for an investigation is likely to prove a political embarrassment
to President George Bush, who has denied any wrong-doing by his
administration.
The request was in a letter from 20 Democratic members of the House
judiciary committee, sent yesterday to Mr William Barr, attorney-general. It
said a special prosecutor should investigate alleged attempts 'to conceal
from Congress information about potential criminal activity'.
Republican members of the committee have accused Democrats of a witch-hunt
against Mr Bush. They say a special prosecutor would be a waste of money.
Mr Jack Brooks, the conservative Texan Democrat who chairs the committee,
denied yesterday that the call for a special prosecutor was related to
electoral politics. He said the request was not an attempt to second-guess
the administration's policy of 'tilting' toward Iraq in its war with Iran in
the 1980s.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Brazil reaches outline debt accord

THE Brazilian government and its commercial bank creditors yesterday reached
an outline agreement aimed at easing the burden of servicing more than
Dollars 44bn (Pounds 23bn) of its foreign debt.
Leading bankers said they hoped to thrash out a detailed accord with the
government by August, allowing for its approval that month by the Brazilian
senate. The deal could be closed, after approval by all bank creditors, by
the end of the year.
The agreement was greeted by the Brazilian economy minister, Mr Marclio
Marques Moreira, as a 'watershed, closing a long chapter overshadowed by
foreign debt problems and opening a new chapter full of opportunities. This
is the new Brazil, reinserting itself into the international community in a
dynamic, competitive and sovereign way.'
Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, said that, after the Brazilian
agreement, more than 90 per cent of the commercial bank debt of major debtor
countries had been dealt with. 'It represents a milestone in finally putting
the Latin American debt crisis behind us,' he said.
However, there remain doubts about whether the agreement will reach
fruition. These have been substantially heightened by the corruption crisis
enveloping Brazilian President Fernando Collor. This has called into
question his retention of office and, if he does stay on, his ability to
wield effective power.
Some bankers argue that the Brazilian accord may be the first deal signed
under the Brady debt initiative - named for Secretary Brady - to fail.
The accord would allow banks to exchange their loans for one of five
varieties of concessionary bonds, or to make new loans equivalent to 18.18
per cent of their current exposure.
The concessionary bonds are each designed to yield an equal sacrifice to
banks, equivalent to about 35 per cent write-down in the face value of the
debt. Some concessionary bonds are backed by guarantees of principal or
interest.
The accord also calls for Brazil to increase its interest payments on
existing debt from 30 per cent at present to 50 per cent of contracted
payments, once senate approval has been obtained. It also addressed past
arrears of interest and allowed debt-for-equity concessions.
The news of the accord was broken in Brazil through a hand-written note from
Mr Collor to his spokesman. In the letter, the president described the
accord as 'a good solution after a year of negotiation and one which does
not compromise our capacity to pay principal'.
Mr Collor claimed: 'No other country got the advantages that we have
achieved, either in terms of the percentage of reduction, the multiplicity
of options or in the modality of guarantees.'
The Brazilian stock market reacted cautiously to the long-awaited news, the
Sao Paulo market index rising by only 1.1 per cent.

FT  10 JUL 92 / The Brady initiative embraces Braslia but doubts remain:
Collor's political weakness presents a problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL, the developing world's largest debtor, is the last big Latin
American country to have agreed a debt restructuring and reduction accord
under the initiative launched by Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary,
in 1989.
The accord is the most complex yet negotiated under thisinitiative. Banks
have the choice among six options, three of which carry collateral assuring
payment of interest or principal in case of a Brazilian default. Another
layer of complexity is added by a likely lack of collateral - the Dollars
3.2bn (Pounds 1.67bn) promised may not be enough to go round. This problem
will be surmounted by the issue of 'phase-in' bonds, to be exchanged as and
when collateral becomes available.
While this makes valuing the various options hideously difficult for banks,
the biggest potential pitfalls lie elsewhere. The Brazilian government is
intending to secure senate approval of a detailed accord in August. Despite
the insistence by the government that approval will be forthcoming, that
cannot be taken for granted, given the political weakness of President
Fernando Collor.
Despite the government's protests to the contrary, the opposition will be
able to characterise the accord as of, at best, moderate benefit for Brazil.
Because the government is now paying only 30 per cent of scheduled interest,
its actual interest payments may well rise after the deal is closed.
Furthermore, once restructured, the debt will be very difficult to
restructure again, because most of it will have been converted into
marketable bonds.
Moreover, unless the government's economic programme is firmly on track, the
deal could be severely jeopardised before it is even closed. Brazil looks as
though it is going to miss its second consecutive set of quarterly targets
under its International Monetary Fund economic programme. If the programme
is jeopardised, then IMF funds which are needed to provide part of the
collateral will also be unavailable. The World Bank - another source of
funds for collateral - has made plain, meanwhile, that it is not keen on
lending in support of Brazil, given its current economic uncertainty.
In providing collateral, Brazil has promised to match the amounts of funds
made available by the international institutions and in new money from the
banks. If the other funds were not forthcoming, Brazil could choose to top
up collateral from its own volatile reserves. But, if the government were
not in a valid programme with the IMF, then many banks might decide to
reject the agreement.
The uncertainty over whether the accord will be closed means that what
bankers call 'completion risk' is high. So, while providing a welcome
political fillip for Mr Collor, the 'Mexico effect' will be modest, if
discernible. When Mexico signed an agreement in principle with banks three
years ago, funds flooded into the country and confidence soared. The
immediate benefit was lower domestic interest rates - which helped economic
recovery and reduced the burden of servicing Mexico's domestic government
debt.
Brazil has a long way to go before it achieves the depth of economic reform
achieved by Mexico three years ago, and the completion risk was
significantly lower.
The reason banks would entertain this high-risk prospect is because some,
particularly in the US, are keen to write back the provisions they have made
on their Brazil debt. Some believe that the team of Mr Marclio Marques
Moreira, economy minister, is worthy of support, despite the weakness of the
government that backs him. Without him, the whole deal might have to be
renegotiated at another time.
There is also some political pressure from the Bush administration to get
the agreement out of the way so that, 10 years more or less from the advent
of the debt crisis, the issue may be said to have been resolved. The
administration would like to claim that the Brady initiative has resolved
the issue.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Secretive Saudi bank may be forced to change course:
National Commercial Bank may have to forfeit its privileged private status
and sort out its problem loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi Arabia's oldest and biggest, is a
singular and secretive institution in a singularly secretive country. It is
the kingdom's only private commercial bank, and the confidentiality this
affords is the factor beyond any other which has attracted the Saudi princes
whose custom has won it the tag 'the Saudi royal bank'.
But NCB's highly-prized secrecy looks increasingly a millstone around the
bank's neck as it enters the most controversial and troubled period in its
41-year history.
However the bank survives the shock resignation this week of Sheikh Khalid
bin Mahfouz, the bank's chief operating officer, who left to defend himself
against fraud charges in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI) affair, it will not emerge as quite the same institution.
Whatever the eventual verdict on Sheikh Khalid, who with a London associate
was accused of fraudulently obtaining more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m)
from BCCI customers, and the effect of other possible ramifications of NCB's
involvement with the collapsed bank, analysts and fellow bankers agree that
the Saudi bank will be forced, for internal problems of its own, to change
its structure and outlook fundamentally over the next few years to survive
as a competitive institution.
NCB is essentially Saudi Arabia's founding banking institution and has been
among the kingdom's most trusted, by royals and subjects alike, in a land
traditionally suspicious of banks.
Owned by the bin Mahfouz family (whose net worth is estimated at Dollars
2bn), which holds more than 60 per cent of the bank's shares, and the
al-Kaaki family, it has a third of the kingdom's total bank deposits, eight
overseas branches or offices and, with net assets in 1989 of Dollars 23bn,
is the largest private bank in the Middle East.
But NCB has not published full financial figures since 1989, and its
accounts for the three preceding years were qualified by the auditors.
According to Capital Intelligence (CI), the Cyprus-based rating agency,
auditors have consistently been unhappy with the way the bank has classified
billions of riyals of non-performing loans, most of them more than a decade
on the books, lent, for the most part, to a few very highly-placed Saudis.
The extent of these loans is undisclosed.
Saudi bankers do not doubt that the bank's solid deposit base and top-level
support will guarantee its leading status in the kingdom's banking market.
But the bank appears to be losing some ground in the kingdom's increasingly
competitive, and increasingly sophisticated, banking sector. NCB's share of
domestic deposits, dominant though it is, has shrunk over the past five
years from around 40 per cent to nearer 30 per cent of the total.
CI, in a recent memorandum, said it believes the main cause of NCB's delay
in producing full figures for 1990 and 1991 to be its 'challenging and
unconventional' methods to try to recover non-performing loans. This,
decoded, means essentially that, by failing to produce figures for the
kingdom's best-connected bank, NCB has sought to embarrass the country's
rulers into intervening to force the debtors to pay up. Some analysts argue
that only King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, himself could achieve this.
But whatever the reasons for NCB's non-disclosure, the effects have hurt its
international standing - quite apart from any detrimental effects of Sheikh
Khalid's alleged dealings with BCCI. In May, for instance, the bank closed
its London office, arguing it had been running at a loss. However, many
bankers believe the Bank of England urged the closure, uncomfortable that a
branch with Pounds 1bn on its books had produced no up-to-date figures. The
Bank will not comment on the matter.
However, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said yesterday
that among its reasons for ordering the closure of NCB's New York branch was
its failure to provide 'current, complete financial information' on NCB's
consolidated operations.
CI early in June suspended its rating for NCB because of the non-disclosure
and said in its explanatory memorandum that while under Saudi law NCB, as a
private bank, has no legal requirement to produce results, it had an
'ethical obligation' to do so while it engaged in substantial dealings with
foreign counterparties.
CI also argued that the bank had become too large to remain an unlimited
liability partnership and should urgently consider turning itself into a
joint-stock bank, like the kingdom's other 11 commercial banks. 'The right
time for this has already passed,' said CI.
Whatever the other effects of Sheikh Khalid's departure - and insiders
suggest that his hands have been very much guiding the bank's rudder -
analysts say it could prove the spark for overdue structural change. 'Once
things stabilise,' says Mr Mardig Haladjian, a CI analyst, 'a major
restructuring is certain to take place'.
Indeed, NCB officials themselves appeared to acknowledge as much soon after
Sheikh Khalid's resignation. 'Like all dynamic institutions, the bank will
change as circumstances change,' said a bank spokesman in Jeddah, when asked
if the resignation might herald further changes.
But there is a dilemma inherent in any moves the bank might make to open
itself out. A full restructuring - and certainly a public share offer -
would require the bank to sort out its problem loans, which in turn would
require the energetic support of senior members of the Saudi royal family.
But, as several Saudi bankers are quick to note, these are the very people
who most prize and enjoy NCB's status as a private, and therefore highly
confidential, institution.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Patten turns on the charm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG got a taste of a real politician yesterday when Mr Chris Patten,
the colony's new governor, held an audience of 800 spellbound for half an
hour as he outlined his vision for the last five years of British colonial
rule.
His vision was based on hard realities, but served up with noble thoughts.
He held up as the prize of success 'a shining example to the world of
partnership and co-operation'. However, he was not blind to the need for a
close working relationship with the colony's future landlord, China.
It was a vintage performance which launched his governorship in a way not
done before.
Mr Patten was anxious to convey the image of a man running Hong Kong, rather
than running to Whitehall to seek approval for his every decision.
But, while his audience was impressed by the fluency of his oratory, few
were unmindful of what he faces. As one senior civil servant noted: 'We'll
have to see how Beijing reacts.'
A member of his Executive Council, or cabinet, noted: 'What he said sounded
good, now all he has to do is do it.'
Ms Emily Lau, an outspoken advocate of democracy, said: 'I remain to be
convinced' that he is Hong Kong's hope for greater democracy.
Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, was more generous, even
though Mr Patten did not address the democracy issue head-on.
'I thought it was the speech of a consummate politician,' he said last
night. 'He managed to please everyone and offend no one.'
Mr Patten stressed his belief in the maintenance of Hong Kong's freedoms. He
said the colony should retain a low-taxation environment. He also saw much
to be done to develop social policies, particularly for education, the
elderly, and for the environment.
He said nothing to offend China. One of the many difficult tasks in front of
him is to build trust with Beijing. He has to convince China's leaders that
the political structure he fashions is one which it is in their interests to
accept.
He offered an olive branch, promising candour and co-operation in matters
concerning the transfer of sovereignty. But Mr Patten was not on bended
knee; he said trust was a mutual exchange. This will be put to the test in
the coming weeks as he oversees Hong Kong's negotiations with China about
financing the colony's new airport.
It is thought in Hong Kong that China's disagreement with the financing
cloaks a fear that Mr Patten will introduce participative democracy. His
vigorous assertion that his government will be 'executive-led' was
calculated to allay that fear but no one is betting serious money that it
will.
Mr Patten got Day One right; he has 1,815 days to go.

FT  10 JUL 92 / French truck strike losses disputed: Government and
employers differ over impact on economy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government and employers yesterday differed sharply over the
scale of the economic damage inflicted by the 10-day truck strike.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said supply shortages had seriously hit
some companies but would have no impact on national economic growth, set to
reach 2 per cent this year, according to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, head of the economics commission of the
Patronat employers' group, insisted that the damage could harm growth. 'We
believe this great Gallic event has discredited and weakened us,' he added.
Several industrial federations called on the government yesterday to allow
them a moratorium on tax and social security payments, in order to help them
through the cash flow shortage caused by the strike. 'Several thousand
industrial companies have been forced to make lay-offs and have lost sales,
especially in export markets, at the moment when the general economy is in a
marked slowdown,' said a joint statement by the steel, mechanical, chemical,
textile and electrical industry federations. Farming and tourism are the
worst-hit sectors, said Mr Sapin. The government would decide on assistance
case by case, through the inter-ministerial industrial restructuring
committee (Ciri). The government would consider requests for aid from
foreign companies which had lost money because of the strike, but help would
go to French businesses first, said Mr Sapin.
The ABF French banking association yesterday called on its members to show
'understanding and flexibility' towards companies in difficulty and to study
the situation with local authorities and professional groups. Small
businesses are likely to be worst hit, said the ABF.
The direct damage to French and foreign companies caught up in the stoppage
is variously estimated at well below FFr5bn (Pounds 500m) by finance
ministry officials and and 'several billion francs' by the Patronat.
The employers estimate that a loss of five days' production would be
equivalent to 2 per cent of a year's total gross domestic product, but is
not sure yet how many full days of production have actually been lost. It
expects to produce a more precise estimate in the next few days.
Farmers angry at EC agricultural reforms ransacked two supermarkets in the
southern town of Nimes, and dockers set up their own road blockade in the
south-western port of Bordeaux yesterday to protest against reforms in their
pay and working conditions, Reuter reports from Paris.
The profusion of street protests this summer - radical farmers attempted to
blockade Paris last month - highlights the fragility of the unions and of
worker representation in France despite 11 years of almost uninterrupted
Socialist rule. A recurring government complaint during the truckers'
dispute was that the protesters had no representative spokesmen. Only 10 per
cent of French workers are unionised, and in a sector such as trucking,
where many are self-employed, dialogue with the government has proved
difficult.

THE very name Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is
calculated to dampen public interest in an organisation which, though now 17
years old, has seldom caught the public imagination. This week, however,
leaders of as many as 52 nations are meeting to discuss adapting a forum
created to provide a framework for relations between the communist and
western halves of Europe and to set standards on human rights, to the
post-Cold war world.
Human rights and democratic government are still at the centre of the new
Helsinki document due to be adopted today. But the focus has again switched
to security problems. As President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia so
eloquently told the conference yesterday:
'The sudden outburst of freedom has not only untied the straitjacket made by
Communism, it has also unveiled the centuries-old, often thorny history of
nations. Peoples are now remembering their past kings and emperors, the
states they had formed far back in their past and the borders of those
states ..It is entirely understandable that such a situation becomes a
breeding ground for nationalist fanaticism, xenophobia and intolerance, as
well as for all kinds of demagogues, authoritarians and populists to whom
people, overcome by a deep feeling of uncertainty, may well be inclined to
turn for salvation.'
The intention is to transform the CSCE, which includes the US, Canada,
Russia and the other former Soviet states, into a more effective instrument
for preventing conflicts as well as dealing with them after they have broken
out.
Procedures for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management and
peaceful settlement of disputes have been or will be set up. A Vienna-based
conflict prevention centre and an Office of Democratic Institutions and
Human Rights in Warsaw have been created. They will be complemented by the
appointment of a CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities to
investigate tensions arising from ethnic and minority problems.
Peaceful settlement of disputes will be an important element of a revamped
CSCE, though there is disagreement on conciliation and arbitration
machinery. The French argue for a formal court, while the US wants more
flexible political conciliation machinery based on consensus decisions.
If a crisis breaks out, formal peacekeeping operations are envisaged. These
would normally be carried out on a case-by-case basis by individual CSCE
members or, at the request of the CSCE, which has no armed forces of its
own, by organisations such as Nato or the nine-nation Western European
Union.

THE Russian government was yesterday reported to have adopted new
restrictions on the movement of foreigners at a time when the country is
trying to attract foreign investment and open up to the west.
Itar-Tass news agency said in an unsourced report that foreigners would have
to apply for Security Ministry (ex-KGB) permission to visit 'several areas'
in the Moscow, Leningrad (now St Petersburg), Nizhny Novgorod, Sverdlovsk
(now Ekaterinburg), Chelyabinsk, Kaliningrad, Astrakhan and Krasnoyarsk
regions.
Many of these areas used to be sealed off but have been opened up in recent
times.  They include large military plants, defence installations, and
environmental disaster areas.
Officials at the ministries for foreign affairs and security could not
confirm the report last night.
But if it is true, the move would indicate a sinister step back to the old
days of Soviet dictatorship, playing into the hands of conservatives and
giving an opposite message to that of partnership with the west proclaimed
by President Boris Yeltsin.
Supporters of ousted Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia kidnapped the
deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Kavsadze, yesterday in a new show of
resistance to the country's leadership, according to Interfax news agency,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
A spokesman for the ruling state council told local journalists that Mr
Kavsadze's car had been blown up in the west of the republic. His driver had
been killed.
Western Georgia is the main stronghold of Mr Gamsakhurdia, overthrown in
January after a two-week battle in which hundreds died.

BOSNIAN president Alija Izetbegovic yesterday asked the US and other
countries to send troops to the borders with neighbouring Serbia to stop the
flow of arms into the war-torn republic.
'Aid will not stop the killing, the deportations and the ethnic cleansing,'
said Mr Izetbegovic, who reached Helsinki by getting a lift on a relief
flight from the besieged capital of Sarajevo on Wednesday.
Mr Izetbegovic told the summit meeting of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) that Bosnia needed 'arms to defend ourselves
against the Serb aggressors'.
'It is a fraud that the Yugoslav army has withdrawn from Bosnia. It is here
in another name. There are 80,000 Serbian-backed Yugoslav troops, 500 tanks,
and 55 planes still in our republic. It is one of the best equipped armies
in Europe.'
US President George Bush and secretary of state James Baker yesterday made
no explicit commitment to provide military aid to Bosnia.
'Our policy is that we do not believe that large infusions of arms into the
crisis in what was Yugoslavia is going to solve the problem,' a US spokesman
said.
The US would continue to work with its European allies, and 'we will have to
consider what our future steps will be.' A US diplomat suggested that
efforts would be made to tighten the UN sanctions against Serbia and
Montenegro.
Although several other CSCE countries repeated the US view, other countries,
notably Canada and Czechoslovakia said the international response to the war
in Bosnia-Hercegovina, as well as ethnic disputes in other former communist
countries, was dangerous and shameful.
Few delegates believe the CSCE's new mechanisms for peace-keeping or crisis
management will have enough clout to stop the killing.
Reuter adds from Strasbourg: The European Parliament recommended yesterday
that Croatia be excluded from the EC aid programme for eastern Europe
because of questions over its role in the Bosnian civil war.
Some deputies charged that Croatia and Serbia had agreed to partition
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said Brussels would prefer to give aid to
both Croatia and Slovenia, but would delete Croatia from its proposal if the
parliament wished.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Lamont says regulation failed in Maxwell case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont conceded yesterday that the Securities and Investments
Board review of regulators' handling of the Maxwell affair showed grave
deficiencies which were a matter of 'serious concern' to the government.
In reply to a question in the House of Commons, the chancellor promised to
ensure that necessary steps were taken to tighten the system of regulation.
His statement was the government's first public acknowledgement that
regulation had failed in the Maxwell case. He added, however, that the
majority of pension funds served their members well, and that the Maxwell
affair was 'wholly exceptional'.
The SIB yesterday unveiled its conclusions about the role in the Maxwell
affair of Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said his board had rejected a suggestion that
it withdraw recognition from Imro. Instead, it had decided to work on
correcting key shortcomings.
The SIB also announced that Mr John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, is to
resign as soon as a replacement can be found. In May, Imro announced it was
seeking a successor to Mr Morgan after his term expired in September 1993.
Mr Large said the SIB had decided against releasing the full contents of an
Imro investigation into the affair for fear of prejudicing future legal
actions.
The parts of the report released yesterday show that Imro had concluded it
was 'unduly ready to rely on the good faith and professionalism of those
with whom it dealt' and 'its monitoring activity was insufficiently alert
and responsive to information available to it'. Its response to the crisis
after Robert Maxwell's death was also 'inadequate'.
Imro believed, however, that it acted properly in authorising Maxwell's fund
management companies to operate under a looser regulatory regime.
The SIB's report, released yesterday, took a harsher view of Imro's role. It
said: 'Imro's monitoring failures in this case reveal more than a general
lack of market awareness and scepticism in dealing with information about
transactions and in monitoring returns.' It added, however, that 'Imro had
in many respects shown itself to be a committed and effective regulator'.
Mr Large, who took over as SIB chairman on June 1, said he remained
committed to self-regulation for the City. 'What we have to look at is how
to improve the system we have without throwing out the parts that are good.'
His main initiatives would include a drive to recruit more industry
practitioners to work for the self-regulatory bodies.
The SIB board has asked Mr Large to review how it carries out its own
regulatory responsibilities and how it monitors the activities of the four
self-regulatory organisations (SROs).
'This re-examination will have regard to considerations both of investor
protection and efficiency,' the report said. In particular, Mr Large said,
he was anxious to recruit more industry practitioners into the SROs.
Mr Large signalled, however, that he wants no significant changes to
self-regulation. 'The reality is that the problem is not as great as it's
perceived to be.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / Saudi bank ordered to close US branch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERAL US banking author-ities have accused the National Commercial Bank of
Saudi Arabia of violating 'significant provisions' of US banking laws.
The bank, which is Saudi Arabia's biggest and has members of the Saudi
ruling family among its customers, has been ordered to shut its New York
branch within 30 days.
The order comes two months after NCB closed its London branch 'in an effort
to rationalise operations and cut costs' following consultations with the
Bank of England.
The Bank of England has declined to comment on the circumstances of the
London closure.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the federal bank
regulatory agency, said it acted in conjunction with the Federal Reserve
Board, which has filed charges against Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, who
resigned this week as NCB's chief operating officer. Sheikh Khalid was
indicted last week in New York on charges of having schemed to defraud
investors and depositors in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International of
more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m).
In Jeddah, the NCB said it was 'greatly surprised' by the Fed and OCC
actions and denied 'in the strongest terms all charges as being devoid of
any substance'.
NCB claimed 'the curious timing of the announcements clearly indicates they
were the result of political pressure' following last week's indictments in
New York.
A federal judge in New York yesterday ordered the US assets of Sheikh Khalid
to be frozen after it was disclosed that the Federal Reserve had levied a
Dollars 170m fine against the Saudi banker and a Dollars 6m fine against Mr
Haroon Kahlon, an associate also indicted last week. In its enforcement
order, the Fed alleged that Sheikh Khalid, with the assistance of Mr Kahlon
and through the facilities of NCB, violated US law by acquiring control of
28.7 per cent of the shares of the parent company of First American Bank of
Washington without first obtaining Fed approval. NCB denied the charge,
saying it never bought the shares.
First American is one of four US banks that was secretly and illegally
acquired by shareholders accused by the Fed of being front men acting for
BCCI.
The OCC said it viewed the allegations pertaining to NCB and Sheikh Khalid
to be 'extremely serious'. The federal agency said: 'NCB is alleged to have
violated significant provisions of the federal banking laws applicable to
federal branches and their parent foreign banks.'
The OCC said NCB's New York branch had 'not supplied current and accurate
financial statements regarding the condition of its parent', raising serious
questions about the operations and liquidity of the branch. Sheikh Khalid
yesterday termed the Federal Reserve Board charges 'unwarranted and
ill-advised'.
Mark Nicholson in London adds: The bank yesterday also denied reports that
its sale earlier this week of very large quantities of silver - a sale
bullion traders reckoned to be as much as 50m ounces, but which NCB says was
less than 20m - was related in any way to the resignation of Sheikh Khalid
or the charges against him.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Western warships to tighten Serbian sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Western European Union defence organisation is today expected to agree
to send naval units to patrol the Adriatic to tighten sanctions against
Serbia after the Yugoslav republic's failure to stop the war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In separate moves, the US dispatched the cruiser Biddle and an amphibious
landing ship to the area, and France decided to send more troops and
helicopters to Bosnia to back United Nations relief operations.
The two ships from the Sixth Fleet last night entered the Adriatic, where
seven US warships were briefly stationed last week. The Defence Department
said the ships would provide communications and radar help for US
humanitarian aid flights to Sarajevo.
The moves come amid warnings by UN officials in Sarajevo, the besieged
Bosnian capital, that continued fighting is endangering the international
airlift.
Swedish truck drivers hired by the UN refugee relief agency are refusing to
transport aid because of sniper fire.
Officials of the nine-member WEU, attending a summit in Helsinki of the
51-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, insisted that
its action, to be agreed by foreign ministers in the margin of the CSCE
meeting, was not a precursor to full-scale military intervention in Bosnia.
Such a step was currently not envisaged by any western country.
Mr Enzo Scotti, the Italian president of the WEU council, said the ministers
would also discuss ways of protecting the humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo.
It was not immediately known how many ships might be sent to the area, but
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, announced earlier in the week that Britain
would be sending a destroyer, HMS Nottingham, 'to help enforce sanctions'.
In a speech at the Helsinki summit, President George Bush strongly supported
action to ensure that UN sanctions were respected and that relief supplies
got through to Sarajevo, 'no matter what it takes'.
But at a meeting yesterday morning with Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian
president, Mr Bush made no commitment to supply weapons to Bosnia's defence
forces or to intervene militarily in the crisis.
US officials have made it plain over the past few days that, while
Washington would contemplate sending military aircraft to ensure the safety
of the UN humanitarian airlift and overland convoys if necessary, it has
ruled out dispatching ground forces to Bosnia. The UK has adopted a similar
position on sending troops. In France, Mr Jean Musitelli, the presidential
spokesman, said his country's move had been closely co-ordinated with Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, who had asked France to
contribute 700 troops to the UN contingents replacing the Canadian battalion
in Bosnia.
Last night negotiators at the CSCE failed to break a deadlock over a
statement condemning the rump state of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and
Montenegro, and left the issue for the leaders of the member countries to
decide. The Bosnian president has appealed to all 51 CSCE leaders - the
former Yugoslav delegation has been temporarily suspended - to sign a
declaration of solidarity with Bosnia today. At the UN last night, Lord
Carrington, after briefing the Security Council, said he would call for
another round of the EC-sponsored peace talks on Bosnia.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Top public pay rises cut to 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday slashed recommended rises in the pay of Britain's
top public servants and MPs allowances in an effort to set an example over
pay restraint and reinforce its determination to control public finances.
Top civil servants, judges and members of the armed services were told they
could only have a 4 per cent pay rise this year against a recommendation of
up to 24 per cent.
In a further rebuff to the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB), ministers
overruled its proposal to increase allowances of MPs by up to 40.2 per cent.
MPs will receive an office allowance increase of only 9.8 per cent, but the
government could be defeated when the Commons debates the proposals in a
free vote next Tuesday.
A further 3 per cent will be paid to top public servants next year and 2.8
per cent the year after, in addition to whatever increase is decided for
those years. The total increase amounts to about half of what was
recommended.
Underlining the importance attached to the decision, Mr John Major returned
to London from the G7 summit in Munich specifically to chair an extended
cabinet meeting which decided to hold down the rises.
The government's stand on top people's pay, which will save Pounds 22m this
year, was generally welcomed by Tory MPs but denounced as a betrayal by
unions representing senior civil servants. The Association of First Division
Civil Servants accused the government of 'sheer political opportunism'. The
Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists said it was a 'slap
in the face' for senior civil servants and the review body.
In its most fundamental review since 1985, based largely on comparisons with
the private sector, the review body recognised the need for 'reasonable
restraint', but argued that job security in public service had to be offset
by the compensation packages and service contracts common in the private
sector.
However, Downing Street said 'wider considerations' had to be taken into
account in setting top people's pay, citing the fall in average earnings and
the 4 per cent going rate for private sector pay settlements.
The Treasury said that the decision was intended to 'send a signal' as work
begins on agreeing public spending totals for the next financial year.
The government is to investigate extending performance-related pay to the
highest Civil Service grades.
After yesterday' decisions, the salary of the head of the home Civil Service
will rise this year from Pounds 104,750 to Pounds 108,940, instead of Pounds
130,000 as proposed by the TSRB. A major-general in the army will see a rise
from Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 55,120 instead of Pounds 63,000.
The separate decision on MPs' office cost allowances is set to provoke angry
exchanges next week in the Commons.
Labour has already tabled a motion calling for a Pounds 40,000 allowance and
could win support from Tory MPs unhappy at the Commons facilities.
The TSRB proposed increasing MPs' allowances to between Pounds 37,360 and
Pounds 42,360, including extra help for general office expenses.

FT  10 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share rally extended in good volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOOTSIE Index came within one point of the 2,500 mark yesterday as a
brighter tone in the US dollar and on Wall Street brought buyers back into
the London market, lifting the Index by more than 25 points.
The institutions were buyers of the leading blue chips, taking their cue
from strategists at several UK securities houses who described the UK market
as oversold, if only in the near term. London joined in the general advance
by other leading European bourses. However, any more lasting rally is likely
to hinge on the meeting of the Bundesbank policy council next Thursday,
according to the strategy team at Robert Flemings Securities.
The upturn in London was encouraged by the favourable response to the latest
US jobless figures from both the dollar and the New York stock market, where
the Dow Average gained 21 points in UK trading hours.
The London arm of a US investment bank bought shares in Glaxo strongly and
there were indications of a large programme trade which was weighted towards
the buy side.
Trading volume increased sharply yesterday, at least in terms of the Seaq
daily total which rose to 482.9m shares from Wednesday's 396.1m; retail
business was worth only Pounds 816.9m in the previous session, still an
unexciting performance.
At the close, the FT-SE Index showed a gain of 25.3 points at 2,497.9,
having touched 2,499.2 earlier. The erratic performance of the stock market
this week has suggested that the institutions continue to regard the UK
market as a 'buy' between FT-SE 2,450 and 2,500.
Equities were led forward by sharp rises in US-orientated stocks, with BAT
Industries, SmithKline Beecham and Rothmans International standing out.
Domestic consumer stocks remained out of favour, with fresh food
distributers unsettled after a profit warning from Albert Fisher, supplier
of products to the big supermarkets.
Among UK securities houses taking a relatively more optimistic view for the
short term were UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, where Mr Mark Brown, while admitting
that the market has taken a worse turn than expected, urged that it was
'time to buy'. He stressed that the current yield on UK equities of around 5
per cent, putting shares on a yield ratio of 180 against government bonds,
has proved a 'useful support during this recession'.
Today brings the close of the two-week trading account in London equities,
and share prices benefited again yesterday from bear-closing operations -
buying operations by traders who had sold stock early in the account period,
when share prices were higher, and needed shares for delivery when the
account closes. Traders were favourably impressed by the market's
performance yesterday, perhaps more by the improvement in trading volume
than by the gain in the FT-SE Index. The market has traded an extremely
erratic pattern this week, with share prices moving sharply in minimal
turnover as traders have reacted to bad news on new issues and company
profits.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE September Contract on the FT-SE recovered from early weakness that
followed a selling order by a large institution and moved ahead to end
strongly, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first deal in the FT-SE contract for September delivery was struck at
2,492, leading some dealers to forecast a strong move forward. But that
positive mood evaporated when Salomon Brothers sold around 500 contracts,
with part of the order said to have been executed through James Capel.
With independent traders joining in the selling, the contract fell to 2,485.
The completion of the Salomon's order coupled with independent traders
caught short led to a turnaround, helped by a rally in the gilts market.
In the afternoon, the firmness on Wall Street led to further buying, pushing
September higher to reach the session's high point of 2,523 just ahead of
the official market close. September closed at 2,521, up 17 on the previous
session but around 2 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash
of about 25.
Traded options saw an improvement in volume, the day's total reaching 31,998
lots. The FT-SE contract accounted for 9,429 of the overall total. Hillsdown
was the busiest stock option, trading 2,800 lots, and was followed by Forte.

FT  10 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy demand for Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS GROUP Glaxo saw unusually heavy turnover as buyers moved back into the
stock. US investment bank Goldman Sachs raised its short-term recommendation
to 'market outperformance' and the shares jumped 25 to 707p with more than
14m traded. The turnover was boosted by three large blocks of shares,
totalling 5.8m, traded between 700p and 703p; Goldman was believed to the
source of much of the business.
The US house argues that the shares have slumped far enough and that worries
about the timing of the general economic recovery are likely to encourage
investors to return to relatively recession proof stocks. The enthusiasm
also follows a recommendation on Monday from another US house, Wertheim
Schroder.
Meanwhile, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has raised questions about the launch of
injectable Imigran, the anti-migraine treatment, in the US. UBS says new
data has been handed to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the
drug has had to lose its fast-track approval status. The house says the
approval could be delayed until the first quarter of 1993. However, Glaxo is
believed to be disparaging about the research; insiders apparently refuse to
accept that such information could leak from the FDA.
Fisher slide
A profits warning from Albert Fisher sent the shares tumbling and analysts
rushing to cut forecasts for the fresh food group. Turnover was a hectic 29m
shares - easily the heaviest traded stock of the day. Fisher blamed a glut
in the produce market, caused by early harvests and low sales, for a drop in
produce prices.
Although analysts downgrades were not severe, the heavy fall in the shares -
down 25 at 41p - was blamed on general anxiety among investors; this has
followed trading problems previously signalled by the company, including
stiff competition in the US and in the mushroom canning business in Holland.
Yesterday's warning also raised worries that the dividend could be under
threat. Among the welter of downgrades, Smith New Court and Nomura, both on
Pounds 77m for this year, reduced forecasts to Pounds 60m and Pounds 63m
respectively.
Worries over Fisher hit other fresh food producers. Hazlewood Food lost 3 at
139p, Hillsdown 2 at 145p and Perkins Foods 2 at 95p.
Rank active
Interim results at the top end of market forecasts sent Rank Organisation
shooting forward in early trading, at one stage to a gain of 18 at 649p.
However, in discussions with the leisure group afterwards, analysts returned
with their enthusiasm dented and ready to revise forecasts downwards.
Most attention was focused on comments by Rank executives that there would
be little new earnings growth this year, and profits would be eked from
existing business through cost cutting. The shares closed a net 7 off at
624p in busy trading of 1.7m.
There was some switching from Rank into Thorn EMI, the latter also
benefiting from County NatWest support. The shares put on 15 to 788p. A
Nomura buy note helped Forte, up 4 at 173p.
British Aerospace was volatile, jumping 18 to 260p, early in the session on
news that Airbus Industrie, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake, had won a
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.61bn) order from United Airlines. However the shares
retreated sharply, reaching 232p at the day's worst, after hints that a
leading broker had raised doubts about the financial health of GPA, an
important Airbus customer. Bargain hunting later in the session helped the
shares rally off the bottom and they eventually closed 3 up at 245p on
turnover of 2.7m.
Kleinwort Benson cut estimates for the top stocks, including BP, Shell,
Enterprise and Lasmo. Mr Paul Spedding, Kleinwort's oil specialist blamed
the downgrades on 'purely and simply the dollar', but felt the sector would
outperform in the medium term. He has lowered current year historic cost net
income figure for BP from Pounds 600m to Pounds 450m and that for Shell from
Pounds 3.12bn to Pounds 2.9bn. For Lasmo, Kleinwort expects net income to
drop from Pounds 15m to Pounds 5m while, for Enterprise, the broker is now
looking for Pounds 70m against a previous figure of Pounds 85m.
Smith New Court was also said to have downgraded BP estimates, as was
Nomura. Hoare Govett described the recent performance of the dollar and
crude oil prices as 'a pretty hostile combination', while Mr Keith Morris,
at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, warned that the exploration and production 'may not
have yet found a floor - watch out for net asset value downgrades'. Mr John
Toalster, oil specialist at Strauss Turnbull and a long-time bear of the oil
sector, said confidence level in the sector was evaporating and that 'the
next stop for BP is 180p'.
BP shares, under pressure following the ousting of Mr Robert Horton,
previous chairman and chief executive, eased 1 1/2 to 209 1/2 p in London on
turnover of 16m, but were said to have come under sustained downward
pressure on Wall Street after London closed.
Shell fell 3 to 492p on 3.4m and Enterprise 9 to 385p. Lasmomanaged a 3 gain
at 165p.
Buying ahead of the share split on Monday helped SmithKline Beecham jump
sharply. The registered shares, which are to be halved in price and doubled
in number rose 30 to 912p.
Cellular phone group Vodafone continued to suffer from the shift of
sentiment towards Cellnet. This began with news of the latter's increase in
market share and profitability and became more marked when Securicor
revealed a big jump in profits earlier this week.
Vodafone dropped 10 more to 310p yesterday on good turnover of 3.3m. Merrill
Lynch said yesterday that Cellnet 'has taken the initative from Vodafone on
the product, marketing and sales front and that Vodafone 'appears to have
lost its way.'
Vague bid talk helped GKN add 9 to 389p. Lucas Industries moved 9 ahead
124p, boosted by the talk in GKN and the increasing belief that the company
is likely to maintain its dividend. Smiths Industries retreated 9 to 284p.
Figures showing a 5 per cent first-half sales growth for LVMH helped lift
parent company Guinness, the shares climbing 29 to 557p. The group also
benefited from a large research note from Lehman Brothers.

FT  10 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Firmer futures market
gives Nikkei a boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices shrugged off arbitrage-related selling and posted firm gains on
index-linked buying, prompted by a rise in the futures markets, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 248.40 to 16,848.66. The index, which fell to the
day's low of 16,571.76 in the morning, advanced to a high of 16,927.24 on
active buying in the afternoon.
Volume rose to 250m shares from 201m. Advances led declines by 602 to 315,
with 167 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 10.80
to 1,284.93 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.01 to 1,011.13.
Traders said that the activity was largely option-related, as July options
contracts expire today. But most Japanese institutional investors were
absent from the rally. 'Financial institutions will buy when the market
falls, but they will not chase rising share prices,' said Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda
at Daiwa Securities.
While foreign investors remained on the sidelines, traders said that a rise
could prompt selling from foreigners looking for opportunities to manoeuvre.
'Many foreigners are looking to switch into defensive stocks,' said Mr Ross
Purdie at SG Warburg Securities.
Traders said that the index was helped by the advance in bank shares.
Reports that commercial banks are considering issuing perpetual subordinated
bonds, to meet capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank for International
Settlements, encouraged investors. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y40 to
Y1,600 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank advanced Y70 to Y1,270.
Short-term 'theme' stocks continued to be actively traded. Dealers and
individuals took profits on Aids-related issues such as Meiji Milk Products,
which fell Y5 to Y980, and bought stocks on the mergers and acquisitions
theme.
Lower-priced companies in the high-technology and automobile sectors were
popular as possible targets for acquisitions. Fuji Heavy Industries, the car
maker, was the most active issue of the day, advancing Y10 to Y386. Ricoh,
the office equipment maker, rose Y10 to Y576 and Oki Electric added Y12 to
Y434.
The two paper and pulp companies which announced a merger on Wednesday
declined on profit-taking. Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp fell Y53 to Y525 and Jujo
Paper lost Y8 to Y528. Analysts pointed out that while the merger would
create the largest company by sales, the new company could face a squeeze in
profitability due to the slump in the paper and pulp industry.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 230.30 to 19,452.06 in volume of 10.2m
shares.
Roundup
ELSEWHERE in the Pacific Basin region, turnover was mixed, but share prices
were mainly on the downgrade.
MANILA accelerated its downward slide, the composite index dropping 46.30,
or 3.1 per cent to 1,435.52. Combined turnover in the Manila and Makati
bourses fell from 581m pesos to 243m.
Brokers said that the market is still in a consolidation, or correction,
phase following the bull run caused by the peaceful transfer of power to the
new president of the Philippines, Mr Fidel Ramos.
SEOUL tumbled for the seventh consecutive day and about 100 investors
protested outside the exchange, calling on the government to halt the slide.
The index fell 8.72 to 523.07 as turnover fell to Won109.6bn from
Won150.97bn.
AUSTRALIA fell after data which showed that unemployment rose to 11.1 per
cent in June from 10.6 per cent in May and 9.4 per cent a year ago. The All
Ordinaries index closed down 9.3 at 1,642.1, but off its lows for the day,
in brisk turnover of ADollars 405.8m.
Westpac took the brunt of weakness in the banks, sinking 7 cents to ADollars
3.32.
HONG KONG finished at the day's lows as profit-taking continued to put
pressure on prices in subdued trading. The Hang Seng Index fell 56.39 to
5,925.52, from a morning high of 5,980.49. Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.47bn
from HKDollars 2.88bn.
NEW ZEALAND equities followed a continued rally in the bond markets, the
NZSE-40 index ending 7.10 higher at 1,577.80 in turnover of NZDollars 25m.
BANGKOK closed higher across the board after a Thai SEC announcement eased
fears about tighter regulation of the stock market. The SET index rose
13.27, or 1.8 per cent to 743.11 in turnover of Bt4.86bn.
Ekamol Khiriwat, secretary general of the SEC, told a news conference that
his office's probes were aimed at manipulators, that they were confidential
and that the SEC was not going to do anything to restrict normal
speculation.

FT  10 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses respond to recovery in
the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY's recovery in the dollar gave bourses a better day, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw the dollar improve 3 1/2 pfg to DM1.51, reversed direction and
restored some serious share price falls of a day before. This, and a modicum
of good company news, left the DAX 6.46 better at 1,757.64 after a token
0.05 gain for the FAZ in midsession.
Volume fell from DM5.2bn to DM4.7bn. Among the DAX stocks, the big three
chemicals put in bigger than average gains; Degussa and Metallgesellschaft
recovered DM8.60 to DM331.80 and DM6.30 to DM401.50, the former helped by
supportive comment and the latter by speculation about higher metals prices,
and news of a cooperation agreement with Deutsche Babcock on power plant
production.
In construction, Hochtief rose DM15 to DM1,217 on a 19 per cent rise in
first half output. In retailing, Kaufhof rose DM8.50 to DM520.50 on the
prospect of a 20 per cent increase in earnings this year; Asko continued its
recovery with a DM19 rise to DM710.
Elsewhere, AMB put on DM27 to DM895 after its accord with the French
insurer, AGF, over voting rights attached to AGF's stake in AMB; the
agreement also paved the way for Credit Lyonnais to become a majority
shareholder in BfG Bank, a substantial drain on AMB since 1987.
PARIS rose in a technical reaction to its recent losses but trading was thin
ahead of the Bastille holidays on Monday and Tuesday. The CAC 40 index rose
14.09 to 1,861.84 in turnover of FFr1.6bn.
LVMH was a prominent winner, adding FFr118 or 3.2 per cent to FFr3,780 on
news that turnover rose around 5 per cent in the first half. Among stocks
participating in the rebound, Suez rose FFr6.90 to FFr273.80, Total FFr2.50
to FFr235, Michelin FFr5.20 to FFr204.2 and Euro Disney FFr1.90 to
FFr106.90.
Valeo fell FFr24 to FFr745 on news that CGIP had sold a 1.4 per cent stake
in the car parts maker during the third week of June and that it intended to
sell its remaining 3.7 per cent.
MILAN closed firmer in a technical rebound after its recent weakness. But
trading was thin ahead of details of the government's interim budget, due to
be released today. The Comit index rose 4.09 to 433.21 in turnover estimated
at less than Wednesday's L89.5bn.
The insurer, Fondiaria eased L550 to L24,500 on fears that the accord
between France's AGF and Germany's AMB could hurt the Italian company's own
projects with AMB.
Benetton fell to L10.905 on reports that a domestic broker had cut its
earnings estimates for the textile company, but recovered to L11,600, down
L250, on a 15 per cent increase in first-half net profit.
Telecoms steadied after their recent drop, with Stet closing L19 higher at
L1,569 and Sip recovering L35 to L1,203.
ZURICH saw thin trading and the employment agency, Adia, which does
substantial US business, topped the active list as it rose SFr9 to SFr304.
The SMI index rose 9.1 to 1,846.7. Ciba-Geigy registered rose SFr6 to SFr682
following news that EMS Chemie had sold 70,000 at an unknown price. There
had been talk of a major seller in Ciba.
Bearers in the watchmaker, SMH, rose SFr65 to SFr1,260 in active trading on
the acquisition of two small Swiss companies, the watchmaker, Blancpain, and
the watch movements manufacturer, Frederic Piguet.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index added 1.3 to 122.10. Unilever was the main
beneficiary of the dollar's recovery, adding Fl 2.30 to Fl 187.30.
The truckmaker Daf added 40 cents to Fl 21.70 on reports that it might
receive a Fl 100m loan from the government.
STOCKHOLM rebounded in low volume, the Affarsvarlden General index closing
7.6 higher at 885.1 as turnover dropped from SKr552m to SKr284m. The
pharmaceuticals group, Astra, led active stocks, the B gaining SKr4 to
SKr518 on their defensive qualities.
Volvo went against the trend, the B shares retreating SKr4 to SKr370.
Dealers attributed this partly to a French government report on Tuesday,
which was gloomy about Volvo's prospects, and to the dollar's effect on
Volvo revenues.
VIENNA was volatile, the ATX index hitting a low of 887.84, recovering to
close 7.37 lower on the day at 900.25, and indicated lower again after hours
following the surprise resignation of the OMV chairman, Mr Siegfried Meysel.
OMV fell Sch20 during the session to Sch784 but after news of Mr Meysel's
resignation it fell to Sch747 in London.

FT  10 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: False dawn for European engineers - The
sector has retreated after a good performance in the first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in European engineering companies are having to learn the virtue
of patience as they await the end of a recession that has spread steadily
across the Continent over the past 18 months.
It is not only in the UK - where the Conservatives' election victory in
April produced a burst of enthusiasm that turned into a false dawn for
manufacturing companies - that 1992 has brought disappointment for companies
as well as their shareholders.
In Germany, the powerhouse of European engineering, shares performed well in
the first half of the year but more recently have fallen back. Mannesmann,
the big German engineering company with an interest in cellular telephones,
reached DM310.50 on June 23 - up 26.5 per cent since the start of the year -
but has since dropped back, to close at DM293 yesterday. Linde, one of
Europe's leading fork-lift truck manufacturers, reached DM876 on May 25, up
28.6 per cent since January 1, but closed at DM820 yesterday.
The story is similar in Sweden, with Atlas Copco jumping 39 per cent from
the start of the year to SKr334 at the end of May before retreating to
SKr300 yesterday, and Asea, in partnership with Switzerland's Brown Boveri,
gaining 40.5 per cent to SKr392 on July 3 before closing at SKr376
yesterday.
This trend is a sign, says Mr Gebhard Klingenstein of Barclays de Zoete Wedd
in Frankfurt, 'that the whole upturn of industry has been postponed, and
won't be happening this year'.
Reports from the real economy tend to confirm what Mr Edward Hadas at Morgan
Stanley sees as a 'growing doubt among investors that there is an end to the
recession'. Incoming orders for the western German engineering industry, an
important barometer, dropped 4 per cent in real terms in May, compared with
the same month a year earlier, according to the VDMA industry association.
The European engineering industry is international - 60 per cent of German
mechanical engineering output is exported and a similar proportion of the
larger UK engineering groups' turnover is derived from outside the UK.
Therefore, the industry is exposed to economic conditions worldwide, and
currently there are few bright spots. But it is also diffuse, and its
constituent parts react in varying degrees to other external factors - most
of which are negative at present.
The near collapse of east European markets, for example, has cast a pall
over the German machine tool industry, exacerbating problems caused by the
downturn in western Europe.
Other sectors hit by the upheaval in east Europe include sewing machines and
textile equipment, according to Mr Hadas, while one of the very few sectors
to have retained some stability has been food manufacturing machinery.
For investors in European engineering stocks, one of the features of the
sector is the relatively long lag between changes in business conditions and
their effect on profit. Investors tend to look out for an improved order
flow, and can then expect a rise in profits some months ahead.
In this environment, share prices are much more sensitive to short-term
changes of sentiment than to short-term trends in earnings, says Mr Hadas.
On the immediate outlook, there is nothing to suggest a dramatic change in
sentiment, and thus in share prices, over the next few months. One analyst
even suggests the general environment could get worse rather than better,
citing factors such as the current Italian budget deficit crisis - reducing
the deficit could hit exports from German engineering companies to the
Italian market.
Mr Klingenstein is optimistic about the performance of machinery stocks for
next year, partly because of a structural rise in demand - mainly from
eastern Germany - and cyclical demand factors. Meanwhile, he says, shares
are likely to go sideways.
As in the UK, what is lacking in continental Europe is confidence, a problem
that begins with the current reluctance of engineering companies' customers
to invest, and feeds through to share prices. Restoring it is likely to be a
gradual process as equipment demand grows slowly next year.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dramatic recovery by dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR gained over two pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday on one of
the most volatile days of trading on the foreign exchanges this year, writes
James Blitz.
Early morning trading in London continued the bearish trend set on
Wednesday, with the US currency hitting a low of DM1.4805. But the dollar
was boosted later in the day by comments from several European finance
officials who said that they would like to see the dollar bottom out at its
current levels.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French Finance Minister, issued the first blow in the
dollar's favour by saying that none of his counterparts in the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations wanted to see the currency drop further.
Later, a Bundesbank board member compounded this comment, saying that
Germany wants strong and stable dollar. The US currency finished trading in
London at DM1.5190. In late American trading, it fell back to DM1.5150. By
that stage it had climbed more than three pfennigs in the previous ten
hours.
Few believe this recovery can hold. 'We've seen a lot of short covering and
a lot of operators trying to buy the dollar because they think it's cheap,'
said Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London.
'I think they're moving too early.' Mr Mark Slater, managing director of
foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch International, agreed: 'Nothing has
changed in terms of the fundamentals. There is no sign of any reversal in
the dollar's trend,' he said.
Underlining that view were renewed fears that the Bundesbank could raise
interest rates or the banks' reserve requirements at its council meeting
next Thursday. 'The underlying problem is that the Germans have still not
managed to get money supply under control,' said one commercial bank trader.
Sterling was the other volatile currency yesterday, suffering a heavy fall
both in overnight trading and the early morning in London. At 9 am in London
it was trading at a low of DM2.8585, 1 1/2 pfennigs down from the previous
night's close in London. For the rest of the day, it was boosted by a series
of comments from British government ministers, suggesting that sterling
would enter the narrow bands of the European Monetary System when the time
was right.
The pound ended the day  3/4 of a pfennig stronger than its previous close,
at DM2.8800. But sterling could have been expected to profit more from the
dollar's dramatic rise and from intervention by the Bank of Spain, which
yesterday sold D-Marks to buy pesetas. Its failure to do so is one of the
clearest signs yet that the currency has an a weakness independent of market
uncertainty.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Small cash shortage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in the sterling money markets ended softer yesterday after the
Bank of England forecast a far smaller shortage than the market had
expected.
The Bank's forecast of a Pounds 500m shortage, later revised to Pounds 600m,
was nearly half of what most dealers had anticipated. The news brought
relief in a market where three days of expensive money had left the
overnight offered rate on Wednesday at 25 per cent.
There was less cheer from sterling's performance on the foreign exchange
markets, however, with the pound sinking to a low of DM2.8587. Although it
closed  3/4 of a pfennig up on the day, this was less than could have been
expected given a dramatic rise yesterday by the dollar.
The pound's dramatic drop by nearly two pfennigs in Wednesday's overnight
trading in Asia forced cash rates to firm when London opened. Sterling
futures were also sharply depressed. The September short sterling contract
reached a low of 90.06 in the morning, underlining the market's view that a
base rate cut is unlikely before the autumn.
Confidence was then restored by the low shortage forecast from the Bank and
comments from a UK Treasury minister that the pound would enter the narrow
band of the European Monetary System 'in due course.' The September sterling
contract eventually closed 1 tick down from its previous close at 90.12,
while the December contract finished 3 ticks higher at 90.41.
In the cash market, 1 month money ended unchanged at 10 1/16 per cent and
3-month money, a key indicator of where rates are moving, was  1/32 per cent
softer at 10 1/32 per cent. 1 year money was  1/16 per cent softer at 9
29/32 per cent. The overnight closed at the far more relaxed level of around
9 3/4 per cent.
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 500m of Band 1 bank bills at the
established rate of 9 7/8 per cent, and bought a further Pounds 100m of
these in the afternoon.
Dealers remain bearish about a base rate cut. A suggestion in a German
newspaper yesterday that the Bundesbank may engineer another interest rate
rise rattled the market. As one London money market dealer put it: 'I don't
think such a rise is likely, but where would such a rumour have come from if
there was no basis for it?'

FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian crop estimate raises
bread price fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY FORECASTS suggest that the Russian harvest this year wil reach 98m
tonnes - 8m tonnes higher than last year's poor harvest, but about 10m
tonnes down on initial estimates made during the spring sewing campaign.
At the same time, the republic's government is now expressing serious
worries about the prospects for an increase in the price of bread, both
because of the much higher prices already being demanded by farms for grain
deliveries and because the price of imported grain to the purchasers will
increase by some five times because of the abolition of state import
subsidies, which set an artificially high exchange rate for imports of 20
roubles to the dollar.
The price of a loaf of bread, which was less than one rouble only last year,
has already increased more than tenfold. However, it is now generally
accepted in government circles that further sharp price increases must be
avoided - especially for bread, which is even more than ever an
indispensable part of the diet for poor and even average families.
Mr Victor Khlystun, the Russian agricultural minister, told a conference of
local authority leaders on Wednesday that the 98m tonnes expected was down
on the 104m to 108m tonnes originally forecast. He also said that that the
harvest of potatoes, Russia's other staple food alongside bread, would also
be down from last year's level. But he gave no figures for potato
production.
The government and the state farms, which still command the repiublic's
agricultural sector, are now engaged in a prolonged wrangle over prices of
grain.
The Interfax news agency reported yesterday that producers are demanding
wheat prices ranging between Rbs13,000 and 20,000 a tonne; the Russian
Pricing Committee is proposing Rbs6,800 a tonne; and the agriculture
ministry is trying to compromise on Rbs10,000 a tonne.
The government is anxious to conclude contracts with the farms soon, in
order to avoid being forced to pay higher prices - and it intends to use
part of the Dollars 1bn tranche the International Monetary Fund has agreed
to given to Russia for this purpose. However, preliminary contracts with
farms cover only 24.5m tonnes of grain, and no prices have yet been agreed.
Last year the farms managed to withhold deliveries until the last moment,
thus forcing up the price to the state. This year, however, the farmers'
shortage of cash, the high inflation rate and the severe problems
experienced in buying fodder for livestock are expected to force a number of
farms to conclude early contracts.
The price of bread, at presently about 10 roubles a loaf, will at least
double even if the government can keep the price down to about Rbs10,000 a
tonne. Imported grain, which might make up between a quarter and a third of
all requirements, will now be priced to the purchasers at the full market
rate of the rouble, at present over Rbs130 to the US dollar.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, told the local
authorities' conference on Wednesday that the state budget would again have
to subsidise the price of imported grain, if a loaf of bread priced at Rbs60
was to be avoided.
The Russian government has earmarked Rbs130m to finance the dispatch of
troops to help collect the grain harvest, according to the official Itar
Tass news agency.
General Alexander Rutskoi, the republic's vice president, said on Central
television on Wednesday that Russia would be forced to 'beg again round the
word and collect humanitarian aid' unless all efforts were concentrated on
getting in the harvest this year.

COPPER came in for hefty profit taking on the LME after hitting new 18-month
highs. Firmness on Comex provided some impetus, and the three-month price
rose to around Dollars 2,519 a tonne before technical traders elected to
take profits. Both New York and London remain underpinned by developments in
Poland, where KGHM miners are unhappy with the government's 17 per cent pay
offer and intend to strike on July 20. SILVER remained steady on the London
bullion market as fears faded of further heavy Middle East sales after news
that Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, former chief operating officer of the
Jeddah-based National Commercial Bank, had been fined Dollars 170m by the US
Federal Reserve Board for violations of US banking law. Dealers estimated
NCB silver sales at more than 40m troy ounces, worth Dollars 160m, which as
one dealer commented 'fits the fine.' London COCOA prices closed mixed,
while robusta COFFEE rose up to Dollars 26 a tonne on short covering and
option-related buying. Traders said cocoa could still extend its recent
rally as the Ivory Coast appears reluctant to make large sales while ICCO
pact talks are in progress in Geneva.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S Africa's Impala Platinum hit
again by labour unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMPALA PLATINUM, the world's second largest producer, has again had
production disrupted by labour unrest at its Bophuthatswana operations.
Impala said about 10,000 employees did not turn out for Wednesday's night
shift, nor for yesterday's day shift, at the Bafokeng South mine. The
stay-away affects about a quarter of Impala's production of 20,000 troy
ounces a week.
Labour relations at Impala have been fairly quiet during the past six
months; a company official says the last strike was in March. This compares
with the second half of 1991 when labour difficulties caused shaft closures
and lower productivity, resulting in about 100,000 ounces of lost
production.
Mr Jerry Matjatladi, spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM),
says workers had stayed away in protest at an attack by mine security on
workers attending a meeting to report back on wages and conditions of work.
It is ironic that Impala should again be at the receiving end of worker
displeasure in a week when it emerged that it has been having indirect talks
with the NUM. Mr Marcel Golding, assistant general secretary of the union,
confirmed that two rounds of talks had been held between Impala management
and the 'central council' of Impala's worker's, assisted by the NUM.
The reason for much of the labour troubles last year was that the government
of Bophuthatswana, the homeland where all Impala's mines are found, refused
to allow the South African-based NUM to represent Impala's workers, because
it was a foreign union. The NUM, despite the fact that about 60 per cent of
Impala's workers are its members, refused to register because it did not
want to recognise the sovereignty of Bophuthatswana, which it regards as an
illegitimate creation of apartheid.
The NUM has subsequently applied for registration in Bophuthatswana, but
this has not yet been granted. The current talks are apparently an attempt
to circumvent the legal restrictions.
Although the recent spike in the platinum price, which rose in a short
period from Dollars 360 to over Dollars 380, has been attributed to concern
about the impact of mass action on South Africa's platinum production,
analysts dispute this analysis. Mr Kevin Kartun, mining analyst at
stockbrokers Frankel, Max Pollak says it has more to do with dealers short
of metal covering positions than concern about industrial action. He adds
that both Impala and Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer, have
enjoyed relative industrial harmony in recent months.
Mr Kartun says the last large stay-away hardly touched the mining industry,
and given difficult economic conditions, and given the relative affluence of
platinum miners, he does not expect much disruption to platinum production
from industrial action.

salvo
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE latest failure of the European Community and the US to resolve
their differences over farm trade in Munich, Washington farm groups and
legislators are now focusing on a provision in the US farm law that could
allocate millions more dollars for American food export subsidies.
Mr Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, has promised to activate
the 'Gatt trigger,' due to go off if no Uruguay Round agreement was reached
by June 30, 1992. He is now being pressed to give details of his plans.
'We're anxiously awaiting word,' said Mr Jim Petterson, spokesman for
Congressman Dan Glickman, chairman of the House wheat, soyabeans and
feedgrains subcommittee.
Mr Glickman late last month wrote to the secretary, urging 'full disclosure,
up front, of your plans to implement this law' so that farmers and
agribusiness would not be left 'in the dark.'
'What export programme's funding do you intend to increase by Dollars 1bn as
required,' he asked. 'Do you intend to spread this increase over the next
three fiscal years or expend it all in one?'
The 'Gatt trigger,' contained in the 1990 Farm Act is, in fact, two
triggers. The first, for 1992 authorises the administration to make
'marketing loans' for wheat and feed grains. These loans - now in effect for
soyabeans, cotton and rice - encourage exports by reimbursing farmers for
sales at a specified level, even if they must sell at a lower price.
The first trigger also allows the agriculture secretary to spend up to
Dollars 1bn more for 'export promotion' or export subsidies. The second
trigger - set for June 30, 1993 - would waive budget-saving provisions in
the 1990 Act and release more funds for exports.
'We would unleash our competitiveness,' said Ms Nancy Foster, an official
with the American Soybean Association. 'We would become a tougher, meaner,
more aggressive player.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Much tin capacity 'still
unprofitable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN PRICES have risen by more than 25 per cent since the begining of this
year but even so about a third of the industry's production capacity was
still unprofitable, Mr Campbell Anderson, managing director of Renison
Goldfields Consolidated, the Australian mining group, pointed out yesterday.
The recent price rise 'probably has gone too high too quickly', and was
likely to stabilise before moving up again, he suggested. 'But I'm
reasonably bullish about tin.'
Mr Anderson warned that there was still a great deal of production capacity
that could be brought back into operation at little cost if prices continued
to rise. However, the Malaysian government had recently said tin was no
longer strategically important so was unlikely to subsidise the re-start of
dredgers there.
Renison last year came close to closing its tin mine on Tasmania's west
coast - the world's only underground tin mine - because of low prices.
Employees agreed to a productivity scheme which cut the workforce by 100 to
250 with the aim of sustaining annual output at about 6,000 tonnes of tin
but reducing production costs to Dollars 6,500 a tonne. In fact, costs had
been reduced to about Dollars 5,500, said Mr Anderson, who was speaking to
the Association of Mining Analysts in London.
Tin averaged Dollars 2.52 a lb last year (Dollars 5,556 a tonne) and
analysts have been revising their forecasts for 1992 in response to the
metal's strong price performance so far. Mr Nick Moore at Ord Minnett
suggests the price will move up to an average of Dollars 3 a lb this year
and to Dollars 3.80 in 1993. Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitcat &amp;
Aitken, looks for Dollars 2.85 a lb this year and Dollars 2.95 next year.

BOSCHER, the 53 per cent-owned stockbroking unit of French state-owned bank
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), is to be wound up, Reuter reports from
Paris.
Mr Georges Chodron de Courcel, BNP finance director, yesterday said BNP and
Alain Boscher, representing minority shareholders of Boscher, would sign the
'friendly' wind-up of the company shortly.
Mr Alain Boscher, who wants to continue in the business, will be given first
right of refusal on the repurchase of the company's assets after a value has
been set. If he declines, other buyers will be sought, Mr Chodron de Courcel
said.
The company manages assets of some 4,000 clients, which total about FFr2.5bn
(Dollars 500m). Mr Chodron de Courcel said the company could be valued at
FFr5m to FFr50m.
Boscher, which employs 72 people, has made an operating loss of around FFr4m
since the start of this year after a net profit of FFr10m in 1991.

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Bonds: SNCF issue underlines demand for long
maturities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE appetite of investors for French franc bonds continued to draw issuers
to the international market yesterday, with SNCF, the French state-backed
rail company, launching an innovative FFr3bn 31-year issue with warrants.
The deal, the longest maturity Eurobond ever issued, underlined the
enthusiasm of investment institutions for long-duration exposure to the
French market. On Wednesday, Finland launched a FFr4bn 11-year issue.
The debt warrants, which offer investors the right to buy new bonds fungible
with yesterday's issue, offer additional 'geared' exposure to market.
Lead-managed by Paribas Capital Markets, the deal sold mainly to big
portfolio investors in Europe. The bonds pay a coupon of 8 7/8 per cent and
the bond-plus-warrant package was re-offered to investors at a fixed price
of 98.71. At this level the paper yields 30 basis points more than the
French government OAT maturing 2023.
If all the warrants are exercised on February 11 next year, when holders can
buy additional bonds at 99.55, the issue will grow to FFr4.5bn. Bankers
expected the warrants trade separately from the bonds, creating a liquid
derivative instrument on the long end of the French market.
Elsewhere, the strong tone of the Australian bond market attracted
borrowers. The Australian government bond market rallied overnight following
the release of poor unemployment statistics. The figures increased
speculation that the government will ease monetary conditions again,
following a  3/4 point cut in rates last week.
Credit Local, the financing agency for French local government, launched a
ADollars 250m five-year global bond issue, which can be traded in both
domestic and international markets. The deal, lead-managed by Hambros,
carries a 7 1/2 per cent coupon and was priced to yield 20 basis points more
than Australian government bonds of the same maturity. The bonds are used by
many institutional investors as a proxy for government debt.
Hambros also lead-managed a ADollars 125m, 10-year issue for Banque
Nationale de Paris. The bonds carry a higher 9 per cent coupon and attracted
primarily retail investors. Another retail-targeted deal was launched by
Guinness Finance, lead-managed by NatWest Capital Markets. The 8.25 per cent
six-year bonds were priced to yield 53 basis points more than government
paper. Both deals were seen as tightly priced by participants, but likely to
sell over time.
The Canadian dollar sector has also rallied this week, spurred by an
agreement between the provinces on constitutional reform. Eurofima launched
a CDollars 150m three-year issue, lead-managed by Goldman Sachs
International. The top triple-A credit rating of the issuer attracted
investors, despite the low 6 1/2 per cent coupon on the bonds.
The World Bank fixed a 5 7/8 per cent semi-annual coupon and 99.425 issue
price on its Dollars 1.5bn five-year global bond issue launched on
Wednesday. At this level the bonds yield 5 basis points more than US
treasury bonds, at the lower end of the indicated range.
Salomon Brothers yesterday launched the first warrants on loans to Poland.
The warrants give investors the right to buy loans covered by Poland's debt
deferral and restructuring agreement (DDRA) with its principle commercial
creditors at 26 per cent of face value. Yesterday, Polish DDRA debt was
trading just above this level in the secondary market.

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: The return of a rare breed -
London's newest bond broking house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGENCY brokers are a rare breed in the bond markets. Fund managers have
grown accustomed to dealing without commissions, trading at net prices with
banks which act as underwriters and market-makers as well as brokers.
But a growing band of specialists believes that it is time to bring back
traditional independent broking skills to the fixed-income markets.
The latest bond broking house to emerge, the London Bond Broking Company,
was announced yesterday in London. It is not alone: bond broking houses set
up so far in the 1990s include Luthy Baillie Dowsett Pethick and Sebbco in
London, and Bridport in Geneva. All three were created on the same
assumption: that investors will be prepared to pay for independent advice in
a market where they have received research and advice 'free' up to now.
London Bond Broking is run by three former employees of Phillips &amp; Drew,
including Mr Stephen Lewis, a respected economist who left in 1988 to run
his own research house.
The company is 55 per cent owned by Albert E Sharp, a Birmingham-based
broker. Sharp scored a big success in the late 1980s when it was one of the
backers of Sharelink, one of the new breed of execution-only brokers set up
to deal for retail investors, and it reckons it has picked another winner,
given the growing interest of UK institutions in the bond markets.
'The age of the bond . . . has finally arrived,' said Mr Lewis yesterday. It
was not long ago that the bond markets faced an uncertain future, as
governments cut their fiscal deficits and companies found banks queueing up
to lend them money at ludicrous rates. Investors prefered the racy profits
apparently offered by the equity markets. That has all changed, says Mr
Lewis - a view supported by recent pronouncements from institutions like
Norwich Union and Legal &amp; General, which have turned their attentions to the
fixed-income markets.
Commission levels, though, are unlikely to return to what they were before
the Big Bang reforms which swept them away London Bond Broking, which will
focus initially on government bond markets, plans to charge 1/32 per cent,
well below the  1/8 per cent that was once standard on bond trades.
Higher commissions are available outside the government bond markets. Luthy
Bailey, which specialises in less-heavily traded bonds, charges up to 1 per
cent, though commissions average 0.1 per cent - still below the standard 0.2
per cent payable in the equity market.

REVLON, the US cosmetics and consumer products company taken over by Mr

The company blamed the generally poor market conditions for equity deals,

Mr James Conroy, Revlon senior vice-president for corporate affairs and
special counsel, said the company had also reduced the target price for the
shares to a range of Dollars 14 to Dollars 15 a share from Dollars 19. This
means Revlon will raise roughly Dollars 145m instead of nearly Dollars 400m

<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's five leading carmakers saw a slowing in their sales growth for
the first half of this year, reflecting the stagnant domestic market on
which they rely for some 80 per cent of sales, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
According to the five makers, Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, Daewoo Motor, Asia
Motors and Ssangyong Motor, their preliminary sales were worth a combined
Won5,970bn (Dollars 7.6bn) in the first six months of this year, up 12.8 per
cent from Won5,290bn in the same period of the previous year.
This represents a slowdown from a growth rate of 13.5 per cent for the whole
of last year and 31.8 per cent in 1990.
The six-month sales fell short of the carmakers' goals for the whole of this
year, accounting for a mere 39 per cent of the Won15,210bn goal.

half

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YOKOHAMA Rubber, the Japanese tyremaker, yesterday said the downturn in the
domestic car market had led to a decline in pre-tax profit for the first
half to between Y4.5bn (Dollars 36m) and Y5bn, down from the Y5.6bn of a
year ago.
Sales for the half-year to the end of June had been forecast at Y150bn, but
that figure was revised to Y140bn, as the company reported slower demand for
new car tyres and for replacement tyres.
Reductions in capital spending by Japanese industry also slowed sales of
industrial rubber products, which account for about 21 per cent of
Yokohama's total sales.
For the full year, the company revised its sales forecast from Y305bn to
Y300bn, still slightly higher than the Y295bn of last year, and left its
pre-tax profit forecast at Y12.3bn, down from Y12.7bn.
An increasing number of Japanese companies are having to revise profit and
sales forecasts as the hoped-for recovery has not yet materialised and there
are signs the economy will remain weak until early next year.
Suppliers to the leading carmakers are under particular pressure as domestic
auto sales have been in decline for the past year, though Toyota Motor, the
leading maker, this week said the market appeared to have touched bottom.
The strengthening of the yen in recent weeks is also likely to bruise
second-half profits at manufacturers such as Yokohama, which relies on
exports for about 23 per cent of sales.

CBS Inc, which owns one of the three US television networks, reported a 39
per cent jump in second-quarter income, helped by an improving climate for
US network advertising and its rise to the top of the prime time television
ratings.
The group reported net income of Dollars 70.1m, or Dollars 4.53 a share,
compared with Dollars 50.6m, or Dollars 3.31, in the second quarter of last
year.
Sales increased by 10 per cent, from Dollars 710m to Dollars 780m.
The figures were at the top end of analysts' expectations.
The company said the television network's unit prices improved in the prime
time, day time and late night time periods.
Network sales were also bolstered by the broadcast of two basketball
competition semi-finals during the quarter. In 1991, the semi-finals were
aired in the first quarter.
But while demand for network television advertising improved, local TV and
radio advertising remained sluggish.
Sales and profits of the CBS television stations division increased,
primarily because of the acquisition of two new businesses, while CBS
Radio's earnings fell, due mainly to sales weakness.
The company's net interest income was Dollars 8.9m, down from Dollars 10.8m,
and its cash and marketable securities at the end of the period totalled
Dollars 1.4bn, compared with debt of Dollars 1.1bn a year earlier.
For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 88.7m, or
Dollars 5.75 a share, up from Dollars 73.9m, or Dollars 4.29 a share for
last year's comparative period. Sales for the half-year increased from
Dollars 1.46bn to Dollars 1.86bn.

FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hughes Aircraft plans assault on
Europe - The ambitions of General Motors' defence and electronics arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM its bases on the west coast of the US and in the UK, Hughes Aircraft,
the defence and electronics arm of General Motors, is planning its assault
on the fragmented markets of Europe.
It is hunting for acquisitions and joint ventures in any of its four core
businesses: defence, electronics, vehicle technology and telecommunications.
The intention is to reduce the company's dependence on US sales by doing
business with Europe's governments and its biggest companies.
Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive, is undaunted by the
prospect of trading with such a patchwork of customers, each with its own
standards and needs. 'We're good at dealing with bureaucracy and paperwork -
we've been working with government for years,' he says.
For Hughes, working with government means being one of the biggest US
defence contractors. The Gulf war saw more than 7,000 of its missiles
launched and its radar saw service in most fighter aircraft and warships.
The company is also involved in satellites and satellite services, aircraft
flight simulators and automotive technology.
But the military still accounts for 65 per cent of Hughes' Dollars 8bn
turnover, and sales within the US are worth 80 per cent of the company's
business. At a time of falling defence budgets and a deep domestic US
recession, Hughes looks badly exposed.
Enter Mr Armstrong. He joined Hughes in March this year after 31 years at
IBM, where he had risen from systems engineer to be responsible for IBM's
entire operations outside the US.
He acknowledges that the combination of international experience with
industrial as well as government clients got him the top job at Hughes.
It did not take long for his presence to be felt. This month, Hughes said it
would cut more than 9,000 jobs, or 15 per cent of its workforce. The
restructuring - blamed partly on cuts in defence programmes and partly on
the weak economy - will result in an after-tax charge of Dollars 749.4m.
Mr Armstrong is quick to reassure that Europe will not see the kind of cuts
he is instituting in the US. 'We plan to grow business and staff in Europe.'
There are two clear routes to higher sales in Europe. One is the military,
where Hughes is the prime contractor for the UK's medium-range surface to
air missile (MSAM).
Its partners in this Pounds 500m-plus (Dollars 955m-plus) contract are
Siemens, Plessey and Norsk Forsvarsteknologi of Norway. The competitors are
formidable: one group consists of British Aerospace and Raytheon of the US,
the other is a combination of the UK's GEC, Thomson of France and Alenia of
Italy.
Unfortunately for all three consortia, the decision on which wins the
contract has been delayed for at least six months by uncertainty over the
European Fighter Aircraft project. Last week, the UK Ministry of Defence
wrote to them saying they would have to wait until June 1993 to know which
has won the contract. The second area is in automotive technology, which the
company was encouraged to enter after the General Motors takeover in 1985.
Since then, Hughes has found itself adapting radars into collision avoidance
systems and using advanced electronics to make safety air bags and electric
cars.
Mr Armstrong insists the GM connection will not guarantee sales to Opel and
Vauxhall, GM's European subsidiaries and which are not currently Hughes
customers.
'GM Europe was set up independently and they were able to build up more
effectively as a result. We have come here to compete for the business, but
we hope they'll let us in the door,' he says.
Going international with satellite services, one of its most successful US
operations, is more problematic. Hughes is the biggest seller of satellite
time for domestic US telecommunications. But Mr Armstrong winces at the
suggestion that the company should internationalise this business.
Such a move would bring it into direct competition with its best customers
for the satellites it builds, the international telecommunications consortia
Intelsat and Inmarsat.
He prefers being a satellite service provider through direct broadcasting by
satellite. He is even prepared to countenance Hughes becoming involved in
television programme acquisition and revenue collection from subscribers to
any channels he set up.
Such plans are still several years from fruition. In the meantime, the
company is keen to tighten its grip on small satellite dishes.
It has already met with success in Europe: Alcatel of France this year
abandoned its own investment of between Dollars 30m and Dollars 50m in small
dishes and now plans to market Hughes-built devices.
Such collaborative ventures are central to Hughes' strategy in Europe,
especially for the French market. 'This is done knowing that market access
is the most important thing,' confesses Mr Armstrong.
Hughes also has links in missiles with Thomson of France and Siemens of
Germany. It has Japanese joint ventures in satellites and TV displays.
Does this emphasis on collaboration mean European acquisitions are ruled
out? 'There are none on the table, but they may yet happen,' says Mr
Armstrong.

<TEXT>
PROFITS at Kaufhof, the German retailing group, should rise by at least 20
per cent this year, despite the more difficult trading climate, Mr Jens
Odewald, chief executive, told the annual meeting.
Kaufhof, which has expanded beyond department stores into specialist outlets
and tourism, has benefited considerably from the increased business
opportunities opened up by German unification.
Last year, its net profits rose by 38 per cent to DM166m (Dollars 102m).
Turnover was up by 21.5 per cent to DM17.8bn, though the increase would have
been only 12 per cent without the new business in eastern Germany, where
thegroup has invested nearly DM400m.
However, the west German economy has slowed down recently and consumers have
had to bear higher direct and indirect taxes to help pay for unity.
Mr Odewald said Kaufhof's turnover in the first half was 13 per cent higher
at DM8.9bn, a growth rate with which it was 'not unsatisfied'. He said the
group's aim in coming years was to grow at twice the rate of the retail
sector. In tourism, he expected turnover to grow by around 30 per cent this
year.
Fresenius, the drugs and medical technology group, yesterday forecast
increased profits for this year and announced plans for a DM174m rights
issue. The share offer is on a one-for-three basis at DM440 a share.
The company said its business in the current year was running positively,
and that it expected growth in turnover of more than 10 per cent to around
DM1.5bn plus an improvement in net profit. After-tax profits in 1991
totalled DM15.9m.

INTRACOM, the Greek telecommunications company in which Ericsson of Sweden
holds a 15 per cent stake, has reported a 77 per cent rise in net profits to
Dr6.3bn (Dollars 34m) for 1991.
Sales rose by 85 per cent to Dr30.4bn last year from Dr16.1bn in 1990
following the award of new contracts from OTE, the Greek telecoms monopoly,
and DEH, the country's electricity utility.
Intracom, a large equipment supplier for OTE, is starting to diversify
before liberalisation of telecommunications in Greece later this year.
It already exports specialised software for Ericsson digital switching
systems and power supplies for IBM personal computers. Exports in 1991
amounted to 7 per cent of sales and are expected to rise strongly this year,
following sales in Russia and Romania of a computerised state lottery system
designed by Intracom.
The company said investment this year would amount to Dr6.5bn under a
five-year plan launched in 1990 that calls for total investment of Dr25bn in
new telecoms products and information systems.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAP Gemini Sogeti, the French computer services group, and Matra, the French
electronics-to-transport company, are to merge their defence software and
computer imaging businesses.
The move reflects the pressure on the French defence industry, where the
government plans to freeze defence spending in real terms over the next
three years.
It will create a FFr1bn (Dollars 198m) turnover per year group with 1,000
staff, around the same size as the defence software activities of the
partners' main competitor, state controlled Thomson-CSF.
The link forms part of the strategy of Mr Jean Luc-Lagardere, the chairman
of Matra, of seeking partners where the group can no longer compete alone.
It will start operations early next year, specialising in computer systems
for handling civil and defence satellite pictures.
The subsidiaries making up the joint venture are Matra-Sep Imagerie et
Informatique (Matra MS2i), which had turnover of FFr542m last year and Cap
Sesa Defense, which had sales of FFr346m in 1991. MS2i makes imaging systems
for scientific and military clients, while Cap Sesa Defense makes
information and command control systems for the French military.
The partners have already worked together for the past several months on a
project to computerise army battlefield communications.
Cap Sesa Defense will be in charge of industrial management at two of its
own sites and two MS2i sites. Marketing will be through the international
offices of Matra Espace, Matra's space systems division, to help both
partners win more foreign contracts.

<TEXT>
ROCKEFELLER Center Properties (RCP), the largest real estate investment
trust in the US, is close to negotiating an early renewal of its Dollars
200m letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank.
RCP, however, denied reports that it was seeking a complete restructuring of
its Dollars 865m debt, which consists of two Dollars 200m commercial paper
programmes, two series of debentures and bank borrowings.
Mr Edward Fontaine, chief executive of RCP, said yesterday that there had
been a 'continued effort by management to look at ways of refinancing
existing debt that is more reflective of current conditions in this market'.
RCP's main asset is a Dollars 1.3bn convertible mortgage on land under the
original 12 buildings of the Rockefeller Centre, and the New York commercial
property market has been in a prolonged slump since 1990 because of
overcapacity and a severe local recession.
Mr Fontaine said RCP had been in regular talks with Credit Suisse, and hoped
to shortly agree new terms for the letter of credit facility, which was
originally due for renewal in May 1993.

<TEXT>
GRUNDIG, Germany's leading home electronics group, lost DM19m (Dollars 13m)
in the year to March 1992 because of continuing weak demand for television
sets, video recorders and radios.
Announcing the fall into loss, after a DM190m net profit in 1990-1991,
Pieter Harmsen, chairman, warned yesterday that sales and production of home
entertainment products would fall further in the current year.
Last year, sales were DM4.24bn, down from DM4.55bn in 1990-1991. Overall
sales were badly hit by a 9 per cent fall in the home entertainment
division, which contributed DM3.76bn of the total.
Sales in the industrial electronics division fell from DM161m to DM154m,
while the office equipment business picked up from DM97m to DM110m.
Grundig, which is managed by a team from minority shareholder Philips of the
Netherlands, is currently looking for partners prepared to join strategic
alliances in technology and other projects.
Meanwhile, it is busy rationalising its existing operations, and earlier
this week announced that it is to cut its workforce by 3,000 over the next
18 months.
The video recorder business is being merged with that of Philips, and
production currently carried out in Grundig's Nuremberg plant is to be
switched to its Dutch partner's works in Vienna.
The companies are also collaborating closely on development and manufacture
of cordless telephones.
Hit by cheap imports, slack demand in a saturated and depressed domestic
market, and rising wage costs, Grundig - like many other German companies -
is attempting to stay competitive by transferring production overseas.
Around 40 per cent of its 21,000 workforce is employed in low-cost countries
such as Portugal and Malaysia.
Bauknecht, the former Philips domestic appliance subsidiary, now controlled
by Whirlpool of the US, yesterday forecast a 5 per cent sales increase
during 1992, after a similar rise last year to DM1.2bn.
Profits fell in 1991 from DM12.8m to DM8.5m, a company official said.

for 12 years

TWO of Europe's biggest motor groups yesterday reported increased sales for
the first half of 1992.
Renault, the French state-owned car maker, sold 767,000 cars in the first
six months of the year, its best first-half performance since 1980.
This is a 4.8 per cent rise on the first half of last year and lifts
Renault's share of the European market for private cars from 9.9 per cent to
10.5 per cent over the same period a year earlier, said Mr Patrick Faure,
marketing director. He was optimistic about the company's outlook, but
warned that he saw no signs of recovery in the European market.
The performance lifts Renault's share of the French market by three
percentage points over the past year, to 30 per cent, where it is level
pegging with the combined forces of Peugeot and Citroen.
Renault's unit sales in Germany, its biggest export market, fell by 12 per
cent, but it held market share as the Renault 19 continued to be the biggest
selling imported car.
Separately, Valeo, France's biggest supplier of car components, reported a
7.8 per cent increase in first-half sales, from FFr10.3bn to FFr11.1bn
(Dollars 2.2bn). Of the total, 68 per cent was to truck and car makers, with
the remaining 32 per cent to the repairs market, where turnover rose by 3.7
per cent over the comparable period.
Audi, part of the Volkswagen group, reported a drop of 13 per cent to DM315m
(Dollars 210m) in pre-tax profits for the first half of this year, despite a
sharp rise in sales.
The company said the profits decline stemmed from the fact that it was now
selling more cars in export markets, where margins are lower due to
distribution and marketing costs, after the slackening of the German market
which had previously benefited from unification.
In 1991, Audi's net profits jumped by 30 per cent to DM370m, helped by a
lower tax bill.
Audi's turnover in the first six months was 20 per cent higher at DM8.6bn,
with unit sales up by 15 per cent to 271,200 cars. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the
chief executive of Audi who becomes head of the VW group next January, said
the company intended to increase output to some 490,000 cars from last
year's 451,000.
This, he told the annual meeting, would 'have a positive impact on
earnings'. Turnover should exceed DM16bn, a rise of some 8 per cent on the
DM14.8bn of 1991.

THE Australian Securities Commission (ASC) is to facilitate local investment
in foreign companies by removing the need for these companies to register an
Australian prospectus.
Mr Tony Hartnell, ASC chairman, said yesterday that Australian investors had
in effect been excluded from issues of foreign securities because of the
small local market and the practical difficulties of complying with local
prospectus requirements.
The result had been to exclude Australian investors from scrip issues by
foreign companies, or from take-over offers for foreign companies in which
they already held shares.
Mr Hartnell indicated that rules would be relaxed to allow approved foreign
companies to offer securities on Australian markets through a prospectus
registered overseas.
He said the ASC wanted to ensure that Australian investors had a wider
choice of securities 'while retaining key elements of investor protection'.
The change follows a public hearing into the matter in February this year.

HAFNIA, the Danish insurance group which came close to going into
receivership last weekend, has had its credit rating downgraded from A to
BBB.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, said the downgrading took Hafnia to
the lowest rating of any European insurance group.
Hafnia will stay on creditwatch, said S&amp;P, pending the successful
implementation of a DKr2bn (Dollars 348m) share issue, launched on Monday,
and clarification of unauthorised financial commitments by a senior manager,
which Hafnia claims have cost the company an unrealised loss of about
DKr350m.
Hafnia's problems centre on its 'two highly-illiquid and
rapidly-deteriorating strategic stakes' in Danish insurance group Baltica
and Swedish insurer Skandia, said S&amp;P in a statement yesterday.
'Only the resolution of the strategic impasse will bring any lasting
stability to the Hafnia group, though this may be at the expense of its
independence,' it said.
Hafnia has a 34 per cent holding in Baltica Holding and 14.8 per cent in
Skandia. The deterioration in the value of these holdings, as well as other
share and bond holdings, had by July 2 reduced Hafnia Holding's equity to a
negative DKr450m.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALBROOK INSURANCE, a subsidiary of London United Investments which is in
administration, has a balance sheet deficit of Pounds 170m, the directors
told major policyholders at a meeting in Chicago yesterday.
Walbrook, which stopped paying claims on May 29 after having made additional
reserves which gave it net negative worth, urged policyholders to accept a
plan to keep the company out of liquidation.
Under the proposal, the largest policyholders would receive 100 per cent of
claims on condition of returning 60 per cent in subscription for redeemable
preference shares in the company.
The shares would carry no dividend and be redeemable in 2012, on pain of a
shareholder vote to wind up the company. They would rank above the rights of
current shareholders.
Large policyholders - those which have above Dollars 1m in potential
outstanding claims - number 200 in the US and UK. To approve the plan,
enough will have to vote in favour to cover the value of the net liabilities
and a reserve.
There are more than 200,000 total policyholders. However, small
policyholders would be paid in full and not be required to subscribe to the
shares. Claims settled but not paid by May 29 would also be paid in full.
Letters of credit and valid set-offs would be honoured.
The directors of Walbrook - Sir Ian Morrow, Professor Ian Percy and Mr Bill
Goodier - would remain in charge, which they said would allow greater
flexibility and avoid the costs of liquidators fees.
'This plan maximises value for the policyholder, while protecting the
company's major asset,' Sir Ian said yesterday. He called the plan a 'unique
effort' to avoid the risk of becoming 'deadlocked in complexities'.
The policyholders were urged to sign non-binding agreements on or before
July 24, which would allow the scheme to come into operation towards the end
of the year.
If the plan fails, the company faces the prospect of a formal scheme of
arrangement, or provisional or full liquidation.
Walbrook has estimated gross liabilities of more than Pounds 900m and
undiscounted claims of Pounds 1.3bn.

5.25m) for the six months to April 30 on sales of Pounds 450,000 (Pounds
164,000).
The interim dividend is 3.45p, which is 15 per cent up on the notional
dividend the group would have paid had it been a quoted company at the time.
Mr Neville said the French lorry drivers blockade had not prevented most of
the group's customers reaching their destinations. Cancellations had not
risen, although bookings had been affected since the blockade began.
However, more than 95 per cent of bookings had already been taken. Mr
Neville said he did not expect a material affect on profits.
EuroDisney bookings were running at about 70 to 75 per cent of capacity,
which would give a broadly neutral impact on profits.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Jarvis Porter moves into beer mats with
Pounds 8.5m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JARVIS PORTER, which prints labels for spirits and consumer products, is
moving into beer mat printing with the purchase of the promotional products
division of James Wilkes, the specialist engineer which earlier this year
fought off a hostile bid from Petrocon.
Jarvis is paying Pounds 8.5m cash and taking on Pounds 2.9m debt within the
division, which includes John Quarmby in the UK and Waterlomat in Belgium.
These companies account for about a third of European beer mat production,
estimated at 4.5bn units a year.
Jarvis will pay for the acquisition through a placing and offer by Hill
Samuel at 138p a share on a 3-for-8 basis. The issue will raise Pounds
11.97m to cover the acquisition, repayment of debt and costs.
Jarvis's shares fell 5p to 143p while James Wilkes shares were unchanged at
124p.
Mr Arthur Watt, Wilkes's chairman, said the sale was another step to
reducing borrowings, as promised during the Petrocon defence. Following the
disposal, gearing would fall from 164 per cent at the year-end to about 90
per cent, he said.
The division accounted for about 25 per cent of Wilkes's turnover last year.
The division made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.29m in the year to December 31
on turnover of Pounds 11.8m. However, this included a Pounds 567,000
management charge payable to Wilkes which Jarvis believes no longer
necessary.
All the shares were placed yesterday. Certain directors agreed not to take
up the offer, and their shares have been placed firm with institutions.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Davy holders likely to lose Pounds 54m
payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVY Corporation shareholders yesterday lost any hope of receiving the
remaining Pounds 54m, or 45p a share, due under the successful takeover of
the company by Trafalgar House, the engineering and construction group.
Midland and Scottish Resources, reporting a Pounds 46.4m pre-tax loss for
1991, said it was unlikely to fulfil conditions set by Trafalgar enabling
Davy shareholders to be paid the money due to them.
Trafalgar made payment to Davy shareholders conditional on MSR, the oil
production company, completing the purchase from Davy of the Emerald
Producer offshore rig.
But Mr Jon Hawksley, MSR managing director, said it was now 'very difficult'
to see how his company could obtain a Section 10 ship certificate from the
Department of Trade necessary to complete permanent finance of the rig.
'We could only achieve this if oil production from the rig was in excess of
our estimates' he added.
Nor is MSR likely to be able to draw upon the Pounds 118m letter of credit
with the project's bankers.
Instead Trafalgar will lease the Emerald to MSR for Dollars 65,000 (Pounds
34,200) a day.
Trafalgar said the annual Pounds 12.3m leasing fee would barely cover its
interest costs on the assets and the depreciation of the rig.
MSR has been offered an option to buy the rig from Trafalgar but after
reporting the loss, which compared to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.8m, it is
unlikely to exercise the option.
The loss was struck after a Pounds 37.5m exceptional charge relating to the
delay in completing the rig.
The project has taken three years instead of the anticipated 20 months.
Therefore MSR was not able to receive revenue from production this year
while paying its 100 strong project management team working on the rig.
Mr Hawksley said initial oil production was now imminent.
Losses per share of 22p compared to earnings of 5p. Turnover rose from
Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 5.9m. The cost of sales increased from Pounds 2.6m to
Pounds 10.3m.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: NatWest Bancorp continues to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bancorp, the US subsidiary of National Westminster
Bank, continued to show a strong improvement in the second quarter of the
year and is on course for profits of Dollars 120m (Pounds 63m) for the year.
Mr John Tugwell, chairman, said yesterday that he expected NatWest Bancorp
to have even better results in the third quarter and to make profits of
about Dollars 120m this year.
The bank's net profit of Dollars 35.8m in the second quarter to end- June
compares with a Dollars 85.1m loss in the same period a year ago. The
second-quarter result was also up on the first-quarter profit of Dollars
30.3m.
NatWest Bancorp believes it has overcome its problems with bad loans to the
New Jersey property market. These left it with cumulative losses of Dollars
860m since 1989.
'We have turned the corner and the worst is over,' said Mr Tugwell, adding
that he was pleased the bank had kept its costs steady and maintained good
margins on its lending. 'The core deposit side is really excellent with a 10
per cent increase in demand deposits.'
There was a charge of Dollars 30.5m for loan losses during the quarter, down
from Dollars 134.7m in the same quarter a year ago. The charge for the
six-month period was Dollars 61m, down from Dollars 356.6m a year ago.
The bank's total allowance for loan losses is now Dollars 657.5m, 60 per
cent of its non-performing loans, or 4.63 per cent of its total loan book at
June 30.
At the end of June, its total assets were Dollars 22.17bn, up from Dollars
21.97bn a year earlier.
Mr Tugwell said plans to build up the bank's retail deposit base were going
well and the bank was making steady progress in finding new customers in
ethnic areas.
Although the bank has shed some unprofitable branches it has also opened new
ones and wants to buy branches to expand its network of 270. It is also
interested in buying any credit card businesses which come on the market.

FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Overseas sales behind 32% improvement at
Domino
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG OVERSEAS sales helped Domino Printing Sciences, the Cambridge-based
manufacturer and distributor of industrial ink-jet printers, increase
pre-tax profits by 32 per cent, from Pounds 3.43m to Pounds 4.54m, in the
six months to April 30.
Turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 30.9m, although UK sales were flat at
Pounds 5.25m (Pounds 5.29m). Domino said the corresponding period had
benefited from strong legislative-driven demand for new food labels, and
buying decisions had been delayed in the run-up to the general election.
Order levels had since improved and a contract to supply the Royal Mail with
ink-jet machines starts in July.
Elsewhere in Europe, the growth pattern had generally been very positive.
Business in Germany, France, Spain and Italy continued to be encouraging in
spite of reduced legislation-driven demand.
US sales grew by 23 per cent, mainly from further commercial printing
installations. The range of JetArray Elan and JetAddress printers had sold
well, with one customer placing a Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.2m) contract for
delivery of 37 JetArrays before September of this year.
So far a limited part of last September's Pounds 15.5m rights issue has been
applied to the development of the German business and setting up support
offices in Singapore and Dubai. The group had also examined a number of
acquisition opportunities, but none had proved sufficiently attractive.
Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said: 'The growth achieved in the first half is
continuing into the second half. The order book is very strong and both
assembly plants are working extra hours.'
Interest income was Pounds 876,000 compared with a payment of Pounds 19,000
last time. Earnings per share rose to 11.46p (10.58p). The interim dividend
is lifted by 14 per cent to 2.4p (2.1p).

pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REG VARDY, the multi-franchise motor dealer, lifted its dividend by 11 per
cent for the year to April 30.
Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said this reflected the board's confidence despite
a slip in profits from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 4.11m pre-tax and in turnover
from Pounds 182.6m to Pounds 177.5m.
Again the best news came from the after-sales operations. Service, parts and
bodyshops contributed 46 per cent to group gross profits, up from 43 per
cent last time.
The long-predicted revival in new car volumes 'failed to materialise', he
said. The company sold 23,090 cars in the period - 150 more than previously
 -and 63 per cent of these were volume used cars. It sold 14,540 new volume
cars.
However, Mr Vardy said used car sales had been hit by the drop in new car
sales in the past two years which had limited supplies.
October's Pounds 12.9m placing and open offer - reducing Mr Vardy's stake to
53 per cent - enabled the company to acquire more dealerships. It now has 21
representing 13 franchises as well as two MotorZone used car centres.
Gross profits rose to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 23.1m), but were more than offset
by operating expenses up Pounds 2m at Pounds 19.5m. Interest charges fell to
Pounds 826,000 (Pounds 1.24m).
The final dividend is lifted to 2.7p for a total of 4p (3.6p), payable from
earnings of 7.8p (9.4p), diluted by the increased number of shares in issue.

FT  10 JUL 92 / United alters its aircraft allegiance: US airline's order
for Airbus will earn it European goodwill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday, Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, was in Toulouse
negotiating a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) aircraft order with Mr Jean
Pierson, chief executive of the European Airbus Industrie aircraft
consortium.
Five months earlier, Mr Wolf announced a Dollars 6.7bn cut in his airline's
three-year new aircraft capital expenditure programme including 104 Boeing
737 and 757 narrow body jets after United reported a Dollars 331.9m net loss
for 1991.
The financial performance of United, the second largest US carrier, has
remained in Mr Wolf's own words 'dismally woeful'. For the first quarter of
this year, the airline lost Dollars 92.3m and the second quarter is also
expected to be disappointing.
But Mr Pierson appears to have made Mr Wolf an offer he found hard to
refuse. On Tuesday his board approved an order for up to 100 Airbus A320
narrow-body aircraft, the rival of the Boeing 737, worth about Dollars 5bn.
On Wednesday, the champagne flowed in Toulouse to celebrate what is
undoubtedly one of the most significant marketing coups in the 20-year
history of Airbus.
United was one of the last remaining strongholds of Boeing, the world's
largest manufacturer of commercial airliners. For the last two decades,
United bought nothing but Boeings. In the early 1930s, Boeing owned a big
stake in United until the US Congress decided in 1934 that airlines had to
be separated from manufacturers.
With the United deal, Airbus has now placed aircraft with all the main US
carriers with the exception of USAir and South-west Airlines. The last two
remaining Boeing strongholds are Japan Air Lines and British Airways,
although the UK carrier inherited 10 A320s when it took over British
Caledonian five years ago.
Mr Pierson is now well on his way to achieve his target of a 30 per cent
share of the commercial jet market. 'Last year we stood at 26 per cent of
the global trade,' he recently said.
Airbus has now become Boeing's main competitor overtaking McDonnell Douglas,
which is struggling to revive its commercial aircraft operations by
attempting, so far unsuccessfully, to negotiate a partnership with Taiwan
and other Asian countries.
The United deal also comes as the aircraft industry faces one of the worst
cyclical downturns in its history. The order will help safeguard thousands
of jobs at the four Airbus partner companies including British Aerospace (20
per cent), Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9
per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent).
It is also important for Rolls-Royce, a partner in the International Aero
Engine (IAE) consortium whose V2500 has been chosen to power United's new
A320s.
The order will give IAE a big boost in its fierce competition against the
rival CFM International consortium, the joint-venture between General
Electric of the US and Snecma of France which has won the lion's share of
engine orders in the 150-seat narrow-body aircraft market sector.
Finally, the order is likely to restore confidence in the A320, probably the
world's most sophisticated and technologically advanced airliner which has
regularly been dogged by controversy over the safety of its 'fly-by-wire'
computer flight control system.
But the deal begs one important question: why did United suddenly decide to
order Dollars 5bn worth of Airbus aircraft after slashing in February its
1992-95 aircraft acquisition programme involving all Boeing aircraft?
Airline industry sources suggested yesterday Airbus had presented United
with 'an extraordinary opportunity' by
offering extremely attractive financing. Under the terms of the deal, United
will acquire 50 A320s on lease with options for an additional 50.
Airbus claimed yesterday the arrangement was a classical financial vehicle
involving long-term leasing.
It added that the Airbus proposal was identical in structure to Boeing's
competing bid to supply Boeing 737-400s to United. Boeing, for its part,
said it had made a very attractive offer which went 'as far as prudence
would dictate'. The Seattle manufacturer also added: 'Obviously Airbus could
do more.'
United is acquiring the A320s to replace gradually its fleet of ageing
Boeing 727-200 three-engine airliners. It expects to retire 26 of these this
year. Since February, it has also faced a new demand for aircraft for its
expansion in the fast-growing Latin American market following its Dollars
135m acquisition of Pan Am's Latin American routes this year.
Apart from the bargain terms offered by the European consortium, United
clearly expects to earn some much needed goodwill in Europe by opting for
Airbus rather than Boeing aircraft.
Several European countries, especially France and Germany, have recently
become alarmed by the aggressive expansion of big US carriers such as
United, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines into their market and the
transatlantic fares war this has unleashed.
France has been seeking to limit this expansion by wanting to renegotiate
its bilateral air agreement with the US.
United now has four daily flights out of Paris to the US as well as European
feeder services operated by Boeing 727s which could eventually be replaced
by A320s.
Although Boeing said it accepted and understood United's decision, the deal
is likely to rekindle the old dispute over Airbus subsidies and creative
financing to win market share in the US. The A320 contract is understood to
be flexible with some liberal return arrangements if aircraft are not taken
up by United.
However, if Boeing ultimately decides to kick up a fuss, its campaign could
be blunted by the accord reached this spring between the US and the European
Commission on aircraft subsidies.
'It is an agreement that is balanced and fair to all and now that it is
completed, it lets both sides focus their energies on what they do best:
designing, building and selling aircraft,' Mr Pierson said in New York last
month.
But that was before the United deal.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Shares fall steeply at Albert Fisher on crops warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Albert Fisher plunged by 25p to 41p after the UK-based fresh
produce distributor and food processor warned that a glut of fresh produce
in Europe and North America would significantly cut its profits.
The collapse cut Albert Fisher's market value by nearly Pounds 150m to
Pounds 244m, compared with last year's peak of Pounds 790m. The flight from
the shares also reflected the City's continuing disillusionment with the
company, a stock market star of the 1980s, and with Mr Tony Millar, the
executive chairman who built it up by making more than 50 acquisitions.
Mr Millar said high crop yields of a wide range of fruit and vegetables, and
the expansion by growers of cultivated acreages and early harvests, had led
to an unprecedented seasonal oversupply.
Sales volumes were in line with expectations, but severe price deflation in
Europe and North America would cut profits. Apples, grapes and pears
imported from Chile into Europe were particularly adversely affected.
Analysts cut pre-tax profit forecasts from Pounds 77m to about Pounds 63m
for the year to August 31.
The group said: 'Whilst the board considers it inappropriate to make a
dividend forecast at this stage of the year, it remains conscious of the
importance of dividends to shareholders.'
There was some surprise among analysts that the company was not able to be
more forthcoming, as the year-end is so close. Mr Millar said he wanted to
see how long the oversupply would continue before making the dividend
decision in October.
Albert Fisher shares have fallen steadily since it was revealed in March
last year that Mr Keith Brackpool, chief executive of the group's US
operations, personally owed Polly Peck International, the failed trading
group, more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.8m).
Mr Millar has since sought to reassure the City by appointing new chief
executives in North America and Europe and two new non-executive directors.
Last night the company announced after the market closed that Mr Millar's
wife, Judy, and five group directors had bought a total of more than 100,000
shares during the day, at prices between 36.5p and 38p.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Rank limits dip in profits after tight control of costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF-WAY results at Rank Organisation, the leisure group, reached the top
end of expectations in an economic climate which the company said offered
little but gloom.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 94m for the 28 weeks to May 16, Pounds 2m less
than last year. Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said the company had
kept tight control of costs, including 600 redundancies. Sir Patrick Meaney,
chairman, added: 'Until the recession lifts, any improvements in performance
are likely to result only from self-help.'
The group, whose activities include the Butlin's holiday camps, Odeon
cinemas and Pinewood studios, said most areas had been hit by the recession.
The Hard Rock Cafes were an exception. Over the past year, Rank has opened
new Hard Rock Cafes in Paris and Berlin. Bingo also appeared impervious to
the downturn, with admissions and spending per head both up.
The company also had encouraging results from its London hotels, where
occupancy is now more than 70 per cent. Although this has been achieved
through price-cutting, Mr Gifford said profits at the London hotels were at
the level achieved in 1990. The group still intends to sell 22 of its UK
hotels. Mr Gifford said no sale had yet been concluded, although several
buyers had expressed an interest. He hoped to conclude a sale during the
second half.
Admissions at Odeon cinemas fell 10 per cent, mainly because of an absence
of blockbuster films. The US video sales business continued to suffer
losses, but new managers had been appointed and computer systems improved.
Admissions to casinos remained constant but spending per head fell 4 per
cent on last year. The amusement machine business also had a difficult year.
The group's share of the pre-tax profits of Rank Xerox was Pounds 71.1m,
compared with Pounds 80.1m last year. This included a reduced contribution
from Fuji Xerox, which has suffered from the Japanese economic downturn.
Turnover was Pounds 935.5m, compared with Pounds 983.6m last year. Earnings
per share rose to 14.2p from 11.3p as a result of a lower tax charge,
reduced minority interests and a reduction in total dividend payments on
preference shares. The interim dividend was a maintained 10.25p.

FT  10 JUL 92 / EC Court opens way for sale of cut-price UK books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUT-PRICE books could soon be widely available in Britain following a
European Court ruling yesterday.
Under the ruling, British booksellers will be allowed to reimport
UK-published books from other European Community countries and sell them at
a discount.
Although the decision by the Court of First Instance, the lower EC judicial
body, does not abolish Britain's 'net book' agreement (NBA), through which
UK publishers set minimum retail prices for books, it could undermine it by
allowing 'parallel imports' of British books to escape its restrictions.
The court upheld a 1988 European Commission decision which forbade
publishers from applying the NBA to sales of British books across EC
frontiers.
The ruling will have a particular bearing on Ireland, where imports of
British books account for about 50 per cent of the market. Irish
booksellers, previously subject to the British agreement, will now be
allowed to cut the retail price of British books.
But entrepreneurial book distributors will also be able to reimport books
from Ireland - and other EC countries - into the UK, where booksellers could
cut the 'minimum' price by up to half.
The London-based Publishers Association, which represents most UK publishers
and brought the case against the Commission, said yesterday it was
considering an appeal to the European Court of Justice - the ultimate EC
legal body - and would try to find ways to close the parallel import
loophole.
'One of the first things we will be doing is discussing (with the Court and
Commission) how that particular fiddle, if that's not too strong a word,
could be frustrated,' the association said.
But a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, said: 'In
general, the Commission upholds parallel imports as being good news for
competition.'
Supporters of the NBA are worried that if the agreement disintegrates, small
booksellers will be driven out of business, and less popular books will
either remain unpublished or be priced out of the market.
Mr Terry Maher, an arch-critic of the NBA and chairman of Pentos, owners of
Dillons bookshops which sells some books on a non-net basis, said the
court's decision was 'devastating'.
'It sounds the death knell for the NBA . . . and I hope that this is quickly
and graciously recognised by the Publishers Association,' he said.
The association accepted it would have to modify the NBA, but believed this
could be done by adding a codicil rather than redrawing the whole agreement.
Irish booksellers said the ruling would not have an immediate effect on the
market, but they were worried that eventually there would be less choice and
fewer books on the shelves.
'We won't be able to stock the same range, and first-time writers will have
a nil chance of being published,' said Ms Mary Fitzgerald, general manager
of Waterstone's bookshop in Dublin.

FT  10 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Scottish Hydro
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In theory, Scottish Hydro-Electric has several natural advantages. Its
hydroelectric power is cheap. Unlike the English generators it is not
obliged to pass on the benefits of low-cost coal. In other respects prices
are more tightly regulated in its home market than those of the English
RECs. So it is not surprising that exports of electricity to England and
Wales jumped by 58 per cent to Pounds 117m last year. But it would be
mistaken to read too much into the future from this, even if it was the
chief factor behind the 35 per cent increase in pro-forma pre-tax profits.
The risk in depending for growth on exports to England and Wales is not only
that the pool price at which such exports are priced can fluctuate widely.
It is also that any eventual deal between British Coal and the English
generators will almost certainly lead to lower power prices south of the
border, reducing the margin that Hydro can earn. Scottish Power, which has
concentrated on sales to Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, may be on to
a better thing, besides having its venture into telecommunications. It all
makes the 8 per cent premium on Hydro's partly-paid share price over that of
its Scottish rival look a trifle excessive.

With a bit more life in the economy, Rank might by now have digested the

has still not sold any of the 22 hotels it put on the market in April.
Progress in stemming the video distribution losses in the US is
embarrassingly slow. To crown it all, a slowdown in the Japanese office
supplies market depressed the contribution from Rank Xerox by more than 10
per cent.
That said, it is easy to overdo the gloom reflected in the shares' near-20
per cent fall since late May. Bingo is going from strength to strength and
London hotels are making money, though at the cost of savage discounting.
The company still managed enough capital spending to keep an edge on the
competition during the first half, while lopping Pounds 47m off net debt
outstanding a year earlier. Lower profits at Rank Xerox should have little
impact on Rank's cash flow, since the associate is unlikely to cut its
regular dividend much, if at all.
Tax credits from previous US losses will help keep the tax charge down, so
that profits, which have now started flowing from Universal Studios, will
pass straight to the bottom line. Rank's dividend thus looks reasonably
secure in terms both of earnings and cash cover. But it is not worth getting
too carried away by the yield of more than 6.5 per cent. The upside is
limited by the delayed UK recovery which Rank itself does not expect before
1994.

FT  10 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's profits warning from Albert Fisher completes the company's
transition from glamour stock to problem case. Investors have had their
patience tried before, by mishaps with Polish mushrooms and Dutch cockles.
The latest, involving Chilean grapes and apples, sounds more serious: so
much so that seven weeks from the year-end the company cannot be quite sure
about maintaining its Pounds 22m annual dividend, despite having Pounds 10m
of net cash in the bank.
Faced with a likely halving of its second-half profits, Fisher is in
something of a cleft stick. If a sudden drop in fruit and vegetable prices
can do this kind of damage, so much for the notion that the company adds
value to what it sells. So much, too, for any claim to quality of earnings
and a high p/e. If, on the other hand, there are factors yet unknown behind
yesterday's announcement, the market is wholly justified in hitting the
shares as the price of uncertainty.
With the shares down 38 per cent yesterday to 41p, Fisher's market value has
fallen from nearly Pounds 800m to Pounds 240m in little more than 15 months.
The perplexing thing is that if full-year profits come out at Pounds 63m, as
the optimists suggest, a held dividend would be almost twice covered by
earnings. The yield would then be over 12 per cent, on an earnings multiple
of less than 6. It was doubtless this, rather than any sense of urgency,
that caused half a dozen Fisher directors to dive into the market and buy
shares yesterday. Others tempted to follow their example might care to
reflect on the reasonably safe stock market generalisation that when shares
have fallen this far, they seldom come back.

FT  10 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Owning up to Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the many distasteful examples of buck-passing over the Maxwell affair,
at least somebody has had the guts to stick up a hand. All the same,
official reaction to yesterday's guilty plea by the relevant self-regulatory
organisation, Imro, is rather depressing. Judging by its position paper, the
line of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) seems to be that the
edifice of UK self-regulation established in the mid-1980s is essentially
sound. Mr Maxwell drove a coach and horses through it this time; but
would-be pension fund plunderers of the future can be stopped by
better-qualified regulators - preferably volunteers from the financial
services industry - and beefed-up admission and monitoring procedures at
Imro and elsewhere.
There are no easy solutions, to be sure. But the decision to retain Imro
suggests the old boy network is alive and well. Imro's credibility and
morale have been seriously damaged, and one wonders who will be willing to
take over as chief executive even at a rate nearly twice that of a
comparable self-regulatory organisation boss. More to the point, there was
already a plausible case for merging Imro into the rather more successful
Securities and Futures Association to create one entity for institutional
investors, just as the two retail investor regulatory organisations are now
being merged into one. Such a solution would have ended the present muddle
which still allows companies to shop around for regulation, besides
dispelling lingering doubts about Imro itself.
As for alternatives to self-regulation, there is no evidence that government
departments can do any better. But the string of recent scandals centring on
London is more damaging than anything else to the UK's continued
pre-eminence in financial services.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Letter: Debt relief for Russia would be unwise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HORST SCHULMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Russia's place at the table' (July 8), is ill judged,
in particular the low priority you extend to meeting international financial
obligations. Considerable damage has already been done to Russia's
creditworthiness as a result of the interruption in payments since the turn
of the year. Western governments will have to ask themselves what debt
relief might do to the prospects for future private capital flows to Russia.
As is well known, private investors tend to have long memories. Following
the repudiation of the Tsarist debt, it took the former Soviet Union over 70
years to float a bond issue in the international capital market. The example
of Poland is also telling. Unlike Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which have
faithfully serviced their external debt, Poland is not experiencing a
foreign investment boom.
Thus, while it is important to create 'a legal framework to ensure the
growth of private enterprise throughout Russia', this alone will not restore
Russia's creditworthiness. A country as great, proud and rich as Russia
should do everything to avoid the experience of Latin America in the 1980s.
Fortunately, debt relief is not required for Russia. With appropriate
policies in place and the financing already pledged by the G7, Russia should
be able to service in 1992, if necessary, the entire foreign debt of the
former Soviet Union and increase its foreign exchange reserves as well.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Letter: Executive options a lottery not reflecting
management effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID M W BROOKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your article, 'Shareholder group calls for changes to
stock option plans' (July 6), it is unfortunate that, as with so many things
in life, the institutions are trying to make the best of a bad job.
Institutions and companies appear stuck in the trap of using existing
arrangements - executive options - the design of which has in reality been
substantially dictated by the Inland Revenue and only to a small degree by
the specific requirements of each individual company.
Is it not high time that, rather than tinkering with options, the
institutions and remuneration committees asked themselves what they are
trying to achieve by giving executives company shares? If they are to use
options as an incentive they should accept that the basic structure of
options, in the majority of cases, is totally inappropriate.
Because options are highly leveraged and dependent more upon the thoughts of
Number 11 Downing Street than the effort and corporate results of the
company, the benefits of an option end up being regarded as a lottery rather
than a benefit reflecting management effort.
Tinkering with performance measures may remove the windfall or market
(rather than company) gains under options, thereby removing some of the
extremes of the 1980s. However, applying such an on/off switch does little
to deal with the quantum of award or the quality of the incentive impact.
It is a pity if both the institutions and the remuneration committees, in
the light of corporate governance pressures and a growing realistic approach
towards executive remuneration, do not take this as an opportunity to go
back to basics and to draw up guidelines which can be used effectively to
give management incentive and reward by reference to shareholder reward,
rather than simply provide a lottery ticket which may or may not pay up.

FT  10 JUL 92 / France breaks through political roadblock: Despite a
faltering start, the government has done well to resolve the truckers'
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 10 days of chaos and confrontation, the French government has pretty
well brought an end to the nation-wide truckers' protest, through a shrewd
orchestration of heavy police power and astute negotiation. But it has been
a gruelling ordeal for all concerned, and it is still not clear whether the
government's public standing will have suffered lasting damage from the
crisis.
Conservative commentators have argued that the government displayed
incompetence and mismanagement; they may have a point. The new driving
licence regulations, which were the ostensible cause of the truckers'
protest, became law three years ago, were due to come into effect at the
beginning of this year, and were then postponed to July 1.
By any reckoning the start of the holiday season must have been the worst
possible moment to enforce an unpopular innovation of this kind. Yet the
government appears to have been taken by surprise by the scale of the
truckers' protest.
At that stage the main count against the government was that it was simply
out of touch with the national grass roots, and in particular out of touch
with the attitudes of the lorry drivers. The truckers object to the new
points system for driving licences, under which drivers can lose points for
traffic offences, because they claim that their high mileages make them
specially vulnerable. Yet the government was obviously unaware that these
objections were about to explode in a nationwide conflict.
Some French commentators have argued that the government's apparent
insouciance on this occasion, was in fact only a particular confirmation of
a general rule: that the political elite in Paris is cocooned from the rest
of France, and that the centralised government machine is far removed from
the real world. Even if this general rule is not in fact valid, it is widely
believed: survey after survey has shown that many French voters feel that
their governments and their political leaders are remote from everyday life,
and indeed are indifferent to the concerns of ordinary people.
This grassroots critique of politicians is directed against all parts of the
political spectrum, regardless of ideology. Yet it is obviously focused most
immediately on the party in office, and after 11 years of a Socialist
presidency, the charge may stick. What is not really in doubt is that under
the Fifth Republic power in the French political system has increasingly
become drawn towards the office of the presidency, with unfortunate
consequences for the political system: successive governments have become
increasingly dependent on presidential approval while parliament seems
marginal.
In the truckers' dispute, however, the government recovered from a poor
start and finished well. All last week it was fumbling for a strategy, but
getting nowhere. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy promised that the 'black
boxes' in lorry cabs would not be used for retrospective evidence of
speeding offences, but insisted there could be no going back from the new
licence system; the Ministry of the Interior veered between half-hearted
threats to withdraw the licences of striking drivers, and ineffectual
attempts to start negotiations on the operation of the new system.
By Monday, however, the government had finally gripped the central fact,
that the new licence was not the real cause of the conflict, but only the
last straw for a workforce suffering from the pressures of cut-throat
competition.
In 1986 the then Conservative government freed the road transport industry
from price and licensing restrictions. Deregulation attracted an inflow of
new entrepreneurs, many of them very small; the number of trucking outfits
rose from 24,000 in 1983 to 33,000 in 1989.
At first there was enough business to go round, and road transport's share
of total goods transport in France rose from 47 per cent in 1970 to 70 per
cent in 1990. But already in 1989 the economy started to turn down, forcing
an inexorable cycle of price cutting: the large transport companies forced
price cuts on the small sub-contractors, to the point where some say that a
quarter of self-employed small truckers may be operating unprofitably. In
turn the sub-contractors have forced wage cuts or longer working hours on
the drivers.
As a result, working practices are often unsafe. Out of 340,000 trucks
checked on the roads last year, one-tenth were found to be in breach of laws
on working conditions, notably hours worked and rest periods.
This is where the new driving licence regulations come in. Even the drivers
complain that competitive pressures commit them to journey times which
require them systematically to break the speed limits. At the last count,
trucks accounted for 7 per cent of total vehicle-kilometres in France; but
they were involved in nearly 15 per cent of the fatal accidents.
On Monday and Tuesday, in two successive all-night negotiating sessions with
the employers' unions, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, the transport minister, rammed
through a double package designed to mitigate the effects of cut-throat
competition. There will be new safeguards to protect drivers from
exploitation by the sub-contractors; more important, perhaps, there will
also be measures to prevent main transporters from imposing sub-contracts
which manifestly cannot cover costs.
No one can be sure that the new deals will do the trick; they certainly do
not solve the central problem of over-capacity in the trucking industry. But
by yesterday virtually all the truckers' roadblocks had been cleared, and
traffic was again flowing freely on the French roads. Considering that the
drivers are virtually un-unionised, semi-anarchic and without recognised
leaders, the government has done well to defuse the dispute relatively
quickly, and with much less police violence than became familiar in some
British labour conflicts such as the coalminers' strike of 1984-85.
Naturally, the government does not expect any applause; but there is still
one question which worries it: will this dispute tilt the balance against
the Maastricht referendum on September 20? There is no reason to conclude
that it is evidence of a general upsurge of popular discontent with the
government. President Francois Mitterrand remains deeply unpopular, but Mr
Beregovoy is much more popular than his predecessor, Mrs Edith Cresson.
Nevertheless, the Maastricht treaty will be strongly contested by an
ill-assorted alliance of nationalists led by traditional Gaullists. Aware of
this challenge the government has done its best to clear the decks of all
other contentious issues. Two weeks ago it postponed until the autumn a
controversial bill on the control of medical spending. Nevertheless, there
is some danger that the trucking dispute, like the rolling waves of farmers'
protests, will be blamed not just on the government, but also on the
economic liberalism associated with the European Community.
For the moment, it does not look as though the referendum is in danger. The
two most recent opinion surveys show a clear majority in favour, though the
margin is narrower than in some previous polls; and these polls were both
taken on July 3-4, when the truckers' dispute was already in full swing. In
any case, for most Frenchmen, the holidays are still ahead, and may bring
forgetfulness.
