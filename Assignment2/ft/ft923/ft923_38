FT  10 JUL 92 / Letter: CBI industrial surveys tell the story as it is, with
no gloss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUGLAS MCWILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having begun his campaign against business surveys with the accusation
in June that the CBI was 'stretching the truth, or probably downright
lying', Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of MSF, now appears to have
moderated his language but still seems to be intent on misrepresenting the
facts. In his letter (July 8), he asserts that the CBI's March Industrial
Trends Survey 'declared on the eve of the general election that recovery was
round the corner'. It did no such thing.
The survey, based on replies from 1,439 companies in 50 different industries
together responsible for roughly half of UK manufacturing employment and
exports, reported a slight improvement in home and export orders, a further
run-down in stocks and that firms expected output to flatten out over the
next four months. The FT report on the survey was headed 'CBI reports
'patchy' rise in demand' (March 28). In June, Mr Lyons was quoted in The
Guardian as saying the CBI had been 'talking up the state of the economy,
particularly before the election' and alleging there had been 'election
trickery at work'.
I suspect Mr Lyons' memory is as muddled as his accusation. It was the CBI's
April survey, published 19 days after polling day, that reported the biggest
increase in business optimism since July 1988 and said that manufacturing
output was expected to increase over the next four months as demand
improved. The FT report on that survey was headed 'CBI reports rising
prospects' (April 29).
Mr Lyons really must not allow his dissatisfaction with the election result
to distort his judgment. The CBI surveys depend solely on what
industrialists themselves say about the trend in orders, output, stocks and
prices. In publishing these surveys, the CBI never attempts to put a
particular gloss on them. We always tell the story as it really is.
Mr Lyons might do much for his own credibility if he followed the same
practice.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Letter: The rights and wrongs of forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BECK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article on the problems of economic forecasts ('Stormy
forecasts', July 8) compares their reliability with weather forecasts. This
is not just unfair to weather forecasters, but also ignores a fundamental
difference between the two. Weather forecasts do not affect the weather, but
forecasts of the economy do affect the economy. Forecasts of human behaviour
or activity which are believed and acted upon tend to fall into two
categories - self-fulfilling or self-defeating. Forecasts of the economy
clearly fall into the latter category: if believed, they will prove wrong,
if ignored they may prove correct.
Economic forecasters thus have a choice. They can become influential and
wrong, or ignored, but right.

At the bar of a London men's club, an accountant, a lawyer and an actuary
were debating the pros and cons of matrimony.
'I'm better off having a wife rather than just a lover - the tax advantages
are so great,' the accountant said. 'No,' replied the lawyer, 'I'm better
off with my lover - you can be hit so hard for alimony by a wife.'
'I'm best off in having both,' said the actuary. 'When I'm not with my wife
she thinks I'm with my lover, and when I'm not with my lover she thinks I'm
with my wife. That way, I get to spend more time in the office.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Ross Perot's victory is imminent and will be the flash-point of a
fundamental political restructuring that will spell the end of the familiar
two-party system and the beginning of a new system of independent parties.'
Says who? The latest issue of the Trends Journal of the Socio-Economic
Research Institute, that's who. And what is the Socio-Economic Research
Institute? A 'world leader in trend forecasting', according to the
institute's own packaging. The institute - based in New York state - charges
its corporate clients Dollars 25,000 for a 'trend-tracking project', which
defines a trend in social, economic or political terms.
Run by bearded, messianic-looking Gerald Celente, the institute claims an
impressive series of successful predictions, including the savings and loan
crisis and democracy for east Europe.
But it seems happiest when hedging its bets. Thus the very same issue, after
two pages explaining why Perot will win, considers four reasons why he might
lose: 'the national economy significantly rebounds'; 'Perot is found to have
been involved in a major scandal'; he 'selects a running mate with a narrow,
ideological perspective'; or 'he doesn't run an even moderately effective
campaign'. Oh Nostradamus, where art thou now?

One of the City's better-known Jeremiahs, Stephen Lewis, was trying his best
to look cheerful yesterday. The most memorable prediction from the former
Phillips &amp; Drew economist was that there would be 50,000 job losses after
the 1987 stock market crash. Grinning amiably over a glass of champagne, he
claimed the rout to be over - rather surprisingly, given the deathly shadow
that has fallen across the equity market of late.
'The City has come full circle,' maintained Lewis, explaining his decision
to throw in his lot with a new broking firm. Like an increasing number of
people in the City, he believes fund managers are again prepared to pay
commissions for good advice. If not, then Lewis and his colleagues at the
grandly titled London Bond Broking Company will find themselves adding to
the job queue.
Was the 50,000 an exaggeration? 'After the first three months, people
stopped publishing the numbers. But there's a feeling that we did get the
50,000, and more besides.'

Campbell Anderson, managing director of Renison Goldfields Consolidated, the

this week.
He is suffering from repetitive strain injury which, he explains, is very

'I thought it was something only typists and journalists suffered from,'
says Anderson.
So how did he come by his RSI? From playing with a Game Boy - a hand-held

Signs of the times. Just as publishers Random Century have put the gag on
chauvinistic references to foreigners in reprints of W E Johns's books about
fighter ace Biggles, the borough council of Nuneaton and Bedworth has taken
the wraps off condom-dispensers.
It has evidently become the first UK council to abolish the rule restricting
contraceptive vending machines to indoor sites such as the lavatories of
public houses.
Moreover, it has already put its new policy into practice. An open-access
machine has been installed at Nuneaton's main bus station, and formally
inaugurated by Councillor Mrs Mary Beaumont, chair of the council's
environmental health committee.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Observer: Silver dollars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not every day that someone dumps 622 tonnes of silver - or, if some
bullion traders are to be believed, perhaps even twice that amount. But
dealers with long memories may reflect that their lives were disrupted some
years ago when the very same National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia
offloaded 100 tonnes of gold.
The gold sale was hailed as a shrewd move by Khalid Bin Mahfouz, the bank's
operating officer, who switched into US dollars and made a subsequent packet
as the rate rose. Mahfouz, who now finds himself indicted in the US for his
part in the BCCI affair, is no stranger to the bullion markets and was one
of the players invited to join in Nelson Bunker Hunt's ambitious plan to
corner the silver market in the late 1970s.
Hunt wanted Mahfouz and Ghaith Pharaon, another Arab closely connected to
BCCI, to join in his scheme. Pharaon demurred but Mahfouz started buying
enthusiastically and lost Dollars 600m when the scheme backfired and the
price of silver plummeted.
Three years ago he had a bad car accident in Jeddah which left him badly
injured, though he has continued to play a central role in the bank's
affairs - as, indeed, in those of the kindgom itself.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Leading Article: No squibs from SIB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board (SIB) yesterday confirmed what no one
had previously doubted: there were serious deficiencies in the behaviour of
the investment watchdog, Imro, in relation to the fund management companies
in the late Robert Maxwell's business empire. SIB made the equally
incontrovertible statement that the massive fraud perpetrated on the Maxwell
pensioners reflected badly on the British corporate and financial system as
a whole. The question is whether its moderate proposals for piecemeal reform
amount to a credible response to the scandal.
SIB's ultimate sanction under the 1986 Financial Services Act is to withdraw
recognition of self-regulatory organisations. That is a draconian response
which it has preferred to eschew. Instead it has opted for a clean-out at
the top of Imro, proposals to strengthen Imro's organisations and
procedures, and a review of this and that. These reviews will include one of
its own procedures, in the light of SIB's failure to detect a shortfall in
standards at Imro. Such a lapse had been predicted by countless observers
long before the Financial Services Act originally came into force.
SIB's new chairman, Mr Andrew Large, has also decided that a greater and
more effective level of practitioner experience in the regulatory system is
now called for. This seems an odd rejoinder to deficiencies at Imro, given
that the two men departing the Imro camp - to their credit the only two to
have accepted any real blame for the affair so far - were respectively a
former leading light of the stock exchange and the former manager of one of
Britain's largest pension funds.
What has been missing at Imro, and in other self-regulatory organisations,
is not practitioner input but the sense of mission and sceptical inquiry
that pervades bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission in the
United States. The absence of those qualities is rightly emphasised in the
limited parts of Imro's own report on its performance that SIB's legal
advisers have let it publish.
To be fair to Mr Large, there are limits to what he can do about the
inadequacies of pension fund regulation under his existing remit. The more
important contribution on the nature and scope of future reform will have to
come from Professor Roy Goode's committee and, ultimately, the government.
Social services secretary Mr Peter Lilley's minimalist response to the
Maxwell pensioners' plight inspires little confidence on that score. Nor did
yesterday's performance in the Commons by Mr Norman Lamont, in which he
denied, in effect, that earlier warnings about the inadequacies of trust law
were relevant to the Maxwell case. Passing the buck is still the name of the
game and it is not an edifying spectacle. The questions raised by the
Maxwell saga about the effectiveness of the regulatory structure deserve
better answers than they have received so far. A greater readiness to accept
responsibility is also overdue.

FT  10 JUL 92 / How blues help greens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The environment was not an issue in the last British general election. The
Conservatives believe that it may be one in the next. It depends on the
economic cycle. When people feel affluent or comfortable they attend to the
purity of the air and the cleanliness of water. When there is a downturn
voters worry about jobs, prices and taxes. That is what is happening in the
US. The economy is flat. The greens are in retreat. When the recession is
over they will be back in force, on both sides of the Atlantic.
There is a perverse logic here. You could argue that the British government
is proving this very day that it is a true friend of the earth. It has
produced a long, debilitating recession. This is wonderful for the
environment, if not for those who campaign on green issues. Fewer cars are
sold. Less electricity is consumed. Less coal is burned. Houses remain
unbuilt. The rate of emission of greenhouse gases is thus depressed. Even
better, the government has no strategy for bringing the recession to an end.
Mr Norman Lamont is to be congratulated. As chancellor, he has consistently
fended off the resurgence that the Treasury consistently forecasts. He may
go down in history as the greenest chancellor of them all.
Mr Michael Howard is basing his political strategy on a more orthodox set of
assumptions. The environment secretary believes that the next election will
be fought during a boom. Mr John Major, the prime minister, concurs. That is
why the pair of them made such an effort to establish their green
credentials at the recent Rio earth summit. The government's aim is to
capture what it calls the moral high ground, by which is meant that it
proposes to stay one jump ahead of Labour.
Mr Howard knows how he will go about it. He has read the aspirational report
 -'This Common Inheritance' - produced by Mr Christopher Patten in 1990 and
the progress report produced by Mr Michael Heseltine last year. Neither
added up to a row of beans. What we greens demand is action. There is
promise of action, of a sort, in what the government likes to call Mr
Major's eight-point plan for following up on Rio, as adopted by the European
Community. Conventions will be ratified. National plans will be published.
Leads will be taken. There is some money in there, but most of it reads like
flim-flam to me. Nevertheless, Mr Howard will peddle the plan during the
British presidency of the EC. His sales patter may be marred by his
proclamation, spoken out of the other side of his mouth, that EC
environmental laws should be dismantled in the name of subsidiarity.
Mr Howard does not, however, rely solely on Mr Major's eight points. His
pursuit of competitive advantage over a revitalised Labour party of the
future will be more soundly based than that. He knows that there must be
government action. But what? He accepts that some substances, such as
chlorflourocarbons, have to be prohibited. Regulation is also unavoidable.
His preferred method of protecting the environment is the use of economic
instruments. The lower tax on lead-free petrol, which has worked a treat, is
one example. The use of tradeable permits, is another. Mr Howard hopes to
visit the US soon to see if marketable documents permitting a certain
quantity of pollution actually reduce it.
Such musings might ordinarily be ascribed to the dizzying effect on any
politician of discovering that he is, for the first time, head of a really
large department. Other environment secretaries have espoused economic
instruments; Mr Nicholas Ridley was temperamentally in favour of them.
Lead-free petrol apart, they got nowhere. But Mr Howard may benefit from
fortunate timing. If the Conservatives are to reduce direct taxation before
the next election they will doubtless have to increase indirect taxes to pay
for it. They may even have to raise indirect taxation merely to keep the
government in business next year. What better than an EC-inspired carbon
tax, offset by reduced corporation tax, or an extension of road use charges,
offset, perhaps, by a reduction in income tax? Such a happy blending of
economic and political instruments could prove irresistible.
The fly in the ointment is the nature of Mr Howard's department. It is a
great mess of distractions. The new minister has said that it must move away
from its present building in Westminster, probably to London's Docklands.
This has unsettled all its staff; many of them can hardly think about
anything else. Mr Howard's own immediate preoccupation is the settling-in of
the new council tax, which replaces the poll tax. A few years back all his
considerable skills of advocacy were used to argue that the latter tax was
flawless in conception, immaculate in practice, and a thing of beauty for
any philosopher to behold. No tax could match it. It was the pinnacle of
human ingenuity. Now he has to sweep up its leavings. At least that will
leave the political environment better than Mr Howard found it.

THE FUTURE of Europe, or at least of European union a la Maastricht, lies in
the hands of the French. A yes vote in the September referendum is a
necessary, though not quite sufficient, condition for the treaty to survive.
But the immediate stability of Europe's exchange rate mechanism also lies in
French hands.
No country has dedicated itself to the cause of European monetary union as
devotedly as France; and none with such success. France is the only EC
country, other than Luxembourg, that satisfies all the convergence criteria
in the Maastricht treaty. With an inflation rate below that of Germany,
France carries, at least for now, the disinflationary standard to which
lesser states aspire.
This achievement has not come cheaply. The French policy of competitive
disinflation has demanded almost a decade of modest growth and high
unemployment. But the government has compounded the pain. Too much of the
French unemployment problem, particularly among young people, arises from
deleterious government regulations and persists despite apparently
well-targeted labour market spending.
Whether France's disinflationary policies should be judged an entire success
remains in doubt. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, in its latest report on the French economy, points to large
gains in export competitiveness over the past few years as evidence that
disinflation has worked. 'It would be inappropriate,' it argues, 'to abandon
the policy of competitive disinflation when it is clearly bearing fruit.'
Nevertheless, the trade account remains in deficit; and the markets are
still not persuaded that France can sustain a lower inflation rate than
Germany. The suspicion remains that deflationary policies are necessary to
maintain both a low inflation rate and a manageable trade deficit.
Meanwhile, the discontent of sections of French society has already been
made apparent, both in the streets and at the ballot box.
France may not yet have established its credentials as a permanently
low-inflation country. But it has come far enough and sacrificed so much
that to give up now by realigning the franc against the D-Mark would be
foolish. Other member currencies cannot expect French assistance if they
wish to ease the ERM strain.
If Maastricht were to fail, however, the ERM would become a less secure
guarantor of low French inflation. French policymakers should take steps to
insure against this outcome, steps that they would have to take, in any
case, if Emu were to go ahead.
If France wants to keep a Germanic inflation rate, why not put in place a
central bank a la Bundesbank sooner rather than later? Such an independent
Banque de France could manage the franc, independent of shifts in European
or French politics. The master is a bit weaker, but by now the apprentice
has learned the trade.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Power prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST full-year results from the electricity industry have done little
to dispel the view that it was privatised not only with the wrong structure
but on the wrong terms - at least from the point of view of the consumer.
Profits are so buoyant that many regional power distributors have been able
to produce real dividend increases of 10 per cent, so contributing to the
severity of the recession. Two of them have been so embarrassed that they
decided to hand part of their profits back to customers.
One year is a short time in which to judge a complex business that still has
a lot of shaking down to do. Part of the profit surge came from a price
catch-up to which the electricity companies were entitled under their
complex pricing formula. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director general of
Offer, the industry regulator, has promised to leave the formula alone until
1994-95, because he believes that the electricity companies need that degree
of certainty to increase their efficiency.
This view has merits. But if it is already clear that the terms on which the
industry was privatised were more than just marginally too generous, it also
has serious flaws. One is that the price formula ensures that benefits
earned by the electricity companies through cost reductions flow to the
shareholders, rather than customers. Once the economy recovers, that
generous starting point is likely to ensure that profits will remain
inordinate even if electricity prices rise at less than the rate of
inflation. Another flaw is that should present trends continue the
adjustment which is bound to follow the 1995 pricing review will be so large
that the industry will have to go through another disruptive upheaval.
There are, admittedly, still big uncertainties in the market, above all the
renegotiation with the generators of supply contracts for coal prior to the
privatisation of British Coal. These contracts, which should be concluded by
the end of the summer, could have a big impact on electricity prices.
Professor Littlechild has, however, already begun to squeeze other links in
the electricity supply chain. He has warned the generators that they might
face a monopoly inquiry if they engage in predatory pricing. He has also
just imposed a tough new price formula on the National Grid Company, which
has a monopoly on the grid. Both moves were intended to address complaints
from wholesale users of electricity, such as ICI, about fast-rising
electricity prices.
Once the new coal contracts are concluded, it would make sense for the
regulator to follow the process through by imposing pressure on the regional
distributors as well, by reconsidering both the price formulae and the
threshold for outside direct supply to their customers. These are risk-free
utilities. Customers should not suffer because the initial formulae were too
generous to shareholders. Voluntary hand-outs are not a substitute.

FT  10 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Auditors not liable for losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERG SONS AND CO LTD AND OTHERS v ADAMS AND OTHERS Queen's Bench Division
(Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: June 19 1992
AUDITORS who are at fault in failing to qualify their certification of a
company's accounts for uncertainty are not liable to the company for
subsequent loss if it did not rely on the accounts and was not misled by
them in that the information contained in them was provided without intent
to defraud by the person who was in effect sole proprietor of the company
and was its directing mind and will. And certification alone gives rise to
no duty of care towards a lender who may rely on the accounts, in that their
statutory purpose is confined to protecting the company and informing
shareholders, and does not extend to other persons.
Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when dismissing claims by Berg Sons &amp; Co Ltd and
Union Discount Co (London) plc against Berg's auditors, Deardon Farrow.
HIS LORDSHIP said that on May 21 1985 an order was made for the winding up
of Berg on the petition of Union Discount, a creditor. Berg was insolvent.
It was heavily indebted to various banks and discount houses. A liquidator
was appointed.
In the present proceedings Berg alleged breaches of contractual and tortious
duties owed to it by its auditors, as a result of which it allegedly lost
some Pounds 13m.
Union Discount alleged breach of a tortious duty of care by the auditors,
and claimed in respect of the dishonour of four bills of exchange drawn by
Berg, three of them on a company called Esal Commodities Ltd.
The allegations related to an unqualified certificate signed by the auditors
for Berg's accounts for year ending March 31 1982.
The criticisms were that the accounts should have shown a turnover of only
Pounds 2.19m not Pounds 23.69m; and secondly, that bills for Pounds 2.39m
(the 'Gimco' bills) included as 'bills receivable' should have been treated
as irrecoverable.
The audit report, addressed to 'the members' of Berg, was signed on October
8 1982. The auditors' certificate stated: 'In our opinion the accounts give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs at March 31 1982.'
Berg's directing mind and will was that of a Mr Golechha who was in effect
sole proprietor. His knowledge was the company's knowledge. In addressing
their certificate to members, the auditors were for practical purposes
addressing it to Mr Golechha alone.
When the auditors received instructions to carry out the statutory audit it
was reasonably foreseeable and foreseen by them that Berg would make use of
the accounts in its dealings with bankers.
It was not foreseen, nor was it reasonably foreseeable, that the audited
accounts would be the sole information on which a bank or discount house
would rely in assessing Berg's creditworthiness. Nor was it reasonably
foreseeable that failure to qualify the certificate would cause loss or
damage to Berg.
The auditors carried out a specific investigation of the Gimco bills.
With regard to recoverability they had no more than the assurance of Gimco,
an Abu Dhabi entity, that the bills would be honoured 'within three to four
months or earlier when able' and an unsupported statement by Mr Golechha
that he believed Gimco would pay. They had effectively no verification of
recoverability.
The auditors should have said 'bills receivable include bills . . . payable
by an overseas debtor the creditworthiness of whom it has not been possible
to verify', and 'subject to satisfactory recovery of the monies, in our
opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view'.
Had the auditors refused to sign an unqualified certificate, on the evidence
the possibility was that the effect on Berg's affairs would have been
insignificant. Mr Golechha's business activities depended very much on his
own personality, his personal relations with the relevant bank managers, and
the banks' assessment of his business standing.
The accounts were not critical. They did not provide any basis for extending
substantial credit to Berg.
The reasons for Berg's ultimate failure was Esal's failure and Berg's
unsuccessful commodity dealing in the year ending March 1984. The cause of
Union Discount's failure to recover on the bills was Esal's and Berg's
failure.
In Caparo (1990) 2 AC 630,632 Lord Oliver said the auditor's function was to
protect the company from the consequences of undetected errors or
wrongdoing, and to provide shareholders with reliable intelligence as to the
conduct of its affairs.
The decision was that it was not part of the purpose of a statutory audit to
assist even shareholders to take investment decisions in relation to the
company.
It followed from the decision on the restricted purpose of the statutory
audit that there was also a restriction on the scope of the duty of care
that arose simply from carrying it out. The duty was owed to the company
itself, normally in contract.
The duty, although owed to other persons falling within the scope of the
statutory purpose, was in effect equivalent to the duty owed to the company
itself. Union Discount did not fall within the relevant class of persons.
The purpose of the statutory audit was to provide a mechanism to enable
those with a proprietary interest in the company or concerned with its
management or control to have access to accurate financial information about
the company.
Provided those persons had that information, the statutory purpose was
exhausted.
Berg had based its case not on lack of information on Mr Golechha's part but
on the opportunity the auditor's certificate was said to have given for the
company to continue to carry on business and to borrow money from third
parties.
Such matters did not fall within the scope of the duty of the statutory
auditor.
Berg sought to argue that the fact that Mr Golechha was fully informed and
in no way misled by the certificate was irrelevant since he was, it said,
acting contrary to Berg's interests, and his knowledge should not be
attributed to the company.
However one identified the company, every physical manifestation of Berg was
Mr Golechha himself. Any company, if it was to allege it was fraudulently
misled, must be able to point to some natural person who was misled by the
fraud. That Berg could not do.
It was alleged by Union Discount that a duty of care was owed to it by the
auditors when they certified the audit. It said they knew it was extending
credit to Berg, and it was foreseeable that it would be sent copies of the
accounts and would rely on them in deciding whether to continue to extend
credit.
Union Discount did not prove that the purpose of the audit was other than to
satisfy the statutory requirements.
In Al Saudi Banque (1991) Ch 313 Mr Justice Millett held that foreseeability
that a lender might rely on audited accounts was not, without more, enough
to establish the duty of care. His decision was approved by the House of
Lords in Caparo.
Caparo showed there must be a specific relationship between the function
which the defendant was requested to perform, and the transaction in
relation to which the plaintiff said he had relied on proper performance.
The transactions by which Union Discount alleged it suffered loss were
remote from certification of the accounts. It could not establish the
existence of any duty of care owed to it in relation to the audit.
Berg's claim failed because the company was not misled and did not rely on
the certificate, and because the facts did not raise a situation where Mr
Golechha was acting in fraud of the company or its creditors. Union
Discount's claim failed because it had failed to establish any duty of care.
Both claims also failed for want of proof of causation.
For Berg and Union Discount: Stanley Burnton QC and Thomas Ivory (Hopkins,
Wood).
For the auditors: Roger Toulson QC and Charles Douthwaite (Reynolds Porter
Chamberlain).

FT  10 JUL 92 / People: First head of environment for British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition is not the only challenge British Gas, the former UK monopoly
gas supplier, faces in the next few years. It also has to confront
increasingly tough environmental standards.
Leading the charge will be Patrick Weatherilt (left), recently appointed by
British Gas to the new post of head of environment. The job has been
developed to ensure that British Gas's environmental policies and practices
are 'at least equal to those of the best companies'.
This is the first time there has been a manager with overall responsibility
for environmental matters at corporate services level. Weatherilt will
report to Mike Arnold, group director of safety and environment.
Weatherilt joined the company in 1974 and was involved in developing the
national transmission system before becoming chief environmental planning
officer.
In 1991 he joined health and safety to manage the huge environmental audit
BG is conducting at 4,000 installations around the world, designed to ensure
that standards are met wherever the company operates.
He will keep responsibility for that project, and is also charged with
ensuring that standards of environmental management are consistent
throughout the different arms of the company - UK marketing, exploration and
production, and global gas.
A third role will be monitoring national and international environmental
legislation.

Scientists have known for many years that specific parts of the human brain
are used for performing different types of thinking, but pin-pointing and
mapping these areas has proved difficult.
Now a team of researchers from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and the University of
Minnesota Medical School has developed a new non-invasive technique which
enables them to safely and accurately 'see' the human brain working in a
normal conscious person.
The scanning technique, called Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (Bold) imaging,
detects increases in oxygenated blood flow to active areas of the brain.
Unlike the standard images of different types of brain tissue produced by
conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the new method provides colour
images showing the precise locations of increased neuron activity.
'Our method adds an entirely new dimension to MRI images of the brain,
allowing us not just to see the brain, but to see it working,' said Bell
Laboratories biophysicist Seiji Ogawa. 'By imaging the brain in this way, we
can map the specific sites of certain mental activity.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / Technology: IBM widens legal battle - 'Altered memory' is at
the heart of the dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somewhere in Europe, earlier this year, microchips in the main memory of an
IBM mainframe computer overheated, burning a hole the size of a centime in
the printed circuit board on which they were mounted.
Investigation of the resulting machine failure has given IBM a reason to
widen to Europe a campaign of litigation it has been pursuing against
computer leasing and engineering companies in the US.
Computer leasing practices differ substantially in the US and Europe but
IBM's essential allegations against the leasing industry are that:
Its computers and components have been appropriated without its knowledge or
permission.
Vital parts of IBM systems have been counterfeited and passed off as
genuine.
Shoddy workmanship on the part of some engineering companies has led to
systems failures; memory chips have been soldered to printed circuit boards
for which they are inappropriate, resulting in overheating.
The latter two complaints constitute what has become known as the 'altered
memory' issue.
Companies it is suing in the US include Comdisco, the world's largest
computer leasing company which has annual revenues of over Dollars 2bn.
Comdisco rejects the charges fiercely and has spent millions of dollars in
its defence. In Europe, the first overt sign of IBM's campaign has been the
beginning of proceedings against Phoenix International, a Surrey-based
computer brokerage and subsidiary of Phoenix Computer Associates of the US.
Phoenix has since complained to the European Commission.
The issue of 'altered memory' has become a cause celebre in Europe,
provoking cries of outrage from the local leasing community. IBM is now at
loggerheads with the European Computer Leasing Association (Eclat), the
80-member strong trade body. Its director general, Geoffrey Sewell, said
this week that after many meetings he is disappointed that it has so far
proved impossible to resolve the issue: 'In my opinion, if the use of this
sort of litigation were to escalate, we could be heading in Europe for what
I believe is happening in the US; the use of litigation as a business tool
to slow down competition. At the end of the day, it will be the user who
pays'.
The dispute over altered memory, however, is confusing a more fundamental
argument: the question of who will control the market for second hand IBM
computers - a market worth some Dollars 10bn in Europe alone.
The leasing companies believe that IBM, desperate to improve market share
and revenues, wants to drive them out of the business and, as part of this
strategy, is creating doubt among customers about the integrity of second
hand systems.
IBM totally rejects this interpretation, arguing its only concern is to
protect its reputation and its customers. Nick Temple, IBM (UK) chief
executive says: 'Generating anxiety among customers is not the thing to do.
Our objective is to stop the counterfeiters and restore confidence in
genuine parts'.
IBM computers predominate in the world's data centres. Its mainframes,
costing Dollars 1m upwards are 'big ticket' items, such as jumbo jets and
merchant ships and, as such, support a healthy second hand market. The price
and resale value of a second hand system can be predicted with reasonable
certainty over its entire life. This is the basis of leasing industry
economics.
IBM has its own leasing company, IBM Credit Corporation, dealing in new and
second hand machinery but the third party leasing industry is concerned
almost entirely with used equipment. To meet its customers' requirements it
has to reconfigure and reassemble mainframes and memory, using components
from a variety of sources. To hold their book value, all these components
must qualify for IBM maintenance.
A healthy second user market provides customers with three advantages Eclat
says: First, the option to buy IBM equipment from a source other than IBM.
Second, the opportunity to sell surplus equipment at a fair market price.
Third, it forces competition between new and used equipment, which keeps IBM
on its toes technologically.
The European dispute turns around altered memory. In February IBM warned
that IBM memory cards altered by independent engineering companies using IBM
chips would no longer be covered by IBM maintenance agreements. If a machine
failed as a consequence of problems with an altered memory board, the
customer would be charged for time and materials.
Memory boards are expensive - between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 200,000
each. Computing time while a machine is out of action for inspection is also
expensive.
The leasing industry argument is that reconfiguration is essential to their
operations and that IBM has not, in the past, objected either to the
reconfiguration process or to maintaining reconfigured machines once they
had passed initial inspection. (There is an important semantic point here;
reconfiguration refers to putting together systems in different ways and is
quite legitimate; IBM is objecting to the creation of memory boards from
chips unsoldered from existing units.)
The leasing industry believes that IBM is attempting to spread fear and
uncertainty among users to encourage them to go only to IBM for new and
second hand equipment. Joseph Kafka, head of Comdisco in the UK says: 'I
feel IBM has won the short term battle; it has scared the users'. The
leasing industry, itself, has to some extent played into IBM's hands. A high
risk, high profit business, it has had its share of problems. The case of
Atlantic Computers, which contributed to the collapse of British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings, illustrated this.
Altered memory is another example. There are, no doubt, some engineering
companies cannibalising memory, sticking IBM labels on non-IBM parts and
soldering slow memory on to boards where only high-speed chips should be
used.
IBM has every right to seek to outlaw such practices and reputable leasing
companies are in agreement. Kafka says: 'At Comdisco we have never altered
any form of memory nor do we have the capability of doing so'.
Sewell says: 'Eclat does not support the use of memory modules which do not
conform to IBM's design specification or where workmanship is not of an
acceptable standard'. But he argues that the leasing companies have the
right to reconfigure machines and that IBM is wrong, retrospectively, to
decide not to maintain altered memory cards. IBM's offering is an inspection
and replacement service, the cost of which must be borne by the customer.
Temple of IBM says: 'I am not going to subsidise a whole industry'.
Eclat, on the other hand, is arguing for a moratorium on maintenance on all
memory installed on large IBM mainframes in Europe prior to February 1992.
It also wants better identification methods to make it easier to recognise
altered memory. Even IBM cannot always tell altered from original boards,
Eclat says, an argument the manufacturer hotly disputes.
The arguments seem finely balanced; on one side, IBM protecting its name for
quality; on the other, the leasing industry its right to meet its customers'
requirements under the umbrella of a dominant manufacturer.
Inevitably, the leasing industry harbours suspicions about IBM's motives. It
says the altered memory issue has given it a fortuitous stick to beat its
leasing company competitors, especially Comdisco.
Some argue that to enjoin a rival in a legal battle discourages potential
predators. Is the dispute really IBM's way of warning off Fujitsu, the
Japanese company which is resolved to overtake IBM as the world's largest
computer manufacturer, from making a bid for a US leasing company? Whatever
the truth, the battle seems likely to cost the leasing industry and its
customers dear.

London's financial services companies are the next target for personal
computer software companies battling against the unauthorised copying of
software.
Mr Bradford Smith, European counsel for the Business Software Association,
which represents leading software companies including Adobe, Apple Computer,
Lotus and Microsoft, said yesterday that investigators were now ready to go
to court to seek inspection orders against a number of City firms.
He was speaking after the BSA claimed success in its latest skirmish against
software piracy. BSA investigators late last week raided the offices of
Tatung (UK) and inspected software running on 100 of the company's personal
computers.
Tatung (UK), is a subsidiary of Tatung Company, a Taiwanese manufacturer and
distributor of electronic consumer goods including computer hardware and
household appliances.
It is the first time that the BSA and its associate the Federation Against
Software Theft (Fast) have taken action against a computer hardware
manufacturer.
Earlier actions in the UK have been taken against Mirror Group Newspapers
and the London Borough of Greenwich. Both were settled out of court.
Tatung said this week that procedures to ensure observance of software
copyright had failed: 'We are erasing all unlicensed copies and we are
purchasing legitimate replacement software.
'We have compensated the software publishers for loss of licence fees and
costs'.
Mr Smith's announcement that finance houses are the next BSA target is an
indication of the group's determination to leave no commercial sector
untouched in its efforts to stamp out software piracy, reckoned
conservatively to be costing software publishers Pounds 300m a year.
Typically, the BSA and Fast act on information that pirated software is in
use; they secure a court order to enter a suspected pirate's premises in
search of unauthorised copies.
They have always emphasised that they are more interested in persuading
companies to use software that complies with the law than in dragging
suspects through the courts.

FT  10 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Estate crowns a difficult year - The
Crown Estate combines age old tradition with effective portfolio management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's most powerful and idiosyncratic landowner published its figures
this week for the year to March, the annus horribilis of the property
industry.
The Crown Estate, which includes Regent Street, large parts of St James's,
both in London, and half the foreshore of the UK, saw its capital value fall
by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.77bn, following a 12.8 per cent fall the previous
year. Its revenue surplus, by contrast, powered ahead with a 12.2 per cent
rise to Pounds 71.7m.
It was a respectable performance, given that nearly half the Crown Estate's
property is in the hard-hit markets of the City and the west end of London.
Revenue increase was greater than for most other property owners, although
the estate warned that growth this year would not be substantial. Damage to
the Crown Estate's balance-sheet was limited by the absence of borrowings
and a sagacious decision to stop developments in 1989 when the property
recession started to loom on the horizon.
Yet a more important factor behind the Crown Estate's resilient performance
is the energy and commitment of its managers. That, at any rate, is the
opinion of Mr Christopher Howes, the Second Commissioner (chief executive),
who thinks the organisation is incorrectly perceived as sleepy and
bureaucratic.
'When people talk about the Crown Estate being on the edge of the public
sector, they imagine it works from 9am to 4.30pm. Nothing could be further
from the truth,' he says.
But for all the Crown Estate's apparent competence and efficiency, its image
remains tainted by its anomalous constitutional position and the historic
origins of its portfolio. Much of the portfolio dates back to before the
days of William the Conqueror, more than 900 years ago. At that time, the
estate encompassed about a third of the country, most of which has since
been sold or given away.
The Crown Estate is neither the property of the government nor the private
property of the reigning monarch. Since the time of King George III, the
estate's profits have been surrendered to parliament in return for the civil
list (a form of salary for the royal family). The board of commissioners,
the Crown Estate's ruling body, is appointed by the sovereign but is
answerable to the chancellor of the exchequer.
This curious combination of public accountability and centuries old
tradition lends an unusual character to the workings of the Crown Estate.
Its annual report would resemble that of any property company were it not
for a declaration at the beginning: 'To the Queen's most excellent majesty
may it please your majesty . . . '
Occasionally, ancient rights and obligations have a faintly anachronistic
ring about them. Recently, for instance, the Crown Estate objected when the
franchise for the ferry service between Tilbury and Gravesend in south-east
London was transferred without its permission, because it was a breach of
the sovereign's 'ancient rights to run a ferry' which dates back to the time
when there was a fort at Tilbury.
Likewise, in May, the Crown lost a legal wrangle that had been started by
James I against the City of London Corporation, over land at Smithfield
market in London. The case rested on the transfer of land to the City under
a charter granted by Henry VI in 1444.
Some aspects of the Crown Estate's privileged position are coming under
scrutiny. The government is shortly to issue a consultation paper that will
make all Crown organisations subject to the same statutory planning powers
as other developers and landowners. Since the estate has voluntarily
subjected itself to the planning process since the 1970s, this move is
welcomed by the commissioners.
A measure that is viewed with less equanimity by the Crown Estate is the
government's proposals to enfranchise leaseholders. Allowing leaseholders to
buy their freehold would mean the break-up of the Crown Estate's residential
holdings, including the elegant Nash terraces of Regent's Park.
'The government's proposals regarding enfranchisement may seriously erode
our objective to preserve the unique architectural heritage of the Crown
Estate for future generations,' says the Earl of Mansfield, the First Crown
Estate commissioner (chairman of the board). It is still unclear, however,
whether the Crown Estate would be asked to comply with the new legislation.
When similar measures affecting relatively inexpensive houses were
introduced in 1967, the Crown Estate was exempt. It hopes for a similar
outcome this time round. 'We shall make the appropriate representations at
the proper time,' says the Earl of Mansfield.
The Crown Estate's exemption from leasehold enfranchisement would irritate
many of its tenants, who are often critical of their landlord. The heavy
obligations to maintain the appearance of the stuccoed facades of the
Regent's Park estate and the sharp increases in rents when leases are
renewed is a source of continued complaint.
The high degree of public interest in the Crown Estate means that any
disagreement with tenants is likely to attract media attention. But the
commissioners are adamant that they cannot be seen as a soft touch, as this
would be unfair to other tenants.
Mr Howes sees the task of the Crown Estate as a fine balancing act between
extracting the best possible returns from the property and pursuing broader
objectives.
'We can be tough negotiators and managers of buildings. We are entrusted to
manage something that is rather precious,' he says.
For example, the Crown Estate has long contained an element of low-cost
housing in London. And in March it issued a statement about its
environmental objectives called 'Stewardship in Action', designed to
'balance environmental, commercial and social needs in the management of the
estate'.
At the same time, the Crown Estate's financial practices have been receiving
increased attention. Traditionally, the organisation has been difficult to
pin down about its financial performance and, in particular, the value of
its estates. For years, it argued that valuations were inappropriate and
unnecessary for a portfolio which included properties such as Windsor Great
Park.
That policy changed in 1987, the first year the Crown Estate published a
valuation of its assets. Since then, its financial performance has come
under even tighter scrutiny, partly as a result of pressure from the
National Audit Office (NAO), a watchdog which examines the financial
performance of public bodies. In 1988 the NAO concluded that the absence of
financial targets was the chief weakness in the Crown Estate's attempt to
bring its financial management up to date. Now, Mr Howes jokes, the estate
is monitored most closely than a cardiologist's examination room.
This year, the organisation's performance against targets of the portfolio's
value has been disappointing. However, this may partly be the fault of the
target-setters, who made their forecasts a year ago when few chartered
surveyors expected the depression in the market to be as severe as it has
been.
The portfolio's performance is not helped by some underlet business parks in
St Albans and Cambridge. And a shopping centre in Worcester, jointly
developed by the Crown Estate and which opens in the autumn, is an
embarrassment because the co-developer, Ford Sellar Morris, went into
receivership in the summer of 1991.
But, compared to most institutions and property companies, the Crown Estate
has enviably few problematic developments. That is helping the estate to
come through this property recession in better shape than many of its less
idiosyncratic rivals.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MP takes early attacks
personally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of parliamentary early-day motions to broadcast personal attacks on
public figures without risk of being sued for libel has come under question
at Westminster - through the vehicle of . . . an early-day motion.
Mr Richard Shepherd, the Conservative MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, has used
the facility to express regret at his colleagues' tabling of motions 'for
the purposes of disseminating defamation'.
Like all proceedings in the Commons, early-day motions - and reports of
their content - are covered by parliamentary privilege, protecting their
authors from libel proceedings, to which they could be subject if they
repeated their assertions outside the House. However, early-day motions are
very seldom debated in the Commons chamber.
Mr Shepherd has linked his remarks to a motion tabled by Mr Rhodri Morgan,
the Labour MP, relating to the affairs of Mr John Birt, BBC director-general
designate, and Mr David Frost, the television interviewer.
That, though, is just one of several motions containing pointedly personal
allegations to have been tabled in recent months.
Targets have included Mr Peter Walker, the former Tory cabinet minister, and
senior figures in the Lloyd's of London insurance market. The number and
also the aggressiveness of such attacks has placed a question mark over the
legitimacy of the procedure.
Mr Shepherd and Mr Morgan are equally adamant that their actions are
justified.
According to Mr Shepherd, the use of early-day motions in this way 'denies
the ordinary citizen the right to defend themselves properly'.
'Our restrictions on press reporting are very severe in some ways but this
is now being used as a process for putting out any old junk.'
Mr Morgan argues that MPs are under oath to tell the truth in the same way
as witnesses in court but that Britain's libel laws mean individuals 'cannot
afford to fight' court cases even if they think they will win them.
The late Robert Maxwell was 'able to get a non-investigative coverage of his
affairs by scattering writs like confetti', he says. 'The rich and powerful
have one last thing to fear: that is what MPs say in the House of Commons.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / Dentists' fees to be studied quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday tried to head off threatened disruptive action by
dentists, Alan Pike writes. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
announced a review of dental remuneration that would report by the end of
the year.
She urged dentists to 'think long and hard before taking any action that
would damage patients or jeopardise the improvements in dental health
achieved in recent years.'
Dentists this week voted in favour of partial withdrawal from National
Health Service treatment after the government reduced their fees by 7 per
cent.
Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, former head of the Civil Service in Northern
Ireland, is to review the pay system, and Mrs Bottomley emphasised that he
had been asked to report to ministers by the end of the year.
The review will be overseen by Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister. He said
the British Dental Association had told the government it believed the
review must have an element of independence, and ministers had responded by
appointing Sir Kenneth.
The government imposed the 7 per cent fees cut from this month on the ground
that the profession's earnings have exceeded review body recommendations.
Association members responded by voting to stop accepting new NHS patients.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Study guages competitiveness of accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the UK's sixth-largest accountants by fee income, and Price
Waterhouse, the third-largest, were the top firms for profitability and
growth last year, according to an analysis by Datamonitor, the consultancy
firm.
The examination of market positioning is radically different from rankings
by fee income, and elevates several medium-sized firms to high positions.
The analysis takes into account the diversification of the different
business services provided by the firms and the profits, growth rates and
volatility of those services.
Management consultancy and tax are rated the highest business sectors for
growth and profitability, followed by insolvency. Audit and accounting work
is rated the lowest.
Rankings by competitive performance - which considers staff numbers, listed
clients, fees per professional and staff per partner - reflect rankings by
fee income more closely.
The survey suggests there may be tensions in creating multidisciplinary
partnerships in combination with lawyers, because fees per partner are so
much higher in solicitors' firms.
In a ranking of the firms, Arthur Andersen - which is in third place - is
the only accountancy firm in the top 10 measured by fees per partner. There
are six accountants among the top 20, while most come at the lower end of
the table.
Arthur Andersen is the most diversified accountancy firm, with 76 per cent
of its income derived from non-audit fees in 1992. A number of the
medium-sized firms are also highly diversified, however, with Grant
Thornton, Robson Rhodes and Levy Gee ranking next, before Price Waterhouse
at 61 per cent.
The analysis also shows the substantial fall in graduate intake among the
firms during the period 1990-91. New hirings fell the most at Robson Rhodes,
where they were down by 45 per cent.
Large falls were also reported by Pannell Kerr Forster, followed by BDO
Binder Hamlyn, Stoy Hayward, Price Waterhouse, Kidsons Impey, MacIntyre
Hudson and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which declined by 10 per cent. Only Touche
Ross increased its recruitment during the period, up by 13 per cent.

FT  10 JUL 92 / World Trade News: S Korea urged to liberalise trade policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea owes much of its remarkable economic success over the past 30
years to the open world trading system. It should therefore now reciprocate
with further trade liberalisation, some of its trading partners told Gatt's
governing council yesterday.
The council discussed a report on South Korea's trade policies by the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) which pointed out that it was
now the world's fifth biggest trader (counting the European Community as
one). Since 1962, gross domestic product (GDP) had grown at an average 9 per
cent a year, transforming South Korea from a poor agrarian country to a
nascent industrialised economy.
The report said South Korea's success had been based on an outward-oriented,
high investment strategy, supported by continuous access to foreign markets.
But South Korea now had a responsibility to promote the successful
functioning of the multilateral trading system, by reducing high trade
barriers in several areas, notably agriculture.
The report said Korea had made considerable strides in liberalising trade,
especially in manufacturing. Average tariffs had fallen from almost 24 per
cent in 1982 to 10 per cent today. But 'further market opening on a secure
multilateral basis by Korea, which has become a significant trading partner
for many countries, would also facilitate the continuation of its own
successful growth performance', the report said.
High agricultural tariffs, a de facto ban on imports of rice and barley, and
expensive domestic price support schemes cost Korea about 7 per cent of GDP
in 1990, Gatt estimated, almost equivalent to the sector's contribution to
the national income. This had led to a lopsided incentive structure which
was now impairing industrial competitiveness, the report warned. The economy
was showing signs of overheating and resource constraints, with current
account deficits recorded in 1990 and 1991.
South Korea has been attacked by trading partners in the current round of
global trade negotiations for refusing to consider opening its rice market.
Mr Park Soo Gil, Seoul's ambassador to Gatt, told the Gatt council that
liberalisation of the rice market raised 'serious social, economic and
political concerns related to food security and to the family-based
structure of Korean agriculture'.
The report also pinpointed South Korea's tendency to prefer managed trade
arrangements. About 20 per cent of South Korean exports were covered by
selective restraints, some negotiated bilaterally, some resulting from
anti-dumping measures in importing countries but some imposed unilaterally
by South Korea in an attempt to head off action by trading partners.

ARGENTINA and Uruguay are calling a conference in the next two months in an

Potential investors and participants in the project are being invited to
advise the two governments on drawing up detailed bidding terms.
The bridge, estimated at this stage to cost Dollars 400m - Dollars 800m,
would be the region's largest privately-financed construction project. It
would link Buenos Aires with Colonia in Uruguay and would take two or three
years to build.
An Argentine government official said: 'We do not have experience in this
kind of thing, so we want to talk it over first with all those interested -
bankers, lawyers, construction companies, engineers, architects.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY Democrats on the US House Judiciary Committee yesterday asked for the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate whether Bush
administration officials lied to Congress about US dealings with Iraq before
the Gulf War, AP reports from Washington.
Democratic committee chairman Jack Brooks announced the move after a caucus
of the panel's Democrats generated enough support to trigger the request to
attorney general William Barr.
The evidence 'makes it clear that the attorney general needs to appoint an
independent counsel' to investigate possible criminal violations in US
assistance to Iraq, attempts to conceal information from Congress and
interference with prosecution of an Atlanta bank, BNL, that made loans to
Iraq, Mr Brooks said.
An investigation could be loaded with election-year significance, focusing
attention on Mr Bush's efforts to use US loan guarantees and other rewards
to moderate Baghdad's behaviour - a policy the administration now admits was
a failure.
There is growing evidence that the taxpayer-financed benefits for Iraq, far
from encouraging moderation, helped President Saddam Hussein build up
military forces and further Iraqi missile and nuclear weapons development -
and that some people in the administration knew it.
Under the law the attorney general has 90 days, with a possible 60-day
extension, to decide whether there is enough evidence to seek appointment of
an independent counsel.
Democrats said they believed Mr Barr was unlikely to decline the request,
because such a move could prompt charges of a cover-up.
The committee wants the independent investigator to examine inconsistencies
in congressional testimony by administration officials on US policy toward
Iraq before Mr Saddam's invasion of Kuwait.

FT  10 JUL 92 / ANC rejects de Klerk's call for resumed talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, African National Congress leader, last night angrily
rejected President F W de Klerk's call for a resumption of constitutional
negotiations and said a campaign of mass action against the government would
go ahead.
In the latest of a series of accusations and counter-accusations between the
two men, Mr Mandela said 'the path of negotiations to bring about democracy
is deadlocked'.
'The essence of the crisis,' he told a press conference in Johannesburg last
night, 'is that the ruling National Party keeps looking for ways to exercise
power even if it loses a democratic election.'
The often bitter and ill-tempered exchange triggered off by last month's
massacre of 42 residents of the black township of Boipatong has not only
confirmed the wide division between the ANC's demand for a constitution
based on majority rule and Mr de Klerk's concept of power-sharing.
It has also poisoned the political climate and destroyed much, if not all,
of the trust and goodwill that once existed between the two leaders.
Unless international efforts to break the deadlock succeed, it now seems
inevitable that August 3, the date on which a general strike is scheduled to
begin, together with other forms of 'mass action', will mark the start of a
dangerous confrontation between the ANC and government.
Although Mr Mandela last night called on all South Africans to 'ensure that
the mass campaign for democracy is peaceful and disciplined', most observers
believe that outbreaks of violence in the current highly charged atmosphere
are almost inevitable.
In a 24-page memorandum to Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela said that although there
was agreement that South Africa faced a 'serious crisis', when it came to
charting a way out of the crisis 'it is clear that there are hardly any
points of convergence'.
Going on to reiterate the ANC belief that the government's objective is to
secure a minority-party veto in a post-apartheid constitution, and renewing
allegations of government complicity in the violence, Mr Mandela said: 'To
call for face-to-face talks in such a situation is entirely unacceptable.'

FT  10 JUL 92 / Australia confronts jobs crisis: Record unemployment is
forcing a change in Labor government policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate rose to 11.1 per cent in June, the highest
ever recorded by the government statistics bureau. The figure exceeds the
most pessimistic market estimate and has forced a quick policy shift for the
governing Labor party.
Barely an hour after the figures were made public, a sombre Mr John Dawkins,
the federal treasurer, announced that the government would look at fiscal
measures to help the unemployed get jobs.
Over the past five years the government has focused its economic policy on
keeping a tight rein on spending. It has dealt with the recession and
unemployment largely through easing interest rates. Last Wednesday, the
official interest rate was cut from 6.5 per cent to 5.75 per cent, the 13th
cut since it peaked at 18 per cent in January 1990.
But the government has now acknowledged that easing monetary policy has done
little to stimulate the flagging economy. On Wednesday, Mr Dawkins urged
Australians to spend the savings they would get from the interest rate cut.
Economic pump priming was only tentatively embraced by the government
earlier this year with an ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 890m) spending programme
designed to create 800,000 jobs and reduce unemployment below 10 per cent by
mid-1993 when it faces a general election.
The full effect of the programme has yet to be seen but Mr Dawkins has
foreshadowed huge spending measures in the 1992-93 budget to be introduced
next month. He said yesterday the fiscal measures would be directed towards
training, local infrastructure and help for industries in developing
exports. There would also be special aid for regions with acute unemployment
levels.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent in June
represents 963,500 Australians unemployed. Worst affected were males between
15 and 19 years old, 31.8 per cent of whom were unemployed. Total male
unemployment was 11.7 per cent.
The climb in unemployment, which has been above the psychological barrier of
10 per cent for the past 10 months, had been helped along by severe job cuts
in the services sector recently.
While the manufacturing sector has been shedding jobs since the earlier days
of the recession, some of the country's large banks, insurance companies,
airlines and telecommunications companies have now started laying off
workers in their tens of thousands. Big cuts have been announced by ANZ
Bank, Qantas Airlines and the Australian Overseas Telecommunications
Corporation.
The effects of unemployment have also been felt in the government's budget
for the last financial year. The preliminary deficit for 1991-92 was
ADollars 9.4bn, double the initial estimate of ADollars 4.7bn. The
government attributed the surge to the heavy fall in revenues caused by
lower income and business tax revenues. On the other hand, the ADollars
1.2bn rise in outlays went mainly to higher social security payments.
Now committed to kick-start the economy, the Labor government turns its back
on the low deficit era it has carefully nursed. It also now faces the risk
of losing the low inflation period which had given it the room to cut
interest rates.
The bad run of economic news this week has also prompted the government to
revise down its growth target from 4.75 per cent to 3 per cent in 1992-93.
The new gross domestic product target is in line with the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development forecast in May.
The irony of the policy change is that Mr Paul Keating, a federal treasurer
in the mid-1980s, led the country along the path of tight fiscal policy. Now
as prime minister, he seems to accept that the policy has given him low
inflation and manageable current accounts, but not necessarily a clear way
out of the 'banana republic' economy he then warned about.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Storm clouds over S Africa: Growing fear and suspicion in a
divided society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE the smell of damp earth that warns of approaching rains, yesterday's
news from around South Africa carried the whiff of stormy political weather
ahead.
No single item was especially remarkable - not for a society used to
violence and tension. But taken against a background of stalemate in
constitutional negotiations, vituperative exchanges between leading
political figures and a looming campaign of strikes and civil disobedience,
they seem portents of what may be to come.
'A policeman was shot dead in Kathlehong on the east Rand', the South
African Press Association (Sapa) reported. The day before, said Sapa, men
armed with AK47 rifles shot dead one policeman and fatally wounded another.
'Strangers of all races are warned to stay away from the violence-torn
township of Sebokeng, near Vereeniging', said Sapa. Unruly youths had set up
roadblocks and were committing 'acts of lawlessness', according to a police
spokesman.
In the nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana, 'about 10,000
workers at Impala Platinum Bafokend South mine did not turn up for work on
Thursday morning,' reported Sapa. A mine official said the stayaway 'would
appear to be related to management action taken to prevent an unauthorised
mass meeting' the day before.
From Port Elizabeth came reports of a statement from the management of the
Toyota car plant, which earlier this week dismissed 6,000 striking workers.
'If the union does not present firm and reasonable proposals for the
re-employment of dismissed workers by 1600 hours Friday 10 July, Toyota will
commence the re-manning of its production facilities on a permanent basis'.
In a Johannesburg report, Sapa quotes Mr Jay Naidoo, general secretary of
the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and key organiser of the
planned August 3 general strike as saying: 'Unless every aspect of society
acts decisively to break the logjam, we are going to drift into total
anarchy, and possibly even civil war.'
From Durban there is news of further killings in Murchison township, south
of the port - at least four people dead, bringing the unofficial tally to 20
so far this month. 'The latest violence comes after scores of ANC supporters
who fled the violence in Murchison over the past two years returned home',
says Sapa.
'Seventy-six violent deaths in South Africa were recorded by the Human
Rights Commission in the first week of July,' another bulletin began
yesterday, 'up on the 43 deaths of the previous week'. The death toll was
higher in Natal than in the Johannesburg region.
Let the last item in this far from complete list come from Cape Town: the
Goldstone Commission, the judicial inquiry into political violence, warns
that South African society is 'dangerously divided by suspicion and fear'.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Amnesty extends its area of interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMNESTY International, the human rights organisation, will concern itself
with arbitrary killings and hostage-taking committed by armed opposition
groups, such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Northern Ireland, as well
as with abuses by governments, according to the group's annual report
published yesterday.
The policy shift results from an expansion of Amnesty's traditional remit of
campaigning for prisoners of conscience, decided at its biennial
international council meeting, held in Yokohama last September. Other new
areas of work include the defence of 'selective' conscientious objectors,
such as soldiers imprisoned in the US and UK for refusing to serve in the
Gulf war.
In the past governments criticised by Amnesty have often retorted that it
does not apply the same standards to their opponents. As the report says,
states often 'seek to justify violations of fundamental human rights by
their own forces by referring to atrocities committed by their opponents, as
if this helped any of the victims'. The new policy clearly aims to pre-empt
that response. Its object, the report says, is to influence opposition
groups on behalf of victims, and so 'to protect individuals in the face of
abuses by armed political groups when governments fail to do so'.
Killings and hostage-taking by such groups occurred in most regions of the
world in 1991, the year covered by the report, which refers to many of them,
although it does not yet reflect the full range of the new policy. In
particular it mentions the bombing by the IRA of the military wing of a
hospital in November 1991, which killed two soldiers and wounded 10, as well
as killings by Protestant paramilitary groups, the Basque separatist
organisation ETA in Spain, the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK) in Turkey,
Kurdish opposition forces in Iraq, armed militias in Lebanon, and
Palestinians in Israel-occupied territories.
The report opens with the observation that 'the abuse of power continues
unabated', referring to the torture, killings, 'disappearances', arbitrary
detention and other gross human rights violations which it describes in no
less than 142 countries.
Amnesty, the report explains, takes no position on sentences to be passed on
those convicted of human rights crimes (except that it opposes the death
penalty in all circumstances). Nor does it oppose pardons after conviction,
in the interests of national reconciliation. But it believes that thorough
investigations are vital, to determine individual and collective
responsibility and provide the victims with a full account of the truth;
that those responsible must be brought to justice, and their trials
concluded with a clear verdict of guilt or innocence; and that amnesty laws
which prevent the emergence of the truth and accountability before the law
are not acceptable.
The report does contain some heartening news, particularly from central and
eastern Europe where in 1989 Amnesty had no members, only 'a few, scattered,
courageous subscribers to its newsletter', themselves subject to official
harassment. By the beginning of this year it had more than 1,500
international members in that region, receiving information and writing
letters on behalf of prisoners in other countries.

EUROPE'S leading consumer group and a former European commissioner yesterday
warned that over-zealous attempts to assert the principle of subsidiarity
might undermine the benefits of the single market.
Mr Peter Sutherland, a former competition commissioner now chairing a
committee on the single market, said yesterday that the EC should not
compromise the 1992 objectives for fear of treading on its member states'
toes.
'I'm extremely dubious about having exceptions to the single market, because
I think they would be abused,' he said. Following the Danish vote against
the Maastricht treaty, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has said it
might be preferable to settle for an incomplete single market, rather than a
perfect market which might be rejected by EC citizens. Mr Sutherland said:
'I think generalisations like that are extremely dangerous.'
The European Consumers' Union identifies a number of existing and potential
problems, including omissions and exceptions to the market.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Rome fears new influx of Albanian refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday was on the alert for a fresh wave of
refugees seeking to enter the country by boat following an abortive attempt
by a group of 108 Albanians who reached the southern port of Brindisi on
Wednesday.
This group was forcibly repatriated on a special Alitalia aircraft chartered
by the Interior Ministry yesterday. It was the largest single exodus from
Albania since last August when some 26,000 sought to enter Italy on an
ageing freighter. This latest batch of asylum seekers had apparently
commandeered a naval craft in the Albanian port of Sarseno and forced it to
sea with some of its crew. Those seeking to escape Albania included members
of the military as well as women and children.
The vessel was spotted by Italian naval patrols before it reached Italian
waters. However, procedures established by the Italian navy and air force to
turn back vessels failed because the naval craft repeatedly refused to obey
instructions and the Italians were reluctant to use force at sea.

FT  10 JUL 92 / EC court refuses to block toxic waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Court of Justice yesterday decided in a landmark ruling that EC
member states may not refuse entry to hazardous waste under existing
European law, although this allows them to block imports of general waste
sent by their partners for dumping or recycling.
This anomalous judgment may strengthen the argument of France, which is
holding up long-delayed legislation on toxic waste transfers unless it
commits member states to dealing with their own harmful waste within the
near future.
The Court was ruling in a case against the government of Wallonia, the
French-speaking region of Belgium, which issued two general bans against
waste imports in 1984 and 1987.
The case was brought by the European Commission, after complaints by Dutch
waste exporters. It has as its background the Belgian scandal of the Walloon
village of Mellery, where imports of toxic waste to a local dumping facility
had damaged the health of local people, mainly through water pollution. The
Court said that a 1984 directive establishing a system for notifying toxic
waste shipments, as well as EC treaty provisions on the free movement of
goods, meant the Walloon executive was in the wrong. Waste constituted
'goods' in so far as it involves a commercial transaction, the judges ruled.
But although Court and Commission officials were uncertain about the precise
consequences of the ruling, it appeared to leave open a number of doors.
The law, as it stands, still allows member states to ban specific shipments
of toxic waste on health and environment grounds. For the same reasons, they
can establish limits to toxic waste intake, a Court official said. It is
still not clear, however, what these limits are. The Court nevertheless
seems to affirm:
that waste is not an ordinary 'good', and that its circulation can be banned
provided the prohibition is not discriminatory;
and that the Walloon executive's action is consistent with the Basle
Convention on toxic waste transfers - signed by the EC in 1989.
One Brussels lobbyist said that this implied support for the principle that
waste should be processed as near as possible to where it is generated - and
for the right of sovereign EC states to refuse entry to waste.
The decision is likely to reinforce the case for self-sufficiency when the
new waste regulation is debated again by the Twelve on October 20.
It is also expected to raise more questions about the Community's role in
protecting the environment.
Spokesmen for Greenpeace yesterday accused the EC of promoting trafficking
in hazardous waste, and called for fundamental reforms of the Maastricht
treaty.
They warned that Sweden, for instance, under current legal arrangements
would be obliged to accept EC radioactive waste at its Forsmark facility.
This would be from next year, well before Sweden is likely to enter the EC,
because of the common market laws established under the European Economic
Area set up between the Community and the European Free Trade Association of
which Sweden is a member.

<TEXT>
VIRGIN France has won a round in its battle to liberalise France's Sunday
trading laws by securing permission to open its Champs-Elysees store in
Paris on Sundays for a test period of a year.
The store, which sells records, video and cassette tapes and books from a
lavishly renovated banking hall, will open this Sunday. Mr Patrick Zelnick,
the chairman of Virgin France, described the Paris authorities' decision as
'a triumph for logic and common sense'.
Mr Zelnick has campaigned for Sunday trading since Virgin opened its first
French store on the Champs-Elyseesthree years ago. Virgin was previously
fined for opening illegally on Sundays. The Champs-Elysees store made about
one fifth of its weekly turnover on Sundays.
Mr Zelnick has used the campaign to generate publicity for Virgin in its
battle against FNAC, Virgin's chief competitor in France. FNAC and other
retailers have argued against Sunday opening.
The Paris authorities' decision comes during a government review of the
Sunday opening issue, similar to that of the UK government. The decision
only affects Virgin in Paris; its stores in Marseilles and Bordeaux have not
obtained permission from local authorities to open on Sunday.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Italian MPs linked to Milan scandal lose their immunity
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian chamber of deputies yesterday agreed by a large majority to
waive parliamentary immunity on five of its members to face charges of
alleged corruption, abuse of office and illegal financing of political
parties in connection with the five-month old Milan municipal corruption
scandal.
However, a special session of parliament refused to allow members to be
arrested, stipulating that they only answer the specific charges on which
Milan magistrates had sought to have their immunity waived.
Some of the five already face further charges and a new waiver will be
necessary in respect of these.
A total of 13 MPs and former ministers are currently under investigation by
Milan magistrates in connection with the scandal, while a further nine are
being investigated for alleged corruption in other parts of the country.
So far, 76 local and national politicians have been either charged or are
under investigation in the Milan affair which is having wide repercussions.
The scandal itself forced the resignation of the Milan municipal
administration and only yesterday, after exhaustive negotiations, a new
council was put together under the former communist mayor, Mr Piero
Borghini. Those on whom immunity was waived were three Socialists, Mr Carlo
Tognoli, Mr Paolo Pillitteri and Mr Renato Massari, Mr Antonio del Pennino a
Republican and Mr Gianni Cervetti of the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS). All held senior positions in their respective parties
and are leading political figures in Milan and the Lombardy region.
Mr Tognoli was minister of tourism in the previous Andreotti government and
a former mayor of Milan; while Mr Pillitteri, also a former mayor of Milan,
is brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader.
Mr del Pennino headed the Republican party in the chamber of deputies and Mr
Cervetti was the shadow defence minister for the PDS.
Yesterday Mr Tognoli continued to protest his innocence while Mr del Pennino
welcomed the waiving of immunity in order to clear his name.
The magistrates are alleging that the politicians formed part of a
sophisticated system of rigged public works contracts and kick-backs worth
millions of lire which largely went towards illicit funding of the political
parties running the Milan municipal administration - the Socialists,
Christian Democrats, PDS and Republicans.

THE international airlift of supplies to besieged Sarajevo is 'working by a
hope and a prayer', according to a United Nations official in the besieged
Bosnian capital.
'The situation in Sarajevo is extremely fragile,' the UN official said. 'We
don't have a ceasefire yet. We don't have a concentration of heavy weaponry
controlled by the United Nations. And we don't have the ground security
corridor within Sarajevo.'
Eleven of a planned 16 planeloads of aid were delivered by yesterday
afternoon. But Swedish truck drivers hired by the United Nations
refugee-relief agency are refusing to transport the aid pallets because of
the danger of snipers.
'The Swedish truck drivers want to go home,' the United Nations official
said. 'It is too dangerous.'
Mr Fred Eckhard, a UN spokesman, said aid trucks are coming under sniper
fire every day. Yesterday a Canadian soldier was seriously wounded when he
stepped on a mine.
'The military situation is precarious,' he said. An attack by Bosnian forces
or a 'third party' on Serbian positions sparked a heavy retaliatory
artillery attack on Sarajevo's centre overnight on Thursday. The 'third
party' was a reference to Croatian forces that may or may not be loyal to
the Bosnian government.
UN troops came under fire in their Sarajevo headquarters last night as
artillery fire, mortar blasts and machinegun fire resumed.
Witnesses said some of the 1,100 UN troops in the city briefly fired back
with small arms from their base in the south-west of the city.
The exact troop strength of the Serbian army around Sarajevo is unknown, but
western analysts estimate that they number some 20,000.
They are armed with mortars, tanks, armoured troop carriers, anti-aircraft
guns and multiple rocket launchers.
In Belgrade Serbia's parliament yesterday passed an emergency economic
programme that gives the government almost complete control over the
economy.
The law, aimed at countering the effects of UN sanctions, gives the
government sweeping powers to control the sales of goods and services.
Opposition MPs attacked the law.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Lawyer set to oversee Poland's uneasy coalition: A look at a
government led by two parties that have differed on almost everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S long political crisis should end today after expected parliamentary
approval for a new coalition government - the fourth since the collapse of
communism three years ago - headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka.
Ms Suchocka, a no-nonsense 46-year-old lawyer, has made few enemies during
her parliamentary career in the pro-market Democratic Union (UD) party but
has impressed many by her quiet competence. As a Catholic with strong
anti-abortionist views, she should be able to maintain the peace between the
two main parties in her cabinet. These are the UD, the largest party to
emerge from the general election last October, and the right-wing
nationalist Catholic party (ZChN). The alliance between them made the
formation of the government possible but, if handled badly, could lead to
its eventual downfall.
Until now the two groups have appeared to differ on almost everything - from
their approach to the role of the Catholic Church to economic policy. The
UD, for example, has demanded strict controls on money supply while the ZChN
has called for monetary expansion to lift the economy out of recession.
The experience of Poland's previous non-communist governments indicates that
the economic agenda is set more by the International Monetary Fund and the
now-ratified Association Agreement with the European Community than what
politicians say in public.
The ZChN, for example, defended the 5 per cent of GDP budget deficit ceiling
demanded by the IMF once they were part of the previous government headed by
Mr Jan Olszewski. This helped to ensure that the economy has strengthened
despite nearly nine months of political uncertainty.
A strong team at the finance ministry, led by Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the
outgoing minister of finance who has been appointed an adviser to the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, managed to control
spending, while the central bank kept a close watch on the money supply.
As a result inflation should be halved to around 40 per cent this year while
industrial production is starting to recover. GDP is now expected to
stabilise at last year's level after a three-year decline. This is thanks
partly to devaluation of the zloty which has boosted exports and slowed
imports. Poland registered a Dollars 765m trade surplus in the first five
months of this year, helping to strengthen reserves.
Mr Henryk Goryszewski, from the ZChN, is expected to become the deputy
premier responsible for the economy. He will have to work with men such as
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, from the Liberal Democratic Congress, who is
returning to head the privatisation ministry.
The self-assured Mr Goryszewski has enjoyed a meteoric rise from legal
adviser in the transport ministry to chairing the Sejm's budget committee
and has often criticised Mr Lewandowski's privatisation policies.
The finance ministry is to be headed by Mr Jerzy Osiatynski from the UD who
served as central planning minister in the first Solidarity government.
The new government also has its big spenders. Mr Jacek Kuron, one of
Poland's most popular politicians is to return to the labour ministry, where
he is remembered for granting a generous deal for pensioners and the
unemployed in 1990.
President Lech Walesa has grudgingly accepted the proposed cabinet after
giving every indication that he would have preferred a government led by Mr
Waldemar Pawlak, the 32-year-old farmers' party leader.
Mr Pawlak, who has resigned after his abortive attempt to put together a
working majority, offered the president a greater chance of dominating the
executive without having to take direct responsibility for its actions. The
division of powers between the president and the government has plagued each
successive administration and the new one should prove no exception.
But for the moment Ms Suchocka has secured that flank by acknowledging that
the key ministries of defence, the interior and foreign affairs remain
within the president's domain.
Mr Olszewski and his followers are now in opposition and will continue to
demand the removal of former secret police collaborators from public
service, an issue which helped push them into the wilderness but will have
to be faced by Ms Suchocka's administration.

FT  10 JUL 92 / World Bank to make its first Russian loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank is to make its first loan to Russia, just three months after
the country was admitted as a member. The bank is preparing around Dollars
1.7bn (Pounds 890m) of loans to support the Russian balance of payments, the
first of which - a Dollars 600m loan to finance critical imports - could be
approved early next month.
Officials familiar with recent talks between the Russian government and the
bank said the Dollars 600m loan, to finance the import of priority goods
such as health supplies and spare parts, should be presented to the World
Bank board in early August before the start of its summer recess. They said
the loan, to be disbursed over a six-month period, would not be heavily
conditional on economic reform.
The bank is also working on loans of around Dollars 500m each to support the
Russian agricultural sector and the petroleum industry. These may be
approved as early as October. Work is also going ahead on smaller loans to
encourage the Russian privatisation programme and to help exports, officials
said.
The World Bank, which is playing a subsidiary role to the International
Monetary Fund in providing financial support for Russia, has also agreed
with the government the basis for their future co-operation.
A memorandum from the Russian government to the bank suggests five priority
areas for structural change:
Reform of enterprises, including privatisation and improving their
management. Competition and anti-monopoly policy.
Improving the environment for foreign direct investment, which relates to
issues such as the exit and entry of profits - the government favours
discriminatory treatment in favour of foreign investors.
Financial sector reform, including modernisation of the banking system.
Social protection and the social safety net, including reform of the
pensions system, unemployment compensation and the social safety net.
A parallel memorandum to the IMF, focusing on economic stabilisation, is
also likely to be sent to the fund's board next month.
Officials said yesterday that the proposal by President Boris Yeltsin to
swap Russian assets and goods in exchange for cancellation of Russia's
foreign debt had not been aired with officials from the two institutions.
They said that while such swaps might play a useful role in the
privatisation of enterprises - as they have widely done in Latin America -
it would make little sense to use exports to cancel debt when they could
otherwise be sold for cash.
Furthermore, the idea that assets in the former Soviet Union are owned by
the people raises the question of who owns the assets to be swapped: the
federal government, provincial or municipal governments or workers in the
enterprises?

FT  10 JUL 92 / Sharp fall in exports hits German surplus: Hopes of interest
rate cut replaced by fears of monetary tightening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LINGERING hopes of a summer start to international economic recovery
received a setback yesterday when Germany recorded a surprise fall in its
trade surplus for May.
Imports and exports both dropped sharply, indicating continuing weak demand
from abroad and stagnation at home. Instead of the widely forecast rise in
the surplus to about DM3.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn), the federal statistics office
yesterday reported a drop to just DM1.1bn, against April's DM2.3bn surplus.
Imports fell from DM58bn to DM51bn and exports dived from DM60.4bn to
DM52.2bn. The current account deficit widened to DM4.2bn from DM1.9bn.
The disappointing results were compounded by inflation figures, stuck firmly
above 4 per cent, a standstill in already depressed manufacturing orders and
falling capital investment - suggesting the expected emergence from the
doldrums must wait until after the summer lull.
Even then German hopes are pinned mostly on rising domestic demand following
expiry of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge at the end of June.
Hopes abroad for a cut in German interest rates have also been put on hold
and replaced by speculation over the chances of further tightening of
monetary policy at the Bundesbank's next council meeting on July 16. The
central bank yesterday described a newspaper report that it was considering
a renewed squeeze as 'speculation'.
However, economists say the time is ripe for a further signal on the bank's
determination to maintain monetary discipline. While an interest rates rise
is widely ruled out, other measures to control fast-growing money supply are
not.
One possibility is a rise in banks' minimum reserve requirements, to try to
curb lending. The M3 broad measure of money supply is growing at an
annualised rate of 9 per cent, against the 5.5 per cent upper limit of the
bank's target range.
A report from the Ifo economics institute in Munich, which says
manufacturing investment in west Germany will fall by a real 2 per cent this
year, supports suggestions that much borrowing is to help companies manage
cash-flow problems. Private mortgage demand is also unusually strong.
Mr Otmar Issing, a bank council member, yesterday referred specifically to
M3 expansion when he said 'there is no situation in which we could think to
reduce interest rates'.
Inflation, the other key factor governing interest rate policy, is still
above the bank's medium-term target of 2.5 per cent. A month-on-month
increase of 0.2 per cent in May, confirmed yesterday, left the annual rate
at 4.3 per cent.
According to the June economic survey from the BDI, the federation of German
industries, next January's increase in value-added tax from 14 per cent to
15 per cent will provide another inflationary surge.
The federation also warned of dangers from the east. Transfers will exceed
the nominal increase in gross national product, it said, with the net result
being that 'the cost of reconstruction will have to be met by cuts in
purchasing power in the west'.
The dire state of east Germany's economy was underlined by statistics
showing that gross domestic product per inhabitant in the new states is
about DM10,500 a year. This compares with more than DM65,000 in Hamburg, the
richest state, and almost DM40,000 in North Rhine Westphalia, the most
populous.
The German post office is to shed 34,000 jobs by the end of the decade, the
Deutsche Bundespost announced yesterday. Forced redundancies among the
service's 385,000 employees have been ruled out.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (10):
Changing markets - Leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, had not crash-landed
on its flotation take-off last month, two of Ireland's largest PLCs would
now be leasing companies, each catering to very different markets.
GPA whose business is almost entirely overseas, is in the big-ticket
business of jet aircraft leasing, and was started in 1975 by a former Aer
Lingus employee, Mr Tony Ryan, who is now one of the wealthiest men in
Ireland
The other Irish company whose name has become synonymous with leasing, is
Woodchester Investments, seventh in size on the Irish Stock Exchange, and in
control of around 30 per cent of the Irish car and two-thirds of the office
equipment leasing market.
It also has a small, but growing, share of the UK market and is launching
into continental Europe. Its chairman, Mr Craig McKinney is a Scotsman who
moved to Ireland in 1970 as a 20-year-old straight out of college, setting
up Woodchester seven years later.
Both companies have experienced exponential growth in the past five years.
The reasons for their success have been a combination of identifying market
niches at the right moment, access to the finance to fund their growth, and
initially at least, the benefit of Irish tax laws which favoured their
development.
The market for both is changing. GPA now faces its biggest challenge since
its formation - finding Dollars 12bn in finance for new aircraft purchases
up to the end of the decade, after institutional investors turned away from
the company at the minimum Dollars 10 per share asking price for the
flotation.
Perceptions of the airline industry in general are not good, but GPA has,
nonetheless, managed to put in a good performance over the past two years
despite the worldwide recession. Its 10 per cent corporate tax rate remains
in place until the year 2005, and company strategists are convinced that
sustained growth in airline seats demand will recover soon, underpinning
their expansion strategy.
Woodchester has a corporate partner in the shape of Credit Lyonnais (CL),
one of the world's leading banks, which holds 45 per cent of the company and
has the resources to bankroll plans to place Woodchester alongside the
Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland as one of Ireland's leading financial
institutions.
WOODCHESTER came to the market 10 years ago valued at IPounds 2m. A tax
regime then allowed generous 100 per cent capital write-off allowances in
the first year, which created opportunities for leasing companies to offer
highly competitive rates and to defer tax charges indefinitely into the
future.
The company grew rapidly through acquisition and now has assets worth in
excess of IPounds 1.2bn. This tax regime began to change in the late 1980s,
however, and, according to Mr Dan O'Connor, the group's finance director,
'capital allowance rates are now more penal than most places in Europe, so
the changes have eliminated those competitors who were dependent solely on
tax-driven business.'
Woodchester had, meanwhile, built up a sales-aid leasing business, arranging
lease finance directly through dealer outlets in both the UK and Ireland.
This, Mr O'Connor says, is now far more important than the tax-driven
capital allowance reasons for leasing.
Unlike GPA which is investing in large assets with lifetimes well beyond the
end of lease terms, Woodchester is able to conduct a highly conservative
accounting policy, which leaves no residual value, and hence risk, in its
leased equipment, which is typically leased over three years.
Woodchester has, thus, had few problems in tapping either debt or equity
markets in its expansion, and, according to NCB stockbrokers in Dublin, its
current debt-equity ration of 3 to 1, 'gives it a very strong capital base
with plenty of room for gearing up for further expansion.'
Mr O'Connor says the strategic alliance with CL has been vital to
Woodchester's growth, and that the two companies plan to combine their
expertise - Woodchester applying its success in the Irish leasing business
to develop into Europe through CL, and CL applying its banking expertise and
financial muscle to help Woodchester expand into the retail banking market
in Ireland, where its large market share in leasing limits further profits
growth in that sector.
Mr O'Connor says: 'The banks here are moving into the finance house
business, while we are moving in the opposite direction into retail
banking.'
GPA and Woodchester have thus evolved along very different pathways from
different ends of the leasing spectrum, but both have emerged as two of the
largest companies in the Irish corporate scene.

IN a country in which not every politician possesses both personality and
probity, Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, has achieved the happy state
of harmoniously possessing both. He is the 'Mr Nice Guy' of Irish politics.
At 40 years of age, he is one of the youngest of the present cabinet, and
has managed to work his way to the top without indulging in the backstabbing
or steamrollering of opponents that characterises the building of many
political careers.
It has been this ability to combine frankness with charm, to lead a complex
discussion accompanied by a joke and an impish lop-sided grin, that disarms
his opponents and allows him to then begin convincing them of his own
arguments. A left-of-centre liberal, and a one-time trade union activist, he
describes himself as a pragmatist free of strong ideological constraints.
Born into a family of staunch Fianna Fail supporters, he joined the party in
1967. An accountant by training, he has studied at University College in
Dublin and the London School of Economics, but politics has dominated his
working life. At 25 he was elected to the Dail at his first attempt,
representing a central Dublin constituency, and he has consistently had one
of the highest first preference votes in the country of any parliamentary
member.
He was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1986 and in 1987 was appointed labour
minister in Charles Haughey's government.
His ability to deal with the unions and their often cantankerous leaders has
been the key to achieving five years of relative peace on the industrial
relations front.
The tripartite pact of government, business and trade unions known as the
Programme of Economic and Social Progress, which currently underpins the
government's fiscal and monetary policy, owes much to the diligent
negotiating skills of Mr Ahern.
The only time he came close to making enemies within the party was during
the efforts to oust Mr Haughey from the leadership last November. Mr Albert
Reynolds, the then finance minister, led the rebellion, only to find himself
sacked and Mr Ahern stepping into his shoes at the Finance Ministry. For a
while Mr Ahern was dubbed 'the rat in the anorak.' He later made amends by
supporting Mr Reynolds' candidacy for the leadership in February.
As Ireland's 21st finance minister, he has now positioned himself for the
final step to the leadership of the party, and if the party's fortunes hold,
the position of prime minister.
'When I came to finance from the labour portfolio, where I was known as the
'good guy', people wondered whether I had what it needed to make the tough
decisions at finance. Well, within six months I have upset just about
everybody,' he says.
Those decisions have included closing a wide range of tax shelters and
loopholes, cracking down on tax evasion, holding steady on public sector pay
targets, and keeping the public sector finances firmly in line with
Ireland's commitment to European union and Emu, despite their short-term
recessionary effects and rising unemployment.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (11): All
quiet, for now - Prospects for bids and takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DUBLIN'S BUSINESS community is a cosy, informal fraternity, where an
outsider can quickly be on first-name terms with the locals, and where his
own business can equally as quickly become the knowledge of all.
Corporate deals will often be decided over a pint and a handshake, with
boardroom formalities conducted merely for the purposes of satisfying
corporate legal departments.
When a hostile takeover bid breaks the smooth surface of this tranquil
dealing pond, however, it immediately provokes a stir of reaction and
speculation. A small Irish engineering company, Barlo, last month staged a
successful all-paper takeover bid for IRG, another Irish engineering
concern.
In itself, the takeover was of minor importance, creating a combined group
with an annual turnover of IPounds 70m and a market capitalisation of some
IPounds 50m. But it has prompted speculation as to whether this is the
long-awaited start of a consolidation of the Irish corporate sector.
Mr Tom Healey, general manager of the Irish stock exchange, says: 'Over
two-thirds of the dealings are in just the top 10 stocks.' This has resulted
in the smaller companies finding it difficult to raise new funds on the
stock market in order to grow - 'the magic figure for market capitalisation
is around IPounds 100m. It is at this point the institutions take an
interest.'
Mr Brian O'Loughlin, the investment strategy director of Irish Life, one of
Ireland's big four institutional investors, believes the economy and the
market would be better off with more medium-sized companies benefiting from
strong management and good growth prospects.
At the end of last year, only 13 of the 77 currently quoted stocks on the
Dublin Stock exchange fell into the IPounds 50-60m capitalisation category.
Without institutional interest in their shares, smaller companies face
serious restraints on their growth; brokers have been trying to impress upon
their managements the need for merger or acquisition.
There are doubts whether the Barlo/IRG takeover will lead to a trend.
According to Mr O'Loughlin: 'Economic convergence in Europe puts pressure on
people to be more efficient and to think about alliances, but I don't think
there will be a major spate of activity.' He believes the larger Irish
companies prefer to look abroad, to reduce their exposure to the Irish
market, while UK and European companies will have little interest in picking
off the minnows. The expanding larger companies are more likely to be the
subject of foreign takeover bids. The profitable and rapidly growing food
companies, which have generated strong cashflows and good marketing outlets,
have been identified as possible targets. So have the big financial groups,
Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life, as well as some of the
building societies. Any European bank or insurance company looking for
market share in Ireland might consider them tempting.
Of the Irish financials, Bank of Ireland appears the most vulnerable. But Mr
Des Doran, the investment manager in Ireland for Standard Life, believes
that the government would attempt to block a foreign takeover of one of the
large financial institutions.
According to Dublin's Business and Finance magazine, French companies have
spent more than IPounds 600m buying into Irish businesses over the past five
years. This began with Pernod's IPounds 285m takeover of Irish Distillers in
1988.
Market sentiment at present is that no large takeovers or mergers are in the
immediate offing, but that a rationale for consolidation exists which will
push players in that direction, with Irish companies becoming both predators
and prey.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (9): Mood
of realism - Treasury management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND

<TEXT>
FROM his spacious office on the top floor of one of Dublin's finest new
buildings, Dr Michael Somers can look out over the city and wonder where on
earth all the money has gone. As the head of the agency charged with
managing Ireland's massive national debt, he is entitled more than most to
ponder this as he juggles with billions of pounds of debt incurred in the
high-spending 1980s, and seeks to cut the cloth to the style of the more
responsible 1990s.
Ireland has one of the highest per capita debt ratios in the EC, both in
absolute and in relative terms. At the end of 1991 it stood at IPounds
25.4bn, or about IPounds 6,500 for every person in the country.
The total debt swelled alarmingly in the early and mid-1980s as successive
governments borrowed heavily to finance spending at home through deficit
budgeting. Between 1982 and 1987 the debt more than doubled, from IPounds
11.7bn to IPounds 23.7 bn
It wasn't until 1987 that politicians finally began to listen to what senior
department of finance officials and independent economists had been saying
for years: that such a level of borrowing was fast becoming unsustainable
and a threat to the country's financial independence. Even the public began
to appreciate that the enormity of the figures demanded immediate action.
Dr Somers, chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency
(NTMA), says that by 1987 the size of the debt had become a very real
problem.
He credits Mr Charles Haughey's government, which came to power after
winning a general election that year, with bringing a new commitment to
tackle the debt problem.
One of the key elements in the government's new approach was the creation of
the NTMA, a semi-state agency which was handed management of the debt
portfolio from the department of finance.
Dr Somers himself had been head of the debt management unit within the
department for several years. In 1985 he had been appointed secretary of the
department of defence, but was brought back into finance in 1987, when
Fianna Fail returned to power, to take charge of the debt portfolio.
'We were losing staff hand over fist,' Dr Somers remembers. They were
poached by stockbroking firms and banks in the private sector keen to avail
themselves of the expertise they had developed in capital markets, and able
to offer them much higher salaries than the public purse. An embargo on
recruitment into the civil service also hindered their replacement.
The government asked Citibank to review its debt management operations and
suggest ways in which it could be made more efficient.
AFTER toying with the idea of hiring specialist staff on contract or handing
debt management operations over to a bank in the private sector, the
government opted to establish the NTMA, and introduced legislation which saw
the agency set up at the end of 1990. Its aims, he says, were to improve the
maturity profile of the debt portfolio and to save money.
Of the total debt of IPounds 25.4bn at the end of 1991, some IPounds 9bn is
in foreign currencies. Of the Irish pound portion, about IRPounds 4.1bn is
held by non-resident investors.
For 1992, the cost of interest payments and the repayment of certain sinking
funds is put at IPounds 2.4bn, and this does not include capital repayments.
The maturity profile of the medium to long-term foreign currency debt shows
loans of up to IRPounds 1.1bn repayable in 1995 and 1996, and from 1998
through to 2000.
It is the NTMA's task, Dr Somers says, to refinance that maturity profile,
pushing repayment dates out further by switching where appropriate into
longer dated borrowings at cheaper rates. The foreign currency debt service
ratio is expected to amount to 6.6 per cent in 1992. This compares with an
average of 7.9 per cent for the period 1986/91.
A key objective is to ensure that obligatory debt repayments in any one year
are kept to a level that can be readily refinanced to avoid the risk that
new money might not be forthcoming, or available only at exorbitant cost.
With this in view, there is an ongoing programme to repay a proportion of
loans several years before their final maturity and refinance them with
loans of longer maturity.
Of the foreign currency debt, some 32 per cent is denominated in
Deutschmarks, 30 per cent in Swiss francs, 15 per cent in dollars, and the
rest spread between ECU, yen, sterling and florins.
About 63 per cent is fixed, with 37 per cent in floating rates. At the end
of 1991 IPounds 6.2bn - 70 per cent - of the foreign debt had been redeemed
early and replaced.
The NTMA uses the Dublin bond market to service and redeem the government's
domestic debt. It plays a crucial role in issuing and trading gilts on the
market, where turnover in 1991 is estimated at IPounds 100bn.
This year the NTNMA has to repay and refinance some IPounds 1.6bn in
maturing gilts. It has designated four stocks as benchmark issues, with
maturity dates in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2012, with the objective of building
up the amounts outstanding to around IPounds 1bn in each case. It also holds
gilt auctions from time to time to supplement sales via the tap system.
The government has set an exchequer borrowing requirement of IPounds 592m,
or 2.1 per cent of GDP, for 1992. Last year the EBR reached 1.9 per cent of
GDP compared to the budget target of 1.7 per cent.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (6):
Poised for expansion - Food processing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON June 18, the day of Ireland's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, the
Irish Farmers' Association published a large front-page advert in the Irish
Farmers' Journal saying: 'Your most important task today - vote YES for your
families' future.'
Most farmers did not need persuading. In many rural areas over 70 per cent
of voters gave their approval to the treaty. Common Agricultural Policy
reforms notwithstanding, Irish farmers obviously concluded that an EC with
EMU is infinitely preferable to an EC without Ireland.
Ireland's dairy and beef industries continue to be mainstays of the economy.
It is estimated that food production accounts for 10 per cent of GNP and 20
per cent of total exports. One in seven people are involved in farming. As
one market analyst says: 'It is hardly surprising that the main
home-produced soap opera on TV in Ireland is set on a farm.'
Beef production has grown tenfold in Ireland as a result of EC membership.
Dairy output has been similarly stimulated. But what of its food processing
industries? According to a recent industrial policy review study, known as
the Culliton report, 'since Ireland joined the EC, Irish food manufacturing
has declined significantly in the face of more liberal market conditions.
Consequently imports of manufactured foods have risen steeply . . . a
priority for Irish manufacturers must be to increase domestic market share
and reduce imports'.
Mr Liam Connellan, the director-general of the Confederation of Irish
Industries, said: 'The value-added at the manufacturing stage in the food
industries is an average of only 3 per cent, whereas it should be possible
to achieve 15 per cent as it is in the UK and other parts of Europe'.
MUCH has been blamed on the complacency produced by dependence on EC
intervention buying of Irish produce. In 1990, 40 per cent of beef
production and 50 per cent of skimmed milk power and butter was sold into
intervention, making Ireland one of the biggest users of intervention-buying
mechanisms in the Community.
However, significant changes are taking place in the industry. The emergence
of the dairy co-operative-plc hybrids in the late 1980s, with their access
to stockmarket funds, has created a powerful and rapidly-expanding new
sector of Irish-owned industry which is international in outlook with
ambitions to match.
The transformation began in 1986 with the flotation of Kerry Group, the
country's first dairy co-operative-plc hybrid, and has since been followed
by Avonmore, Waterford, and Golden Vale. Greencore, the state sugar company,
was floated last year.
Virtually insignificant ten years ago, food companies now account for more
than 10 per cent of the Dublin Stock Exchange's market capitalisation. All
have turned in respectable results for the past year, despite the recession,
and all are engaged in ambitious acquisition programmes in an effort to
diversify, achieve economies of scale and increase market share abroad.
Kerry Group has been the trailblazer. Starting out as a small farmers'
co-operative in 1974, with an annual turnover of IPounds 23m in dairy
products, it reported IPounds 24.1m pre-tax profits in 1991 on a turnover of
IPounds 755m. Dairy products now comprise only 25 per cent of turnover,
while meat processing accounts for 50 per cent and food ingredients the
other 25 per cent.
It is the latter which has generated the most excitement. In 1988 the group
purchased Beatreme Food Ingredients in the US, which Mr Hugh Friel, the
company's deputy managing director, said 'produced a major change in the
organisation'.
KERRY is now a leading producer of specialised food ingredients in the US,
and sources one of those ingredients, casein (a by-product from butter
production), from its dairy processing plants in Ireland. It has also become
a large supplier of branded consumer food products to UK multiple retail
outlets. Mr Friel says that further expansion in the US, UK and Europe is
envisaged.
However, further growth at Kerry, as well as the other co-operative-plc
hybrids, will eventually require a change in their shareholding structure.
At present, all stipulate that the co-operative shares must not fall below
51 per cent without a majority decision of the shareholders.
Kerry has come closest to that threshold and is likely to be the first to
break it. Five thousand farmers currently hold a 58 per cent stake in Kerry
through the Kerry cooperative, a stake which has been diluted through
successive rights issues made to finance the acquisition programme.
Will the dairy farmer-shareholders be willing to cede control of their
company?
Mr Friel says: 'There's a lot of money tied up in that 58 per cent and the
growth we have achieved has never been at the expense of the milk price paid
to our producers.'
He predicts that the change will occur 'within two years'. If Kerry leads,
it is probable that the farmer-shareholders at the other
co-operative-hybrids will follow.
The government is meanwhile preparing to change tack on its industrial
support programme, to give greater incentives to investment in the food
industry, which the Culliton report identified as requiring special
attention.
Shortly after Mr Albert Reynolds became prime minister earlier this year, he
placed special emphasis on the importance of the food industries for
Ireland's economic development and said it would be one of his priorities to
encourage growth and investment in the sector.
Civil servants in conjunction with industry representatives are currently
drawing up a national food industry development plan, on the basis of
recommendations made in the Culliton report, and this should be ready later
this year.
The shake-up, when it comes, will produce one of the biggest overhauls of
Irish industrial policy for decades, and position its food industries for a
prolonged and sustained period of growth.
The farmers will doubtless feel justified in having demonstrated their faith
by voting for Maastricht last month.

People are often the main incentive - Inward investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN tourists from around the world are asked which aspect of Ireland they
enjoy the most, the answer is frequently: 'The people.'
The same answer is often given by foreign executives when asked why they are
pleased with their operations in 'the Emerald Isle.' There are 1,000 foreign
companies in Ireland. A recent survey on what a sample of them like about
the country showed 'people/ambience' at the top of the list, closely
followed by qualities of the workforce, namely youth and skills.
Ireland has been at pains to stress its young, highly-educated wealth of
graduates, especially in technical disciplines. More than half the
population is under the age of 28.
About 60 per cent of Irish 18-year-olds are studying or undergoing a
training course, compared with 35 per cent in Britain. The percentage of
tertiary students pursuing engineering, science or business-related studies
is also around the 60 figure.
With the world recession, the 'migration' of so many bright young things to
London and New York has tailed off as job opportunities in the megalopolises
disappear. On the other hand, the current number of jobs in Ireland with
foreign companies is 92,000 - nearly 10 per cent of the workforce.
English being the main language is of course an advantage to the two largest
foreign investors, the US and Britain, although it was mentioned only as
something of an afterthought by the 14 respondents to the survey
commissioned by Allied Irish Banks (AIB) International Corporate Banking.
One in four - a surprisingly low percentage - said the generous tax
concessions on offer for the next 15 years were a prime incentive to invest
in Ireland.
Corporation tax for manufacturing and some service industries is fixed at a
maximum of 10 per cent until 2010, but five years earlier for financial
institutions operating in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre
(IFSC). Nobody seems to be looking beyond these magic dates at the moment,
although managing director of the Industrial Development Authority, the
chief promoter of inward investment in the country, Mr Kieran McGowan,
envisages European community battles on levels of financial incentives.
'The EC is talking about a ceiling on these types of incentives,' said Mr
McGowan.' We argue that small countries such as Ireland are disadvantaged in
attracting industry, so should be able to offer extra benefits.'
The largest foreign investor in Ireland is the US, with about 350 American
companies having operations there. Here is an area, unlike tariffs, where
all seems to be sweetness and light between the two countries. Mr Gene
Harris, the commercial attache at the US Embassy in Dublin, says there is an
undeniable cultural affinity - about 45m Americans have Irish ancestry,
according to the latest census - but the preference is more hard headed than
that.
'That figure of 350 represents a very high level of investment for the US,'
he says. 'If you compare it with, say, Denmark, also a EC member, the
company count there is only 185 and yet Denmark has twice the population of
Ireland.' The US presence is in fact the highest per capita investment it
has anywhere in the world.
Mr Harris mentions the highly-trained labour force as a factor in US
preference: 'I don't believe all the glowing IDA publicity, but I find when
I ask American companies here what problems they have had there is a pause.
They have to scratch their heads and think about it, whereas anywhere else
in the world there seems to be an automatic litany of complaints as soon as
you put that question.'
Apple computers have had its most profitable operation anywhere, in Cork,
according to Harris, although a big withdrawal recently suggests that this
may not be much help to the company at the moment.
Low labour costs have certainly helped the balance sheets of many companies.
Taking Ireland as 100 units in a scale of comparative labour costs in
Europe, it is nearly half as expensive as Germany (192) and has a definite
advantage over Britain (117).
Things have gone well for Coke in Ireland. The drinks company has had
operations here since 1952, and Coca-Cola Atlantic was formed in 1974. The
company recently announced a IPounds 127m expansion of its concentrate
manufacturing plant in Drogheda, in the north-east of the republic, with
11,000 extra square metres and 140 new jobs over five years.
A new company, Coca-Cola Reinsurance Services (CCRS), is also being set up
in Dublin's IFSC. The company wIll provide insurance for all Coca-Cola
properties outside the US and Canada.
Maidenform, best-known as a bra maker, is one of dozens of foreign companies
operating in the special industrial zone around Shannon, in the mid-west.
Top secret information such as the average bust size of women in the 50
counties where Maidenform has markets is held here. Humdrum assembly and
repackaging for Asian markets are other concerns.
Other US developments include establishment of the European headquarters for
Adam Spence, the medical components manufacturer, and a new laboratory for
Carlow Associates of Virginia, which works in human factor and ergonomics
studies. Adam Spence expects to create 50 jobs at its facility in Boyle,
County Roscommon.
Carlow will be looking for psychology and computer science graduates for its
work, which entails investigations of errors and human performance. Its
clients include the NASA space agency, the US Army and Navy, and the French
Ministry of Defence. To date it has investigated the role played by human
error in the Three Mile Island nuclear accident and studied the need for
high-mounted braking lights on cars.
The US is still the main focus of its attention, says Mr McGowan at the IDA,
but a lot of effort is currently being put into wooing British and German
interests, particularly in the financial services and software sectors.
Japan has not been a target yet, although its representation is respectable,
at 35 firms including Fujitsu (which has four plants), Atari, Hitachi,
Brother and NEC. Korea has two operations in Ireland.
Interest from that part of the world is also bearing fruit with a small
number of Australian operations. There is already a financial presence, for
example National Australia Bank's ownership of National Irish Bank,
forerunner of a possible trend towards mergers and acquisitions rather than
greenfield projects from foreign interests.
Allied Smokeless Fuels, a Queensland company, is importing anthracite from
Australia to process in Ireland and take advantage of the market created by
smokeless fuel regulations around, for example, Dublin. Michel, an
Australian leather goods company, has just agreed terms with the IDA on a
IPounds 27m investment in a plant at Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, 'the
leather capital of Europe', according to the IDA.
The 23-year-old authority is an aggressive marketer of the advantages of
locating in Ireland. Across the board, it now sees big opportunities in
telemarketing, with the 340m consumers of the EC just on the doorstep. 'For
telemarketing, all you need is, one, people, and two, telephones, and we
feel we have particular strengths in both areas, ' said Mr McGowan.
The authority is working closely with Telecom Eireann to develop this
market, and Telecom claims an investment of Pounds 3.5bn in digital and
fibre-optic technology will make it a leading competitor.
Electronics and pharmaceuticals have been two strong areas for foreign
investment. Here again availability of local staff skilled in electrical
engineering and chemistry is attractive.
Sectors which Ireland is concentrating on are financial services and
software. The IFSC, a 1980s glass and towers project in Dublin's equivalent
of London's Docklands, has had reasonable success in attracting tenants.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (8): An
unexpected success story - Captive insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST by accident, the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin
has discovered captive insurance. Or more accurately, the captive insurance
industry has discovered the IFSC.
When the Irish Industrial Development Authority (IDA) set out on its
marketing drive to attract international companies to locate in Ireland, the
captive insurance business was not on its target list. The IDA was after
banks, fund managers and insurance companies. That was in 1987.
Then, in early 1988, things changed.
'We had a brainstorming session with six chief executives of Irish insurance
companies,' explains Mr David Hanna, the IDA's director of international
financial services.
'The captive insurance industry was very well developed in the US and the
consensus was that it was beginning to take off in Europe. There was an
opportunity for a good location for setting up captive insurance arms, and
the IFSC seemed to be it. By May 1988, captive insurance was on our target
list.'
The result is that there are now more captive insurance and reinsurance
companies in the IFSC than there are banks or fund managers - 65 by early
June this year - and that figure is expected to grow as the IDA continues
its marketing effort and as more European companies set up captive insurance
divisions.
A captive is a wholly-owned insurance company subsidiary established by an
industrial, commercial or governmental organisation to underwrite all or
part of the risk of the organisation and its affiliates. The aim is to try
to keep as much as possible of the huge premiums, paid out every year by
corporations in insurance cover, within the group.
'The captive chooses lines of insurance that have a good loss history,'
explains Mr Eamonn O'Brien, manager of Alexander Insurance Managers, one of
several companies providing captive insurance management services in the
IFSC. The captive lays off most of the risk to reinsurers but retains a
greater share of the premium income than it does of the risk.
The idea first took hold in the US, according to Mr Garry Cullen, a director
of Sedgwick Dineen, the Irish arm of the Sedgwick Group in London. 'I would
say about 30 per cent of the companies in the Fortune 500 have captive
insurance arms,' he says. US corporations use Bermuda and Barbados as their
main captive locations.
So what is it about the IFSC that makes it such an attractive location for
the captive insurance industry? When companies are considering a domicile
for a captive, they look for technical expertise, good communications,
formalised insurance legislation, tax efficiency, political stability and a
good operating environment. Dublin is seen as having a good mix of these
qualities.
Where Dublin is seen to have the edge on its main European rivals -
Luxembourg, the Isle of Man and Guernsey are the other main European centres
 -is in the ability of captives located in the IFSC to write direct
insurance into the EC. This, coupled with the 10 per cent tax rate
applicable to profits up to 2005 (extended from 2000), makes Dublin unique
among captive locations in Europe.
Mr Cullen says the fact that the EC has accepted the low tax rate for a
certain period gives the ISFC added legitimacy as a location, rather than
being perceived purely as a tax haven, such as the Isle of Man or Guernsey.
Being located in the IFSC also allows captives to take advantage of 22
double taxation agreements which the Republic of Ireland has signed with
trading partners. This ensures that the benefits of the low tax rate
applying to the IFSC can be passed back to the parent company without
further deduction of tax on remitted dividends.
Many of the big European and US insurance companies, including Aachener &amp;
Munchener, American International, Marsh &amp; McLennan and Cologne Re, have
established themselves at the IFSC. Companies which have set up captive
insurance arms there include BMW, Volkswagen, Siemens, and Asea Brown
Boveri.

ABOUT a year from now, the Irish Stock exchange will sever an historical
link with London which goes back almost two centuries to when dealers first
traded out of coffee houses in the main cities of the British Isles. The
link was formalised in 1973 with the amalgamation of the seven regional
exchanges into the Stock Exchange of Great Britain and Ireland.
A new Bill is due to be passed next summer which will break this umbilical
cord, creating a new regulatory framework for the market, and giving
statutory control to the central bank. This, in turn, will delegate the
day-to-day policing of the market to the Irish Stock Exchange itself.
The move is not due to national chauvinism or disenchantment with London. It
is simply that the legislative framework in the UK has evolved rapidly in
recent years, triggered by Big Bang, and the need to regulate an
increasingly sophisticated market based on on-screen and paperless trading.
The event will not produce a major trauma for the market: indeed, most
traders will barely notice the difference, according to Mr Tom Healey,
general manager of the Irish Stock Exchange, who says there will be minimal
changes. 'There will be an updating of the regulatory structure, to reflect
the many new instruments and ways of doing business that have evolved in
recent years but there will be no effect on listings. It is more to do with
brokers and the relationships with their clients.' All leading Irish stocks
are quoted on the London exchange and this will continue after the change.
Dublin will be linked to the Taurus electronic settlements system in London,
but Mr. Healey says it will not be necessary to duplicate the legal
structure that has been put in place in the UK - 'the UK took the pathway of
dematerialisation, but there is the alternative of demobilisation of paper,
which can have the effect of creating a paperless market without
dematerialising it. Dematerialisation would require entirely new
legislation'.
The close association with London will be maintained - 'our criteria will be
to adhere as closely as possible to London standards as that is what the
market wants.' If and when detailed investigations became necessary, these
could be contracted out to the London Exchange in order not to duplicate
efforts.
Unfortunately, the new stand-alone exchange will be deprived of what was
hoped would be its biggest single quoted company, GPA, the aviation leasing
group whose international offer was withdrawn at the eleventh hour last
month due to a lack of institutional interest.
With a forecast capitalisation of around IPounds 2bn, it would have
represented 20 per cent of the market's total capitalisation. The flotation
failure has disappointed brokers and investors alike, who are concerned at
the lack of dynamism in the Dublin market. At the end of June, the ISEQ
index fell back to where the market was a year ago, prompting analysts to
downgrade their earlier expectations of 15-20 per cent overall growth in the
market in 1992. Brokers say that, since the abolition of exchange controls
in 1989, most Irish institutional investors have been diversifying into
overseas equities with the result that Irish equities now only form some 30
per cent of their portfolios.
Last year Irish companies raised IPounds 816m on the Dublin exchange, up 11
per cent on 1990. The flotations of Greencore and Irish Life accounted for
IPounds 312m of that sum, and nothing of that scale is likely to be repeated
this year or next. The market is depressed and the GPA flop has added to the
sense of languor, but dealers console themselves that things could be much
worse. As one broker says: 'If Ireland had voted against Maastricht, there
would have been a disaster.'

Premiums have soared - High level of insurance claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As anyone who owns a car in Ireland will testify, the cost of insuring it is
enough to make you want to take the bus. And it isn't just cars: other
non-life premiums such as employer and public liability are also high
relative to elsewhere in the European Community.
According to a study carried out for the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF) by
the accountants Coopers and Lybrand last year, motor insurance costs in the
Republic of Ireland are in most cases more than twice as high as in the UK.
The study found that the cost of comprehensive cover is 48 per cent higher,
while non-comprehensive cover is 133 per cent higher. But only 38 per cent
of Irish drivers have comprehensive cover, compared to 73 per cent of
drivers in the UK.
The reasons for this are in many cases interlinked. First, as the study
showed, personal injury claims are two and a half times more likely to arise
than in the UK. But perhaps more importantly, personal injury awards are
also much higher. Claims under comprehensive cover are up to three times
more expensive; claims under non-comprehensive cover are five times higher.
The explanation lies in the number of accidents on Irish roads every year.
Based on the number of casualties per vehicle registered in Ireland, there
are two and a half times as many fatalities resulting from accidents than in
the UK.
Irish people are also far more likely to sue for damages than people
elsewhere, according to insurance companies. They say the first notification
of a claim they receive is often a solicitor's letter.
In an attempt to bring down the high cost of insurance and personal injury
claims, the government passed legislation in 1988 abolishing the use of
juries in settling claims. But despite this, the level of awards continues
to be very high.
'The overall cost of litigation and awards has not changed because of the
legislation,' says Mr Aidan Cassells, director general of the IIF. 'They are
more consistent but there has been no significant reduction.'
Mr Eamonn Walsh, managing director of Hibernian, the country's largest
independent general insurance company, agrees that public and employer
liability premiums are high but not out of line with elsewhere in the EC -
'the level of personal injury claim is high but there is no real difference
in cost,' he says. 'It does arise in certain situations, and within
individual companies I think laissez faire management is to blame for the
level of claims by employees. But in general, industrial insurance is
comparable. We do not, after all, have a very industrialised economy. A lot
of our manufacturing is high technology, where there is very little risk.'
All are agreed, however, on the need to reduce the level of court awards -
'something has to be done, either at EC or at national level,' says Mr
Cassells. 'But it is a difficult issue to address. The independence of the
system of deciding awards makes it nearly impossible to change them.'
THE IIF sees a cap on the level of damages as the most logical route for
less serious injuries. The IIF has been active in promoting greater safety
awareness on roads, which, coupled with tougher enforcement of road traffic
laws, led in 1990 to a six per cent drop in the number of accidents.
Insurance companies are chalking up heavy losses in motor and liability
underwriting business. In 1990, the last year for which figures are
available, motor underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 130m, an increase of
12 per cent on the previous year. The good news, though, was that the rate
of growth of losses appeared to be slowing.
Guardian Royal Exchange lost Pounds 36.5m on motor premium income of Pounds
64m. Its subsidiary New PMPA, which rose from the ashes of the collapse of
the original PMPA insurance company in 1984, lost Pounds 11m on premium
income of Pounds 91m.
Liability insurance is also unprofitable. In 1990 companies reported total
underwriting losses of Pounds 54m on premium income of some Pounds 140m.
Indeed, of the 38 companies licenced to write general insurance business in
the Republic of Ireland in 1990, only 11 recorded underwriting profits.
Total underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 171m on premium income of
Pounds 800m. Fire and property insurance showed underwriting profits of
Pounds 7m on premium income of Pounds 168m, with the vast bulk of those
profits generated by the Irish arms of overseas insurance companies.
The high-cost environment has not, however, dissuaded many of the big
overseas insurance companies from competing in the Irish market. In fact,
the non-life market is dominated by the big UK insurers, including Guardian
Royal Exchange, General Accident and Eagle Star. As Mr Walsh points out, the
UK insurers have traditionally seen Dublin as another branch, like Glasgow
or Liverpool.

Rationalisation required - Banks and building societies compete fiercely for
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is certainly no lack of choice in financial services in Ireland. There
are over 30 licenced banks and building societies, with five retail banks
and five building societies offering some form of nationwide service.
Competition for customers is fierce, the range of products wide, standards
of personal service high but falling as the relentless drive for newer and
more sophisticated technology continues.
A noticeable feature of the market over the last six years has been the
blurring of the lines between banks and building societies as each invaded
the other's traditional territory in the hunt for business.
Until about 1986, banks stuck to banking and building societies to their
traditional role as providers of mortgages and high-interest savings
accounts. But as the banks sought new lending opportunities they too began
offering mortgages, and they now account for some 35 per cent of the total
mortgage market.
Bank of Ireland, the country's second largest retail bank, stole a march on
its rivals with the purchase of the ICS Building Society in 1986. Now the
so-called Big Four banks - AIB, Bank of Ireland, National Irish and Ulster -
each offer their own mortgage packages, though ICS does not compete with
Bank of Ireland's mortgage business.
'The banks realised they had no service to offer when customers were making
one of the most important decisions of their lives - buying a house,' says
Mr Brian Wilson, AIB's group general manager for Ireland. We were simply not
capitalising on a very warm customer relationship.'
AIB now claims between 15 and 20 per cent of the mortgage market.
However, for the Irish banks the expansion of the 1980s has not all been
smooth. With the economy sluggish and heavily dependent on a move out of
recession in its two main export markets in the UK and US, bad debts have
risen and huge losses have been incurred by some banks on badly timed
overseas expansions.
The Bank of Ireland may have pulled off a coup by buying the ICS Building
Society, but nothing it has bought since has been so rewarding. It followed
AIB into the US banking market by buying First New Hampshire Bank (FNH), but
so far has not earned a penny in return. In 1991 alone FNH lost IRPounds
76.6 million, up from IRPounds 60 million the previous year. The cost of the
FNH acquisition is put at some Dollars 500 million to the Bank of Ireland so
far.
AIB, the country's biggest bank, is one of the few European banks to have
bought a successful US bank. It owns First Maryland Bancorp, based in the
Washington DC area, where the stability of its customer base has ensured
consistent profitability.
Bank of Ireland and AIB were for years seen as peas in a pod. When one
moved, the other was bound to emulate it. This has stopped since the Bank of
Ireland's purchase of FNH.
In the intervening five years, AIB has grown to be about twice as big as its
nearest rival in terms of market capitalisation.
National Irish Bank, part of the National Australia Bank group, and Ulster
Bank, owned by National Westminster of the UK, have established large branch
networks throughout the country and now challenge for business in most of
Ireland's large towns.
They have now been joined by a fifth, the TSB Bank, formed at the beginning
of June from the merger of Trustee Savings Bank Dublin and the Cork and
Limerick Savings Bank. There was a neat dovetail between the branch networks
of the two banks, which included the capital and the important southern
market, taking in Cork and the rich Golden Vale farming area.
Management of the building societies has traditionally been viewed in
banking circles as sleepy and lacking in sufficient experience to challenge
the banks in their own markets. But the building societies have not been
idle. Stung by the banks' move into their traditional markets, they have
fought back aggressively with new products.
The market is dominated by five big societies, the Irish Permanent, First
National, Irish Nationwide, Educational and ICS. The Irish Permanent is the
biggest, with a mortgage book estimated at IRPounds 1.2 billion. It has
recently made some key appointments, including Mr Peter Ledbetter from GPA
Group as executive director and Mr Roy Douglas from AIB as chief operating
officer.
'Certainly the banks' move into the mortgage market made us react,' says Mr
Gerry Murphy, assistant general manager at the First National. 'They had a
product which suited their customers. But I think it helped us to get out of
the mindset that there was no competition for mortgages. I think we have
fought back very well and are now competing very aggressively.'
Competition has now shifted to the area of savings. Mr Murphy describes the
competition for resources over the last two years as 'vicious.'
Bankers are among the first to acknowledge that Ireland is severely
overbanked. Subsidiaries of international banks such as ABN Amro, Citibank
and BNP are fighting the large domestic banks for a share of the fiercely
competitive corporate sector.
They have gained some market share, notably in the food industry, but have
been badly hit by the collapse of Goodman International and United Meat
Packers, Ireland's two largest beef processors, which collapsed in 1990 and
1992 respectively.
Consolidation within the financial services industry is seen as both
inevitable and desirable over the next few years. Of the commercial banks,
Bank of Ireland is generally regarded as the most vulnerable, especially if
it cannot turn around FNH. Profits in the year to the end of March rose from
Pounds 54m to Pounds 77m, but for the second successive year it has had to
dip into reserves to pay its dividend. AIB reported profits of Pounds 186
million.
'There has to be rationalisation,' says Mr Jim Lacey, chief executive of
National Irish Bank. He claims that his bank's Australian parent is
committed to maintaining its presence in Ireland, but as the smallest of the
retail banks it is also vulnerable.
Among the building societies the drive towards plc status is expected to
continue, though there is a clause preventing holdings above 15 per cent for
five years. Mr Tony O'Connell, managing director of ICS, sees Irish
societies following the UK trend and forging mergers within the sector.
'I've always been surprised that there have not been more mergers among the
societies, which could have been achieved by a simple transfer of
engagements. Size is important and becoming more so,' he says.

Sell-off plans hit by delays - Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION has never been the buzzword in Ireland that it became in
Margaret Thatcher's Britain. The Ireland of prime ministers Garret
FitzGerald, Charles Haughey, and, since February, Albert Reynolds, has no
great vision of the joys and virtues of ushering state-run bodies into the
private sector. Nor has there been a big drive to widen share ownership
among the population.
There are good reasons for this.
First, there are only 3.5m people in the 26 counties of the republic, and
the economy is only now getting rid of its almost total dependence on
agriculture. The economy has also been slowed by the recession of the early
1990s - although Ireland, not having reached the dizzy heights of the
mid-1980s, was affected correspondingly less by the downturn.
However, last year there was a limited foray into privatisation, with two
part sell-offs of Irish Life, a financial institution, and the sugar
producer Greencore.
Other candidates for privatisation which were being discussed two years ago,
such as the Irish telephone monopoly, Telecom Eireann, and the Industrial
Credit Corporation (ICC), will not now be sold off for at least another two
years.
In the case of Telecom, the delay could be longer, depending on how long it
takes the dust to settle from the IPounds 19.4m sale of a former bakery near
the US embassy in Dublin to Telecom within a year of it having been bought
for a much smaller sum.
The roles of Mr Michael Smurfit, the former chairman of Telecom, and Mr
Dermot Desmond, a leading Dublin stockbroker and former consultant to the
communications body, are being examined by a government-ordered inquiry
which shows little sign of clarifying the matter.
'Telecom will have to be whiter than white before the government sells it
off,' said a leading Dublin business analyst.
'The privatisation process had virtually begun last year, before these
matters arose, and now these so-called scandals have derailed it.'
There is also stiff union opposition to the sell-off plan. Last September,
when it became known that the government had suggested that Telecom
commission a study of its prospects, including privatisation, the unions
declared that the government had promised previously that privatisation was
not on the agenda.
A statement by Mr David Begg, the general secretary of the Communications
Workers Union, extolled Telecom as 'a jewel of great price . . . it would be
extremely unwise to sell it off for a once-off cash sum'.
The union claims that because few Irish buyers could raise the estimated
IPounds 1bn or more purchase price, it would probably be sold to foreign
interests, which it sees as bad for Ireland.
It also argues that, without any accompanying legislation to license other
telephone operators, a monopoly would fall into private hands.
UNIONS such as Mr Begg's are forces to reckon with, as the management of An
Post (the Post Office) found during the recent six-week mail strike, which
cost it millions of pounds in revenue.
Telecom is profitable, but it does have a fairly high ratio of debt to
equity. This would have to be reduced, and manning levels rationalised,
before it was put on the market.
Scandal allegations have also tainted Irish Sugar (Siuicre Eireann), which
was brought to the market as Greencore in April last year, with 55 per cent
of the shares on offer and the government retaining the other 45 per cent.
The sugar company had been performing creditably in the six months before
the float, or semi-float, with pre-tax profit climbing from IPounds
11,648,000 to IPounds 14,361,000. Hence the issue was six times
over-subscribed, with more than 16,000 applications for shares valued at a
total of IPounds 250m.
However, a series of court hearings and investigations into the business
practice of the former chief executive, Mr Chris Comerford, will have to end
before more shares are offered on the market. The government did sell off
another 15 per cent of its holding, but analysts say this did not help the
prospects of full privatisation and served to undermine confidence in the
company.
Irish Life, the third largest financial institution in Ireland, was the
other part-privatisation. It went to the market last July, when the
government reduced its stake from 90 per cent to 34 per cent.
Analysts believe the government will have to wait for the economy to improve
before any appetite for Irish Life shares would justify the administrative
costs of a sell-off.
'We don't have a policy on privatisation as such', said a spokesman for the
Department of Finance, which handles such activity. 'Each situation would be
handled as it arose, and on its own merits.'
He referred to a general reference in the government's Programme for
Economic and Social Progress (PESP), launched at the beginning of 1991: 'The
government's objective in developing state companies is to enable them to
contribute better to the economy and to employment. Private involvement in
state companies can, in various ways and depending on the circumstances of
each company, help the companies to achieve this objective.'
While it is perhaps not enthusiastic about the idea of privatisation, the
Fianna Fail government is as keen as anybody to boost the exchequer.
However, the organisations equivalent to the big privatisations achieved or
scheduled to go ahead in Britain (British Telecom, British Gas, British
Rail) are often not in the right shape for offers to the public.
The Irish railway, Iarnrod Eireann, is far from robust and has never been a
likely candidate for privatisation. However, Bord Dais, the gas authority,
is reasonably strong, with very competitive, market-conscious consumer
policies. The Electricity Supply Board (ESB) is also a competent performer.
However, Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy Stockbrokers,
questions the benefits of privatising either the electricity or gas
authorities. 'What would you gain?', he says. 'They would inevitably be
split into generating and supply units, so instead of one utility which was
doing OK you would have two, each with its own costs and administration.'
The Industrial Credit Corporation (ICC), a bank set up in 1933 to help small
businesses, was described confidently in 1990 as 'next in line' to be
privatised. Since then nothing has happened except the queue for
privatisation has disintegrated. The government's 98 per cent share remains
untouched.
Should it wish to sell, which is still spoken of as 'in about two years', it
would not have to pass enabling legislation as the ICC works in some ways
like a trustee bank. The Ulster Bank, Banque Nationale de Paris and
Kredietbank have at times been named as likely buyers. However, a
spokeswoman for ICC's newly installed chairman, Mr Ted MacRedmond, said the
ICC accepted that the climate is not right for bank sell-offs, and that
situation will not alter for at least two years.
Mr Kevin Barry, head of research at National City Brokers (NCB) in Dublin,
suggests Bord Gals and Aer Rianta, the Irish airports authority, as likely
candidates.
Aer Rianta, unlike the national carrier, Aer Lingus, has stayed in profit in
recent years, although it experienced a blip in 1991 which was put down to
the Gulf War.
'Aer Rianta is not even a semi-state body yet, but a department of the
administration, so it would have to be made a semi-state body in the first
place,' Mr Barry pointed out. Aer Rianta's annual profitability of around
IPounds 25m should make it easy to attract buyers.

Market's nerves steadied by Maastricht vote - Ireland has proved more
resilient to the recession than its main trading partners, and on economic
convergence criteria it is better placed for an early incorporation into
European monetary union than most of the EC's member-states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IRELAND is staying on the fast track to European monetary and political
union. The republic's overwhelming approval of the Maastricht Treaty, last
month, has steadied market nerves and steeled government resolve to forge
ahead with plans to place Ireland among the first group of EC countries to
adopt a single European currency by the end of the decade.
The 70:30 majority in favour of the treaty has given a powerful mandate to
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. The tough economic policies
that economic convergence requires, which are vital to continuing investor
confidence in the Irish economy, will continue.
The doomsday that had been depicted by Mr Reynolds (German fund managers
shouting 'Sell' down the telephone to their Irish gilts brokers, foreign
investors abandoning their factories and workforces, panic-stricken dealers
watching helplessly as the Irish stock market index dived off trading
screens in the wake of a No vote) was clearly sufficient to outweigh any
nagging doubts the average Irish voter might have had about abortion,
neutrality, and the environment within Greater Europe.
Pre-referendum tension has been replaced by a balmy, midsummer preoccupation
with more mundane affairs: Catholic schoolgirls sneak a lunchtime smoke in
the park, and lament having missed the recent Prince concert in Dublin; last
week's TV reports from Wimbledon caught the interest of beer-bellied
pub-goers; and the discovery, by a turf cutter, of a woman's skeleton in the
Wicklow mountains, occupied the imaginations of the tabloids' headline
writers.
But if the Irish government can afford itself some self-congratulation on
the Maastricht result, it cannot allow itself the luxury of complacency.
On the positive side, Ireland's economy has performed remarkably well over
the past year. It has proved more resilient to the recession than its main
trading partners, and on economic convergence criteria it is better placed
for an early incorporation into EMU than most of the EC member states. The
Central Bank's 1992 summer report records a 1.5 per cent growth in GNP in
1991, and a projection of 2.5 per cent growth for this year.
It notes 'an impressive performance of exports' in 1991, a further
improvement in the trade balance in 1992, and it predicts that the
government borrowing requirement of 2.4 per cent of GNP this year 'will be
broadly in line with budget targets.' Inflation was down to 3.2 per cent per
annum last year, and the currency stayed comfortably within the limits of
the upper band of the ERM.
None the less, a number of problems lie in ambush. Inflation is creeping up,
projected at 3.7 per cent for 1992. A tranche of public sector pay awards
has been deferred into 1993 and 1994, waiting to explode like a time-bomb
under the government's finances if economic growth over the next two years
is insufficient to increase tax revenues to meet the additional bills.
Failure to meet the awards would put an end to five years of relative peace
on the industrial relations front in Ireland.
An increase in EC structural and cohesion funds has been vectored in to the
government's budget calculations, to help fund essential infrastructural
projects, to offset anticipated losses of revenue resulting from EC tax
harmonisation measures, and to confront the rising unemployment problem
caused, in part, by the measures undertaken to put Ireland on course for
Emu.
Should the increase not be forthcoming, and economic recovery is delayed in
the UK and the US, two of Ireland's most important trading partners, then
the Irish government will face serious financial difficulties.
Privatisations offer some room for manoeuvre. But a lingering whiff of
scandal in several state enterprises, and a lack of political will in the
face of stiff union resistance, rule out any significant initiatives before
1994.
A continuing flow of inward investment thus remains the key to the
government's strategy for sustained economic growth.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, told a visiting group of US
businessmen recently: 'We are extremely dependent upon international trade.
That fundamental fact is the single greatest influence on our economic
policies.'
He declared that Ireland's commitment to a low-inflation economy, a strong
exchange rate policy and a responsible fiscal stance are central to
maintaining Ireland's competitiveness within the EC - and to provide a
stable platform for inward investment. 'Ireland can be your gateway to that
market,' he said.
US investment comprised 52.5 per cent of all overseas investment in Ireland
during the past two years. The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) notes
in its annual report, published at the end of June: 'There are over 1,000
overseas companies in Ireland employing 93,000 people and contributing
approximately IPounds 4.1bn to the Irish economy in wages and purchases.'
About 8 per cent of Ireland's total workforce, and almost 45 per cent of its
manufacturing workforce, are thus employed by foreign companies, which have
been attracted by low corporate tax rates, generous grants and Ireland's
skilled labour. But serious questions are now being raised as to whether
Ireland is getting value for its money.
The IDA reports that its grant-aided schemes created 12,439 new first-time
jobs in 1991 at a cost of IPounds 14,000 per job. Over the same period,
unemployment grew by almost 30,000. The unemployment total is expected to
hit 300,000 by the end of the year and, at 21 per cent of the workforce, is
already the highest rate in the EC.
Emigration has been the traditional escape valve to ease the demographic
pressures swelling the workforce, but in the past year this has proved to be
a two-way street. Not only has emigration halted, but emigres are returning
home to Ireland as jobs also disappear in the UK and the US. The Central
Bank estimates that in the absence of emigration an additional 20,000-25,000
jobs need to be created each year, to prevent unemployment rising higher.
Earlier this year, an important re-assessment of industrial policy was
elaborated, on behalf of the Industry ministry, by a think-tank of Irish
industrialists, financiers and trade unionists.
Their recommendations (published in what is known as the Culliton report)
are that the more labour-intensive food industries should be specifically
targeted for growth; that tax reform and a widening of the tax base should
be carried out urgently; that equity stakes rather than grants should be
increasingly used by the IDA to finance projects, and that the concessionary
10 per cent corporate tax rate for manufacturing industry should be phased
out after the year 2010.
Mr Ahern's Finance Bill this year has sought to address the report's
recommendations on taxation. He has closed many tax avoidance loopholes,
lowered the basic and top rates of income tax - and mounted a witchhunt to
catch evaders. But his move to encourage short-term savings, with a
concessionary 10 per cent tax rate on interest earnings, has angered the
investment community, which says that long-term savings are being adversely
affected - especially those destined for the equity markets. Brokers
identify this as one of the reasons for the poor performance of the equity
market at present. Mr Ahern has promised to review the bill.
The government is also under pressure to intervene in the insurance
industry, where non-life insurance business has suffered heavy losses in
recent years, pushing up premiums and making insurance very expensive in
Ireland.
Mr Brian Duncan, the outgoing president of the Irish Insurance Federation,
said recently: 'If the cost in Ireland exceeds the norm in other European
countries then it represents a real competitive disadvantage to Irish
firms.'
Awards on claims are increasingly settled through the courts in Ireland; the
result has been awards running at levels well above those in other European
Community countries. However, the government is wary of wading in with
legislation to limit court awards, partly for fear of a confrontation with
the judiciary, and the possible constitutional implications, but also
because it is from the courts that the next political crisis in Ireland may
emerge.
The scandals which led to the resignation last February of Mr Charles
Haughey, the former prime minister, have still to be cleared up. They are
currently bogged down in what appear to be interminable official inquiries.
Failure to nail the culprits will be seen as a political failure by the
government.
But the beef tribunal, the most explosive issue, will reach its denouement
in the coming weeks. Some of those expected to testify - regarding
allegations of political favouritism in the allocation of government export
credit insurance to beef processors such as Mr Larry Goodman, Ireland's and
Europe's biggest - are none other than Mr Haughey, Mr Reynolds, Mr Des
O'Malley, the Industry minister, and Mr Goodman himself.
The initial verbal sparring outside the courts indicates considerable
divergences of opinion over what actually happened in the granting of the
insurance for beef sales to Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 1988.
A cartoon recently published on the front page of the Irish Times summarised
a man-in-the-street's view of what went on. It portrayed a man holding out a
collecting can for contributions to different party funds to a housewife
replying 'No - I already gave at the butcher's'
Mr Reynolds and Mr O'Malley, the leaders of the two parties in the
government coalition, have so far made contradictory statements on those
events in 1988.
The Tribunal will either resolve them, or else they could lead the country
to an early general election.

OUTOKUMPU of Finland and Italy's SMI group are rationalising their copper
interests in Spain by forming a joint venture, Laminados Oviedo-Cordoba
(Locsa), writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The new company will manage the two group's previously separate rolled
copper and copper alloy manufacturing activities in Oviedo, Asturias and
Cordoba.
Locsa, with a headquarters in Madrid, is expected to have a Pta10bn (Dollars
105m) annual turnover.
The authorities in Brussels are due to be informed of the deal which has
been made necessary by the need to make Spanish operations more competitive.

EURO:RSCG, the French marketing services group formed recently by the merger
of Eurocom with RSCG, yesterday announced it was paying a total dividend of
FFr32.25 for 1991, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Societe Generale, the French bank, has invested in the group, which is one
of the leading players in European marketing services, by buying the 8.5 per
cent stake previously owned by the Suez industrial group. Suez has sold its
stake as part of its strategy of streamlining its investment portfolio.

THE Spanish daily newspaper El Pais and Italy's La Republica have each
agreed to take a 15 per cent stake in Publico, a respected Portuguese daily
newspaper launched two years ago, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Publico sells around 70,000 copies daily, making it one of the leading
Portuguese newspapers. Set up by journalists with finance provided by a
Portuguese entrepreneur, the newspaper is reported to have reached
break-even point.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Mary Robinson of Ireland yesterday urged an open and honest debate
on the country's long-standing policy of neutrality.
During a rare address to the two houses of parliament, she emphasised the
importance of European union for Ireland's future. 'We are a country which
has held on principle to a policy of non-involvement in military alliances;
yet we have a proper sense of responsibility to our partners. How do we
balance these things? We need to debate this honestly, aware that the
balance we strike and the approach we take can be both constructive and
exemplary,' she said.
Irish opponents of the Maastricht treaty fear it will lead to Irish troops
being sent abroad in aggressive as opposed to UN peacekeeping roles.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Brittan launches probeinto funding for Ilva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, yesterday launched a formal
inquiry into L650bn (Dollars 572.6m) state aid to Ilva, Italy's state steel
company, claiming he was helping Italy rein in spending.
But the new government in Rome had sought more time from Brussels to revise
its stock market flotation plan for the company, after it had declared a
loss for 1991.
Sir Leon refused to comment on the latest proposals received on Ilva. But he
said it was clear that, with the flotation gone awry, the company would need
other sources of private finance and the prospect of viability to justify
the L650bn as a normal investment, and not state aid.
'This opening of an inquiry should not in any way be regarded as a hostile
act towards the new government,' Sir Leon said.
The Commission could take several months to rule on the plan. It has the
power to scuttle the whole project and said it wanted to check whether the
injection of funds amounted to state aid or subsidy which might affect rival
steel companies in the Community.
The inquiry might be seen in the US as evidence that the Italian company is
subsidising exports there. The US steel industry has accused counterparts in
the EC of dumping on American markets.
The Commission came in for sharp criticism from the British government last
week when it closed a year-long inquiry and approved a funding package of
more than Dollars 1bn for Cie des Machines Bull, the French computer group.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru oil refinery sale attracts
lone bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS clashed head on with harsh reality on Tuesday when Petroperu,
Peru's state oil concern, made its first attempt to sell off a major asset.
The oil refinery of Conchan, a few miles south of the capital, failed to
reach its Dollars 8m reserve price at auction in Lima and will now be
re-offered within a month.
Potential buyers were put off by what they considered an excessively high
base price. 'In the current political climate in Peru, any investment is
risky and the price reflects that,' commented one.
The sale was reported to have aroused considerable initial interest - a
couple of dozen potential buyers included Chilean and Argentine interests
and the Marc Rich minerals marketing empire. Long-controlled fuel prices
were freed a week before the auction date, supposedly making it more
attractive.
Conchan produces less than 5 per cent of all oil refined in Peru - about
8,000 barrels a day, compared with the 100,000 b/d capacity of major
refineries at Talara and La Pampilla - but is excellently sited a few miles
south of the capital.
On the day, however, only one bid emerged, from Chile's Asfaltos Chilenos, a
small company interested in Conchan's virtual monopoly over provision of
asphalt in the central coastal area. High demand for asphalt is guaranteed
in a big repair programme for Peru's road system.
The Asfaltos Chilenos bid was for under Dollars 7m, around 15 per cent below
the base price and close to what is expected to be the re-offer price. The
fact that the only bidder was from Peru's age-old rival provoked a mild
outburst of nationalism in the Petroperu auditorium - a union leader, with
some support, stood to intone Peru's national anthem. Outside a band of
diehards chanted and waved banners accusing the state of giving away the
national patrimony.
But mines and energy minister Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, who also heads the
government's privatisation commission Copri, said the failure to sell
Conchan was incontrovertible proof that no special interests were being
favoured. He estimated that any buyer for Conchan would have to invest an
immediate Dollars 7m or Dollars 8m in modernisation and re-equipment.
'We'll go on auctioning it until we sell it,' he promised. 'But I'm
absolutely confident we'll get a buyer next time.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow settles back into narrow
trading range
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices settled down after Tuesday's program-related sharp losses,
but the underlying tone remained weak, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.89 at 3,293.28,
having spent most of the session only a few points off the opening mark. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished slightly firmer, up 1.11
at 410.27, while the Amex composite ended 0.40 lower at 379.86, and the
Nasdaq composite 0.20 higher at 557.61. Turnover on the NYSE was 201m
shares.
Overnight losses on foreign markets set the scene for a muted opening in New
York, but a rebound in the dollar and recent declines in bond yields helped
keep early declines to a minimum. Investors remained concerned, however,
about how second quarter corporate earnings will look. The first reports are
beginning to trickle in, and the market is unlikely to make up much of the
recent lost ground until it has clear proof of improvements in corporate
profits.
Among individual stocks, sports shoe makers were in the limelight. The
market leader, Nike, jumped Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/8 in heavy trading
after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings of 92 cents a
share, up from 76 cents a share and above the average of analysts'
forecasts.
Going in the other direction, LA Gear dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 10
5/8 on a second quarter loss of Dollars 1.29 a share after taking a 68 cents
a share litigation settlements charge.
Georgia-Pacific fell another Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 1/2 after Dean
Witter Reynolds, the broking house, cut its 1992 estimate to 50 cents a
share from Dollars 1.50 cents a share. This follow's the company's warning
on Tuesday that it would only just break even in the second quarter.
Giant Industries rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 6 1/2 after the company
projected second quarter net income of as much as 27 cents a share, which
would represent a strong turnround from the loss it incurred at the same
stage a year ago.
First Virginia Banks rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/4 on news of second
quarter earnings well up on a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, Roadway Services fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 62
after the broking house, Alex Brown &amp; Sons, cut its rating for the stock
from 'buy' to 'neutral' and lowered its 1992 earnings estimate from Dollars
3.79 a share to Dollars 3.50 a share.
Durr-Fillauer jumped Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/2 after the rival drug
and healthcare group, Bergen Brunswig, announced that it had made an offer
for the company of Dollars 26 a share.
Exabyte Corp rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 29 3/8 after the company reported
second quarter net income of 54 cents a share, well up from the 30 cents a
share of the second quarter of 1991.
Canada
TORONTO share prices closed little changed in moderate trading. Based on
preliminary data, the TSE 300 composite index gained 2.09 points, or 0.06
per cent, to 3,418.38. Advances edged declines 269 to 260, volume of 24.3m
was below the previous 30.8m, and trading value was CDollars 268.9m against
CDollars 361m.
The real estate sub-group posted the day's biggest decline, down 1.71 per
cent on index.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar sinks in chaotic market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar dropped on the foreign exchanges yesterday, in what some traders
called the most volatile day for the US currency in many months, writes
James Blitz.
It slipped below DM1.50 for the first time in 17 months - a victim to heavy
selling - after Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, said at the
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich that he
was unconcerned if the dollar went below that figure.
That comment triggered heavy selling on Tuesday night and yesterday morning,
with the dollar closing at DM1.4750 against the German currency in London
trading.
In the afternoon, the dollar recovered ground after Mr Brady retracted his
comment, telling the Reuters news agency that 'we are not seeking to
depreciate the dollar.' Other dealers said that the dollar's recovery may
have been boosted by technical factors, with many traders suddenly finding
themselves too short of the US currency. By the day's end in London, the
dollar was at DM1.496 compared to a previous close of DM1.4980. But traders
pointed out that it had oscillated through nearly three pfennigs in the
previous 24 hours. In late American trading, the US currency was again
weakening at around DM1.4935.
Many dealers believe that the dollar will continue to encounter highly
volatile trading in forthcoming days, with every chance that it will sink to
its all-time low against the D-Mark of DM1.4430. Other analysts recall that
the kind of volatility seen yesterday can sometimes herald a considerable
change in a currency's fortunes, and at least one analyst remained bullish
about the dollar.
However, the overwhelming feeling towards the dollar in the market was
bearish. Mr Christian Dunis, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London
said: 'The problem of the day is to get the US economic recovery going.
'If that is at the cost of a weaker dollar, then so be it.'
The other important action was in sterling/D-Mark trading, with the pound
finishing the day over 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the previous night's close at
DM2.8720. Sterling's losses were partly a product of the D-Mark's huge gains
against the dollar. But many traders explained the pound's fall by
uncertainty over the Bank of England's intentions on interest rates.
Last Friday, the Bank shaved the rates at which it deals in longer-dated
money. The expectation was that the Bank would signal a cut in base rates
later. But this has not materialised, and one London-based analyst said that
the Bank had left dealers trying to guess whether a cut was in the offing or
not.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper prices surge to 18-month
peaks
</HEADLINE>

COPPER'S PRICE surged again to fresh 18-month peaks on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday after Poland's copper mining unions called an all-out
strike for July 20.
But some producers cautioned that world economic conditions did not justify
the market's apparent optimism.
Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest
mining group, told brokers in Tokyo he was surprised by some copper price
forecasts because there was no evidence the recession was ending.
He was asked whether the copper price would reach Dollars 1.50 a lb and said
this was unlikely.
However, Sir Derek suggested that copper prices would be more resilient than
those of other metals because copper demand and supply were finely balanced.
Mr Paul Hansen, president of the Highland Valley Copper company in Canada,
told the Reuter news agency there was not enough underlying demand for the
metal to enable copper to maintain its recent upward momentum. 'North
America and Japan are still mired in recession and we really don't see the
fundamentals in place at this point,' he added.
Copper 'could easily fall back and maybe go below Dollars 1 a lb.'
The metal's price in London has risen by nearly 9 per cent in a little over
a week from Dollars 1.04 to Dollars 1.13 a lb even though Asarco, one of the
big US copper producers, signed new labour contracts without any problems
and although the Polish news and had been widely expected. Traders pointed
out that there was still time for the Polish government to avert the strike
by reaching an agreement with the miners.
Pay talks are to start today at Poland's giant KGHM copper producing combine
between management and miners' unions. The unions are demanding a 30 per
cent wage increase and are backed strongly by the workforce of nearly
40,000, which recently voted overwhelmingly for strike action in a shop
floor ballot.
Such a pay increase would require an easing by the government of prohibitive
taxes controlling state sector wages. So far all that the authorities have
conceded is not to tax wages earned at the weekend on condition that ore
mining and refined copper output increases.
Miners' hopes of having their demands accepted rose recently after talks
with representatives of Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the PSL farmers' party leader,
who yesterday dropped an abortive month-long effort to form a new
government. A short wildcat stoppage on Monday at the Rudna and the
Sieroszowice copper ore pits saw miners calling for Mr Pawlak as prime
minister.
In any event the conflict promises to be the first challenge facing the new
government, which will be led by Ms Hanna Suchocka and is likely to be
installed at the weekend.
The unions are also demanding that the government explain its privatisation
plans for KGHM. Asarco, the US metals producer recently offered to manage
the combine under a three-year contract while Australia's Western Mining
Corporation is talking with it about a joint venture.
KGHM produced 165,000 tonnes of copper in the first five months of this
year, an increase of 2.5 per cent on the same period last year.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries run out of steam ahead of
auction

AFTER several consecutive days of strong gains, US Treasury prices weakened
yesterday ahead of the afternoon auction of seven-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 104
17/32 , yielding 7.605 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down
3/32 at 101 5/32 , to carry a yield of 4.365 per cent.
Although prices firmed overnight on foreign markets, when trading opened in
New York dealers quickly pushed Treasuries lower as they prepared for the
afternoon sale of Dollars 9.75bn in seven-year notes. The five-year note was
particularly heavily sold as dealers raised cash for the auction.
That cash was put to good use when the auction commenced, and in the wake of
solid demand for the new issue, the sale of seven-year notes was closed out
at an average yield of 6.44 per cent, with a one-point tail and with 39 per
cent of all bids tendered at the high yield.
In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve intervened with a round of
overnight system repurchase agreements in an attempt to counter a firm Fed
funds rate by adding reserves to the system. Fed funds had been trading at 3
3/8 per cent, above its new target of 3 1/4 per cent. By late afternoon,
however, Fed funds were still trading above their target at 3 1/2 per cent.
EUROPEAN bond prices were stable yesterday as a bland G7 communique failed
to provide markets with any direction.
Gilt prices ended fractionally weaker, when sterling slipped outside the
notional narrow band it has been tracking in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The currency weakness undermined the otherwise bullish tone of the market,
dealers said.
'There has been a marked rally over the last week,' said Mr Simon Briscoe,
economist at Midland Montagu. '(Yesterday's slight weakness) represents a
slight retrenchment, rather than a setting in of pessimism.'
The market has been slightly soggy, because most of last Friday's Pounds
600m gilts tap is still unplaced.
GERMAN bund prices ended unchanged as traders positioned themselves ahead of
today's issue of 10-year bunds. The new issue is expected to total DM10bn to
DM15bn, and to have an 8 per cent coupon, and to be priced above par,
according to traders.
IN JAPAN, government bonds reached a two-and-a-half-year high as sentiment
was buoyed by the strength of the yen. The benchmark No 129 traded at 5.17
per cent in Japanese trading before the price fell slightly to end at 5.22
per cent in European trading.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, expects the market to
'continue to firm', underpinned by weak economic demand in Japan, as well as
a firm currency.

CEMENTOS MEXICANOS, stung by a 17 per cent fall in its shares after agreeing
to buy Valenciana de Cementos, Spain's largest cement producer, yesterday
revealed it had no intention of buying the whole company.
It said it would pay Dollars 1.25bn for just 74.1 per cent of the Spanish
company.
Earlier pronouncements by the Spanish advisers to Cemex, the world's
fourth-largest cement-maker, had said it was taking control of 100 per cent
of Valenciana, which would have cost it close to Dollars 1.7bn.
The Mexican company said yesterday, however, that 25.9 per cent of
Valenciana, held as treasury stock by the Spanish company, would not form
part of the takeover offer it has made.
Valenciana accumulated the treasury stock earlier this year when it bought
full control of an affiliate which, in turn, owned Valenciana shares. The
company, by law, has three years to dispose of it.
Cemex has so far paid Dollars 419m, privately, for 24.9 per cent of
Valenciana held mostly by the Serratosa family that controls Valenciana and
by the Scandinavian producers, Akem and Euroc.
It has also been promised a further 29.1 per cent by the Serratosas, Aker
and Euroc at the formal public offer price of Pta15,075 a share. That will
cost another Dollars 496m.
The 20.1 per cent of Valencia traded on the markets will cost another
Dollars 343m if all the shareholders take up the offer.
Officials said Cemex would pay Dollars 500m in cash for the acquisition and
the company had been promised financing worth at least Dollars 750m by
Citibank.
The acquisition will raise Cemex's debt to capital ratio from 38 to 44 per
cent, according to J. P. Morgan, who advised on the deal.

CBS Inc, which owns one of the three US television networks, yesterday
reported a 39 per cent jump in second-quarter income, helped by an improving
climate for US network advertising and its rise to the top of the prime time
television ratings.
The group reported net income of Dollars 70.1m, or Dollars 4.53 a share,
compared with Dollars 50.6m, or Dollars 3.31 a share, in the second quarter
of last year.
Sales increased by 10 per cent, from Dollars 710m to Dollars 780m.
The figures were at the top end of analysts' expectations. The shares,
however, ended the day at Dollars 195 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange for
a net fall of Dollars  7/8 .
The company said the television network's unit prices improved in the prime
time, day time and late night time periods.
Network sales were also bolstered by the broadcast of two basketball
competition semi-finals during the quarter. In 1991 the semi-finals were
aired in the first quarter.
But while demand for network television advertising improved, local TV and
radio advertising remained sluggish.
Sales and profits of the CBS television stations division increased,
primarily because of the acquisition of two new businesses, while CBS
Radio's earnings fell, due mainly to sales weakness.
The company's net interest income was Dollars 8.9m, down from Dollars 10.8m,
and its cash and marketable securities at the end of the period totalled
Dollars 1.4bn, compared with debt of Dollars 1.1bn a year earlier.
For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 88.7m, or
Dollars 5.75 a share, up from Dollars 73.9m, or Dollars 4.29 a share for
last year's comparative period. Sales for the half-year increased from
Dollars 1.46bn to Dollars 1.86bn.

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Merger will create Japan's
largest paper manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JUJO PAPER and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, two leading Japanese paper producers,
yesterday announced a merger that will create the country's largest
papermaker.
The merger follows two difficult years for the Japanese paper industry,
which rapidly expanded production capacity during the 'bubble' era of the
late 1980s, only to find demand and prices falling sharply last year.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange said yesterday that it will investigate trading in
the shares of Jujo and Sanyo-Kokusaku, as prices of both companies rose
sharply in a variable market before the exchange suspended trading in the
stocks. Jujo had risen Y26 to Y536 and Sanyo-Kokusaku by Y27 to Y578.
Jujo, the third-ranking company, and Sanyo-Kokusaku, fifth-ranked, reported
sharp profit falls of 49 per cent and 68 per cent respectively last fiscal
year, despite cuttingproduction costs and bolstering earnings with sales of
securities.
Executives of the two companies said the paper market had been damaged by
'excessive competition' and that the yet-to-named new company, to be formed
next April, would rationalise production facilities and 'stabilise the paper
industry'.
However, like all Japanese companies, the new management will find it
difficult to reduce its workforce. Miss Caroline Stone, paper industry
specialist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the merger could take five years
to produce positive results.
'It is very difficult in Japan for management to reduce staff. Apart from
sheer size, it is difficult to see what Jujo paper will gain from
Sanyo-Kokusaku. Perhaps it is just the attraction of being the biggest,'
Miss Stone said.
The likely emergence of Jujo as the largest company in the industry is a
blow to Oji Paper, the present market leader, as Jujo was separated from Oji
group - a member of the Mitsui family of companies - after the Second World
War in an attempt to rid Japan of its monopolies. After the planned merger,
Jujo-Sanyo will have a 17 per cent market share and Oji about 16 per cent.
In the late 1960s, Oji, Jujo and Honshu, another original member of the Oji
group, planned to reunite, but the move was opposed by Japan's Fair Trade
Commission.
The announcement of the agreement comes 20 years after the merger that
created Sanyo-Kokusaku itself. The company still shows signs of having been
unable to blend the separate management structures. Mergers in Japan often
result in disillusionment among workers in the smaller partner, who feel at
a disadvantage in the new hierarchy.
Under the agreement announced yesterday, the president of the new company
will be Mr Takeshiro Miyashita, the Jujo president, while the more
ceremonial post of chairman will go to Mr Choji Kuramochi, the current
chairman of Sanyo-Kokusaku, which will essentially be dissolved.
The problems in Japan's paper industry, forced this year to cut production
levels to reduce inventory, were also highlighted yesterday by reports of a
restructuring at Daishowa Paper, the second-largest maker, which had been
ordered by its banks to reduce debt through asset sales.
Japanese paper companies are known for supporting their often weak operating
profits with sales of securities or property holdings, but the continuing
downturn in both the stock and property markets has limited these sources of
funds.
Daishowa's banks are understood to have asked the Saito family, which
oversees the company, to increase their investment to strengthen its
financial position.

THE contrasting fortunes of Nike and LA Gear, two of the biggest sports shoe
and apparel makers, was underscored yesterday when they turned in results
for the three months to May 31.
Nike, which has steadily improved its performance in spite of the recession
and a weak retail climate, said its fourth-quarter net income grew 21 per
cent to Dollars 70.7m, or 92 cents a share, from Dollars 58.6m, or 76 cents,
a year earlier. Revenues rose 18 per cent to Dollars 847.6m from Dollars
719m.
Nike's results were stronger than Wall Street had expected, and the shares
jumped Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/8 at midday yesterday.
For the full year, Nike's net earnings rose 15 per cent to Dollars 329.2m,
or Dollars 4.30, from Dollars 287m, or Dollars 3.77, in 1991. Revenues
advanced to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3bn.
Mr Philip Knight, chairman and chief executive, said futures orders for the
next six months were up 17 per cent, which 'sets the stage for another
record year in 1993. This increase reflects US retailers' continued success
with Nike products in an otherwise difficult retail environment.'
He added the company was committed to achieving revenues of Dollars 6bn by
1996.
LA Gear, which brought in a new management team this year in an attempt to
reverse its fortunes, posted a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 24.4m, or
Dollars 1.29. The results were distorted by an after-tax charge of Dollars
13.9m, or 68 cents, from the settlement of lawsuits.
In the 1991 second quarter, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 4m, or 20
cents, including losses from discontinued operations of 3 cents a share.
Sales dropped 36.9 per cent in the 1992 quarter to Dollars 104.7m from
Dollars 166m, reflecting a drop in shoes sold and a fall in selling prices
as LA Gear continues to liquidate inventory.
The company expects to stay in the red for the rest of 1992 as it continues
to liquidate old inventory and increases promotional spending.

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Amoco and Unocal plan job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO US energy groups - both affected by declining earnings and the weak US
demand for oil and gas products - yesterday announced wide-ranging job cuts,
asset disposals and corporate restructuring plans.
Amoco, the fifth-biggest US energy company, said it would take an Dollars
800m after-tax charge against second-quarter earnings to cover costs of
write-offs, restructuring and workforce reductions.
The company, which aims to save Dollars 600m of annual operating costs a a
result of its 'strategic reassessment' of business operations, said that by
the end of 1993 it expected some 8,500 employees to have departed.
This would represent a cut of nearly 16 per cent of the Amoco workforce,
which totalled 54,120 at the end of 1991.
Amoco also said it would cut its planned 1992 capital spending by 12 per
cent, to Dollars 3.3bn. This would leave the 1992 capital and exploration
budget some 17 per cent below the 1991 spending level.
The Dollars 800m Amoco charge includes about Dollars 250m to cover
anticipated losses on the abandonment of oil and gas producing properties,
Dollars 220m for write-offs and reserves in Amoco' chemical operation,
Dollars 160m to cover other reserve and asset write-offs and Dollars 170m to
cover the cost of workforce reductions.
Unocal, the California-based energy group that in April unveiled plans to
sell at least Dollars 700m of assets and reduce the size of its workforce,
yesterday announced a corporate reorganisation that would eliminate 1,100
jobs.
Like other US oil and gas companies, Amoco and Unocal are feeling the
pressure of reduced margins, weak demand and recession. A number of
companies, such as Chevron and Mobil, have announced asset disposals and
cuts in capital spending budgets as part of their efforts to struggle
through the difficult operating environment.
Unocal said its decision to reorganise its corporate structure would help to
accelerate its plan to lower group debt by Dollars 1.5bn - from Dollars
4.6bn at present - over the next five years.
Another key step the company said it was considering would be the decision
to try and raise about Dollars 500m by way of a private placement of
securities that would be convertible into 7 per cent of Unocal's outstanding
share base.
The 1,100 job cuts include 450 positions in petroleum and geothermal energy
exploration and production and 400 jobs on the downstream side of the
business. Unocal also plans to reduce its corporate and research staff
numbers from 1,600 to 1,350. The company's total workforce at the end of
1991 was 17,000.
Unocal reckons its cost reductions will increase its after-tax cash flow by
Dollars 200m a year, starting in 1993. The company said its after-tax cash
flow in 1991 was Dollars 1.24bn.
Unocal also said it would close it regional office in Schaumburg, Illinois
by September 1993, either transferring or making redundant the 600 people
who work there.
Unocal plans to take a Dollars 35m charge in its third quarter as a result
of the cuts.

MARRIOTT Corporation, the large but indebted hotels group, yesterday
revealed a modest improvement in second-quarter profits and said it hoped
recent domestic air fare wars would boost its summer business.
In the second quarter, to June 19, Marriott made an operating profit of
Dollars 125m, compared with Dollars 123m, on turnover of Dollars 2.03bn
(Dollars 1.94bn). After-tax profits were up from Dollars 27m to Dollars 29m.
The shares closed unchanged at Dollars 16 1/8 .
Marriott said, however, that the figures included a number of non-comparable
items. Without these complicating factors, it claimed, that operating
profits would have shown an 8 per cent rise, while after-tax profits would
have been up by 28 per cent.
The company's lodging division showed a 6 per cent sales gain, year-on-year,
while operating profits were up by 9 per cent. Minus the non-comparable
items, this latter figure would have been up by 19 per cent.
On the contract services side, Marriott posted a 4 per cent sales increase
but saw operating profits fall by 16 per cent,. - a decline which it blamed
on the slow economic recovery.

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Air France gets ready to fly
into battle - A look at the more aggressive attitude adopted by the national
carrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNARD Attali is bracing himself for what he calls 'the mother of all
battles' in the airline industry.
'We haven't seen anything yet. It's going to be a terrible earthquake and we
are all going to be engaged in a frightful war for the next 10 years,' says
Mr Attali, whose mandate as chairman of Air France has has just been renewed
by the French government for another three years.
During the past three years, Mr Attali has been preparing Air France by
attempting to transform the French state-owned carrier into a more
aggressive, market-orientated enterprise.
His task has not been easy. The group has lost a total of FFr1.4bn (Dollars
270m) during the past two years. Mr Attali expects Air France to show
another loss this year, although he hopes his group will return to the black
in 1993.
Air France, like other airlines, has suffered from the combined effects of
the recession in many world markets and the hangover from the slump caused
by the Gulf crisis. The expected recovery in traffic has been elusive.
The pressures are now building up on the airline and the industry. Capacity
continues to outstrip demand. Airlines have launched a fares war to try to
fill empty seats and protect market shares. Air transport liberalisation in
Europe next year will intensify competition while the large US carriers
continue their onslaught on the European market.
'We are number one in Europe in terms of turnover and our ambition is to
remain number one,' says Mr Attali. But, despite its size (Air France had
sales of FFr57.6bn last year), Mr Attali concedes his airline continues to
be regarded by some as 'a big, sleepy, monopolistic elephant'. But he claims
this is no longer true and that Air France is changing fast.
'I'm a chess player, and the first lesson in chess is never underestimate
the opposition. Many of our competitors are clearly making that mistake,' he
says with a touch of defiance.
Mr Attali's strategy has focused on restructuring operations while
strengthening market position by acquisitions and partnerships. His target
is to achieve productivity gains averaging 5 per cent a year. Between
1991-1993, Air France will have shed 11 per cent of its ground staff.
He has also been reorganising the structure of the company by integrating
Air France and UTA, the independent French long-haul carrier which he took
over two years ago. He also acquired control of Air Inter, the domestic
French carrier, which is continuing to operate under its own identity.
'The UTA and Air Inter deals were fundamental for Air France. Without them I
would have now felt very uncomfortable,' he says, explaining that it was
critical for Air France to consolidate its position in its domestic market
to compete against other big European carriers already dominant in their
home markets.
The next step was to develop alliances in Europe. He achieved this by
acquiring this year a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena, the Belgian airline,
and leading a group of investors to take a 40 per cent interest in CSA, the
Czechoslovakian state carrier. He now intends to look farther afield in an
effort to forge partnerships with carriers in America and the Asia-Pacific
region.
Air France has also been reviewing its marketing strategy in response to the
new competitive pressures and especially the growing North Atlantic fight
against US carriers. It has introduced a frequent flier programme, is
investing heavily in training, and is seeking to enhance its customer
service. It has also joined in the latest transatlantic fares war by
announcing discounts of up to 35 per cent on some tickets.
Mr Attali regards the US as posing the most immediate threat to Air France.
He has lobbied hard to secure a more favourable bilateral air service
agreement between France and the US for his airline. Since the new breed of
giant US carriers like American Airlines, United and Delta have started
expanding into Europe and France, the French carrier has seen its share of
the transatlantic market decline from around 50 per cent to just over 30 per
cent.
'In 10 years' time we risk being under the domination of US carriers,' Mr
Attali says, arguing for the need for greater consolidation in the European
airline industry. Competition policies must enable European carriers to
develop into significant global entities. 'The problem in Europe is that
there are about 60 airlines that matter, and that's 40 too many,' he says.
Although the French government has sought to delay the implementation of
full liberalisation in Europe, Mr Attali says he is not worried by the
recently-approved third package of EC liberalisation measures. Indeed, he
plans to take advantage of it and is considering operating domestic services
in other EC count-ries, including the UK.
In turn, his UK rival BA is also expected to expand in the domestic French
market. BA is especially interested in setting up joint ventures with
smaller carriers in other EC states to operate domestic services in these
countries. In France, BA has been talking with TAT, the French independent
regional carrier. 'If BA does a deal with TAT, it won't find life easy in
France,' Mr Attali warns.
He also warns liberalisation could backfire as long as the congestion
problems of European air traffic and airports are not resolved.
'It's difficult to see how you can put even more aircraft in the skies if
the adequate infrastructure is not in place,' he says.
Improving the quality of his airline is a priority. 'We already have a
strong product and that is one of our strengths,' he claims. In anticipation
of the forthcoming battle, the other strengths he plans to build on are the
extensive size of his airline's international network, his domestic market,
and his hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle with considerable expansion potential
and its connection with the French TGV high-speed rail network.
Mr Attali is also continuing to shop around for opportunities. 'There is
bound to be an acceleration in deal-making between airlines in the current
climate,' he says. 'The problem is to be in a position to choose your
partner and not to be chosen first.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: French, German insurers bring
end to hostilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AACHENER und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-largest
insurance group, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of France's
biggest insurance groups, yesterday reached a surprise accord after months
of bitter hostilities.
The companies announced they had reached agreement over voting rights
attached to AGF's stake in AMB, giving it full voting strength. AMB's
management previously has refused to recognise the full voting rights on
AGF's holding - as it is entitled to do under German company law - prompting
legal action from the French company. AGF's stake will be limited to 25 per
cent plus one vote.
Hostilities were set to come to a head at AMB's annual meeting in Aachen on
Tuesday next week, at which AGF had intended to launch a series of
challenges to the German company. Yesterday, AGF said it would drop its
legal actions and abandon its opposition to the AMB board at the forthcoming
AGM.
The agreement is also set to pave the way to bring in Credit Lyonnais, the
French bank, as a majority shareholder in BfG Bank, Germany's sixth-largest
private commercial bank. This is at present majority-owned by AMB and has
been a substantial drain on AMB's resources since it bought its stake for
DM1.9bn in 1987.
AGF and AMB will implement a co-operation agreement first negotiated in 1990
but never put into effect because of AMB's insistence that the agreement was
a barely-disguised bid for management control.
A joint press release insisted that the agreement would not lead to the
unscrambling of AMB's existing co-operation agreement with Fondiaria of
Italy and Royal Insurance of the UK.
They said they would do everything in their power to make sure that Credit
Lyonnais would take a majority stake in the bank by the beginning of next
year - thus giving the French bank access to the German banking market and
relieving AMB of further financial strains.
Together with BGAG, the trades union holding company which owns the
remainder of BfG's shares, AMB has injected DM1.5bn (Dollars 980m) into the
bank since the purchase and has recently indicated that a further DM950m
will be needed before the bank is able to stand on its own feet in 1994.
Another large French insurer, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), is still
locked in talks with Suez, the French industrial group, over its attempt to
expand into Germany. UAP hopes to swap its shares in Victoire, a Suez
insurance subsidiary, for a 50 per cent stake in Colonia, the German insurer
that Victoire controls.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Panel stops publication of Greene King
results
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENE KING, the East Anglia-based brewer which is engaged in a hostile
Pounds 102.6m bid for Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, has been prevented
by the Takeover Panel from publishing its results for the year to May 3
1992.
The Panel decided that publication of the results, due to take place today,
could have affected the outcome of the bid.
Greene King, after buying a further 100,000 Morland shares, has 47 per cent
of Morland. The offer closes on Friday, although it can be extended until
July 27.
Over the past few weeks Greene King has been challenged by Morland to issue
a profit forecast for the year. Greene King's stockbrokers have forecast
that full year pre-tax profits would slip from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 18.8m
or Pounds 18.5m. Greene King was also planning to announce the revaluation
of its assets which it does every five years. The last revaluation was in
1987.
Greene King is offering 4.5 convertible shares - which yesterday amounted to
484p - for each Morland share. There is a cash alternative of 450p.
Both companies were constrained by the Panel in what they could say publicly
about the decision. However, Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, said
he was extremely disappointed by the Panel's decision.
He added that current trading conditions remained 'most satisfactory' and
that the board still intended to rec-ommend a final dividend of 8.1p.
Greene King believed its results would have bolstered its position, while
Morland believed the opposite.
As Greene King's results will not be published until after the end of the
offer period Morland's shareholders will not know who was right until after
they have decided whether or not to accept Greene King's offer.

The ITV companies want to buy a package of the company's most famous
programmes for next year's schedule in a deal worth about Pounds 22m.
The programmes include The Bill, This Is Your Life, Wish You Were Here, and
Minder.
After Thames was outbid by Carlton Television in last year's competitive
tenders, Mr Richard Dunn, Thames's chief executive, said his main aim was to
become the UK's leading independent television producer. He declined to
comment last night because he had not yet received the details of the ITV
offer.
The deal can only be for the first eight months of next year because ITV has
not yet got its new network commissioning structure in place. That structure
also needs to be approved by the Office of Fair Trading.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity ahead 35% - Growth in
distribution profits outweighs supply deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EASTERN Electricity yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 143.1m for
the 12 months to March 31, a 35 per cent advance on last year's pro-forma
Pounds 130.6m.
The group, the last of the 12 regional electricity companies to report,
lifted earnings per share by 30 per cent from 29.8p to 38.6p.
A final dividend of 11.85p is recommended, making a total for the year of
16.7p. This represents a 15.5 per cent improvement, the second highest in
the industry.
Unlike most regional companies which benefited this year because of the
effects of undercharging in 1991, Eastern's profits were depressed by
undercharging in both years. Without this effect, the increase would have
been about 23 per cent.
Because of this undercharging, as well as rising costs, bad debts and
depreciation, the company's supply business, which buys and sells bulk
electricity, incurred a loss of Pounds 9.7m compared with a profit of Pounds
14.6m the year before.
Mr James Smith, chairman, said Eastern's pricing policy was designed to give
customers excellent value for money. Average electricity bills in Eastern's
area were the lowest in England and Wales, he said.
Most of Eastern's income was earned by the distribution business, which made
Pounds 175.9m (Pounds 114.7m). This was partly due to higher tariffs, but
also to electricity sales growth of 1.8 per cent, above the average for the
country.
Costs in the electricity business fell by 3.6 per cent in real terms, saving
Pounds 8m as 250 jobs were lost, mainly in the distribution business.
The retail business made a trading profit of about Pounds 2m, but Pounds
5.6m of restructuring charges relating to the company's retailing
joint-venture with Southern Electric, set up during the year, turned that
into a loss.
Similar restructuring charges depressed profits for contracting and
generation, giving an overall loss of Pounds 9.3m for the company's
non-regulated businesses.
Next year the supply business should be in profit as the Pounds 12m lost
from undercharging this year is not expected to recur.
Retail may break even or make a small loss and the restructuring costs will
not recur in the non-core businesses. Electricity sales are expected to grow
by about 1 per cent.
COMMENT
Eastern's loss on the supply side implies bad management and the company is
unlikely to recover this year the short fall from that undercharging. But it
can console itself that the loss has depressed profits and the rate of
return to levels more pleasing to the regulator. And although the company
increased its prices by an above average 3.22 per cent this April, it still
charges less per unit than other regional companies. Eastern also outshone
most regionals on cost cutting. Shareholders may wonder whether the outlook
for the underlying businesses justifies the substantial dividend increase.
The cover at 2.3 times is low for the sector. The City forecasts pre-tax
profits of Pounds 160m-Pounds 187m for the year to March 1993, putting the
company on a p/e of 5.6 to 6.3. A dividend in the range of 17.5p to 18.25p
is forecast.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Isosceles equity likely to be rendered
worthless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 70 or more institutions with investments in Isosceles, the owner of the
struggling Gateway supermarket chain, are continuing to haggle about the
terms of a refinancing, but it seems increasingly likely that the company's
Pounds 400m slab of equity will be rendered worthless.
This week 3i, the venture capital group, wrote off its Pounds 45m equity
holding in Isosceles in its latest set of figures. This move followed the
disclosure in May by Mercury Asset Management, the fund management
subsidiary of SG Warburg, that it had written down its holding of Isosceles'
equity by an undisclosed amount.
Wasserstein Perella, the US investment group, has the biggest exposure to
Isosceles' equity with a 40 per cent stake. But the latest set of accounts
filed at Companies House by Newgateway, which holds the shares on behalf of
Wasserstein Perella, showed that it had not yet written down their value.
Standard Chartered, GE Capital, CINVen, and Murray Johnstone are the other
big institutional equity holders. But 4,000 private shareholders who
subscribed for Isosceles shares when it acquired Gateway three years ago are
also locked into the company.
The refinancing talks have been plagued by the conflicting pressures of
paying down debt and re-investing in the core business to keep it
competitive. The company is seeking increased financial headroom to enable
it to back its Food Giant and Somerfield chains.
However, the talks are also complicated by the different demands of the
holders of the three classes of capital: senior debt, mezzanine debt and
equity. Some individual investors hold more than one class.
An Isosceles spokesman said yesterday: 'We do not know when these talks are
going to conclude but they are making positive progress.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / Walbrook Insurance faces liquidation threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALBROOK INSURANCE Company, a subsidiary of London United Investment which
is in administration, faces the possibility of liquidation after a new
analysis of its reserves has shown that it has negative shareholder funds.
The 200 principal policyholders of the company have been invited to meetings
in Chicago today and London next Monday to consider four separate options as
to its future.
In a letter to policyholders earlier this month, Sir Ian Morrow, chairman,
invited them to hear the directors describe 'the deterioration in Walbrook's
current financial position, and propose a plan which they believe should
achieve long-term solvency'. The board is believed to favour proposing an
informal scheme of arrangement by which they would remain in charge, with
creditors receiving 100 cents in the dollar, but then returning 60 cents
immediately in exchange for preferred stock.
The three other options are a formal scheme of arrangement, provisional
liquidation or liquidation.
Provisional accounts circulated by Walbrook for the year to December 31,
1991, are believed to show negative net worth of more than Dollars 160m
(Pounds 83m). It has gross reserves of more than Dollars 1.5bn.
Walbrook announced on May 29 this year that it would no longer be paying out
on claims. That followed a report from its actuaries that it had had to
increase its reserves, which had the effect of making it insolvent.
Separately, Transit Casualty Company, a Missouri-based insurance company
which went into receivership in 1985 and which is one of Walbrook's larger
creditors, filed a petition for provisional liquidation in the High Court in
London.
Walbrook has been known to be in difficulties since an announcement by the
Department of Trade and Industry in March 1990 that it would cease writing
new business.
That application was postponed by Mr Justice Harman until July 15 to allow
Walbrook time to discuss its position with creditors.
Some of the policyholders, including Transit, are also creditors with other
subsidiaries in the LUI group, and have been disgruntled at the large legal
expenses and slow progress of insolvency proceedings on these other
companies.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Investment trusts drop short of target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORNTON Investment Management yesterday announced that its European Smaller
Companies investment trust had raised Pounds 35.5m, barely a third of its
original Pounds 100m target.
It said the launch had been hit by the gloomy sentiment which afflicted the
market at the end of June, following the abandonment of the GPA Group
flotation and disappointment with the MFI Furniture Group and The Telegraph
launches.
Thornton's offer period opened on June 15 and closed last Monday.
Thornton's trust was chaired by Mr Peter Walker, the former cabinet minister
who was created a life peer in the dissolution honours list. The trust also
had an ambitious fund management structure, with duties split between
Thornton in the UK, BNP in France, and Dresdner in Germany. It was marketed
to institutions and retail consumers in all three countries.
Mr David Harding, institutional marketing manager at Thornton, said take-up
had been strongest on the retail side, particularly in Germany where the
issue had strong support from Dresdner's branch network. UK institutions
accounted for the most disappointing figures.
He said: 'Our original target was higher and I think we would have made it
if it hadn't been for the sharp deterioration in the UK new issues market in
the weeks coming up to the launch. Maybe they are taking an enlightened view
of the markets in Europe.'
Henderson Administration reported a similar problem with its newly launched
EuroTrust investment trust, whose offer period ended last week. It aimed for
'at least Pounds 20m', and forecast Pounds 25m, but raised only Pounds
17.3m. A sudden outbreak of gloomy sentiment caused by failed new issues and
the BP boardroom coup was blamed.
Mr Alan Gadd, director of investment trusts at Henderson, said: 'I have
never experienced such a change in sentiment as we saw among stockbrokers in
the last 10 days of June. That was remarkable, and there's no doubt that is
the reason why we were under what we had anticipated.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / GPA bankers in talks on new equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group's investment bankers recently approached the Kuwait Investment
Office and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority about the placement of up to
Dollars 500m (Pounds 260m) new shares to plug the gap in the aircraft
leasing group's finances.
Discussions about the new shares centred on their being offered for sale at
about Dollars 12 compared with a price range of Dollars 20 to Dollars 25 in
last month's aborted Dollars 800m flotation. In the UK, a proposed
two-for-one share split meant the shares were offered at between Dollars 10
and Dollars 12.50.
At Dollars 12 a share on an unsplit basis the group would be valued at about
Dollars 1.1bn. If the planned flotation had taken place, the group would
have been valued at Dollars 2.4bn.
In a separate development, Moody's, the credit rating agency, downgraded the
long-term debt ratings of GPA's subsidiaries from Baa-1 to Baa-3 and the
short-term commercial paper programme from Prime-2 to Prime-3.
Discussions on raising new equity have provoked criticism from some GPA
shareholders who are still bound to a 'lock-in' agreement signed before the
ill-fated flotation. This obliges them to seek GPA's permission if they wish
to sell more than 20 per cent of their stock for the next three months.
Shareholders are irritated that while they are prevented from selling their
shares, GPA's investment bankers have been talking to potential new
investors.
Nomura International, which acted as global co-ordinator to GPA in its
failed flotation, said there had been talks with potential investors in the
Gulf and nothing had yet been signed or agreed. GPA sought to distance
itself from the move. It said: 'We have had an avalanche of advice from our
advisers which we may or may not act upon.'
It described the lock-in agreement as a 'technicality' and said the group
would consider waiving the obligation when its board meets next Monday.
However, the group did not want to 'give it up lightly'.
GPA believes most of its institutional investors are relaxed with the
lock-in agreement. It added: 'We have not been asked by any shareholders for
permission to sell their shares. If it was asked for, it is likely that it
would be granted.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / Telegraph shares fall 42p on first day's dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST day's dealings in shares of The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's UK
newspaper group, saw the price fall to below the 325p level set for the
flotation.
The shares opened at 289p, hovered around that level in the morning and then
closed at 283p. Mr Black's Hollinger Group retains a 68.3 per cent stake in
The Telegraph, worth Pounds 258.7m at yesterday's closing price, Pounds
38.4m less than at the flotation price.
Public investors shunned the issue with applications arriving for only 3m of
the 13m shares offered. Another 13m shares had been placed with
institutions.
On Tuesday, retail investors were even more reluctant to take up the public
offering of shares in Anglian Group, the double-glazing company which was to
float with a market capitalisation of Pounds 183.5m at the flotation price.
Anglian's shares are also expected to open at a discount to the 210p price
at when dealing begins next Wednesday.
The public offer for shares in MFI Furniture Group, the retailer, closes on
Friday while the offer for Taunton Cider, the drinks group, closes next
Wednesday.
Kenwood Appliances, the kitchen equipment maker, opened at a modest premium
to its 285p offer price but had slipped back by yesterday to 282p.
The Telegraph float was hampered by a number of factors including the fact
that Hollinger was to retain a majority stake. Analysts suggested the sale
could have succeeded with a price of 300p.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Wellcome book-building meets with good demand: FT writers
report on the varied progress of newly launched issues in an uncertain
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INITIAL indications about the progress of the Wellcome share sale suggest
good demand is being found, particularly from UK institutions. The global
book-building process began on Monday and runs until July 24.
Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, aims to sell around 330m shares in the
drugs company, headed by Mr John Robb, reducing its stake from 73.5 per cent
to 38 per cent. So far bidders have indicated an interest in buying more
than 40 per cent of the shares on offer at prices of around a 5 per cent
discount to the market price. Wellcome shares were down 6p to 894p
yesterday, although they had risen last week and earlier this week.
One manager involved said it was early days yet, with the US roadshows only
starting this week, for instance. But he said: 'There is a good feeling
about this, there is a solid base of demand for the shares. It feels totally
different to the GPA Group sale.' The flotation of GPA was abandoned last
month when insufficient demand for the shares was found.
The US portion of the Wellcome sale - about 80m of the total 330m shares on
offer - is considered problematic. Among several factors that could dampen
investor interest is the sheer size of the investment being sought from the
US - more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) worth of Wellcome shares. At
present it is estimated that only 2 per cent or 3 per cent of outstanding
Wellcome shares is in US hands. If the full number of shares on offer were
sold in the US, this would increase to about 12 per cent or 13 per cent.
Wellcome is seeking a big leap in the number of shares held in the US in one
go.
In addition, Wellcome is relatively unknown in the US investment community,
in spite of roughly half of its earnings coming from the US, including
income from the AZT drug for Aids treatment.
Mr Sam Isaly, a drugs industry analyst at Mehta and Isaly in New York, said
another problem facing the Wellcome offer is that US drug stocks have
seriously underperformed Wall Street this year. The drug stock index
compiled by Mehta and Isaly was down by 17.5 per cent in the first six
months of this year, compared with a decline of less than 1 per cent in the
Standard &amp; Poor's market-wide index.
'The US is probably the swing market to make the whole offer a success or
failure.  It is a tough sell,' Mr Isaly said.
Wellcome is seeking to meet this US challenge with an intensive road show
and with the help of leading Wall Street firms in its underwriting
syndicate, which is led by Morgan Stanley and includes Merrill Lynch, Lehman
Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, Wertheim Schroder and Alex Brown.
In all some 1,000 investors will listen to the Wellcome pitch, at meetings
between now and July 16 in cities such as Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago,
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Dallas,
Denver, Kansas City and Orlando.

FT  09 JUL 92 / G7 backs dollars 24bn aid for Russia: Yeltsin in surprise
offer to swap natural resources for debt relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S leading industrialised countries yesterday welcomed Russia as a
partner of the west and pledged their support for President Boris Yeltsin's
economic reforms and political leadership.
Their backing came on the last day of the summit in Munich of the leaders of
the Group of Seven nations, where Mr Yeltsin sprang a surprise offer to swap
Russian natural resources for relief on the country's debt.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, stressed that Mr Yeltsin was in
Munich to meet the G7 as a 'partner' and not as a 'poor relation'.
During their meeting with Mr Yeltsin, the G7 countries - the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - offered 'help for self-help',
endorsing a Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.6bn) package of financial assistance
that will be provided in stages through the International Monetary Fund, the
industrialised countries and through debt rescheduling.
in relation to the scale of Russia's economic crisis, Mr Yeltsin voiced
satisfaction at the results of his first wary encounter with G7 summitry. 'I
certainly didn't expect any more than that and I didn't want any less,' he
said.
Both Mr Yeltsin and the western leaders stressed that the reform process in
Russia was fraught with danger and risk. 'We are paying a very, very high
price for the transition from totalitarianism and communism to the civilised
world,' Mr Yeltsin said.
Mr Kohl urged western companies, banks and investors to become involved in
Russia. In return, Mr Yeltsin called on western governments to open their
markets to Russian goods and services such as space launches and to provide
insurance against political risks for private investment in Russia.
Following the recent agreement between Russia and the IMF, Mr Yeltsin said
he expected 'a powerful flow' of private investment into Russia.
Mr Yeltsin, who had earlier demanded far-reaching debt rescheduling, said he
was satisfied with an assurance that G7 countries would support rescheduling
through the Paris Club of western creditor countries.
His offer to swap Russian mineral rights, land, industry interests and
energy resources for debt write-offs was disclosed by the Italian premier Mr
Giuliano Amato at a briefing for Italian journalists. Mr Brian Mulroney, the
Canadian prime minister, said the proposal was a 'bolt from the blue'.
Mr Yeltsin could, however, face opposition to his proposal at home, where
energy is in short supply and prices are soaring.
Both Mr Kohl and Mr Yeltsin said the purpose of the phased financial aid
package was to make the economic reforms lasting. The Russian president said
that when his term of office came to an end, he 'trusted reform would have
become irreversible in all its areas'.
Mr Yeltsin met the G7 leaders after they had ended their own economic summit
conference, in which they made clear that help for Russia and other former
Soviet republics would 'be comprehensive' but tailored to the progress of
reform and 'internationally responsible behaviour'. This would include more
reductions in military spending and a determined effort to achieve
creditworthiness.
The summit agreed on a plan to make safe Soviet-built nuclear power stations
but failed to agree on a Dollars 700m fund for the venture.
It also achieved no breakthrough on the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks, although the G7 leaders said that freer trade would be
vital for integrating the former Soviet Union into the world economy.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Slough Estates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another rights issue was scarcely an option for Slough. But yesterday's
placing of Pounds 100m of long-dated bonds is nonetheless reassuring for
shareholders with the infamous Pounds 170m convertible put now less than 12
months away. At least half the necessary cash is locked into place at
current interest rates, and though a spread of 255 basis points may sound a
lot, it does not compare unfavourably with equivalent issues from British
Land and Hammerson. By all accounts, demand for unsecured fixed income
instruments is healthy at the moment, provided that the story line is right.
Slough can certainly claim that UK industrial property has not suffered to
nearly the same extent as offices or residential property. This does not
mean, though, that the year-long slide in the shares has necessarily run its
course. At 161p, they are only cheap if the dividend is maintained, which
notwithstanding management's determination to do so must remain something of
an if. The worry is the company's weak revenue account and the extent to
which stated dividend cover depends on capitalised interest relating to the
development programme.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market has never been sure whether to take the Sunday trading
issue seriously. One day there may be an argument for doing so, but
yesterday's non-binding opinion from the advocate-general of the European
Court should be treated strictly as a non-event. What matters is what the
European judges decide in the autumn, and that for now is anybody's guess.
Most of the time they follow the advocate-general's lead - but in the three
previous cases on Sunday trading, they have perversely gone the other way.
The indications anyway are that the government has virtually made up its
mind and will table some sort of compromise legislation once the European
judgment is out of the way, but before the second reading of a Keep Sunday
Special-inspired private member's bill in January. On past parliamentary
experience, the outcome is uncertain - but investors should hardly be
holding their breath. In the present uncertain situation there is doubtless
some advantage for Tesco opening its doors if Marks and Spencer stays shut.
Come the day the law is clear, the advantage of using assets more
intensively is likely to be offset by higher costs. The out-of-town DIY
merchants possibly apart, it looks at best like a zero sum game.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Dixons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of Dixons in recent years is of endless hope matched by endless
disappointment: not a bad proxy for the retail sector, or perhaps the equity
market as a whole. Over the past three years, pre-tax profits have fallen by
10 per cent and earnings per share by nearly a fifth. Dividend cover has
fallen from 2.5 to 1.6 times. Margins and return on equity have slumped. In
response, the shares have risen by nearly 60 per cent and outperformed the
market by almost half. The latest disappointments are suitably varied. UK
sales, which were strong in the second half and indeed throughout the year,
have faltered since the year-end. The electrical goods market is suffering
from a fresh outbreak of discounting. The US retail business has slumped
further into loss. UK property is being abandoned at a below-the-line cost
of Pounds 26m.
The divisional breakdown of net assets, published for the first time, is
deeply unsettling. The UK retailing assets produce a remarkable return of 60
per cent. But they account for only 31 per cent of the balance sheet total.
The remainder, which is tied up in property and US retailing, made a
collective operating loss last year of Pounds 13m, or something over 5p for
every pound invested. Since UK retailing stocks are seasonally low at the
year-end, the picture is doubtless distorted. But on the face of it, Dixons
offers a familiar pattern of a company branching out from its original
business only to throw its money away.
At yesterday's 214p, the shares are on a historic multiple of 23 and a yield
of 3.7 per cent. In relation to the market as a whole, this is a premium of
50 per cent and a discount of 25 per cent respectively. Buying shares for
recovery is one thing. But in the case of a company whose pre-tax profits
are two-thirds of what they were five years ago, the fashion has perhaps got
slightly out of hand.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Stretching the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The conspicuous failure of the G7 leaders to mention the currency markets in
their summit communique suggests they are back to a policy of benign neglect
of the dollar. That need not surprise, since the main players had little
incentive to tackle the dollar's decline in the first place. As the Bush
administration frets about November's election, it must be groping for any
means of reviving the US economy. A weak dollar should give at least some
encouragement to exports. That is bad news for French and British exporters.
But Japan cannot complain because of its own large payments surplus, while
low import prices benefit Germany's anti-inflation drive.
Just the same, confirmation of official indifference is the latest in a
growing list of reasons for expecting further dollar weakness. Exchange
markets are also increasingly sceptical of President Bush's chances of
re-election. The D-Mark is being driven up by devaluation talk swirling
round the lira and perhaps even sterling. All in all, the chances are that
the dollar would be under pressure even without a differential of more than
six percentage points between short rates in New York and Frankfurt.
Less certain is quite how much further the dollar has to fall. On a
purchasing power basis, it is now significantly undervalued, while US
inflation at both the retail and wholesale level is lower than in Germany.
The Federal Reserve may cut rates one more time, which would widen the
differential still further. But the latest car sales figures show the
outlook is not entirely bleak. Even if there is another cut, exchange
dealers must sooner or later start discounting a narrowing of the interest
rate gap. When that happens, the dollar could bounce back sharply. It may be
expensive to hold the currency now, but the point must be approaching where
it is risky to sell it short.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Police and Bank of England combine to fight bank fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLICE, the Bank of England and the security services are planning to
join forces in a renewed fight against bank fraud in the wake of last year's
closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt
international bank.
Talks are taking place between the Bank, the Cabinet Office, the Home Office
and the Treasury on the establishment of a new 'inter-agency group', the
Bank said yesterday.
In a separate development, however, the Bank found itself at odds with the
speaker of the House of Commons over allegations, by the Labour MP Mr Brian
Sedgemore, that it leaked details of its response to a select committee
report into BCCI.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, said she strongly deprecated the alleged
leak because it showed 'great discourtesy to this House'. While she had 'no
influence' with the Bank of England, she would have expected 'as a matter of
courtesy' that MPs would be informed of responses to select committee
reports 'in advance of any other outside body'.
The Bank yesterday gave the Treasury select committee members its detailed
response to their report and also published the response. However,
newspapers, including The Guardian and the Financial Times, carried details
of this response in their Tuesday editions.
'If there has been a breach of privilege it was entirely inadvertent,' the
Bank said yesterday.
The select committee report, published in March, had been critical of the
supervisory system and also made some criticisms of the Bank's behaviour.
In its response to the report, the Bank said that an 'effective co-ordinated
response to complex frauds' may require 'new machinery for the exchange of
information or for investigation'.
An official said this new machinery was likely to be an inter-agency group
containing representatives of the Bank and various investigators, including
the police, the Customs and the National Drugs Investigations Unit. The
security services will also be represented, although the official said 'we
never talk about such things'.
A Bank official admitted yesterday that before BCCI was closed,
'communication (between the Bank and other investigators) could have been
done better'.
The Bank also gave details of an international initiative to prevent
money-launderers from exploiting Swift, the telecommunication system used to
transfer funds between banks in different countries.
The extent of the fraud at BCCI had been partly hidden by its ability to
disguise its identity when making payments through other banks.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK warships on Serbian sanctions alert

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO BRITISH warships are standing by to take part in a naval operation that
European countries are considering launching to enforce trade sanctions
against Serbia and its ally, Montenegro.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said last night that the destroyer HMS
Nottingham was at sea in the Mediterranean. British officials later
disclosed that the frigate HMS Avenger was travelling to join her.
Both ships are expected to remain in the region until a firm decision is
made on any military action to prevent goods reaching Serbia and Montenegro.
Foreign ministers of the nine-nation Western European Union, meeting
tomorrow in Helsinki, are expected to discuss plans for naval operations to
check that sanctions are being observed.
They are also likely to discuss the need for armed protection of
humanitarian aid convoys to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
The UN imposed economic sanctions against the two Yugoslav republics early
last month to put pressure on the Serbs to stop ethnic fighting in breakaway
republics that have declared independence from Yugoslavia.
Mr Major said in Munich after the Group of Seven summit that HMS Nottingham
would initially log ships going to Yugoslav ports.
'If it were to go further and there were to be stop and search, which
conceivably it could, that would require a further United Nations
resolution,' he said.
Mr Major stressed that there was no question of Britain putting ground
troops into Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Judy Dempsey adds from Helsinki: British businessmen who have temporarily
closed their offices or operations in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, said
sanctions-busting was common.
'Electronic goods and spare parts are coming across the Adriatic, into
Montenegro and up to Serbia,' one businessman said.
Another said that Albania was often used as a staging post. Goods were then
moved north into neighbouring Montenegro and onwards to Serbia.

An Indian takes a trip from his reservation to a Las Vegas casino. But his
luck is out, and he loses every cent. There being no telephones on the
reservation, he puts out a smoke signal: 'Send money, send money, send money
. . .'. Alas, it happens to be a day when the Atomic Energy Authority is
testing at nearby Yucca Flats, and his message is almost obliterated by a
great mushroom cloud.
Even so, he is soon rewarded with word from home. 'Sending money, sending
money, sending money . . .' comes the signal back.
'And there's no need to shout.'

While world leaders are debating the best way to achieve currency stability
for the former Soviet Union, ordinary Russian citizens are taking matters
into their own hands. Some Muscovite friends of Observer funded a recent
trip to London with a currency even harder than the D-Mark - the titanium
ice screw.
Though not economists, they had intuitively grasped that this simple piece
of mountaineering kit has many of the marks of a stable medium of exchange:
lightness, portability, intrinsic value by dint of the base metal content,
and - if you mix in the right circles - near universal acceptance as
payment.
They had also grasped the first principles of cross-border arbitrage:
titanium ice screws retail in the UK at upwards of Pounds 20 but are
available in Russia at a fraction of the cost.

The Battle of the Elliotts is being waged in Rotherham, Yorkshire. Should
Olympic athlete Peter Elliott be honoured with one of the plaques to be put
on the houses where the town's most famous offspring were born; or should
the honour go instead to Ebenezer of the same surname?
True, Peter is the more famous and is backed by the borough's Conservative
councillors. But in this contest, at least, he looks bound to be an
also-ran. For, although Ebenezer broke no world records, he left his mark on
19th century literature with verses such as:
What is a communist?
One who hath yearnings
For equal division
Of unequal earnings.
Moreover, his candidature is backed by Rotherham's Labour councillors who
outnumber their Tory counterparts by 64 to two.

There should be more charities around like the Rowntree Foundation, which is
behind yesterday's damning report on the government's mortgage rescue
scheme. It has probably made a bigger contribution to solving Britain's
housing crisis by researching it in a dispassionate way rather than trying
to relieve the problem by giving all its money to good causes.
In terms of research, the Pounds 6m a year it spends on looking into housing
and other social issues is a lot of money, whereas it would not build many
houses. Under Richard Best, who took over as director after Robin Guthrie
left to be chief charity commissioner, it has made a big push to disseminate
its views more widely. As a former director of the National Federation of
Housing Associations, Best has the sort of background which commands respect
from all sides of the housing debate.

Good to see the Bank of England is more than pulling its weight when it
comes to helping out east of the Urals. Senior official Tony Latter has just
flown to Kiev for nine months as special adviser to Vadim Hetman, governor
of the Ukrainian central bank.
Latter, a top bobbin in Threadneedle Street's international division, was
once Hong Kong's deputy secretary for monetary affairs. One of 15 or so
people at the Bank who speaks Russian, he will spend his time advising
Hetman on organising banking supervision and contacts with other central
banks. A prime task will be helping to introduce the hryvnia, the new
Ukrainian currency due to come into force next year.
Since Latter volunteered for the stint in Kiev, where life is less than
settled at the moment, he clearly has a taste for adventure. But it's to be
hoped he also has a head for strong liquor.
During evening meetings, the deceptively quiet but extremely assiduous
Hetman thinks nothing of downing a glass or two of vodka.
What's more, he expects colleagues to match him drink for drink.

The success rate of husband-and-wife teams in retailing is scarcely one to
threaten wholesale redundancy among marriage guidance counsellors.
Admittedly, Body Shop's Anita and Gordon Roddick appear to have made a
triumph of both business and married life. But they are very much the
exception. Compared with their results in partnership, some couples seem to
do better apart.
Hence there is more than usual interest in what will happen to Liz and
George Davies - the former dream team that used to run Next. Having lost
their company in a 1989 boardroom coup and sacrificed their marriage, they
are now going their separate ways.
George, who is a good 10 years older than his ex-wife, seems to be doing
quite well designing casual clothes for Asda. But not a lot has been heard
about his new 'Magalogue' - a combination of magazine and catalogue - which
was launched with great fanfare earlier this year.
Early days yet, but some retailing analysts believe that 39-year-old Liz is
a better bet than her husband over the long-term. Yesterday, she popped up
as buying director at Mothercare, a Storehouse subsidiary. 'She is the sort
of person who gets on and does things, whereas George just makes a lot of
noise,' was the verdict of one City figure.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: An appreciative view of the French franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of France in recent days has been dominated by blocked roads and
railways. Added to these troubles are the political problems of Francois
Mitterrand and the president's truculent attitude to agriculture and the
Gatt negotiations, which resembles on a larger scale the British make-work
attempt to preserve the European Fighter Aircraft. In one case, the French
president is trying to preserve unviable farm employment. In the other case,
the British government wants to subsidise aircraft jobs rather than promote
market-oriented employment.
There is, however, another side to the French economy associated with low
inflation, competitiveness and an increasing role for market forces. Too
much emphasis has been placed among searchers for a European economic model
on Germany, which has been lurching away from a social market economy under
the domination of interest group politics.
The exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was not deliberately constructed by the
former leaders Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt in 1979 as a
German anchor to hold down French inflation. But when it worked out like
that, French leaders, as good pragmatists, were happy to embrace it. In
contrast, Britain did not join until October 1990 after a bitter and
prolonged debate, which shows no sign of dying down. It joined when German
interest rates were about to soar, in time to experience the costs of ERM
membership. But it has not been inside the system nearly long enough, or in
a fortunate enough period, to enjoy the benefits.
How do the track records of the two countries compare? On inflation, France
wins hands down. In a report on France, published today, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) points out: 'There is no
major disequilibrium in the way of French recovery. The household sector is
not unduly indebted by international standards, liquidity is adequate and
overall balance sheets seem to be healthy. Competitiveness continues to
improve as increases in wages and prices have been kept below rates in most
other countries.'
The current account deficit - for what it is worth - is a much smaller
proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) in France. On a comparable basis
the French budget deficit is half that of Britain's; and most of what fiscal
deterioration there is can be explained by the business slowdown.
In terms of consumer prices, French inflation has been below the German
level for a year; in terms of the more fundamental GDP deflator, it has been
below it for two years. The OECD expects French consumer price increases to
fall further from 3 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent next year.
But has not France paid a heavy price for reducing inflation via its link
with the D-Mark in terms of lost output and jobs? The chart suggests that
there is little to choose between Britain and France on average performance.
But one difference stands out. Both growth and employment have been far more
stable on the French side of the Channel. The recessions of both the early
1980s and the early 1990s have - so far - been much less severe there.
France was also spared the very high peaks and unsustainably low troughs
that have been such a feature of the British unemployment scene.
The immediate prospect is also less unfavourable in France. Growth dipped in
1991 to 1 to 1 1/2 per cent. At least it was still positive. The OECD by 2
per cent this year, compared with barely more than zero in the UK.
Even the modest growth recorded in 1991 has placed France in the upper half
of OECD countries for the fourth year in a row, and the unemployment rate
has risen no faster than elsewhere in Europe or in other OECD countries.
Obviously, the current jobless rate of more than 10 per cent is too high, in
both France and Britain. The OECD report examines the question carefully and
concludes that the high French unemployment rate is due to labour market
failure, and is neither caused by, nor can be cured by, exchange rate or
other financial policies.
It is easier to make this case in France where unemployment is endemic
rather than in Britain where it is more clearly linked with the business
cycle downturn, which the so-called 'authorities' are powerless to fight
with lower interest rates.
Of course, there is a black-red coalition in France as well as the UK which
sees the ERM as the root of all evil. But the argument does not dominate the
economic debate as it does in Britain. The OECD stresses: 'A cheaper franc
would not do much to stimulate exports either, given the likely effect on
domestic wages and prices. In any case, the logic of the strong franc policy
has always been to promote competitiveness through cost moderation rather
than to ratify agents' inflationary wage and price setting through
devaluation'.
Not everything in the French garden is lovely. Indeed, there are lessons
from France on what to avoid. What has gone wrong stems more from aspects of
social policy than anything to do with the ERM. The supply side of the
French economy is held back not by the ERM but by a corporatist legacy,
evoked by the OECD's own talk of 'social partners'.
Very high spending on labour market programmes has not helped job prospects.
Unemployment is particularly concentrated among females and younger or older
workers who 'suffer from a lack of adequate incentives to price themselves
into work'. The 'floor on the cost of taking on an employee set by the
minimum wage and social charges may limit employment of youths especially
the least educated'.
Indeed, there is a warning in the OECD report about the harm done by an
excessively academic educational system, which gives rise to misplaced envy
elsewhere.
There is talk in British establishment circles of the possible need for an
agonising reappraisal policy in a year's time if German interest rates are
still acting as a drag on the European economy. It may then be worth
considering a direct link-up with France. An incidental benefit of that,
often stressed by Lord Cobbold, is that by a happy coincidence of currency
units, the freezing of the franc-sterling rate at 10 for one has long looked
attractive.
The doubt thrown over the Maastricht treaty by the Danish referendum has
postponed the chances of an attempt by either France or Britain to reduce
interest rates below German ones, and some clarification of the French
political scene may be required first.
Nevertheless, France is much nearer being able to set the pace of ERM
interest rates than the UK is. Having used the D-Mark as an anchor, the
French franc is near to attaining independent credibility as a low inflation
currency. There is a hint in the OECD report that French interest rates
could eventually follow their own path below German ones  - but only on the
assumption of there being some prospect of a franc appreciation.

Sir, I read with some deep concern the recent article ('School's out - and
nowhere to go', June 6) regarding the number of graduate students that are
unable to find work six months after graduation and their low starting
salary expectation.
Our statistics show a different story. I can find no recent graduate
willingly out of work and our statistics indicate an actual average starting
salary in excess of Pounds 18,000 per annum. Perhaps one can suggest that
companies are becoming more selective, and are focusing on students most
able to offer quick effectiveness in new jobs.
Our graduates, with fluency in three European languages, experience of four
different commercial organisations - two at least outside the UK, and a
sound knowledge of business functions and subjects - provide a well rounded
individual well able to contribute from day one.
Graduates have received a four-year training in presentation skills. The
total mix is aimed at producing managers that can perform and use the theory
they have learnt - and this, after all, is what business keeps saying it
wants.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Health for all
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR TOO long, the UK National Health Service has been failing to live up to
its name. It has been an ill-health service, devoted to curing conditions
which might have been prevented by promoting healthier life-styles. Yet some
of the greatest improvements in the nation's health have come from simple
environmental improvements, such as cleaner water and better diet.
Yesterday's white paper on the health of the nation sets out a strategy for
moving health promotion up the agenda, which will begin to shift the
emphasis from cure to prevention. It identifies five priority areas on which
resources will be concentrated, including coronary heart disease and
strokes, the main causes of preventable, premature death. In each priority
area, clear targets are set for reducing their incidence, with detailed
programmes for achieving the targets involving all the relevant agencies.
There will be widespread support for this approach, especially the adoption
of clear and measureable targets by which progress can be judged. Debate
will no doubt continue over the wisdom of individual targets or the efficacy
of particular policy measures. The halving of pregnancies among girls under
16 is a particularly bold aim, and the means for achieving it - through sex
education and improved family planning - are likely to be contro-versial.
In implementing this strategy, the government will be assisted by its health
service reforms, which have strengthened the strategic planning role of
local health authorities. The white paper sensibly proposes improvements in
the provision of information on how the national objectives are to be
implemented locally. It also promises to monitor progress. While periodic
reports are promised from the health department on progress, there is a case
for these to be published annually, with rapid measures to prod backsliding
authorities into action.
Two omissions from the white paper have attracted criticism. The first is
the failure to ban all tobacco advertising. While there are reasons for not
introducing a total ban, there is scope for further restrictions,
particularly if evidence emerges that advertising encourages young people to
take up smoking. Meanwhile, the level of excise duties on tobacco should be
raised by significantly more than the rate of inflation each year. Removing
tobacco products from the basket of goods used to measure inflation might
make this step more palatable for chancellors committed to low inflation.
The second is that it overlooks the now well-established correlation between
ill health and poverty. One consequence of failing to address this issue
could be that health promotion campaigns, to persuade people to adopt
healthier lifestyles, overlook the underlying causes of bad diet and poor
housing. That is a most unfortunate omission in seeking to create a true
health service.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Leading Article: G7 poverty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'I DON'T know that there's enough money in the world to solve the problems
of the Russian economy,' said Mr George Bush in Munich yesterday after the
summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries. He was right: money is
only a part of the solution to Russia's problems. Mr Bush was also right in
a broader and unintended sense. The leaders of the Group of Seven did
demonstrate poverty in Munich. But it is not resources they lacked. It was
vision.
The G7 failed to rekindle the flame of global macro-economic co-ordination;
it failed to promise anything new for Russia and the rest of the former
Soviet Union; it failed to bring urgency to the task of rendering the
nuclear plants of the former Soviet Union any safer; and, despite Mr John
Major's creditable efforts, it failed to bring a resolution of the impasse
in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations closer.
The meeting may not have done much harm, but could it not have done some
positive good? More macro-economic co-ordination might not be appropriate,
given the legitimate divergences among the G7. But on trade and the closely
connected issues of assistance to the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe
more should and could have been offered.
Are the G7 nations really too poor? Their combined gross domestic products
were a little less than Dollars 14 trillion in 1990. Total G7 government
outlays in that year were more than Dollars 5 trillion, while total spending
on defence, largely against the former Soviet Union, was about Dollars
500bn. Even in the case of the US, aggregate GDP has risen fourfold since
the late 1940s, when it contributed a far higher share of GDP to the
Marshall Plan than anything contemplated today. The resources are there.
What is missing is the sense of priorities.
The same applies to trade. This time the commitment offered in London in
1991 and the year before in Houston is missing. The G7 simply expects that
'an agreement can be reached before the end of 1992'. Anyone might well
expect such a thing. But the G7 could ensure it, which is what makes the
continued failure so depressing.
The G7 calls on the countries of the world - not least those of central and
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - to move to a market economy. In
all these cases, the required adjustments have been very large. By
comparison, the adjustments that would be imposed on the G7 countries by
trade liberalisation far greater than on offer in the Uruguay Round would be
relatively modest.
The countries of the G7 do have the resources and the capacity to meet the
by no means overwhelming challenges of today. But the leaders have not shown
the need-ed ability to lead. If they continue to fail, it would not be
surprising if the peoples of some of the G7 countries were to start looking
for another bunch of leaders.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Painful legacy of an empire: Conflicts around Russia's
periphery have great significance for the former Soviet states and the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The withdrawal of Russia to within its current borders is as painful and as
fraught with danger as any of the great imperial retreats of the past
century. No empire has collapsed without blood: Russia's experience is
proving no exception.
Around the periphery of the Russian federation, a series of conflicts has
erupted and potential flashpoints are simmering. Small wars they may be -
but with a large significance for the states of the former Soviet Union, and
for the international community.
The disputes threaten the fragile post-Soviet consensus that existing
borders, no matter how historically unjust, are inviolate. They raise the
prospect of intractable conflicts and are courting intervention from Russia.
For its part, Moscow is taking a more aggressive stance over the protection
of its interests and Russian minorities.
This week the disputes are being placed firmly on the international agenda.
The Commonwealth of Independent States has called for a peace-keeping force
to restore order to some of the trouble spots. The Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe - the forum for discussion of security issues
including the US, west and eastern European states - will today hear demands
from some of the republics of the former Soviet Union for the immediate
withdrawal of Russian troops.
There are five main areas of tension, mainly outside Russia.
In the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, 130,000 Russian
troops serve in what was one of the easier billets of the Soviet Army.
Tensions have risen to the point where Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, described the area in a speech last month as 'potentially more
explosive' than Yugoslavia. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, yesterday
promised to withdraw troops from the Baltic states by the middle of 1993
though the Baltic leaders remain sceptical in the face of previous promises
to withdraw.
Mr Audrius Butkevicius, the young Lithuanian defence minister, is more
persuaded by General Yuri Kalininchenko, former head of the border guards
for the Commonwealth of Independent States, who told him that he and his
colleagues regarded the Lithuanian border with Poland as the western border
of Russia. 'Russia sees us as part of their strategic area: they are quite
firm on this,' said Mr Butkevicius.
In the Republic of Moldova, a war is raging between regular Moldovan forces
and forces acting in the name of the self-proclaimed republic of Trans
Dnestr, an area on Moldova's eastern border inhabited largely by Russians
and Ukrainians. The region has declared independence from Moldova, citing
fears that the government is seeking to unite with neighbouring Romania.
Before the second world war, most of Moldova was part of Romania, and native
Moldovans are ethnic Romanian.
On Tuesday, the Moldovan government asked for a multinational peacekeeping
force to quell the conflict. But early yesterday, reports from Trans Dnestr
indicated that the ceasefire that had been called to allow this force to
operate had already broken down.
The Russian 14th army, with around 15,000 troops, operates on the side of
the Trans Dnestrians. In spite of Mr Yeltsin's promise, it is not being
withdrawn. Both Mr Vladimir Lukin, the Russian ambassador to the US, and
General Dmitri Volkogonnov, Mr Yeltsin's military adviser, have emphasised
this.
Mr Yeltsin won acclaim in Trans Dnestr when he appeared to support a Russian
intervention in search of a settlement. But he does not control the Trans
Dnestrians, and he will not be able to to stop them fighting. Asked how he
would respond to an order from the Russian president to withdraw, Mr
Vladimir Dmitriev, a 14th Army APC driver, said: 'I have 10 boxes of
ammunition and each box contains 10 rounds. I hope I will kill one Romanian
(Moldovan) with each one, no matter what Yeltsin says.'
The Caucasian republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are all - in
varying degrees - internally unstable and engaged in inter-ethnic
hostilities. The oldest of the conflicts, that between the Armenian
population of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Azeris who surround it, has been the
subject of half a dozen peace plans, all failures. The two month-old Azeri
government of President Abulfaz Elchibey seems more determined to prosecute
the conflict than the previous regime. Efforts by Italy to mediate between
the two sides ended in failure earlier this week.
In Georgia, the government of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze survived a coup attempt
last month by supporters of the previous president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
But Mr Shevardnadze has, it seems, no power to stop his militia pursuing the
war against South Ossetia, an area in the north of the republic, where the
population is demanding unification with its kin in the Russian republic of
North Ossetia.
Although Mr Yeltsin and Mr Shevardnadze agreed a truce, the Ossetians -
north and south - rejected it. The Georgian forces are now closing in on the
partly destroyed Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. Mr Alan Chachiev, deputy
leader of the South Ossetian parliament, said last week that he would call
in forces from the Caucasian peoples in Russia to his aid if Russia itself
did not support him: 'Russia is betraying us, so we will bring the war to
Russia.'
Even where agreements have been reached, they are fragile and untested. The
summit meeting last month between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Leonid Kravchuk,
president of Ukraine, was described by both men as a breakthrough. But it
was a breakthrough that ignored the question of Crimea, Ukraine's southern
region on the Black Sea with a majority Russian population. The region has
been reclaimed by the Russian parliament in a decision that annulled its
arbitrary transfer from Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction in 1954.
This dispute dwarfs all others in its scope and strategic implications. Both
Russia and the Ukraine are seeking to play down the issue while they attempt
to stabilise their economic relations. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Kravchuk have, for
example, agreed to co-operate on the introduction of a Ukrainian currency in
three months' time. But both may be pressurised by their nationalists into
reviving the dispute.
Although most apparent in Crimea and the Ukraine, Russia has an interest in
all of these disputes. The immediate reason for its involvement is also the
most keenly felt: the perceived need to defend Russian minorities.
There are about 25m Russians and Russian speakers who, for the first time
since their rulers began the steady conquest of neighbouring peoples more
than two centuries ago, find themselves outside the borders of Russia
proper, and subject to the laws of other independent nations. They are
suffering: there are Russian-speaking refugees streaming back into Russian
towns from the Caucasus and from Moldova; they have been excluded from
voting in a referendum on the constitution in Estonia; they are regarded
with suspicion everywhere. In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, the statue
of Russian national poet Pushkin was recently removed from its plinth.
This new vulnerability is keenly felt by a people brought up in an era of
great power and self-confidence. Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, the young leader of the
Russian social democrats and the head of the parliament's constitutional
commission, said: 'You must understand, this is not a cause just of the
political right, but of all Russian parliamentarians. It is the most
important cause we now have.'
The Russian cause also involves rights to land and assets. Moscow's claim to
the Crimea is partly a demand for the Black Sea naval fleet, most of which
Russia wants for itself.
The determination with which Russia is pursuing its claims throughout the
territories of the former Soviet Union is increasing. General Alexander
Rutskoi, Russia's vice-president, has continually pushed for a stronger and
more interventionist posture on the part of the Russian military. When Mr
Yeltsin was in North America last month, Gen Rutskoi warned his fellow
countrymen of the need for a tougher stance, and was backed by his president
on his return.
A week ago, two generals with strongly nationalist sympathies were appointed
to senior posts: General Alexander Lebed as head of the 14th Army in Trans
Dnestr and General Boris Gromov as deputy defence minister. As soon as Gen
Lebed took up his appointment, he described the Moldovan government as
'fascists' and made clear his determination to defend Trans Dnestr. In
addition, General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, has grown
increasingly categorical - claiming the army's right to intervene across the
former Union, and warning last week that the perpetrators of attacks on
Russians or Russian speakers would be 'brought to account'.
In their pronouncements, these men blur the distinction between protection
of Russians and protection of Russia's perceived strategic interests - in
their mind, there is no clear division. For them, most of the new republics
are tiny statelets which must accommodate the imperatives of a great-power
neighbour. They resist the withdrawal of Russian armies from the bases they
occupy across the former Union.
Mr Yeltsin's views on the stationing of Russian troops have also been
equivocal. Last month, he promised President Mircea Snegur of Moldova and
President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania that he would withdraw the
armies from their countries, but nothing has since happened. Either he has
acted cynically or he has not been able to deliver. In either case, Russia
can be expected to continue its shift towards a more assertive stance.
This means that the west may soon be faced with hard questions itself: how
far does it tolerate its new-found friend again imposing a Russian hegemony
on the area; and how much suppression of national autonomy can be blinked at
in the name of peace? And the international community could have to decide
whether to recognise - as the Russians are now demanding - enclaves like
Trans Dnestr, Ossetia and Crimea as independent states, thereby alienating
the states of which they are presently part.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Stabilising Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY IN Helsinki, President Boris Yeltsin, with six of the seven world
leaders who confronted him in Munich, will be joined by those of 44 other
member states of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE). From the dispiriting contemplation of the world economy they will
turn to the even more alarming spectacle of conflict spreading rapidly
across the former communist world.
The 'new era of democracy, peace and unity', proclaimed at the last CSCE
summit in Paris less than two years ago (when there were only 34 members),
can hardly yet be said to have fulfilled its promise. The deliberately light
institutional structure set up at that time has been powerless to prevent
the outbreak and gradual extension of war in the former Yugoslavia. In fact,
it assigned responsibility for attempting that task to a supposedly more
solid entity, the European Community, which has done much but achieved all
too little.
But the CSCE did make one decision yesterday which should help to define its
future role: by refusing for the time being to admit the new 'Yugoslavia',
it affirmed its character as an organisation based not on universality (like
the UN) but on a community of values. A state that fails to respect those
values cannot expect to participate as of right.
But the biggest test of the CSCE's effectiveness will be the multiple
conflicts now erupting in the former Soviet Union, described in detail in an
article on this page. The most dangerous of these involve Russian minorities
in non-Russian republics; and indeed practically all the violent conflicts
now visible or predictable in central and eastern Europe concern national
minorities - people who feel threatened by their inclusion in a state which
does not respect their national identity, and yet are often denied their
rights by that state precisely because it regards them as a threat to its
integrity.
By far the best way to defuse such conflicts is by convincing both sides,
before they come to blows, that their security can be better ensured by
negotiation and agreement than by secession or the use of force. The new
CSCE Commissioner on National Minorities should be able to achieve that, in
some cases, by ensuring that minority problems are taken seriously before
they erupt into outright war.
The Helsinki document also makes important and detailed provisions for
peacekeeping forces, and formally proclaims the CSCE a 'regional
organisation' under Chapter VIII of the UN Charter. But none of this is
likely to achieve stability in the volatile conditions which now prevail.
The organisation needs to acquire some of the clout which has lately been
given to the UN by the leadership of the Security Council, with its five
permanent members. In 1989-90, some leaders of newly free central European
countries proposed something like this, but were firmly rebuffed by Nato. In
the light of present conditions, the idea should be looked at again.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Arts: Phil Woods Quintet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sixty two years old, Phil Woods is a serious-minded altoist who, like others
of his age, enthusiastically embraced all the revolutionary influences of
Charlie 'Bird' Parker.
Unlike the others, he did not inherit a fashionably fatal predilection for
alcohol and narcotics and was thus able to develop and expand the Parker
vocabulary to his own ends. He made his name with the big bands of Benny
Goodman, Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy Jones. After moving to Paris in the
Sixties (with Parker's former girl-friend) he began leading his own quartets
or quintets and refining his post-bop school of alto playing in earnest.
His current quintet is tight and bright as you would expect from a seasoned
leader like Woods. The rhythm section of bassist Steve Gilmore and drummer
Bill Goodwin have been with him since the mid-70s, while the composing
talent of pianist Jim McNeely is a more recent addition; young trumpeter
Brian Lynch completes a line-up made for a club setting. Neither chamber
jazz nor smoking hard bop, Woods' music swings intelligently with solos
shared out among the close harmonies of alto and trumpet.
It has been said more than once that his own playing gets better with time.
He manages to take the hysteria out of the alto without dulling its tart
tone. At other times, the phrasing is fluidly melodic.
In McNeely's 'Empty House' he conversed sweetly with the trumpet; with
'Quill' (dedicated to now-deceased friend and fellow altoist Gene Quill) he
punched through the swaying accompaniment of piano and rhythm section and,
with Al Cohn's 'Pensive", declaimed Bird-like, exploring the lower registers
of the instrument.
Phil Woods would certainly have happened without Parker, but the memory of
Parker might have been less vivid, and the legacy of Forties jazz less rich,
without Woods.
The Phil Woods Quintet is appearing at Ronnie Scott's Club until July 11

FT  09 JUL 92 / Arts: King Lear in New York - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chichester Festival Theatre has acquired the reputation - somewhat
unfairly - of being a rather middlebrow, Home Counties sort of place where
it is best to play safe. It has been suggested that Melvyn Bragg's King Lear
in New York was brought into the repertory to see if the audience would take
something more risky.
There need be no fears on that account. Bragg's play is as middlebrow as
they come, and none the worse for that. True, there is a sprinkling of four
letter words, a conversation between father and daughter about sex and a
scene involving hard drugs, but these are of the stuff that can be seen
regularly on television and which presumably even Mrs Whitehouse no longer
objects to in decibels.
Nor, on the intellectual side, does appreciation of the play depend on an
intimate knowledge of the original King Lear.
Bragg is a biographer of the late Richard Burton and it is of Burton that
any audience will be quickly reminded. Here is the once stage idol who has
spent too much of his time wasting his talent on screen, women and whisky,
having a go at King Lear before his stage reputation becomes only a memory.
He is doing it not in the mainstream, but off-off Broadway.
The key question is whether the Burton figure, here called Robert and played
by John Stride, will pull it off or even appear at all. Since the play
contains a considerable measure of suspense, I shall not reveal the answer.
Suffice it to say that there are lots of traps along the way, including a
neurotic first wife who turns up unexpectedly, the daughter by his first
marriage who is on drugs, and his estranged second wife who emerges as his
agent with an offer for him to return to Hollywood - provided he does not
risk flopping as Lear.
Far and away the best scene in the play is a late night television interview
in which the TV hostess, Jackie, is given as good as she gets in trying to
exploit Robert's weaknesses.
Jackie is wonderfully played by Kate O'Mara and this whole sequence had the
Chichester audience rivetted.
That is at the end of the first act. Nothing in the rest of the play quite
lives up to it. There is a structural failing in that while Act 1 is a
unity, played throughout in a New York hotel suite which the televison crew
invades, Act 2 dots about too much, changing location some half a dozen
times in manner more suited to the screen than to the stage.
I must add , however, that the element of suspense is never wholly lost.
One of the nicest inventions in the play is a character called Alec, a
friend of Robert, and in some ways the equivalent of Lear's Fool. He calls
Robert Nuncle and is a bit of a conjuror, but is perhaps more of a nurse.
Sometimes he succeeds in keeping his hero off the bottle and as played by
Richard Warwick, this is a very gentle, admirable performance.
Stride's Robert could be a bit wilder. He looks as if he might fail, but
never as if he might go really mad. Perhaps it is fear of the Chichester
audience that is responsible for such restraint. He should wind up a bit
more in future.
The direction is by Patrick Garland, the artistic director of the theatre.
He is having an excellent season. King Lear in New York is not as exciting
as Coriolanus nor as interesting as Christopher Fry's Venus Observed, but it
adds variety.
The Home Counties should flock to it. It is jut the sort of piece that
people like to talk about afterwards - controversial without really
upsetting anyone.

FT  09 JUL 92 / People: Naylor bowls into MAM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If James Naylor, the new chief executive of Chrysalis's MAM Leisure
business, were to admit to making a mistake, it would be his decision to
branch out on his own at the peak of the last economic upswing.
Having helped organise the Pounds 37.5m (Dollars 71.6m) management buy-out
of First Leisure from Trust House Forte in 1983 - First Leisure is now worth
Pounds 450m - Naylor left in 1987 to set up Whitegate Leisure, a bowling
alley and discotheque operator.
Naylor's departure coincided with the downturn in leisure spending,
Whitegate ran into serious financial difficulties, and Naylor resigned in
January following policy differences.
By contrast, his fellow joint managing director at First Leisure, John
Conlan, stayed put and less than a year later took over as chief executive
of what has become one of Britain's most successful leisure businesses.
Naylor, 46, who has an MBA from New York's Columbia University, has spent
nearly 20 years in the leisure business, including stints at Cunard and
Thorn EMI. He says that his skills lie in 'taking a business that is a bit
moribund and bringing a fresh approach to bear'.
He takes over as chief executive from Peter Hazlerigg, a main board director
who, in addition to his board responsibilities, will remain non-executive
chairman of MAM which takes in Chrysalis's amusement machine business.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Management (GEC at the Crossroads): Behind the Weinstock
enigma - Part Four, Charles Leadbeater looks at the man whose idiosyncratic
style has shaped the group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In summer he usually works in braces, the top button of his shirt undone and
his Hermes tie loosened around his neck. Nearly 68, his greying hair is
always immaculately combed. His clothes are stylish but understated. Sharp
eyes glint behind the tortoiseshell glasses, and his light frame, long legs
and slender arms make him seem unsteady and vulnerable.
Most people believe Lord Weinstock, the managing director of the General
Electric Company, is a financial machine, ruthlessly seeking and greedily
hoarding cash in his west London coffers.
The reality is considerably more complicated. The shades of Lord Weinstock's
character are reflected in his office.
The desk is not fussily neat but carefully organised. Beyond a sloping
reading desk, there is a telephone with 250 short dial codes that put him in
direct contact with his managers throughout the company.
He eschews the egotistical paraphernalia which fill the offices of many
other businessmen. There are no framed awards or pictures of him clasping
former US presidents around the shoulders.
He does not revel in the trappings of power. The furniture is sparse, cheap,
functional and slightly tatty.
He is extremely analytical with a rare ability to convey complex situations
in simple terms. He has a brilliant mind for numbers. His touch with people,
however, is less sure. He can be extremely charming, teasing and humorous.
But many people complain that he is impolite. Many of his managers find him
distant and arid. He rarely shakes hands with guests, who can spend hours in
his warm office while he sips sparkling water from a crystal glass and their
mouths become parched.
Although he has occupied one of the most powerful positions in British
industry for 30 years there is not the slightest hint of pomposity about
him. He hates ostentation.
Executives at lesser companies are fond of reciting their achievements. Lord
Weinstock never boasts about himself.
He is ruthless. He relentlessly demands his managers improve their
performance. Yet he is untouched by the self-congratulatory machismo which
infected much of British management in the last decade.
Lord Weinstock arrives at the office in the late morning, has a late lunch,
usually in the company's sixth-floor dining rooms and enjoys a short
afternoon before working into the early evening, often on his own.
His hallmarks are pragmatism and flexibility, a peculiar mixture of rational
analysis, naked opportunism and great caution. He detests systems and
patterns which impose a false hierarchy and order upon things. Anyone hoping
for a neat, business-school explanation of GEC's history will be at sea with
the swirling narrative that Lord Weinstock delivers.
He explains his big business decisions like a spider spinning a web, weaving
together business and politics, chance contacts and considered strategy,
anecdotes and jokes.
Lord Weinstock provokes equal measures of pride and exasperation, loyalty
and frustration among the managers who work with him.
Mr David Fletcher, managing director of Marconi, GEC's defence subsidiary,
describes his boss: 'He is a unique, fascinating, brilliant, infuriating,
sometimes exasperating guy, who always comes up with something worth
thinking about.'
Mr Carey Nolan, managing director of GEC's Picker medical equipment division
based in the US, recalls his visits to GEC's Stanhope Gate headquarters in
London for annual budget meetings: 'His moods can range from gentle
persuasion to table-thumping demands.'
The idiosyncrasy of Lord Weinstock's character is central to GEC.
It is a tremendously decentralised company. Responsibility for strategy,
product development, investment and business planning is devolved to the
managers who run the subsidiaries. There are about 70 staff at headquarters,
running a business with a turnover of Pounds 9.4bn and 120,000 employees.
As a result a lot of people in GEC know a lot about small bits of the
business. Only a handful of executives know about all of the group. So Lord
Weinstock is unrivalled in his knowledge and power at the company.
That also leaves him very exposed. Any judgment of GEC's record is
inescapably an assessment of his strengths and weaknesses. He has been the
most enduring and the most controversial figure in British business in the
last 30 years.
Most of the industrial barons of the 1960s, such as the late Lord Kearton,
the former chairman of Courtaulds, saw their expansionist dreams turn sour
as their empires were dismembered in the 1980s. Most of the famous names of
British engineering - GKN and TI for instance - underwent painful and
radical surgery in the last decade. Some such as Hawker Siddeley have
disappeared. Lord Weinstock has kept GEC virtually intact.
Most of the management stars of the Thatcher years - the likes of Sir
Michael Edwardes at British Leyland and Lord King, chairman of British
Airways - were products of the time, the political climate, and the boom in
the British economy.
Lord Weinstock may well outlast them all. He has adapted to a wide range of
political regimes, from industrial interventionism by the Labour party in
the 1960s to free-market Thatcherism in the 1980s. He has survived through
nine changes of government, six prime ministers and five recessions.
Yet despite his power Lord Weinstock remains an enigma. That is partly out
of choice, a senior GEC manager in the US suggests. 'He makes himself
enigmatic to protect himself and keep his distance from people.'
Indeed his intense shyness is one of the least understood aspects of his
character. Apart from a brief period in the late 1960s when he crusaded
against the complacent inefficiency of British management, he has not taken
to the pulpit.
He keeps himself to himself, closeted in that darkened office where
messengers deliver reports of events in the outside world. He rarely visits
customers, even if they have spent big sums with GEC over many years.
A former senior official at the Ministry of Defence recalls: 'He would come
over if you specially asked him to, but he would not come to see you of his
own volition very often.'
In spite of his power he still sees himself partly as an outsider, someone
who believes society is run by cliques which he cannot join.
This is a reflection of his background. Arnold Weinstock was the son of
Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father worked as a tailor in central
London. He studied statistics at the London School of Economics before going
into business with his father-in-law, the then Mr Michael Sobell, making
television sets at Radio and Allied Industries.
Thirty years at the top of business have not hardened his skin to public
criticism. He remains highly sensitive and often feels his motives and
achievements are almost wilfully misunderstood.
This combination of power and reticence has created a gap in public
knowledge which has been filled by a series of crude caricatures.
The main one runs like this: Lord Weinstock is a financial automaton who
turns everything into numbers. He is driven by short-term profit to put
financial considerations above all else, whether that be long-term
investment, research on fledgling technologies or his employees' jobs.
On this view, he has gripped his company with a dead hand, unwilling to take
the risks which could have pushed GEC into exciting fields in consumer
electronics or computing.
Lord Weinstock, the critics allege, had the chance to turn GEC into a
company which could have matched the power of Matsushita of Japan, Siemens
of Germany or Philips of Holland.
But he never really tried, they say, because he was content to be in the
second division of the world league as long as he enjoyed a dominant
position in domestic markets. Indeed they allege his obsessive caution is
responsible for much of the failure of British manufacturing since the
1960s.
That widespread caricature is outdated, inaccurate and shortsighted. Some of
the charges of holding industry back are groundless: for instance his record
in the heavy electrical industry is difficult to fault. Others are
one-sided: the financial prudence which critics complain of has lent the
company a stability many of his competitors would envy. But Lord Weinstock
is far more complicated than the caricaturists allege. He does not merely
reduce things to numbers, he uses numbers more like a language to interpret
business. His hatred of waste is not the product of greed for short-term
profit, but a much more deep-seated utilitarian ethic.
Lord Weinstock's style was forged by his family route into business. He
recreates a family atmosphere in his offices, working with a tightly knit
group of highly trusted colleagues. Like a family, relations among the small
team in the fifth-floor offices in the company's headquarters are open,
usually relaxed, sometimes fractious, occasionally heated and completely
informal. They live in one another's pockets. As a result they can take
decisions with enormous speed.
However, outside these intensely close relations with his immediate
colleagues, Lord Weinstock seems distant and cold.
He finds self-publicity distasteful. It is as if at an early age someone
advised him not to draw too much attention to himself. This shyness has had
a profound impact on the business.
He is not an adventurous marketeer like Mr Alan Sugar of Amstrad. He is wary
of the risk of trying to create a market that does not already exist.
Some senior executives within GEC want to break out of the constraints of
the Weinstock style.
Mr Fletcher says: 'There is a growing awareness of the need to connect to
the outside world. We have undersold and under represented ourselves. It is
in the nature of GEC to keep a low profile, to do a good job and let that
speak for itself. Like a lot of Lord Weinstock's sayings it has a lot of
common sense but sometimes you have got to do more to sell yourself.'
The family beginnings of Lord Weinstock's career also shaped his attitude
towards money. A senior Stanhope Gate executive says: 'He spends GEC's money
as if it is his own.'
While some - most recently Robert Maxwell the publisher - have abused the
kind of power Lord Weinstock enjoys at GEC, he is strictly abstemious. There
are no grey areas where GEC's money and the family's private interests are
blurred. The Pounds 1m a year he spends on his racehorses comes from his own
pocket, not from the pockets of GEC shareholders.
He deplores waste with a vengeance so fierce that many who work with accuse
him of going too far. 'He is downright mean about salaries,' remarks one
senior Marconi executive who has spent 30 minutes on the telephone arguing
with his boss over whether to pay a young recruit a slightly higher salary
than normal.
One of Stanhope Gate's most highly regarded executives is an energy-saving
specialist who tours the world, turning up at GEC factories late at night to
find out how many lights they have left on. However, it is not just profit
but old-fashioned cash that drives Lord Weinstock.
One of the company's largest institutional shareholders comments: 'He sits
on top of the till, watching the cash come in and go out.'
This belief in the virtues of money helped to steer GEC clear of the
troubled financial waters which claimed so many apparently robust companies
in the past few years.
He deeply distrusts even audited figures for profits and asset values,
unless they are backed up by something more concrete - money. Lord Weinstock
remarks: 'If you think you make a profit it is reassuring to see it in the
form of money. When people are making a profit but not making money then we
have learned to become suspicious.'
He retains a deeply cautious approach to borrowing, still proud that he has
always had enough cash and liquid assets to cover any overdraft with the
bank.
The other side of the coin of this financial prudence, however, is Lord
Weinstock's very cautious approach to risk. It was not always that way.
He launched himself into the British business world as a huge gambler. In
the late 1950s he was selling and making televisions and radios in west
London. A decade later he was running most of the British electrical
industry.
He recalls: 'We had no option and we had nothing to lose. In the mid-1950s
it was all risk. My father-in-law was being boycotted by the radio trade, we
had little money, an old factory and no way to sell our products in a
heavily overpopulated industry. The risk of failure was enormous. But we
turned out to be the only survivors of the more than 20 companies who were
around at the time.'
It was during the rationalisation when AEI and English Electric were merged
into GEC that Lord Weinstock gained his reputation for ruthlessness.
Trade-union critics alleged it bordered upon savagery in 1969 when he closed
a single plant, the old English Electric telecommunications factory at
Woolwich, with thousands of job losses.
A colleague who has worked with him for 28 years says Lord Weinstock has
changed markedly: 'In 1968 he was full of vigour, a real tiger. Now he is an
old man, his attention span is short, his eyesight is terrible and he is a
hypochondriac. His whole approach to life is much more cautious.'
Others who have worked closely with him allege that after all the upheavals
of the late 1960s he went to sleep in the 1970s. As the cash mounted from
the merged group, he sat back rather than taking a bold initiative which
could have pushed the GEC forward into growth areas of electronics. It was
in the 1970s that much of British industry decisively lost its competitive
edge. During this period the GEC giant, in which so much hope had been
invested, slumbered.
Lord Weinstock's own explanation is not entirely convincing. He says: 'The
radar was scanning the whole time but sometimes there is no traffic. There
was nothing to do, so we did nothing. People wanted me to make things which
have lost a lot of money for those that did make them.'
He argues that he is not abnormally averse to risks. Yet It is just that he
sees risk everywhere he looks.
He likes reducing uncertainty to a minimum before taking a decision. He
deals in reason and evidence rather than visions and faith.
He believes that rational thought is the basis for good business, rather
than the drive of greed. And his belief in this rational thought is the
source of his political and social tolerance. 'Prejudice pollutes the way
people think,' he remarks.
His distrust of zealots and dislike of fashion meant he had an uncomfortable
time with the rightwing idolatry of Thatcherism. A former Conservative trade
and industry secretary acknowledges: 'He had a very rough time in the 1980s.
But over the long run I think history will judge him rather well.'
From the mid-1980s, government policy moved against GEC in several areas.
For instance, defence contracting was opened to competitive fixed-price
tendering. Lord Weinstock was, however, not impressed by convictions based
on faith rather than evidence, and an economic boom based on debt rather
than cash. He knew too much about the reality of British industry to join
the chorus which claimed that a spirit of enterprise had transformed
manufacturing.
He is intensely and annoyingly sceptical. He likes argument almost as much
as he adores opera, often to the frustration of his colleagues. Mr Murray
Easton, the chief executive of Yarrow, GEC's naval shipyard, describes how
best to deal with his boss. 'He is always testing you. The best thing is to
stand up for yourself. The line sometimes goes silent but the best thing is
to stand your ground. If you do not he will never trust you.'
Lord Weinstock says of himself: 'I am not diplomatic, I am fairly blunt. I
am not malicious and I do not harbour any hostile feelings towards anyone. I
like to have an argument about an issue, say openly and in complete
frankness what I think, and then once we have decided the best way ahead I
accept it and I expect others to do the same.'
This belief in logical argument is combined with an appetite for detailed
evidence which is so insatiable that it is simply staggering. His obsessive
attention to the very smallest detail is one of the hallmarks of his style.
The extent of Lord Weinstock's involvement in the minutiae of GEC companies
would stun chief executives who believe their role is to decide grand
strategy.
Mr Fletcher says: 'If we do not have several calls in a day from him or his
staff then we think the telephone is broken.'
Mr Pierre Bilger, chief executive of GEC-Alsthom concurs: 'We expect to get
a phone call every two days inquiring about anything from big strategic
issues to the performance of a particular contract.'
Anecdotes about his hunger for detail abound. A manager at GPT, the
telecommunications division, displays the four pages of his monthly
financial report, which have been pored over with a fine-toothed comb even
though the business only has an annual turnover of just Pounds 20m. On the
back page is a headmasterly warning: 'Most unsatisfactory. Please see
comments.'
At a recent budget meeting a managing director had just explained his plans
for his main seven fixed costs. Lord Weinstock then demanded that he justify
in detail the 24 items which made up the small residual 'others' category in
planned fixed costs. It took about an hour to mollify him.
Hotpoint, the consumer appliances group which GEC runs jointly with General
Electric of the US, is reorganising its after-sales service centres after
Lord Weinstock, posing as a disgruntled customer, got a
less-than-satisfactory reply to a telephone inquiry.
Some chief executives decide strategy and then work out the detail of how to
implement it. Lord Weinstock works the other way around. He believes that if
the details of a business are looked after, the rest will fall into place.
But it is when he moves from figures to people that the combination of
rationality and shyness puts him at his weakest.
Although he believes the business should be financially driven he does not
motivate his managers with financial incentives. He claims he mainly tries
to persuade them by the force of argument: 'The first thing I have to do is
inculcate a methodology based on logical processes. I do not believe in
imposing things upon people. You cannot make people think something, you
have to persuade people about what to do.'
Mr Jim Cronin, GEC-Alsthom's finance director, says: 'He is an educator. He
very rarely tells you what to do. He shows you how to do things rather than
trying to do them for you.'
This does not mean he is soft, because he has an equally strong commitment
to personal responsibility. This was the basis of his attack on the old
industrial establishment in the 1960s.
The companies he took over were suffocating beneath hierarchies of
management which meant that responsibility for most decisions were lost in a
dense network of committees and procedures.
He scythed through that by devolving responsibility to the managers who ran
his businesses. That is why people like working for Lord Weinstock: he
trusts them with great autonomy. It is quite common to find managers at GEC
who have been with the company for between 20 and 30 years.
If managers make a mistake, however, Lord Weinstock holds them personally
responsible. Some are fired, more often they are moved sideways. Once a
manager's copybook has been blotted it takes a long time for the stain to be
removed from Lord Weinstock's memory.
He expects other people to do their jobs without being told how to. He does
not intervene in a subsidiary just to reinforce his authority. In this sense
he is egalitarian, he deals with people as if they were equals.
Nevertheless his faith in the power of argument has its drawbacks. 'He has
not got a clue about the motivational side of man management,' says a GEC
director.
He seems to believe that action should flow like a logical consequence from
a reasoned argument. Managers may revel in the devolution of power, but
their egos are deprived of the oxygen of praise. There is a motivational
austerity at GEC.
Mr Kelvin Bray, a senior executive at GEC-Alsthom who has worked for GEC
since the 1960s, says: 'Lord Weinstock focuses upon what does not work
rather than what works well. If it is working well it does not need his
attention. Silence is praise. When you hear from him it means something is
not right.'
Lord Weinstock believes praise is a currency which is easily devalued. He
will praise people when he is inspired by an exceptional performance. But he
believes praise is usually either empty rhetoric or an excuse to be
patronising. 'Who am I to praise someone for doing his job well? That
implies I am above them or that they are doing it to please me. The point is
to do the job well, to help one another to do the job better. A well-done
job speaks for itself.'
He is also shy - a characteristic often mistaken for arrogance - and is far
less emotionally robust than most people think. He is intensely vulnerable
to being let down by people he trusts. He admits: 'My biggest disappointment
is the failure of a few people to live up to the expectations I had of them.
They did not turn out to be the guys I thought they were. Some of the swans
turned out be geese.'
To his many critics - in and outside the company - the Weinstock swan has
turned out to be an obstinately slow-moving goose.
But most critics misunderstand him or hardly know him. He is ruthless, yet
he has an underlying cultural and social tolerance which leaves him open to
debate and ideas. He also has an irrepressible sense of humour, which means
he constantly tells jokes of widely varying quality. He has held tight to
old-fashioned liberal beliefs in the value of education, reason, and
learning when many others in the 1980s were attracted by the intellectual
and business fashions of the time. Above all he has a mind of amazing
agility and ceaseless energy, which produces a bewildering array of ideas,
most of which are quickly embraced and swiftly dropped.
On the other hand he has great weaknesses which are reflected in his
company. He is not a marketeer; he does not revel in taking risks; he is
fascinated by consumer markets but lacks the confidence to conquer them; his
obsession with detail means his horizon is often too limited, while he seems
at times both naive and unforgiving in his judgments of people.
In the last 30 years he has been the custodian of a vast chunk of Britain's
industrial inheritance. He has protected it better than virtually anyone
else could have, but he has failed to build upon it as much as he might have
done.
Lord Weinstock is one of a stream of Jewish entrepreneurs of central
European emigre descent - men such as Wolfson and Thorn, Sobell and Warburg
 -who threw open the shutters of the musty world of British business. Arnold
Weinstock is one of the last of that band whose roots lie in the upheavals
which shook Europe in the early decades of the century. One of the last, and
certainly one of the best.
IN HIS OWN WORDS
1992:
Weinstock on his office: 'The place must be sufficiently bright not to
depress people.'
'I'm not interested in image. We are what we are.'
'Most of my life revolves around my job. It is what I am doing most of the
time, wherever I am.'
October 1990:
On his son Simon succeeding him: 'Of course I would like it, but only on
condition that it fulfilled his life and not that he did something to please
me.'
On the EFA radar project: 'The cat is not yet in the bag but it is rapidly
moving towards it.'
1990:
On whether GEC has missed opportunities for growth: 'If the number 73 bus
goes down Park Lane and you're in Oxford Street, it is not a missed
opportunity if you didn't get on it in Park Lane.'
1989:
On the company's recent record: 'The stock market took the view that because
something was not happening every day we were fast asleep. That was all
absolutely rubbish.'
1989:
'The minimum scale for effective survival is always rising. A niche can
easily become a tomb.'
1989:
On the joint ventures: 'Everywhere in Europe companies are giving up
sovereignty because of the costs involved in research and development. The
extent and speed of technological changes are such that no one thinks he is
capable of doing it all on his own.'
1969:
'One of the strategic decisions we have virtually made is whether to become
one of the major world companies in micro-circuits. We really see no
alternative.'
1969:
On doing statistic at the LSE: 'I did not have enough background to do
mathematics.'
1969:
'Some of us here have the feeling we are involved in a crusade.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / Technology: Design tools a maturing market - An industry
widens its range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The development of many consumer and industrial products depends upon the
design of sophisticated electronic devices and systems, and the speed at
which new products can be brought to market is often critical for
competitive success.
However, for the electronics engineer, grappling with ever greater levels of
complexity, the design process itself can be an increasingly difficult and
time-consuming task. Without help, productivity quickly declines and
development times stretch out.
Electronic design automation (EDA) software gives the engineer a set of
'tools' that help rapidly turn concepts into products. Using design
automation software not only speeds up the process - for example by
providing libraries of commonly used components - but can also enable the
engineer to check complex designs by simulation.
As a 'top-down' design methodology, EDA allows designers to focus on the
overall architecture and behaviour of a component or system, rather than
being forced to deal with details at the structural level. Engineers can
concentrate on what they want the product to do, rather than on how it will
do it.
The worldwide market for design automation software has grown to around
Dollars 1.6bn, fuelled by the demands of the semiconductor, computer and
electronics industries.
Meanwhile, suppliers know how it feels to have been at the sharp end of a
young and fast-moving industry - one which has undergone a substantial
restructuring. 'If you go back 10 years, all the players that were key
players then, are out of the market now,' says Joseph Costello, president
and chief executive of Cadence Design Systems.
Among the casualties have been once high-flying companies such as Daisy
Systems - acquired by Intergraph - and Valid Logic Systems - which was
'merged' into Cadence at the end of last year.
Aided by a string of acquisitions and mergers, California-based Cadence has
now caught up with Mentor Graphics, its arch rival, and reported EDA
software revenues last year of Dollars 392m. But both Cadence and Mentor
reported losses in 1991, reflecting the tough market conditions.
Many of the industry's corporate pioneers faltered - or are still struggling
 -because they failed to anticipate the move from proprietary minicomputers
to general purpose workstations, and then because they tried unsuccessfully
to bundle hardware with software into turnkey packages.
They also failed to spot the trend in the mid-1980s towards 'open' systems
hardware and software. Customers wanted to be able to 'mix and match' EDA
tools, and Cadence exploited this in 1985 by pioneering the design framework
concept - an open systems platform for applications software that enables
tools to be plugged together easily.
However, there are now signs that the EDA industry is beginning to mature.
Industry growth rates are slowing, and stable hardware and software
platforms have emerged. After a wave of consolidation culminating in the
Cadence-Valid merger, there are now only a handful of big suppliers.
Aside from Cadence, which made a Dollars 21.7m loss in 1991, and Mentor,
which lost Dollars 61m on sales of Dollars 400m last year, these include
Racal-Redac in the UK, which managed to reduce its losses last year to less
than Pounds 5m, and Japan's Zuken group. But several fast-growing smaller
companies, such as US-based Viewlogic Systems and Synopsis, have also
emerged to exploit market niches or new software ideas.
Viewlogic, for example, pioneered EDA software which allows customers to
make use of field-programmable gate arrays - devices that can be
electronically tailored to fit specific applications. However, the
Massachusetts-based company, which went public in December, has recently
launched a broader package of 'next generation' design automation tools
called PowerView.
Indeed, EDA customers have generally demanded that vendors supply broader
product ranges. It was the need to serve this wider marketplace which led to
the merger in 1988 of two Silicon Valley start-ups called ECAD and SDA
Systems and the creation of Cadence.
SDA had focused on integrated circuit (IC) design automation tools, but
recognised that it also needed to be able to provide the software used to
design whole systems. Nevertheless Costello, SDA's chief operating officer
at the time, admits it was only after the merger with Valid that Cadence
could rank with Mentor as full range EDA supplier.
Costello insists there is still 'a tremendous amount of growth' in the EDA
market, particularly for simulation software. 'If you're not simulating you
are really not designing on the computer,' he says.
But not everyone is convinced. Some, like Charles Foundyller, an analyst
with Massachussets-based Daratech, believe the industry's recent relatively
lacklustre performance may indicate that the market for EDA software is
nearing saturation.
He is also reserving judgment on whether Cadence can produce substantial
organic growth. 'Cadence has done a good job of hiding its problems by
acquisitions,' he says.
Not surprisingly, Costello rejects such criticism, arguing that, excluding
last year, the company has had a compound annual growth rate on top of
mergers in the past few years of over 50 per cent and that, in some product
areas, for example analogue tools, Cadence has built up a Dollars 50m
business from scratch.
He is also confident that customers - who, he says, consistently identify as
a key issue the need to reduce the time taken to market and master design
complexity - will continue to turn to EDA for solutions.
The only way to tackle these design issues, he believes, is to change the
process or automate. Either way, he says, the EDA vendors should gain -
through higher levels of expenditure on design automation software, or by
providing consultancy services.
Selling customers design expertise, as well as software, is an increasingly
important source of new revenues for the EDA vendors. For example, earlier
this year Cadence signed a three-year EDA consulting agreement with Japan's
Sony electronics group.
In five years time, Costello forecasts, consultancy could represent a
quarter of Cadence's business. If he is right, the distinctions between
software vendors, systems houses, consultancy firms and hardware vendors may
be erased.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Technology: Digital's package aims to revive declining -
Hopes of commercial recovery lie in Alpha technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the loss-making US computer manufacturer, this week took
its biggest step so far towards securing its future, announcing products
that bridge the gap between the technology of yesterday and that of
tomorrow.
It announced:
a series of 13 new computer systems, ranging from a desktop workstation to a
small mainframe, that are compatible with its earlier Vax technology, but
can make the jump to its new Alpha systems.
modifications to its proprietary VMS operating system which will enable it
to be classified as an 'open' system - that is, conforming to the broadest
industry standards.
a programme to make it simple for DEC's existing customers to move to the
new Alpha systems as they become available.
DEC, with annual revenues of over Dollars 13bn, is the world's third largest
information technology company after International Business Machines and
Fujitsu, but it lost more than Dollars 500m last year.
Its success in the past decade has been based on its Vax computer family, a
range of machines all of which use the same VMS operating system and which
can therefore run the same applications software.
It failed, however, to move quickly enough into workstations powered by Risc
(reduced instruction set computing) chips, or into open systems, the fastest
growing parts of the business.
Its principal hope of commercial recovery lies in Alpha technology, which it
has been working on for over two years. Alpha technology involves a 64-bit
architecture or machine design and a 64-bit Risc microprocessor chip.
Tests indicate that the Alpha Risc architecture is faster than the IBM or
Hewlett Packard equivalent in transaction processing benchmarks, according
to Geoffrey Shingles, DEC's UK managing director. The first Alpha machines
will be available by the end of the year.
There are now some 10m users of Vax technology worldwide which DEC hopes
will switch to Alpha technology. The systems announced this week are
intended to facilitate an easy move.
The new machines, while running VMS, are designed so that they can be
upgraded to Alpha by inserting a printed circuit board incorporating the new
processor chip.
At the same time, X/Open, the open systems standards body, has agreed that
DEC's latest VMS operating systems conform with open systems specifications
(in technical terms, its conforms with X/Open's XPG3 standard). DEC is
calling the system Open/VMS.
Michael Lambert of X/Open said: 'Digital's success in obtaining XPG3
conformance for Open/VMS represents a clear response to user needs and the
strongest possible commitment to open systems.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / Technology: Foiling the forgers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Use a credit card to shop in London and you can expect to see the sales
clerk scrutinise the signature on the back of your card to see if it matches
the one you have scribed on a sales slip.
Now fly to New York and pull out the plastic again. The chances are that
your signature will not even merit a second glance, but the card will
probably be 'authorised' by swiping it through a slot in the side of a
telephone, or built into the cash register that reads information on the
magnetic stripe on the back of the card and transmits it, via telephone
lines, to a central computer.
Retailers and banks have adopted varying methods of validating credit card
transactions in different parts of the world. All, however, address the
universal problem of growing credit card fraud.
Losses from card fraud have risen alarmingly over the past two years. Visa
International measured fraud and counterfeit losses on its credit cards last
year at Dollars 623.4m, up 52 per cent on 1990. In the UK, the Home Office
estimates card fraud cost Pounds 165m last year, up from Pounds 150.3m in
1990.
Technology is widely seen as the chief weapon in the fight against card
cheats, but applications must take account of regional differences.
Automated signature verification holds greater promise in markets where
credit card signatures are routinely checked, whereas in the US, the process
would have to be disguised to make it acceptable to cardholders, who see
this type of authorisation as an insult to their integrity.
Perhaps because the British are accustomed to having signatures checked, the
technology is a focus of research and development in the UK.
AEA Technology, a unit of the former Atomic Energy Authority, has developed
a signature verification system based upon a 'neural network'  - an array of
computing elements that mimics the thought processes of the human mind.
Rather than simply analysing elements of the signature, like a conventional
computer system, the 'Harwell Countermatch' also views the signature as a
whole in the way as a person might get an overall impression of its
appearance. The signature is mapped against a sample which can be recorded
on the magnetic strip or semiconductor memory in a credit card.
The AEA system overcomes one of the drawback's of automatic signature
verification by learning as it goes and picking up on the natural variations
in a signature. So the accuracy of the system improves with use.
In trials where forgers attempted to copy signatures, the system detected
over 95 per cent of forgeries, while less than 1 per cent of authentic
signatures were rejected.
Barclaycard, the largest issuer of credit cards in the UK, is testing
signature verification, voice recognition and fingerprint matching. All are
seen as long-term ways to avoid credit card fraud at the point of sale.
Signature verification is widely seen as the most acceptable form of
automatic verification because it is less intrusive and does not require
significant changes in the familiar procedures involved in using a credit
card.
In the US, point-of-sale credit card verification is the exception, rather
than the rule. However, Visa is conducting a trial of electronic signature
capture in Gap clothing stores. While the aim of this experiment is to
eliminate paperwork, it would be feasible to incorporate signature
verification into the system without any change which is perceivable by the
customer.
Nobody in the credit card industry sees signature verification as the sole
solution to credit card fraud, and there is a broad consensus that the focus
of prevention must move away from the point of sale toward authorisation
networks. The UK's high telecommunications costs are therefore a serious
drawback, inhibiting merchants and bankers from accessing remote data
processing centers.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: Non-trading companies cast shadow over
standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN A small US business began a legal action against a British company
earlier this year, it stumbled across a problem that raises far-reaching
questions about the accounting and legal regulations for non-trading and
dormant companies in the UK.
Pentagen Technologies International, a software company operating from New
York, which wanted to register as a non-resident UK company five years ago,
appears to have found itself in the bizarre situation of entering into a
contract with a company which does not trade.
According to a writ for Dollars 32m in damages filed by Pentagen in the New
York state supreme court in April this year, Pentagen asked Jordan and Sons
 -which is part of Jordan Group, the Bristol-based corporate information and
services group - to act as its company secretary in August 1987.
Under UK company law, the company secretary performs a wide range of
functions, including taking responsibility for maintaining share and other
official registers and filing annual returns and accounts with Companies'
House.
Jordans sent an application form in the name of Express Company Secretaries
to provide registered office and company secretarial services. Pentagen
completed the form, paid a fee, and returned the documents. The writ alleges
that these services were never performed and seeks compensation for the
consequences.
'What followed was your worst nightmare,' says Mr Joel Robinson, a lawyer
representing Pentagen. The company continued to develop over the next three
years, and was on the point of negotiating a contract worth up to Dollars
11m with the US army to provide it with voice recognition and language
translation software.
But in early 1990, he says, an internal audit by Pentagen picked up the fact
that the company was no longer registered in the UK. After failing to meet
the statutory requirements, it had been struck off the company register and
dissolved in 1990. On hearing of the difficulties, its bankers shied away
and the US army backed out from the software deal.
Mr Robinson was hired to consider possible legal action, and requested the
accounts of Express Company Secretaries as part of his background research.
To his horror, he discovered that the company had not traded during any of
the last five years and in 1988 had become 'dormant', which means it does
not have to appoint auditors or file a profit and loss account. 'It was the
furthest thing from my mind when I did the search,' he says.
The details of the Pentagen case are less important than the general point
it seems to raise about UK company law and accounting standards. Thousands
of other customers are entering into similar contracts with UK companies
which are shown in their accounts to be non-trading. The process seems to be
completely legal, but, in the words of one accountant, appears to be a
'modest subterfuge'. It certainly seems to make a mockery of the accounting.
Mr Michael Whitwell, chief executive of Jordan Group and a director of
Express, refuses to comment on the Pentagen case because of the US legal
action. But he says: 'It is easy to read too much into it. This is a normal
and sensible way to provide a company secretary. Others do the same thing.
It is not in any way abnormal. It is an entirely genuine arrangement which
works very effectively.'
The situation is far from unique to Jordans. For example, London Law Agency,
a rival company registration service, says that it also offers company
secretarial services through a non-trading company, called London Law
Secretarial.
Mr Ray Hinton, technical partner with Arthur Andersen, says: 'I grant you
it's misleading.' But he says many companies have non-trading subsidiaries.
These are often businesses which have been bought and which have a
brand-name the new owner wants to maintain, perhaps because customers want
to think they are still trading with the original company. 'They want to
retain the goodwill, but don't want the effort of audited accounts,' he
says.
Mr Whitwell says that Jordans uses non-trading secretarial companies for all
of its customers. The reason, he argues, is simply 'administrative
efficiency' so that mail received on behalf of companies it represents is
not confused with correspondence intended for Jordans itself.
Mr John Franks, a partner with solicitors Chethams and a member of the Law
Society's company law committee, stresses there is nothing illegal about the
practice, as long as the ultimate owner (or 'principal') of the subsidiary
(the 'agent') is disclosed. If anything goes wrong, he suggests, it is still
possible to sue the principal, even if the contract was drawn up with the
agent.
This relationship would appear to be clearly shown in the case of Express,
which lists two Jordans directors as its directors, and is ultimately owned
by the West of England Trust, the parent company of Jordan Group. West of
England is also listed in the latest filings as the company secretary for
Express.
None the less, it does seem rather strange. On the one hand, a non-trading
company that operates with no employees, no accounts and no transactions
passing through its books. On the other, one that is named in a contract as
the entity which will be providing a range of services for a fee, and which
individuals need to be paid to perform. Should its books not at least show a
fee for acting as a nominee for another company?
It hardly seems to comply with the requirement that the accounts should show
a true and fair view. There again, in the case of a dormant company, there
is no need for an auditor to scrutinise the accounts either.
This is what perplexes Mr Robinson. Pentagen entered into a contract with
Express, yet Express does not trade even though it pledges to provide a wide
range of services. Aside from the requirements set down for a company
secretary by law, Pentagen's contract explicitly listed a series of
responsibilities to be carried out by Express, including filing documents,
supplying minutes for the annual general meeting, and forwarding mail in its
role as the registered office of the company.
'People are not getting what they bargained for,' he says. 'If the
subsidiaries are soliciting business and offering to provide secretarial
services, they must be trading. Otherwise it's like an egg shell with no
yolk or white. There's a real ethical question. When you pay for the
service, you are not told the company is non-trading.'
Mr Franks is blunter. 'To be a non-trading company when you are acting as an
agent seems to me to be wrong. If the name is being used, there ought to be
accounts which explain the position. But it's part of the mystery of
chartered accountancy. It seems to me the existing accounting practices are
not sound. They enable things to disappear behind a smokescreen.'
The Accounting Standards Board says it has no current plans to consider the
status of non-trading companies. As Mr Franks says: 'It's one of the greyer
areas of accounting. But we've got so many of those.'

TRANSPORT ministers will next week try to present the privatisation of
British Rail as an opportunity to improve service quality before the next
general election, Ralph Atkins writes.
The long-awaited white paper on BR's privatisation will stress the possible
benefits in terms of increased flexibility in services, improved customer
service and lower fares. The department regards the sell-off as unique in
that there will be less emphasis on the amount it will raise for the
Treasury.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is expected to argue that the
continuing high level of public subsidy for the railways means the
government will continue to have a say over the level of services.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs facing test over salary link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS BY the government to curb a politically embarrassing rise in top
civil servants' salaries may provoke a row with MPs whose pay is linked to
the rates paid in Whitehall.
Ministers have belatedly discovered that plans to alter civil servants'
scales would trigger a debate followed by a Commons vote that they could not
guarantee to win.
The difficulty arises from the automatic linkage between an MP's salary  -
currently Pounds 30,854 - and a specified point on the salary scale for
senior civil servants. Under new pay arrangements, which the government is
still discussing with Whitehall unions, that scale disappears.
While a broadly equivalent linkage point could be found under the new
arrangements, the obstacle is that it would require a Commons vote. On
previous such occasions, MPs have refused to accept government advice about
the need for modest rises only.
Mr John Major has been kept informed of progress on the issue because of its
sensitivity at present.
The cabinet is today set to reject the independent recommendations of the
Top Salaries Review Body for pay rises of up to 30 per cent for senior
public servants, and for a substantial increase in an MP's office costs
allowance.
Rises for senior civil servants, judges and generals will be confined
instead to single figures.
The need for a review of MPs' pay will turn on whether the current Commons
motion is broad enough to apply when fixed salary scales are replaced by
ranges.
The Treasury admitted yesterday that 'there could be a need to change the
resolution'. In the event of a Commons debate, MPs and not the government
would decide the new salary arrangements. Party whips traditionally do not
apply on the issue.
The move to salary ranges for civil servants is intended to bring greater
flexibility, so that pay within each grade can be tailored to individual
performance.

concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR backbenchers are taking steps to counteract the possibility that Mr
John Smith might develop a 'bunker mentality' after he is elected leader of
the opposition at the end of next week, Ivo Dawnay writes.
After years of behind-the-scenes griping that Mr Neil Kinnock's staff
overprotected the leader from his troops, several MPs are planning to ensure
clearer lines of communication are kept open to the new leadership.
Yesterday, Mr Graham Allen, the Nottingham North MP, won unopposed support
from the parliamentary Labour party for a general review of the organisation
and workings of the PLP, aimed at involving backbench MPs more closely in
decision-making.
Mr Allen said yesterday: 'In the past, in order to get a helpful suggestion
considered you had to create a campaign or a row. There should be a
mechanism whereby good ideas as well as discontent can be expressed.'
Mr Derek Foster, the chief whip re-elected last week, also made representing
backbench interests an important element in his campaign.
Aware of the mood within the party, Mr Smith had already promised such a
review when he made his leadership campaign presentation to the party last
month.
His supporters say he will conduct his leadership in a more collegiate
style, provoking less of the 'insiders and outsiders' divisions complained
of by the left.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Winterton anger at committee move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE row over government interference in MPs' rights to scrutinise its
activities exploded last night after the controversial Conservative chairman
of the health select committee claimed Tory whips had blocked his
re-appointment.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Macclesfield MP who has often criticised the
government, said the move was 'blatant interference' by business managers in
the supposedly neutral work of the selection committee which names each
body's members.
Despite Mr John Major's pledge to open government, he said, 'the politics of
dissent' were being crushed by the imposition of 'obedience, obedience,
obedience.'
Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP restored to the social services committee in
1987 after Mr Winterton interceded for him in similar circumstances, is now
to return the favour. He will table an amendment to the committee
selections, substituting Mr Winterton for another Tory MP.
However, neither man was confident last night that the amendment would be
carried after a clearly intentional demonstration by government business
managers of their muscle.
Labour is expected to take the chairmanship of six committees, including the
social security committee, which is poised to revive its investigation into
the Maxwell affair.
Mr John Watts, Conservative MP for Slough, was last night emerging as
favourite to become chairman of the Treasury select committee, replacing Mr
Terence Higgins.
However, Tory MPs on the trade and industry committee are threatening to
rebel against the Conservative whips' decision to give the chairmanship to
Labour - probably either Mr Doug Hoyle, MP for Warrington North, or Stan
Orme, MP for Salford East. A possible Tory candidate would be Sir Anthony
Grant, MP for Cambridgeshire South West.
The selection committee's decisions, based on the nominations of party
whips, will be announced today and debated on Monday.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Sotheby's relieved at sale of Rembrandt: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WAVE of relief washed over the auction room at Sotheby's yesterday as
Rembrandt's impressive portrait of Johannes Uyttenbogaert was knocked down
at Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 4.18m with premium).
It was bought by Dr Otto Naumann, a dealer, on behalf of the man sitting
beside him, Dr Alfred Bader, a Milwaukee-based collector of Dutch
17th-century painting - predominantly of the Rembrandt school.
Dealers and collectors have been playing a waiting game to see what happens
in the market for Old Masters. Sotheby's showed signs of nervousness ahead
of yesterday's auction and can seldom have expended more energy on trying to
find buyers.
The picture - which had an impeccable country house provenance and the
blessing of the Rembrandt Research Project - was offered with an extremely
cautious estimate of Pounds 3m-plus. A small Rembrandt panel bought in at
Christie's in April had drawn bids up to Pounds 6m.
A Sotheby's saleroom notice announced that an overseas purchaser who applied
for an export licence immediately after the auction would not be obliged to
pay the purchase price until after the licence was granted - or in six
months if that were sooner.
Mr Julien Stock, head of Sotheby's Old Master department, said he had known
before the sale that he had a buyer but not an underbidder - a second
interested person to bid up the price.
Dr Naumann also secured a striking canvas by Giulio Cesare Procaccini of a
strangely smiling Judith clutching the head of Holofernes. It was offered
with a low estimate of Pounds 25,000-Pounds 35,000 and realised Pounds
209,000.
Guido Reni's David with the Head of Goliath, the second main lot of the
sale, fared less well. Mr Stock said there had been four serious contenders
for the picture but none materialised on the day. Bidding on the picture
stopped at Pounds 1.25m - one bid more would have secured it.
The vendor was one of many at Sotheby's - and tomorrow at Christie's -
prepared to sell at a considerable loss. The Reni canvas was bought for
Pounds 2m at Sotheby's in 1985 when the National Gallery in London had hoped
to acquire it.
Bidding on Lucas Cranach the Elder's sensual personification of Justice
crept up to Pounds 350,000, and a number of lots sold surprisingly well. An
extravagant architectural capriccio by Francisco Gutierrez made Pounds
181,500 (estimate Pounds 30,000 plus) and another 17th-century Spanish
picture, a still life by Juan de Espinosa, realised Pounds 143,000. The
morning session totalled Pounds 7,422,800 with a respectable 71.32 per cent
sold by value.

FT  09 JUL 92 / EC 'green' laws face UK threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN may press for the repeal of some European Community environmental
legislation during its presidency of the EC, Mr Michael Howard, the
environment secretary, said yesterday.
His remarks provoked strong criticism from opposition politicians and
environmental groups, who said Britain had failed to meet EC environmental
standards on drinking water and clean beaches.
Mr Howard said some environmental matters were 'better dealt with at
national level'. He added that the government would pursue vigorously the
principle of subsidiarity - devolving regulation back from the EC to
national governments where possible.
'The EC's environment council has become something of a sausage machine,' he
said, referring to the ambitious programme of directives passed in the past
10 years, many of which were never successfully enforced. He added that the
UK presidency would emphasise 'the need to put promises into practice'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, a member of Labour's environment team, said: 'Michael
Howard's re-marks are frightening. We think he is paving the way for a UK
opt-out on EC environmental legislation.'
She added: 'His remarks call into question this government's commitment to
meet EC drinking water standards and clean-beach regulations.'
Friends of the Earth, the environmental lobby group, said: 'Mr Howard's
remarks are undoubtedly a lowering of environmental protection standards.'
Mr Howard would not say which legislation might be considered for repeal. He
said: 'Application of the principle of subsidiarity does not mean a
weakening of our vigorous pursuit of environmental objectives.'
Launching the government's plans for the UK presidency of the EC's
environment council yesterday, he said its priorities included regulation on
movements of waste, and national targets for carbon-dioxide emissions.
The council was also contemplating bringing forward the directive on the
phasing-out of ozone-depleting substances by one year, to the end of 1994.
One of the UK government's aims was the 'greening of all aspects of
Community policy', including agriculture, transport and energy.
The environment council, made up of environment ministers from EC countries,
will meet in September to consider how to put into practice commitments
signed at the United Nations Earth Summit.
BRITAIN would like to see a change in emphasis in the use of European
Community social funds, moving away from helping dying industries and more
towards helping the unemployed return to work, Lisa Wood writes.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, announced the aim yesterday
at a press conference on the UK's objectives for its presidency of the EC's
social affairs council, which she chairs. The UK will receive about Pounds
400m this year from the fund, more than half of which is spent on schemes
for the unemployed.
Attention would also be given to assisting labour mobility in the EC.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Industry praise for British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE QUARTERS of industrial gas consumers are satisfied with the service
they receive from British Gas, according to a survey released today by Ernst
&amp; Young. Most welcome the introduction of competition into the gas market
but are concerned about possible supply difficulties.
The survey of more than 60 of the UK's biggest industrial consumers, as well
as independent marketers and Ofgas, the industry regulator, is the first
undertaken since the market was opened to competition in 1990. It was
carried out by the Industrial Research Bureau.
Its findings may surprise critics of British Gas as well as independent
suppliers who have pledged to outperform British Gas's standards of service.
The belief that prices would fall was the reason most consumers supported
increasing competition, although the survey found factors such as possible
shortfalls in production and supply might result in prices remaining stable.
Around 90 per cent of respondents believed competition would benefit
industrial customers. Some large users were concerned about the ability of
independent shippers to supply gas in sufficient quantities.
Two thirds of users said they would not risk changing suppliers simply for
the sake of lower prices, but many said they were likely to buy from more
than one source.
Consumers said British Gas should continue to provide storage facilities for
independents who were unable to make the necessary investment, but should be
allowed a fair rate of return. British Gas looks set to clash with Ofgas
after insisting that the rate of return on its pipeline and storage business
should be 6.7 per cent on existing assets and 10.8 per cent on new
investments.
Many felt competition could be achieved more quickly if there was more
discussion - and less confrontation - between Ofgas and British Gas.
Overall, 75 per cent of large industrial consumers said the service they
received from British Gas was either 'outstanding' or 'above average'.
British Gas and Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals
group, have formed a jointly managed company to provide combined heat and
electricity to up to 10 of Rhone-Poulenc's 30 sites in the UK. British Gas
is investing up to Pounds 30m in the new company, Rhone-Poulenc Energy. It
will install and operate gas-fired plant, with the potential to sell surplus
power.

FT  09 JUL 92 / East Anglia leads lifestyle league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST ANGLIA appears to be the place for young families to live, with the
lowest crime and unemployment rates in the UK and also some of the best
childcare provision.
You'd certainly be better off in East Anglia than in the north of England,
according to the latest edition of Regional Trends, the annual digest of
statistics on the UK's 11 regions published today by the Central Statistical
Office.
The north is clearly no place to bring up the bairns: one in 50 youngsters
has tangled with the law by the age of 13. They leave school at 16 in
greater numbers than in the rest of the country, with some of the lowest
grades in GCSE French. Also the north has the highest burglary rate in the
UK.
Given the region's high unemployment levels - second only to Northern
Ireland - the surprise is that so many in the north have joined the
share-owning democracy. Only the south-east has a higher proportion of
adults owning shares.
Indeed, careful study of the statistics packed into this 27th edition of
Regional Trends offers ammunition for any prejudices against people from
other parts of the country:
The heaviest drinkers are found in the Yorkshire and Humberside region.
People in the north-west spend most on booze and fags.
est population driving the oldest cars. The morose Scots have the highest
male suicide rate in the country.
In spite of the suicidal tendencies of the locals, Scotland seems a pretty
close runner to East Anglia in the quality-of-life stakes. It has the
best-staffed schools and the highest proportion of children staying on after
16. Earnings are also the highest outside the south-east.
As for the people in East Anglia, they are more likely to own a car than
others - and also less likely to fail a breath test. Some people have all
the luck.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Boards' linguistic silence speaks volumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

MOST directors of the biggest UK companies fit the stereotype of the insular
Brit unable or unwilling to communicate in a foreign language.
They lack both the language skills and the overseas work experience
necessary to face the challenge of international competition and global
markets, according to a survey published today.
The latest board of directors study by Korn/Ferry International, the
executive search firm, says that fewer than one in five boardroom directors
of leading British companies speaks a foreign language and two thirds have
no experience of working abroad.
Of the 581 directors of 179 UK listed companies who responded to the survey,
84 per cent spoke no foreign language. Fourteen per cent spoke one foreign
language and 2 per cent spoke three or more. The proportion of directors
with language skills was no higher in companies that generated more than
half their business overseas last year.
Questionnaires were sent to the 335 UK companies in the Times European 1000
list and the next 500 largest British companies.
Mr Michael Brandon, a Korn/Ferry International director and author of the
study, said: 'Unless British boards take rapid steps to acquire the
necessary international skills and experience, UK Ltd is in danger of
becoming a foreign subsidiary.'
Perhaps the occupants of British boardrooms could learn a lesson or two from
the UK's top exporting companies. A straw poll conducted by the FT yesterday
among Britain's 10 most successful exporters showed that they generally
bucked the survey's findings.
Rolls-Royce, Shell UK and BP said virtually all their directors had been
based overseas at some stage, and most had at least a conversational grasp
of another language. Of Shell UK's 12 directors three are Dutch nationals
'who speak English better than the English'. However top marks go to Mr
David Simon, BP's new chief executive, who read modern languages including
French at university, speaks three other languages fluently, and studied for
his MBA at Fontainebleau.
IBM UK said the majority of its directors would have conversational French
at the very least since most had worked at the company's European
headquarters in Paris, and Ford UK said all but two of its 10-man board had
worked overseas. Ford boasts a German-speaking chairman in Mr Ian McAllister
together with a native German speaker in Mr Albert Caspers, and a
Spanish-speaking personnel director.
ICI said it did not know the level of language skills among its eight
non-executive directors but of the eight executive directors, four had more
than one language.
At Pearson, the FT's parent company, three of the 13 board members are
foreign nationals, another is a foreign resident and only one director
speaks no foreign language.
However, another board member makes up for this by boasting four languages,
including Hausa from north Nigeria.
The study also examines the composition of the British boardroom, the
balance between executive and non-executive directors, and the composition
of audit and remuneration committees.
Other main findings are:
Only 11 of the 581 directors were women and no company had more than one
woman on the board. Eight of the 11 women were non-executives.
Three quarters of UK companies had separate chairmen and chief executives -
as recommended by the Cadbury report on corporate governance. In a quarter
of those companies, the chairman was a full-time executive playing a leading
role. There was still, however, an overall majority (55 per cent) with
chairmen who were either part-time or non-executive, or full-time but not
playing the leading role in the organisation.
As the concentration of power and the level of involvement of the chairman
reduces, it becomes more likely that the majority of the board will be
non-executive. Among companies with non-executive chairmen, 55 per cent had
a non-executive majority, but among companies with a strong chairman role,
the proportion was less than 20 per cent.
Just under 60 per cent of the top executives of the largest companies with
turnover of Pounds 1bn or more have university degrees, while roughly one in
five is a qualified accountant.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Mortgage rescue scheme labelled a failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S mortgage rescue scheme is helping only a fraction of those
homeowners in arrears, according to a report published yesterday by the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body.
The report predicts that the number of homeowners who will be saved from
eviction this year by the scheme is unlikely to be much more than 10,000,
compared with predictions of 40,000 when the scheme was launched before
Christmas.
Central to the scheme was the government's decision to pay the mortgage
interest element of income support direct to the lenders. It was estimated
that up to half the money failed to reach lenders when it was paid to
borrowers.
However, a survey of Nationwide building society borrowers in arrears found
that more than four fifths of those on income support were already passing
over in full the interest they received. The report estimates that direct
payment of mortgage interest to the lenders is likely to avoid no more than
10,500 repossessions.
The report is even more gloomy on prospects for 'mortgage-to-rent' schemes,
which were supposed to allow those in arrears to remain in their homes as
tenants.
Although such schemes would reduce housing costs for about half of all
borrowers in arrears, the report found resistance among mortgage holders who
were determined to keep their status as homeowners if possible.
The most effective initiative had been the improved management of arrears by
lenders who realised that repossessions were worsening the decline in the
housing market.
The most effective measure, according to the report, would be a mortgage
benefit scheme providing help with housing costs to people on low income,
whether or not they were unemployed. With most of those in arrears in
employment, mortgage benefits would help 32 per cent of households but cost
the taxpayer of Pounds 800m a year.

stops creditors bringing civil proceedings against him.
At a private hearing before a Chancery Court registrar, Mr Maxwell, son of

Insolvency Act allowing him time to seek an 'individual voluntary
arrangement' with his creditors. Mr George Auger, of accountants Stoy

The order 'stays' all existing or pending civil proceedings against Mr

THE Ministry of Defence should consider contract hiring or leasing of new
vehicles because the old ones cost too much to repair, the Commons Public
Accounts Committee said yesterday, Daniel Green writes.
The MoD was 'running over-age vehicles and incurring costs on uneconomic
repairs' because it lacked the cash for purchases of replacements, the
committee said. The Treasury and the MoD should consider alternatives to
purchase, it said.
The MoD was also criticised for poor management information on the state of
its fleet of support vehicles. The committee called for 'a careful
independent review' of the vehicle needs of the services.

FORMAL approval of the proposed once-and-for-all payments to creditors of
BCCI should be delayed until the creditors have been consulted, Luxembourg's
state prosecutor said yesterday.
The Luxembourg court must approve the provisional agreement - worked out by
the bank's liquidators and its majority shareholder, the Abu Dhabi
government - before it can be implemented.
If the formal decision is delayed, it could prolong the often acrimonious
dispute between disgruntled independent creditors and the Abu Dhabi
authorities over the terms of the deal. The judge, Mrs Maryse Welter, will
deliver her ruling on July 20.
The provisional settlement would involve a payment of between Dollars 1.2bn
(Pounds 620m) and Dollars 1.7bn to creditors and has been approved by courts
in Britain and the Cayman Islands. But Luxembourg, where BCCI had its
brass-plate headquarters, has the final word.
BCCI's liquidators disclosed during yesterday's hearing that Abu Dhabi was
limiting their access to more than 60,000 documents relating to the bank.
The emirate's lawyers argued the government had done its best to make all
the necessary documents available to the liquidators. But the judge
indicated they had not done enough. 'It sounds as though some of those
dossiers - on loans, for example - would be useful, perhaps indispensable
(to the liquidators' investigations),' she said.
Lawyers for independent BCCI creditors in the UK and Luxembourg have been
fighting to prevent implementation of the settlement, which they believe is
not generous enough.
Lawyers for the Abu Dhabi government again warned creditors of the 'serious
risks' involved in turning down the offer. 'Unless the majority shareholders
choose to make a voluntary payment the creditors may get nothing,' Mr Louis

FT  09 JUL 92 / Channel 5 details VCR retuning fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE army of video recorder retuners needed to make the Channel 5 commercial
television station possible are going to be paid by results - at a basic fee
of Pounds 1.50 a home.
The details of how Channel Five Holdings, the only bidder for the Channel 5
licence, plans to visit every home in London and then in other cities are
spelt out in the full application document, published yesterday.
It will be the biggest door-to-door operation since homes were converted to
natural gas in the 1960s. The retuning of VCRs and other electronic
equipment is necessary because the Channel 5 signal will cause interference.
The consortium, led by Thames Television, plans to put more than 2,000
retuners each in charge of 2,000 homes in their area.
After training, the contracted workforce will be responsible for retuning as
many as possible of their designated homes in a five-month period before
Channel 5 transmission begins.
In addition to the basic payment of Pounds 1.50 a home, there will be
bonuses of 40p if 90 per cent of the work is completed before transmissions
begin.
After broadcasts have started, bonuses can be earned by the speed of
response to complaints of interference.
In a field trial in the Harrow area of London, retuning took an average of
10 minutes from arriving on the doorstep. In 10 working days, 61 per cent of
the 725 households involved were successfully retuned without any publicity
or prearranged appointments.
Thorn UK Rentals will be responsible for recruiting and training the main
retuning workforce.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Competition policy 'lacks deterrent'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENT competition policy fails to deter business from adopting or
considering anti-competitive behaviour, according to the former senior
economics adviser to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Writing in the Consumers' Association's Consumer Policy Review, Mr Robin
Aaronson says most UK companies look at competition policy in the wrong way
and do not plan rationally around the constraints it imposes.
As evidence, he quoted Tate &amp; Lyle, a company with nearly half the market
for a product, which bid twice for the company with the other half. Both
attempts were rejected after referral.
He says that all the evidence suggests a failure by the corporate sector to
balance regulatory risk against commercial advantage.
Competition policy in the UK is effective only when the authorities make a
direct intervention in a particular case. Its deterrent effect is much
weaker.
The costs of such lack of knowledge and understanding to the economy are
severe, he says. Large sums are spent on planning mergers and complying with
the Takeover Code and wasted when mergers are blocked.
Small businesses damaged by anti-competitive behaviour may go out of
business before the authorities have time to take action. Consumers suffer
directly by paying excessive prices for longer than they should.
Mr Aaronson suggests that policy changes could encourage business to take
more account of competition issues. In particular, the system of guidance to
companies offered by the Office of Fair Trading could be improved. The
authorities could also help if they gave clear explanations of their
decisions.
Mr Aaronson says the proliferation of competition authorities also causes
confusion, and combining the roles of the MMC and the OFT might provide a
solution.
Writing in the same issue of Consumer Policy Review, however, MMC chairman
Sir Sydney Lipworth says the OFT and MMC should not be merged.

FT  09 JUL 92 / OFT probes music royalties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has written to the Performing Right Society about
changes to the society's live-performance royalty system, which have angered
classical composers.
Before January, the society paid live royalties to composers using a formula
based on a full census of classical programmes. Now it makes its
calculations according to data from about 550 'significant' venues and 50
arts festivals, selected on the basis of capacity and the number of concerts
held each year.
The Composers' Guild of Great Britain claims that little-known composers
will lose when the first payments are made next July, because performances
at small concert venues will not be taken into account.
The society says the previous system was unfair, ineffective and
inefficient. Non-classical writers earned only from performances in large
venues and half of the classical performances went unreported in spite of
the huge administrative cost of chasing every programme - nearly a fifth of
the society's total revenue last year of Pounds 137m.
Ms Sarah Rogers, who chairs the composers' guild, said: 'The new live music
policy, far from creating a level playing field, has begun to reveal the
uneven workings of a monopoly.'
Ms Terri Anderson, the society's public-affairs controller, said composers
could not keep track on their own of where their music was performed and the
society could function only if its administrative costs were covered.
The dispute is likely to come to a head tonight at the society's annual
meeting.
The OFT confirmed that it had written to the society, asking to see the
directive on the collection of royalties and a copy of the society's
memorandum and articles of assistance.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Yorkshire TV faces fresh licence battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITE Rose Television, the defeated bidder for the Yorkshire television
franchise, has called formally on the Independent Television Commission to
revoke Yorkshire Television's licence.
White Rose claims that Yorkshire will be unable to fulfil its programme
promises because of its high bid and the fact that since the licence was
awarded competition has increased and the advertising recession has
continued.
White Rose, which bid Pounds 17.4m to Yorkshire's Pounds 37.7m, has made its
100-page submission to the ITC backed by counsel's opinion under section 18
of the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The section says a licence can be revoked
before it comes into effect if the ITC has reasonable grounds for believing
that the promised service will not be provided.
In a letter to Sir George Russell, ITC chairman, White Rose chairman Mr
Richard Hanwell says: 'We all recognise the quality of YTV's proposed
service - however, it is now certain that this service will never be
delivered because of that company's impossibly high bid.'
Yorkshire, in which Financial Times owner Pearson has a 20 per cent stake,
said: 'Yorkshire has been advised that there is no legal basis for White
Rose's submission and it is totally without merit.'
White Rose estimates that Yorkshire will have to pay 36.5 per cent of its
net advertising revenues to the government next year.
The Yorkshire case, based on cash rather than percentages, is that next year
the company is likely to have a gross cash margin of more than Pounds 90m
after payments to the government.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Ulster talks set for move to Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's unionists will this weekend march in celebration of
William of Orange's victory over the Roman Catholic King James II at the
Battle of the Boyne in July 1690. Less than 24 hours later, their leaders
will face Irish ministers over a negotiating table in Belfast.
The juxtaposition - unprecedented in Northern Ireland's troubled politics -
follows an agreement struck yesterday at a further session of talks
involving unionists, nationalists and the UK and Irish governments in London
yesterday.
Negotiations have been suspended until next Wednesday, partly so that the
Irish ministers can attend to other duties and partly not to clash with the
drums and sashes and bowler hats of Orangemen's marches next Monday and
Tuesday.
The province's politics have taken an important step forward this week with
all shades of unionist opinion represented in talks with the Irish
government for the first time in 70 years. But yesterday's meeting appeared
to have been dogged by disputes over leaks of the participants' position
papers.
It was 'much too early' to talk about solutions, Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster
Unionist party leader, said. 'What we did expect was a frank statement of
everybody's positions. It was never on the cards that there would be any
question of deals or compromises.'
Mr John Wilson, Irish deputy prime minister, said the discussions had been
'splendid'.
Wednesday's arrival of Irish ministers at Stormont, perhaps by helicopter or
in limousines up the mile-long drive to the Stormont parliament buildings -
seat of the former Northern Ireland government - will have particular
poignancy for the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party.
In 1965, he threw snowballs at Mr Sean Lemass, then Irish prime minister,
who was visiting Stormont.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Bank BCCI response attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, RALPH ATKINS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chairman of the Commons Treasury committee yesterday attacked the
Bank of England for failing to respond properly to MPs' criticisms of the
Bank's supervision of Bank of Credit and Commerce International before its
closure.
The Bank yesterday conceded - in its formal response to the committee report
 -that some reform of the system of policing banks was needed in the wake of
the BCCI affair, although it defended the behaviour of its officials.
Mr Terence Higgins, Tory chairman of the committee in the last parliament,
complained that the Bank's response did not 'cover any of the criticisms
made of the Bank'. He added that the Bank was still not taking 'as tough a
line for the future as the committee proposed'.
Nonetheless, yesterday's response from the Bank shows a change of heart on
whether an auditor should have a 'right' or a 'duty' to inform the Bank of
England when it fears that there is malpractice at a bank or that
depositors' funds may be at risk.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, told the committee last year
that the present legal position, which gives auditors a right to report to
the Bank, was adequate. But the Bank now feels auditors should be obliged to
make such reports. The question is controversial because of the duty of
confidentiality owed by an auditor to its client.
The Bank said any amendment to the Banking Act would need to be carefully
drafted, to avoid it being swamped with auditors' reports.
Professional auditors responded positively to the Bank's suggestions
yesterday, while saying they would need extra protection if they were to
take on an enhanced whistleblowing role.
Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, said: 'If it was
accompanied by a clarification of how auditors are protected by privilege
from breach of confidentiality, it is something people would be prepared to
consider.'
The Bank also said it wanted new powers to shut down a bank 'on the sole
ground that an applicant authorised bank cannot be effectively supervised'.
The Bank wants considerable latitude in the criteria for making such a
judgment.
It is asking for greater powers than those necessitated by its participation
earlier this week in an international agreement on co-operation between bank
regulators of the G10 leading industrial countries grouped in the Basle
Committee.
As implied by the Basle agreement, it wants to be able to close a bank if
that bank's domicile is in a country where the regulator lacks the expertise
or resources to take the lead role in supervising all the bank's operations.
The Bank also wants to be able to refuse authorisation to a bank if it sets
up branches in countries lacking an effective supervisor. That goes far
further than the Basle agreement.
The Bank also wants the right to withdraw authorisation if the nature of a
bank's business changes.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Health reforms target killer diseases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government announced plans yesterday to set and monitor targets to
reduce the toll of killer diseases and to improve overall health standards.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said the white-paper proposals
paper marked the 'next logical step in the process of health reform'.
The health plans will target five areas: coronary heart disease and strokes;
cancers; mental illness; sexual health; and accidents. A range of other
targets has been adopted by the government within the main headings - there
will be attempts to reduce the proportion of smokers in the population from
a third to a fifth by the year 2000, with similar efforts to reduce alcohol
consumption.
Mrs Bottomley said: 'No responsible government can be a disinterested
observer of an unhealthy nation.' She added that avoidable illness had an
enormous cost in terms of working days lost and expensive treatment.
Health standards in Britain are relatively poor in international terms. Some
of the targets in the white paper are likely to be achieved provided
existing trends continue but others - notably an attempt to halve
pregnancies among girls under 16 by 2000 - will be difficult.
The government was criticised by opposition parties and health promotion
specialists for not including the links between ill health and poverty in
the white paper's priorities, and for failing to announce support for a ban
on tobacco advertising.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, said the white paper had got the
right diagnosis but not the right prescription. He added: 'A white paper
that does not propose a single measure to combat poverty, homelessness or
unemployment is not a white paper that offers better health to all.' Mr
Bryan Davies, Labour MP for Oldham Central &amp; Royton, suggested the paper
should have been called The Health of Two Nations.
Mrs Bottomley shied away from making a direct connection between poverty and
ill health, saying there was a link between health and 'a great number of
social factors'. She offered breast cancer as an example of inverse
correlation between incidence and poverty.

FT  09 JUL 92 / DTI may relax fund disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUND managers would not be required to disclose stakes below 10 per cent in
companies held by clients under rules proposed by the Department of Trade
and Industry. The present ceiling is 3 per cent.
The DTI has been under pressure from the Institutional Fund Managers
Association, the industry trade association, to ease disclosure requirements
that managers say are expensive and unnecessary.
'In no way would you say that these stakes are predatory,' said Mr Richard
Weir, director-general of the IFMA.
The DTI first consulted on its draft directive in February 1991 and its
proposed rules have been prepared in the light of its consultation and other
developments since then.
The proposed rules are set out in a paper being circulated within the
industry. They will apply to fund managers charged with buying, selling and
voting shares held in segregated accounts in the names of individual
clients.
The proposals say stakes in companies in pooled funds managed by fund
managers need be disclosed only when they reach 10 per cent.
The directive is generally a relaxation of notification rules. However,
while at present fund managers whose sole job it is to sell shares on behalf
of clients need give notification only of stakes of 15 per cent or more,
under the proposals that ceiling would be lowered to 10 per cent under the
proposals.
The rules would also be tightened in respect of unlisted companies. For the
first time, stakes in such companies of 10 per cent or more would have to be
disclosed as well.
The fund management industry has argued for a relaxation of notification
requirements, saying the present rules are cumbersome and expensive to
administer. IFMA also argues that no European country has a requirement to
disclose stakes below 10 per cent and a 1988 directive set 10 per cent as
the minimum size of a notifiable position.
Nevertheless, in what is likely to be a disappointment to the pension funds
industry, the DTI does not propose lifting the ceiling on notifiable stakes
held by pension fund trustees from the current 3 per cent.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Ministers put prevention on par with cure: A look at the
proposals laid out in the white paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO DOCTOR has saved as many lives as a clean water supply. There are many
ways health standards can be improved by non-medical means, and yesterday's
Health of the Nation white paper seeks to give disease prevention the same
status as health care.
The government's wish to turn health promotion into a more central issue -
both politically and for individuals - will be widely supported. It is
consistent with a drive by the World Health Organisation to encourage all
governments to improve health standards by the turn of the century.
Ministers propose a strategy to increase life expectancy and to help ensure
that people enjoy their extra years free from illness and disability. The
strategy will aim to bring about measureable improvements in the five areas
identified by the government.
Questioning and criticism of the government's proposals will come over the
detail, and over the degree of commitment and resources ministers are
prepared to devote to making universally shared objectives a reality.
Research links the health of individuals not only with lifestyle but also
with social and economic status. The government's political opponents were
not alone in complaining yesterday that the white paper lacked proposals to
include an attack on poverty in the health campaign.
The influential King's Fund Institute health policy think tank said it was a
'striking omission' that the white paper 'ignores the rising toll of
premature mortality and sickness associated with poverty'.
There is concern among health promotion specialists that if the government
fails to address the links between poverty and health, its health promotion
strategy might have the paradoxical effect of widening health inequalities
within Britain.
Such concerns will be reinforced by a study of Liverpool published by the
British Thoracic Society today which, it says, shows a 'significant
relationship' between an increasing incidence of tuberculosis and poverty.
The white paper says the government aims to help people understand that
lifestyle can have profound effects on health, and enable them to make
informed choices. Targets will be set in the five key areas to clarify 'what
might otherwise be no more than general good intentions'. They will include:
Reducing death rates from coronary heart disease and stroke by at least 40
per cent by the year 2000.
Reducing the death rate from breast cancer by at least 25 per cent by 2000,
and the death rate from lung cancer by 30 per cent in men and 15 per cent in
women by 2010.
Reducing the overall suicide rate by at least 15 per cent and the rate among
severely mentally ill people by 33 per cent or more by 2000.
Halving the rate of conception among the under-16s by 2000.
Reducing the incidence of gonorrhoea by at least 20 per cent by 1995 - the
rate is seen as an indicator of HIV/Aids trends.
Reducing accidental deaths among children by 33 per cent, and among those
aged 15 to 25 by 25 per cent by 2005.
Encouraging changes in lifestyle will play a big part in trying to achieve
most of those objectives. At the centre of the strategy to reduce lung
cancer deaths, for example, is a linked set of targets to cut cigarette
smoking - at least 80 per cent of deaths from lung cancer are associated
with smoking.
Yet although the government will support efforts to discourage smoking, it
says at this stage only that it will 'review the effects of tobacco
advertising, particularly on children, and consider what further steps are
necessary'. There have been many calls from health campaigners for the
government to support a total ban on tobacco advertising except at points of
sale.
Although the National Health Service will have a central role in the
government's strategy, its success will depend on the enthusiasm with which
other government departments and organisations embrace the principles.
A ministerial cabinet committee covering 11 government departments will be
established to oversee the implementation and monitoring of the strategy.
Local authorities, voluntary organisations, the media and employers will all
be expected to play a part. The health department will publish details of
information needed to monitor progress, and a survey will examine the
lifestyles of 15,000 adults.

Zandra Rhodes UK,the company that manufactured her fashion creations, and

The parent company emphasised that the core of the business remained sound

Manufacturing work, however, will now be subcontracted to selected
outworkers.
Six factory workers have lost their jobs. Another eight to 10 will be
re-employed elsewhere in the company.

<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's largest public company, has reached an agreement with
the US Department of Commerce in an attempt to avert the threat of
anti-dumping duties on exports of magnesium from Canada to the US.
The duties - a 21.61 per cent countervailing duty and 31.33 per cent
anti-dumping duty - would be imposed by the International Trade Commission
(ITC) if it found that Norsk Hydro's Canadian magnesium production had been
subsidised and that the company had sold production from Canada in the US at
dumping prices.
However, Mr Per Erik Bjoerklund, of Norsk Hydro, said yesterday the Commerce
Department had now acceptedNorsk's offer to renegotiate power supply
contracts with Hydro Quebec and to repay an estimated CDollars 20m of
provincial investment funds which it received from the governments of Canada
and Quebec to establish the plant.
'The fact that we have renegotiated our power contracts and are willing to
repay investment funds does not mean we admit to the department's
allegations but that we are willing to solve the issue in order to have the
charges dropped,' Mr Bjoerklund said.
The agreement between Norsk Hydro and the department has not yet been
signed, however, which means that US customs will require a deposit from
Norsk Hydro equal to the proposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties if
it exports Canadian magnesium to the US until the ITC ruling on August 19.
Since the charges were made last autumn, Norsk Hydro has reduced production
to half the Canadian plant's 45,000-tonne-a-year capacity.
The Commerce Department cleared Norsk of allegations of dumping magnesium
from Norway in the US.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Representatives yesterday passed a Democratic-backed trade bill
which would resurrect for five years 'Super 301' - a provision aimed mainly
at Japan - and make a controversial change in US anti-dumping law.
Super 301 requires the Administration to negotiate away foreign trade
barriers or retaliate against closed markets with US sanctions. The bill
also caps Japanese car imports at 1.65m vehicles and imposes a 70 per cent
domestic content requirement on cars produced by Japanese subsidiaries in
the US.
The anti-dumping provision would close a loophole in the 1988 trade law
which allows foreign companies to avoid anti-dumping duties by setting up
'phantom' factories in the US. These assembly operations import all their
parts from third countries which are not covered by the anti-dumping order.
The bill would give the US Commerce Department added authority to judge
whether a company is evading anti-dumping duties by considering 'actual and
potential' threats to US industries.
Congressman Don Sunquist, a Tennessee Republican, yesterday said the
provision 'attacks nearly every US-based manufacturing plant owned by a
foreign company.' It would target a plant in his district, owned by Brother
Industries of Japan, which has been engaged in a long-running feud with
Smith Corona.
Mr Lee Thompson, Smith Corona's chairman, charges Brother with establishing
the low-wage, low-skill assembly plant expressly to circumvent the 60 per
cent duty. Its parts are imported from Singapore and Malaysia.
Brother admits it swallows losses to keep market share (a tacit admission of
dumping, argues Smith Corona).

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR is taking the first steps to set up distribution and sales networks
for its luxury cars in eastern Europe.
It expects initial sales to be small, but is anxious to establish a foothold
in the region in the expectation of significant future growth. The company
also indicated that it was wary of growing Japanese manufacturers' interest
in the area.
In twin moves announced yesterday, Jaguar has appointed a distributor in
Poland and is setting up its first service dealership in east Germany. It is
also assessing how best to establish a presence in two other key east
European countries, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Jaguars are to be imported and sold in Poland by Jaguar Poland, a subsidiary
set up by Overseas Marketing Corporation, a London-based independent
Anglo-Polish trading company which already has extensive experience of
vehicle retailing in eastern Europe, including that of cars produced by
Ford, Jaguar's parent.
Initially, it is to have premises in Warsaw, which are expected to become
operational within the next three months. First year sales are expected to
be only 20 to 25 cars.
However, 'it is important that we quickly establish a presence in these
markets', Mr Roger Puttnam, sales and marketing director, said. 'They will
undoubtedly grow in the future and as their economies expand so will the
demand for luxury cars.'
Jaguar's service dealership is located at Freital, near Dresden, and is the
first of five sales and service outlets planned to be operational within the
next 12 to 18 months.
Unlike the Polish operation, they are to be set up and controlled by a
wholly-owned Jaguar subsidiary, Jaguar Deutschland.

the year 2000' was appointed the country's prime minister yesterday after
the resignation of Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, who had held the post for only 13
months.
The change came 10 days after the assassination of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, the
head of state. Mr Ghozali said he was resigning primarily to allow Mr Ali
Kafi, who replaced Mr Boudiaf, to appoint his own 'strong government capable
of eliminating the forces of evil which have not ceased seeking the
destabilisation of the state to achieve power'.
Mr Ghozali's tenure encompassed the cancellation of multi-party elections
which the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front was set to win. The High
State Council, the five-man presidency, said yesterday his government had
carried out its task efficiently 'in the harshest moments of Algeria's
life'.
However, he had become increasingly unpopular, and the lack of security
around Mr Boudiaf when he was killed drew particularly fierce criticism from
Algerians.
Mr Abdessalam's austere nationalism will appeal to many Algerians. As
economic overlord from 1964 to 1978, Mr Abdessalam, aged 64, is also
remembered for appointing people for their competence rather than their
family and regional ties.
He has spent 13 years in the wilderness but foreign observers - and in
particular Algeria's creditors - will be asking whether he has changed his
interventionist economic spots sufficiently to help steer the troubled
country through painful economic reform.
Mr Abdessalam was on the provisional executive of the National Liberation
Front (FLN) at the time of independence in 1962. Together with then
President Houari Boumediene he shaped Algeria's oil policy, nationalising
foreign oil interests in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Such moves earned
him the lasting antagonism of the French. He built up Sonatrach, the oil and
gas monopoly, into a respected company where Algerian nationals were
responsible for most decisions.
His policy of large-scale industrialisation was much less successful and
many of the difficulties Algeria has faced in the past decade came from the
over-ambitious industrial investment made in those years.
Mr Abdessalam was also a member of a regime which presided over a decrease
in freedom as the 1970s went by. Few people dared speak out for fear of the
security forces. Diplomats said yesterday that one of the challenges ahead
was a decision on whether the trial of FIS leaders Mr Abassi Madani and Mr
Ali Belhadj, on charges punishable by death, would go ahead next Sunday.

FT  09 JUL 92 / West faced with political minefield over Kurds

<TEXT>
THIS week's call by Mr Bernard Kouchner, France's minister of humanitarian
affairs, for the United Nations to lift trade sanctions on the
Kurdish-controlled areas of north Iraq raises questions about the western
commitment to the Kurds.
Baghdad has refused to renew the UN aid memorandum forced on President
Saddam Hussein last year to allow UN agencies to operate in the country. The
Iraqis have also yet to agree to implement UN Resolution 706, under which
Iraqi oil receipts were to finance medical and other aid purchases under UN
supervision - all of which puts the future of western relief effort for the
Kurds in doubt.
The situation poses practical as well as legal and financial challenges for
the aid organisations and allied governments wishing to support the Kurds.
The impasse is of particular concern for Turkey, key regional player in the
Kurdish relief operation.
The Turkish parliament last month gave approval for allied aircraft based in
southern Turkey to continue to provide air cover for the Kurds for a further
six months. But Ankara is worried about the evolution of a de facto Kurdish
state in north Iraq. The foreign ministry argues that the recent Kurdish
elections represent a dangerous step in that direction, despite Kurdish
assurances.
Turkey is none the less aware that without the help of western aid agencies
and with President Saddam continuing to put the area under military and
economic pressure, Turkey could face a repeat of last year's refugee exodus.
The World Food Programme still conducts food distribution, much of which is
being ferried from Turkey. The UK's Save the Children Fund is continuing a
reconstruction project in an area close enough to the Iranian border to
allow for a quick withdrawal if security deteriorates, but many agencies are
already considering pulling out, reluctant to continue a cross-border
operation from Turkey if Baghdad does not give at least tacit support.
A nine-month economic blockade of the region already hampers essential
services and supplies, particularly of fuel oil, which aid agencies now
bring in from Turkey.
Mr Kouchner proposes that the UN should conduct its own cross-border
operation. However, diplomats say this would create a legal and political
minefield.
Such a move would amount to implicit recognition of the separate status of
the Kurdish region, something France and the other Security Council members
were keen to avoid when drafting the original UN resolutions to protect the
Kurds.

THE Indian government is planning to establish a 'Special Bureau of Frauds,'
apparently modelled on Britain's Serious Fraud Office, to deal with scandals
in banks and other financial institutions.
This was announced yesterday, on the first day of parliament's monsoon
session, by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, who sought to calm
agitated members of the opposition with assurance that the government would
spare no efforts to investigate the Rs35bn (Pounds 636m) Bombay financial
scandal, and punish the guilty.
Facing a no-confidence motion, to be debated on July 15 and 16, the
government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao is also considering establishing a joint
parliamentary committee to look into India's worst securities scandal.
While stressing that the frauds were 'in no way due to financial
liberalisation', Mr Singh said that on the contrary, 'over-regulation of
bank interest rates and an excessive pre-emption of bank resources into
low-interest assets had contributed to some extent to bank managements
looking to non-traditional banking activity to bolster profits.'
Mr Singh admitted for the first time since the scandal surfaced that 'in
retrospect, the Reserve Bank of India's supervisory functions were not as
effective as they should have been'. The opposition has been pressing for
dismissal of central bank governor S. Venkitaramanan.
The finance minister acknowledged that 'a serious failure of internal
control systems' in the banks involved had allowed transactions 'in flagrant
and deliberate violation' of established rules and guidelines. To remedy
this, Mr Singh said that his government was considering setting up 'a
high-powered supervisory board, with four to five full-time members, with
the governor, Reserve Bank of India, as the chairman'.
The board's advisory council with eminent persons from banking, auditing,
law, economics and management, would co-ordinate the work of supervision of
banks and financial agencies, and would include surprise inspections.
Mr Singh's announcements seemed to underline the government's confidence
that no cabinet minister is involved in the scandal. Opposition leaders have
been brandishing a list of names of six ministers they allege are involved
in the scandal but have so far not substantiated their claims.
Meanwhile Standard Chartered Bank yesterday fired five senior officials for
their alleged involvement in the Bombay scandal following an internal
investigation.
Mr David Gardiner, acting chief executive of Standard Chartered India,
regretted it had been found necessary to remove the officials, but said the
bank was determined that those they felt accountable should pay the price.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Big Apple aims to shrug off troubles: Democrats will meet in
a city trying to recover from crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK, which prides itself on its ability to throw sensational parties,
is gearing up for four days of self-celebration as it hosts the Democratic
Party national convention next week.
But its civic leaders are also holding their collective breath and praying
that the hoopla will not be marred by the kind of violence which shook upper
Manhattan on Monday and Tuesday. Demonstrators rampaged through the mainly
Hispanic Washington Heights neighbourhood - which is known for drug dealing
 -looting shops and burning buildings, in protest at the killing by police
of a young man from the Dominican Republic.
With some 40,000 convention visitors about to descend on the city, including
15,000 representatives of the domestic and international news media,
violence like this is the last thing New York needs.
For as the Democrats prepare to anoint Mr Bill Clinton as their presidential
candidate, the city is hoping to use the convention to trumpet a message of
its own: New York, which has spent two years grappling with financial
crisis, is on the point of an economic and psychological rebound.
That is in stark contrast to just 12 months ago when the gloomiest pundits
portrayed New York as a megalopolis in inexorable decline, beset by
intractable budget problems, homelessness, violent crime and America's
biggest caseload of Aids.
Mr David Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, was then facing a severe
budget crisis, brought on by economic recession, and was widely accused of
failing to tackle the problem with sufficient speed, vigour or leadership.
With the convention in mind, the Republican Party has been trying to
capitalise on this image, seeking to link the problems of the solidly
Democratic city with the national Democratic party's liberal agenda.
Vice-president Dan Quayle has taken to visiting New York and taunting its
leaders with remarks like: 'Liberal economics may prevail here, but it sure
doesn't work here.'
However, over the past few months there has been a sharp change for the
better in both the mood of the city and in Mr Dinkins's public standing.
Even the crime statistics have shown a slight improvement. Broadway theatres
have been enjoying the biggest collection of hits in years.
The recession which has ravaged the regional economy for the past two years
is not over. Unemployment, at more than 11 per cent, is still way above the
national average. The city is glutted with unused office space. But many
analysts believe the economy has at least touched bottom and may now be
recovering, albeit painfully slowly.
One concrete sign is that the city's budget crisis seems to be over. The
Dinkins administration finished the fiscal year which has just ended with a
budget surplus of more than Dollars 500m, thanks to its conservative
forecasts of likely revenue and a reining back of spending.
This enabled the mayor to withdraw plans for Dollars 115m in new taxes and
reach a remarkably early agreement with the city council on the budget for
the current year.
Mr Dinkins still faces fiscal criticism: the Citizens' Budget Commission, an
independent watchdog, this week accused him of having missed the opportunity
for more fundamental reforms in the way the city is run, which would create
a much smaller, more efficient, municipal workforce and a better structural
balance in the budget.
The mayor has also been widely praised for the fact that New York was spared
the violence which convulsed many other cities in the wake of April's Los
Angeles riots. The mayor helped keep the political temperature down by
working the phones to neighbourhood leaders, urging calm and dispelling
rumours of impending trouble. He has played the same role this week in
Washington Heights, making two trips to the neighbourhood to appeal for
calm. The rampage there this week was ugly but it was mild in comparison to
the convulsions in Los Angeles.
All this has sharply improved Mr Dinkins's once dismal opinion poll ratings
and his chances of winning re-election in 1993, when he is likely to face at
least two strong challengers - the Republican Mr Rudolph Giuliani, who
narrowly lost in 1989, and Mr Andrew Stein, the Democratic president of the
city council.
It also means a reasonably upbeat tone for the Democratic convention, which
will itself have a significant economic impact on the city.
In the short run, it will mean more spending in New York - the gathering
could generate nearly Dollars 500m in new economic activity. However, Mr
Ronald Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, a group of
business and civic leaders encouraging economic development, reckons 'the
more important impact will be psychological, both internally and
externally.'
The convention may boost New York's reputation as a place to do business,
which was battered in the 1980s by its high labour and property costs. But
city advocates point out that these costs have been ameliorated by recession
and insist that New York remains the best US centre for international
businesses, given its good communications links and cultural sophistication.

THE US aircraft maker McDonnell Douglas yesterday intensified its efforts to
get US government support to sell 72 of its F-15 jet fighters to Saudi
Arabia, claiming that indecision in Washington could prompt the Saudis to
join the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme as an equity partner.
McDonnell Douglas, which is financially stretched and faces a sharp decline
in US defence contract work, is anxious to keep its F-15 production line
open past 1994, when it will finish its last jet for the US Defence
Department. But the Bush administration has been putting off a decision on
the Saudi sale, which would raise controversy in Congress.
In a paper published yesterday, McDonnell Douglas said that the recent
German withdrawal from the EFA, along with US government indecision, 'sets
the stage for Saudi Arabia to join Britain, Italy and Spain as an equity
partner in a restructured European warplane project'.
The paper cited various newspaper articles to support this contention. Even
so, there seems to have been no official suggestion of Saudi equity
involvement, although British Aerospace has indicated that Saudi Arabia
might buy EFAs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN politicians are nervously awaiting Quebec's response to a package
of far-reaching constitutional proposals designed to prevent the francophone
province breaking away from the federation.
The proposals were hammered out late on Tuesday by the leaders of the nine
English-speaking provinces after almost two years of negotiation and public
consultation. The federal government had threatened to force its own package
through parliament in time for the national unity referendum which Quebec is
due to hold by the end of October.
Quebec's attitude is unclear because its premier, Mr Robert Bourassa, has
boycotted the talks in protest against the collapse in June 1990 of the
Meech Lake constitutional accord.
He and his cabinet met yesterday to consider their response. They may not
wholeheartedly endorse the latest proposals but are unlikely to reject them
outright.
Mr Bourassa has said that his preference is to stay in Canada. Also,
separatist fervour in Quebec has abated since it was fuelled by the failure
of Meech Lake.
There remains a risk that the latest agreement could unravel. A final text
has yet to be made available for public scrutiny, and the package requires
formal ratification by provincial legislatures. Mr Joe Clark, constitutional
affairs minister, said that some parts 'are going to be improved' in the
weeks ahead.
The new package contains many of the provisions of the Meech Lake deal, such
as a veto for Quebec over key changes to the constitution and a number of
guaranteed seats for the francophone province on the Supreme Court.
But it also addresses the concerns of other provinces, aboriginal peoples
and various interest groups. A key provision sought by the western and
Atlantic provinces is the replacement of the appointed Senate, the upper
house of parliament, by an elected body in which all 10 provinces will have
equal representation. The Senate would have a limited veto over bills passed
by the House of Commons.

'Bill Clinton won the nomination and I did not. Were I the victor, I would

FT  09 JUL 92 / Brazilian bank debt pact near
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRAZILIAN government was said yesterday to be on the verge of an
agreement in principle, with leading creditor banks, on restructuring and
reducing its foreign bank debt burden.
Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, the US bank that leads the
negotiations on behalf of the banks, said: 'We are only hours away from
reaching an agreement, although we are not there yet.'
The accord, the most complex under the debt reduction initiative launched
three years ago by Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, would cover
about Dollars 40bn in debt and substantial arrears of interest. The two
sides have been negotiating for nearly a year.
An agreement in principle is the first step towards a deal. A detailed
accord or term sheet must then be negotiated with leading banks. Then
agreement is required of all creditors.
Mr Rhodes said an agreement 'will signal the final phase of Latin America's
debt crisis.' Other regional big debtors have either completed a Brady deal
(Mexico and Venezuela) or have negotiated a detailed accord with leading
banks (Argentina).
However, the political crisis around President Fernando Collor of Brazil,
with continuing economic problems which may derail an International Monetary
Fund programme, mean that doubts remain about whether the agreement will be
realised. The Brazilian government aims to seek backing from the senate in
Braslia for a detailed accord by the end of next month.
The deal would allow banks to convert their existing debt into one of six
types of instrument, each of which eases in some way Brazil's scheduled
debt-service burden. Some of these instruments will carry collateral to
guarantee interest or principal payments in the case of Brazilian default.
The options include allowing banks to choose to exchange their existing debt
for 'discount' bonds carrying a 35 per cent discount to face value, for
'par' bonds which carry pre-set concessional interest rates, and
'front-loaded' interest reduction bonds (FLIRBs), which reduce Brazil's
interest payments in the early years of the accord. All carry collateral.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOP MANAGERS in the Italian public sector are likely to be among the first
victims of the new Amato government's impending purge on spending.
The issue of their salaries has been forced on to the agenda by the
embarrassing discovery that one of the last acts of Mr Giulio Andreotti's
outgoing government was to award 25 per cent pay increases to the heads of
state companies and financial institutions.
This had gone unnoticed until this week when the decree, dating back to June
15, was published. It provoked a chorus of political protest.
Officials of the new government said it would be hard to justify high salary
raises when public sector pay could be frozen and Rome wished to convey an
image of austerity.
A new decree is now expected either to limit the rise or cancel it
altogether as a side bar to the emergency austerity budget due to be
announced at the end of the week. The biggest increases have gone to Mr
Franco Nobili of Iri, the main state holding company, to Mr Gabriele
Cagliari of Eni, the state oil concern, and to Mr Gaetano Mancini of Efim,
the state industrial holding company.
Their annual pay, backdated to January, 1991, has increased by L62.6m
(Pounds 28,530) to a gross of L312m each. For heads of lesser entities such
as the state cinema concern, the rise was worth an annual L37.5m to a gross
of L106.2m
By European standards these gross salaries are not excessively high and had
remained unchanged since 1987.
The nature of the remuneration packages for senior executives in the public
sector has never been transparent. Indeed, the management has been
invariably selected on the basis of political friendship and party
affiliation.

FT  09 JUL 92 / A president sidling towards staying on: A look at Menem's
chances of asecond term in Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the strangest things about Mr Carlos Menem's presidency of Argentina
is that, against all expectations, he has usually taken the right decisions.
But Argentina is wondering whether he is now on a wrong path by trying to
keep himself in office.
Today, he reaches the midpoint of his six-year term, apparently committed to
change the country's constitution, which does not let a president succeed
himself.
The current president is not the first to attempt this. All but one of
Argentina's post-war civilian presidents tried to amend the constitution and
succeed themselves. All failed, except the late Juan Peron, who was toppled
in 1955 before the end of his second term.
Mr Menem and his courtiers, though, are convinced they can succeed. They
must act quickly for, during the next three years, the government would have
to convince two-thirds of Congress to call a constituent assembly, would
have to fight an election campaign for that assembly, rewrite the
constitution and then fight a presidential campaign.
The president has chosen an ambiguous strategy. He feigns disinterest by
promising to return in 1995 to his home town of Anillaco to practise law.
Meanwhile, his cronies campaign for his re-election.
The effort may be futile, however. There is little chance of convincing
enough opposition Radicals and disaffected Peronists in Congress to form the
two-thirds majority to convene a constituent assembly.
There are also signs that public opinion is turning against the government.
The stock market, which quintupled in value last year, has fallen from its
peaks.
The business establishment - until now Mr Menem's most trustworthy ally - is
making warning noises. Mr Roberto Alemann, a former economy minister and an
establishment stalwart, warns that Mr Menem's need to buy political support
would destroy economic stability. He likens the re-election movement to
'burning a city to light a cigar.'
Mr Menem is vulnerable to shifts in the nation's mood. He has never won
unequivocal backing from any group, not even from the Peronists. His
greatest political assets are a feel for public opinion and free-market
policies that have reduced inflation to single figures and set off a
consumer boom. But, if his personal authority is damaged, financial markets
and the wider economy might lose confidence. Business confidence is vital
after 60 years of upheaval.
Mr Menem may yet take another course, by unambiguously rejecting a second
consecutive mandate, and using the second half of his term to concentrate on
deepening his reforms. This is what Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister and
a possible presidential candidate, wants. He says: 'If we carry out good
government, I have no doubt that the people will want President Menem to
continue.'
Much remains to be done. The president needs to continue deregulating the
economy, press ahead with privatisations and attract investment. To do that,
he must foreswear reforming the constitution, stamp out cronyism and
corruption, and reinforce discredited national institutions.
He must also deal with growing demands for social justice. Voters already
take low inflation for granted and now want jobs, higher wages and better
social services. But living standards are falling sharply, wealth is
becoming more concentrated, and the economy is slowing. Data suggest
investment is far from the levels needed to achieve the 6 per cent annual
growth Mr Cavallo has promised.
The next three years are already full of challenges and dangers even without
a bruising bid to remain in office. If Mr Menem contented himself with a
single term and followed Mr Cavallo's advice, he would go down in history as
the man who broke Argentina's 60-year tradition of economic upheaval and
political unrest.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Aimless dollar gets down to some serious weakness:
'Triple-dip' fear and low interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER months of uncertainty about the US dollar, foreign exchange dealers
have decided what course of action to take. Sell.
Since April the US currency has been drifting aimlessly in the market,
undermined by sluggish growth in the US economy and a huge interest rate
differential in favour of the powerful D-Mark.
But in recent days, dealers have become aggressive bears. The dollar is
being heavily sold, while the D-Mark, its most important competitor in the
market, goes from strength to strength.
After peaking at DM1.6750 in the spring, the dollar gradually slumped to
around DM1.5200 last Thursday night. Since then it has been hit by a wave of
selling, touchingDM1.4760 in European trading yesterday.
Most analysts expect it to return to its all-time low of DM1.4430 in
February 1991. Others are even more pessimistic: 'The market is already
gearing up for DM1.44,' says Mr Christian Dunis, chief economist at Chemical
Bank in London. 'The question now is whether the dollar will go into
something like a free fall.'
Many analysts admit that they have been startled by the dollar's weakness.
But in recent days, several factors triggered a decline in confidence:
Many traders gave up waiting for the upturn in the US economy. Dismal June
employment figures released last Thursday were the last straw. A rise in the
payroll figure of around 80,000 was expected, but, said one analyst, 'the
drop of 170,000 forced us to hold up our hands in horror'.
The US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to 3 per cent, the lowest level
for 29 years, in a further attempt to boost the economy. That established a
yawning 6.75 per cent gap between US and German short-term interest rates.
'It's so costly now to remain a dollar investor that if you don't have good
reasons to hold the currency, you have to get out of it,' says Mr Dunis.
The political difficulties of President George Bush are increasingly cited
by dealers as a reason to ditch the currency. Many dollar investors were
disappointed at the outcome of the Munich summit of the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations. Far from instigating an attempt to prop up the
dollar, the G7 had nothing to say about currencies in its final communique.
Analysts now feel that the US authorities are undertaking a policy of
'benign neglect' towards the dollar, allowing it to weaken in the hope that
it will boostUS exports.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, says
exchange rate policy is now the only way the US authorities can speed the
upturn. 'The other two weapons of economic policy have been spent.' There is
little that can be done with fiscal policy now that the US has a budget
deficit close to Dollars 400bn. With interest rates so low, the Fed has run
out of monetary ammunition as well.
A weaker dollar is probably also welcome to the German and Japanese
governments. Fears of high imported inflation in Germany as the eastern
states are industrially renovated will mean that a strong D-Mark is welcome.
The Bank of Japan, facing an economic downturn, may also need to reduce
interest rates later this year, a policy that will be eased by a stronger
yen.
Whether the dollar will rebound depends on whether there is an economic
upturn in the last half of this year. Some economists are optimistic,
recalling that the US economy has been advancing for four quarters, albeit
slowly. But Mr MacKinnon remains pessimistic: 'The fact is that consumer
demand is weak, real earnings are declining and employment prospects are
deteriorating.'
The US authorities could be forced to intervene to prop up the dollar if its
weakness starts to affect domestic financial markets. Until now, Wall Street
has barely reacted to the currency's weakness. But a lack of confidence in
the currency has affected the stock market before.
The dollar is most likely to gain, however, from new fears about the German
economy which will put the D-Mark under question. Some analysts expect a
slowdown in the German economy in the final quarter of this year, which may
have the effect of leading the Bundesbank to ease German interest rates.
All these economic data are weapons in a battle between two groups of
investors. On one side, they are saying that the dollar is cheap and a
bargain buy. On the other, they believe the US economy is into a
'triple-dip' recession and that the best thing to do is sell. Whichever is
stronger will decide the currency's fate.

PRESIDENT Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia yesterday took advantage of a lull in
the fighting in Sarajevo and flew to the CSCE meeting in Helsinki, where he
will appeal for international help to end the civil war.
Bosnia's mostly Moslem government has appealed for foreign military
intervention in Bosnia.
Mr Fikret Abdic, a member of the Bosnian presidency, yesterday told
journalists: 'If he (President Bush) is really ready to defend his new world
order, here is his chance. It will either rise or fall with Sarajevo.'
Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, left aboard a departing relief flight. Eighteen
international relief flights yesterday arrived in the Bosnian capital, the
largest number since the air-lift began last week.
Some 811 tonnes of food aid and medical supplies had arrived in Sarajevo as
of Tuesday, most of which had already been distributed to local charities.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, yesterday was in
Sarajevo to meet Bosnian leaders and UN officials.
Meanwhile, in Serbia the introduction of new dinar bank notes has wreaked
havoc in the economy and government officials this week set up a commission
to investigate who is responsible for the monetary chaos.
Serbians have been franctically scrambling to get new bank notes since the
weekend, with people packing into banks.
Few shopkeepers in the Serbian capital have bank notes below 5,000 dinars
(Pounds 8). Mrs Dragana Markovic, a 65-year-old pensioner, yesterday bought
one litre of milk and a loaf of bread. She received her change in chewing
gum and sweet cream.
Townspeople in Leskovac, southern Serbia, yesterday gave their identity
cards instead of dinar notes to buy bread. One man went to a market to buy
tomatoes and received his change in pears.
Toll-booth operators on the Serbian motorway, once a major international
thoroughfare, now wave every other car through because they have no change.
Belgrade economists say the shortage of dinar notes may be a heavy-handed
attempt by the federal government to squeeze the monetary supply.

<TEXT>
A BITTER struggle erupted yesterday within the Russian government, as the
ministries of defence and security turned on Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign
minister - accusing him of doing the job of US intelligence in seeking
security and defence reform.
Their spokesmen rejected claims by Mr Kozyrev last week that a 'party of
war' was operating in military circles and that security and defence
officials were nurturing a coup. They said that local disturbances based on
economic grievances were possible, however.
They said Mr Kozyrev's call for 'radical reform' of the KGB and defence
departments would destroy the professional competence of these agencies  -
the aim of the US Central Intelligence Agency.
Last week Mr Kozyrev also accused the Russian military of supplying the bulk
of the arms being used in the conflict in Moldova and its breakaway region
of Trans Dnestr, and asked - 'Why are the military deciding major political
questions? When tanks turn into an independent political force, this spells
catastrophe.'
A ceasefire called in the Trans Dnestr region for Tuesday night was reported
to have been violated several times yesterday, and the government of
Belarus, one of the states which was to have sent a peace-keeping
contingent, said it will not do so.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa has agreed to nominate Ms Hanna Suchocka, a
46-year-old lawyer from Poznan as Poland's next prime minister in a move
towards the solution of Poland's month-long government crisis.
Ms Suchocka is expected to head a coalition government containing seven
parties with Solidarity movement origins.
The president yesterday told Ms Suchocka, who is from the pro-market
Democratic Union (UD) party, that he was 'respecting democracy' by approving
her nomination. Ms Suchocka's candidacy could be voted on as early as
tomorrow.
The new coalition has bowed to President Walesa's wishes by keeping in place
his nominees for the defence, interior and foreign affairs ministries and
kept out the right-wing Centre Alliance.
The remainder of the projected new government marries the Democratic Union,
the largest of 29 parties elected at last October's general elections, and
the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) with the fundamentalist Catholic and
right-wing nationalist ZChN party as well as the Solidarity farmers' groups.
These seven parties control some 190 votes in the 460 seat parliament and
the coalition can also count on support from the Solidarity group which
should be enough for a working majority.

FT  09 JUL 92 / CSCE states to set up peace-keeping forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT leaders at the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe (CSCE) will tomorrow agree to set up armed peace-keeping forces
aimed at preventing the spread of conflicts in member states.
The forces, drawn from CSCE countries, including the republics of the former
Soviet Union, will involve civilian and military personnel acting as
observers, monitors, or elements of larger military operations.
The proposals, agreed early yesterday after four months' negotiations, are
seen as an attempt to beef up the organisation's military and security role.
Despite reservations by some diplomats that CSCE peace-keeping efforts would
duplicate the role already played by the UN, British and US diplomats said
the CSCE would complement UN operations.
'The CSCE will work more closely with the UN, the WEU (the nine-member
Western European Union), the European Community and Nato, and must play a
greater role in conflict prevention and crisis management,' a US diplomat
said.
But the detailed, 90-page document stipulates that CSCE peace-keeping
operations would not entail 'enforcement action,' nor would any military
mission be sent until a durable ceasefire had been established. In addition,
the document rules out the establishment of a permanent CSCE army. 'Each
conflict will be judged case by case,' said Mr Istvan Gyarmati, head of the
Hungarian delegation.
Another western diplomat added that it would require 'considerable political
will and consensus to set up a force and deploy it in a member state.'
Diplomats said the need for the CSCE to have its own peace-keeping mechanism
stems partly from the sharp escalation in ethnic conflicts, particularly in
the former Yugoslavia and the Commmonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and
the need for it to define its role in the post-communist era.
In response to the increasing violation of ethnic rights in the former
communist states, the final document calls for the establishment of a CSCE
High Commissioner on National Minorities - despite strong opposition from
Britain, France, Turkey and the US.
The primary role of the commissioner is to act as an 'early warning system,'
through monitoring potential ethnic conflicts.
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday pledged that Russia would pull its
remaining 130,000 troops out of the Baltic states by mid-1993, a French
official at the Group of Seven summit in Munich said, Our Foreign Staff
reports.
The announcement came after the CSCE and the G7 called on Russia to withdraw
its troops from the three Baltic states.
The CSCE's Baltic statement, agreed by all 52 members, follows weeks of
intensive negotiations with Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania.
Diplomats said the statement referred only to the Baltic states, because
other CSCE countries would not accept a general statement relating to the
issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from CSCE countries.

<TEXT>
THE Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will dispatch
'exploratory' missions to Serbian-controlled Kosovo, Vojvodina, and Sandjak
in a move aimed at deciding what future role the CSCE will play in the
region.
The announcment, made yesterday by a CSCE committee, coincided with a
decision to suspend the rump Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and
Montenegro, until October 14. Several countries wanted Yugoslavia expelled,
but Russia vetoed any such move. Diplomats said the compromise would serve
as a carrot and stick for Serbia.
For instance, western diplomats said if the dismal human and ethnic rights
record in Kosovo, Vojvodina, and Sandjak - which have sizeable Albanian,
Hungarian and Moslem minorities respectively - did not improve by October
14, there was little chance that Yugoslavia would be admitted.
Diplomats said Serbia and Montenegro would not automatically become the
legitimate successor to the former Yugoslavia. 'Like any new state, it will
have to apply for CSCE membership,' an east European diplomat said.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Strong growth vital to meet post-Cold War
challenges
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WORKING together for growth and a safer world
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
final Munich summit statement. Extract on world economy and trade.
'Strong world economic growth is the prerequisite for solving a variety of
challenges we face in the post-Cold War world. Increasingly, there are signs
of global economic recovery. But we will not take it for granted and will
act together to ensure the recovery gathers strength and growth picks up.
Too many people are out of work. The potential strength of people, factories
and resources is not being fully employed. We are particularly concerned
about the hardship unemployment creates.
Each of us faces somewhat different economic situations. But we all would
gain greatly from stronger, sustainable non-inflationary growth.
Higher growth will help other countries too. Growth generates trade. More
trade will give a boost to developing nations and to the new democracies
seeking to transform command economies into productive participants within
the global marketplace. Their economic success is in our common interest.
A successful Uruguay Round will be a significant contribution to the future
of the world economy. An early conclusion of the negotiations will reinforce
our economies, promote the process of reform in eastern Europe and give new
opportunities for the well-being of other nations, including in particular
the developing countries.
We regret the slow pace of the negotiations since we met in London last
year. But there has been progress in recent months. Therefore we are
convinced that a balanced agreement is within reach.
We welcome the reform of the European Community's common agricultural
policy, which has just been adopted and which should facilitate the
settlement of outstanding issues.
Progress has been made on the issue of internal support in a way which is
consistent with the reform of the common agricultural policy, on dealing
with the volume of subsidised exports and on avoiding future disputes. These
topics require further work. In addition, parties still have concerns in the
area of market access and trade in cereal substitutes that they seek to
address.
We reaffirm that the negotiations should lead to a globally balanced result.
An accord must create more open markets for goods and services and will
require comparable efforts from all negotiating partners.
On this basis we expect that an agreement can be reached before the end of
1992.
We are committed, through co-ordinated and individual actions, to build
confidence for investors, savers, and consumers: confidence that hard work
will lead to a better quality of life; confidence that investments will be
profitable; confidence that savings will be rewarded and that price
stability will not be put at risk.
We pledge to adopt policies aimed at creating jobs and growth. We will seek
to take the appropriate steps, recognising our individual circumstances, to
establish sound macroeconomic policies to spur stronger sustainable growth.
With this in mind we have agreed on the following guidelines:
to continue to pursue sound monetary and financial policies to support the
upturn without rekindling inflation;
to create the scope for lower interest rates through the reduction of
excessive public deficits and the promotion of savings;
to curb excessive public deficits, above all by limiting public spending.
Taxpayers' money should be used more economically and more effectively;
to integrate more closely our environmental and growth objectives, by
encouraging market incentives and technological innovation to promote
environmentally sound consumption and production.
As the risk of inflation recedes as a result of our policies, it will be
increasingly possible for interest rates to come down. This will help
promote new investment and therefore stronger growth and more jobs.
But good macroeconomic policies are not enough. All our economies are
burdened by structural rigidities that constrain our potential growth rates.
We need to encourage competition. We need to create a more hospitable
environment for private initiative. We need to cut back excess regulation,
which suppresses innovation, enterprise and creativity. We will strengthen
employment opportunities through better training, education and enhanced
mobility. We will strengthen the basis for long-term growth through
improvements in infrastructure and greater attention to research and
development. We are urging these kinds of reforms for new democracies in the
transition to market economies. We cannot demand less of ourselves.
The co-ordination of economic and financial policies is a central element in
our common strategy for sustained, non-inflationary growth. We request our
finance ministers to strengthen their co-operation on the basis of our
agreed guidelines and to intensify their work to reduce obstacles to growth
and therefore foster employment. We ask them to report to our meeting in
Japan in 1993.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / Sterling's slide hits prospect of interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government's ability to cut interest rates was further weakened
yesterday as sterling dipped to its lowest point against the D-Mark since
April 9, the day of the general election.
Sterling's slide was assisted by strong buying pressure directed at the
D-Mark, which on a turbulent day on world currency markets gained at the
expense of a weaker dollar.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, attempted to buttress the pound by once
again ruling out a devaluation. Speaking in Munich, on the final day of the
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, he said there was
'no question of an alteration of sterling's exchange rate value vis a vis
European currencies'.
He said the UK would keep interest rates at whatever level was necessary to
maintain the pound's value and reaffirmed his commitment to take sterling,
when appropriate, into the narrow bands of the ERM at the DM2.95 central
rate.
Although the pound rallied slightly after Mr Lamont's comments, it finished
last night in London down 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark at DM2.8725. In
late trading in New York it was little changed at DM2.8735.
Meanwhile, with the summit's final communique failing to mention any
international bid to prop up the dollar, the US currency continued its
recent slide. However, after touching a 17-month low against the D-Mark, it
revived in late European trading to close in London slightly down at
DM1.496. In New York it closed at DM1.4897.
The pound's weakness is likely to rule out any immediate cut in UK base
rates, held at 10 per cent for the past two months. Many industrialists and
politicians would like Mr Lamont to engineer a cut in borrowing costs. At
the Munich summit, Germany came under pressure, from Mr Lamont and other
finance ministers, to relax its own high interest rates, a move which would
stimulate global growth. However, senior Bank of England officials have
privately conceded there is little chance of a rate cut by the Bundesbank
before late autumn at the earliest, reducing the prospects of an early move
by Britain on borrowing costs.
Pessimism about the immediate outlook for the UK economy added to selling
pressure on the pound. Some investors were persuaded to switch out of
sterling into other currencies because of continuing rumours that technical
moves by the Bank last Friday on the money markets were a precursor to an
effort to cut rates this week.
Such a cut would be judged by many foreign exchange investors as extremely
risky, considering the pound's weakness in the ERM, and the rumours helped
stoke the general nervousness about sterling.

FT  09 JUL 92 / European Court backs away from Sunday trade row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government to introduce urgent reform of Sunday trading laws
increased yesterday after the European Court of Justice suggested it was up
to English courts to sort out the confusion surrounding the present
legislation.
Mr Walter Van Gerven, the advocate-general, said it was justifiable under
Community law for countries to have national legislation which prohibited
shops opening on Sundays. He was giving a preliminary opinion in three cases
brought by local authorities in England and Wales against Payless DIY, B&amp;Q
and Anders - all DIY chains.
It was up to the English courts to decide whether the 1950 Shops Act was
incompatible with EC law and to judge whether the effect of general Sunday
closing on trade within the EC was disproportionate to the legitimate
objectives of the legislation.
The advocate-general's opinion is not binding on the full European Court,
which will deliver its judgment in the autumn. It will then be left to the
law lords, who referred the cases to Luxembourg, to decide the issue, taking
the court's views into account.
The government has been committed to reform of the Sunday trading laws since
1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated
by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, said
yesterday he had received a personal promise 'from a politician higher than
Kenneth Clarke', the home secretary, that the government would introduce
legislation immediately after the European Court ruling was published this
autumn.
Retailers who have been close to discussions with the government suggest any
legislation is likely to enshrine three main principles: a commitment to
keep Sunday trading different from Saturday, perhaps by specifying a maximum
number of trading hours; a commitment to help protect small shops; and a
provision to protect employee rights.
The government is believed to be keen to prevent the passage of Labour MP Mr
Ray Powell's private member's bill, which suggests reforms along the lines
of proposals drawn up by the Keep Sunday Special Campaign. These seek an
updating of the Sunday trading laws, with heavy regulation and greater
clarification.
The share prices of many of the leading retail companies involved in Sunday
trading were hit yesterday but most recovered as the day progressed.
Kingfisher, which owns the B&amp;Q chain, ended the day down 4p at 466p; J
Sainsbury closed down 3p at 449p; Argyll Group, owner of Safeway, was down
5p at 343p; and Tesco was down 4p at 254p.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Cuckney appeals for funds to aid Maxwell pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN CUCKNEY, the senior City figure given the job of rebuilding the
pension funds looted by the late Robert Maxwell, said yesterday he had still
only received one donation of Pounds 120,000 and appealed to City
institutions to make contributions.
He hinted that a new campaign to raise funds for the Maxwell pensioners'
trust fund would be launched within the next few days, using advertisements
and letters to solicit contributions.
In an interview at the unit's office in St James's Square in London, Sir
John, the retiring chairman of 3i, the venture capital group, said the trust
would require 'tens of millions of pounds' to make good 'a remarkable bit of
pillaging'.
He stressed that donations would not imply any culpability or liability, and
would be motivated by a desire to 'help restore and consolidate the good
name of the pensions industry and the financial services area'.
'In the end, the most interesting thing will be seeing those companies which
choose not to contribute,' he said.
Sir John's unit has a provisional budget for the first year of Pounds 1m,
representing the Department of Social Security's entire contingency fund,
and is staffed by 20 DSS civil servants, headed by a Department of the
Environment under-secretary.
He fended off criticism that the unit was duplicating existing efforts and
was a 'whitewash'.
Sir John said the trust had already been approached by a number of
individuals and 'financial institutions totally unconnected with the Maxwell
affair' willing to make donations. He would not be drawn on the amounts
involved or when the money would be received.
The trust - set up on June 7 by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security
secretary, as part of the Maxwell pensions unit - has a single donation from
the National Association of Pension Funds.
Sir John's comments came as the cross-party social security committee is due
to renew inquiries into the Maxwell affair with an urgent meeting with the
liquidators and administrators of the pension funds.
A meeting last night of the cross-party group of MPs campaigning for the
Maxwell pensioners agreed to ask the committee to look at the costs of
tracing the missing funds after MPs expressed concern about the scale of the
fees.
The group also agreed to seek early meetings with Sir John and with Mr
George Staple, the director of the Serious Fraud Office.
Sir John said that most of the money received by the trust would be given to
the Maxwell pension fund trustees. But he said there could also be
'individual ex-gratia payments to pensioners outside the schemes who are not
the responsibility of any trustees'.
Sir John said he expected the unit to be operating for at least the next 18
months. He said the trust would have an important role in acting as a focal
point for information, and in co-ordinating the work of accountants and
other advisers in an effort to reduce the level of fees charged.
He added that he had been approached by a number of people and professional
firms asking for support or offering suggestions and initiatives, although
he would not give further details.
One of the greatest challenges, he said, would be to try to co-ordinate the
large number of legal actions being taken in an effort to recover assets.
He confirmed that he was also 'working on' the issue of gathering more
financial information from countries with secretive banking laws. However,
he said that he had seen 'no evidence of government maladministration'.
The Maxwell fund trustees met for the first time last week and are likely to
sign a completed trust deed in the next few days.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Airbus wins Dollars 5bn order in US: United Airlines deal
expected to safeguard British Aerospace jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace and the European aircraft industry received a strong boost
yesterday after United Airlines, the second largest US carrier, placed a
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) order for up to 100 Airbus A320 jets.
This latest breakthrough in the US by the European Airbus consortium comes
at a time when the aerospace industry is struggling to win commercial orders
while facing a steep decline in defence sales.
Airbus beat off a tough challenge from Boeing, its US rival and traditional
supplier of jets to United.
The order is expected to safeguard jobs at Airbus's four partners, including
BAe, which builds all the wings for Airbus aircraft. In the UK, 35,000
people are involved in the Airbus programme. The deal is also important for
Rolls-Royce, a partner in the engine group chosen to power the United A320s.
It provides some relief to the two UK groups in a week when the uncertainty
has increased over the future of the Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft
project, in which both BAe and Rolls-Royce are involved.
BAe is a 20 per cent shareholder in Airbus, along with Aerospatiale of
France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent) and Casa of Spain
(4.2 per cent). Rolls-Royce is a partner in the IAE consortium whose V2500
engine will power the United airliners. The UK content of the A320s United
is acquiring amounts to 32 per cent of the value of each aircraft.
The order is also seen as a confidence boost for the twin-engine narrow-body
aircraft, the advanced technology of which has regularly been the subject of
controversy centring on the safety of its sophisticated 'fly by wire'
computerised flight control systems.
United's order was 'a strong vote of confidence in the A320 and its
attributes', Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, said last night.
Under the agreement, United is acquiring 50 A320s under a long-term leasing
deal with options on an additional 50. The first aircraft is scheduled to be
delivered to the US carrier in November 1993.
Airbus is understood to have put together what industry officials described
last night as 'very attractive financing' to win the deal against Boeing.
One official suggested Airbus had offered United 'an extraordinary
opportunity'.
Although details of the financing were not disclosed, the contract is
understood to be very flexible.
Boeing said last night it was 'extremely disappointed' by United's decision
not to choose its Boeing 737-400 twin-jet aircraft instead of the rival
A320.
'We made a very attractive offer and went as far as prudence would dictate.
Obviously Airbus could do more,' Boeing said.
With the United deal, firm orders placed for the A320 now total 701
aircraft.

FT  09 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS reported a volatile session in stock index futures, with little in
the way of features to help dealing, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,500, the September Footsie contract experienced a brief
squeeze before it retreated, with dealers expecting a poor performance from
Wall Street when it opened. But there was little in the way of dealings in
the early part of the session and traders were reported to have been on the
offer but seeing few takers. By 10.30am, September had fallen to 2,483.
Bargain hunters prevented further falls and boosted trade, and with the
feeling that the earlier falls had been overdone, September gently crept
forward in the afternoon. The firm opening on Wall Street helped sustain the
recovery in the contract and generated reasonable buying interest towards
the close.
September eventually finished the session at 2,504, down 16 on Tuesday's
close, but around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of
about 25. Turnover at around 8,000 contracts was modest.
Turnover in the traded options remained dull at 28,316 lots, but an
improvement on Tuesday's poor 21,895 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option put in
a total of 15,459, with Shell the busiest stock option, trading 1,057 lots.

FT  09 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall in renewed uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES over the outlook for sterling and for other world stock markets
returned to haunt London yesterday, and UK equities lost most of their gains
of the previous session as fund managers backed away again. The absence of
convincing progress on global economic problems at the G7 summit was a
discouraging factor.
Turnover remained poor, and the trend for the day was set early in the
session by the fall of 44 Dow points on Wall Street overnight. Lingering
hopes of an early cut in UK base rates received a further blow from
sterling's weakness in the ERM range. Confidence in a consumer-led recovery
was dented yet again when the chairman of Dixon's, the high street retailer,
said that UK consumers were still 'not spending' on major household
appliances.
At the day's low point, the FT-SE Index was down by nearly 40 points.
Equities steadied toward the close, helped by a similar trend in New York
where the Dow was a mere 3.78 off in UK hours, and by a rally in the Footsie
future which regained the 2,500 mark lost earlier in the day.
Also helping market sentiment was the reiteration by Mr John Major, UK prime
minister, of official forecasts that the UK economy will grow by 1 per cent
this year; some stock market strategists have been less sanguine.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,472.6, a net loss of 21.1.
Traders drew comfort from the market's rally from the day's low of 2,454.6,
which suggested that 2,450 is still a support line for the market.
First dealings in The Telegraph public issue, largely left with underwriters
last week, fared little better then expected, ending the session at a
discount of 42 to the issue price of 325p.
Seaq-reported volume, the catch-all figures which take in both retail and
intra-market business, improved to 396.1m shares from the 381.8m of the
previous session. However, dealers saw little advance in the level of
retail, or customer driven business in equities, which remained unimpressive
at Pounds 844m on Tuesday, according to Stock Exchange statistics.
The overnight setback on Wall Street touched a nerve in the London market
where analysts believe that the New York stock market is still over-valued,
and fear that this could prove a time bomb lurking beneath global stock
markets.
Uncertainty over the progress of world economies was further tested by
reports that the chairman of RTZ, the global metals and trading company, had
told stockbrokers in Tokyo that he was surprised by the strength of copper
prices in view of the absence of evidence that world recession is ending.
This morning is expected to bring a rash of bear-closing in the London
market by traders needing stock to meet selling commitments entered into
over the two week trading account which closes tomorrow. The Footsie has
bounced convincingly at the 2,450 area this week; however, the near term
outlook is dependent upon a Wall Street market which this week again
demonstrated its ability to unsettle London.

FT  09 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph issue at discount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST day of trading for The Telegraph new issue was dogged by several
factors, not least of which was the market view that the shares were priced
too high. The shares opened 289p, a sharp discount to the issue price of
325p, and slid further throughout the day to close at 283p; the final
discount of 42 to the offer price indicated the market's cautious view of
the issue. Only 3m shares traded of 26m now in issue.
Analysts argued that at 325p the P/E multiple was too high and the yield too
low but SG Warburg believed that at the 290p level the shares were
attractive.
Initial trading was further hampered by the overhang of stock left with the
underwriters. Private investors subscribed for only 3m of the 13m offered.
Finally, the gloomy state of the stock market, the stream of bad publicity
relating to the Maxwell media empire and the failure of a number of new
issues recently, all had their impact. Mr Guy Lamming from agency broker
James Capel commented: 'Its a shame that such a good asset has got off to
such a bad start.'
Dixons fall
Full-year results from Dixons were in line with expectations, but the high
street group's bleak trading statement added to the gloom over the retail
sector.
While the market was fairly positive about the group's overall trading
performance, the poor trading climate at the present time created a general
consensus that Dixons faces a tough 12 months, with margins under continued
pressure. Analysts chopped forecasts for the next year accordingly, shaving
an average 15 per cent off down to a range of Pounds 80m-87m.
Yesterday, the shares tumbled 9 to 214p. County NatWest said: 'At this
price, we are in no hurry to buy. Dixons will get cheaper.'
Elsewhere, Marks &amp; Spencer lost 8 to 311p, Kingfisher 4 to 466p, Boots 13 to
428p and Argos 4 at 229p.
RTZ nervous
The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, fell 25 to 583p following reportedly
cautious comments by its chief executive Mr Derek Birkin, who was said to
have told a meeting in Tokyo that copper prices are unsustainably high.
The shares were also hit by a weaker dollar. RTZ profits are highly
sensitive to US currency moves and the dollar has lost about 14 per cent
against sterling since mid-March. Analysts said the group loses Pounds 50m
from net income profits for every 5 per cent fall in the dollar against a
basket of currencies, all other things being equal.
Takeover rumours continued to sustain TSB which managed a minor gain of 2 at
139p although turnover was a minimal 1m shares. Merchant banks with market
trading operations were again under pressure as turnover continued at
extremely low levels.
SG Warburg closed a further 23 down at 460p and Kleinwort Benson dropped 5
more to 254p. Union Discount, still reeling from the warning that the group
will record losses of up to Pounds 15m for the half-year period,
relinquished 8 more to 53p.
The latest slide in share prices and their damaging effect on the composite
insurance sectors' solvency margins, led to more weakness in the composite
sector viewed by many strategists as a prime area for dividend cuts. The
sector was also damaged by fears that the mortgage indemnity crisis will
deepen.
General Accident fell 12 to 438p, Royal 7 to 200p, after a low of 198p and
Sun Alliance retreated 8 to 268p.
The electricity distribution stocks suffered profit-taking after a better
than expected outcome from the Offer review. The Electricity Package dropped
43 to Pounds 3,305, while the worst performers among individual stocks
included Yorkshire, 10 lower at 373p, and Seeboard, 8 easier at 332p.
Midlands fell 7 1/2 to 332p.
General unease took its toll on the water sector where smaller more thinly
traded stocks were the poorest performers, with Northumbrian giving up 9 at
478p.
Reports of sharply declining oil consumption triggered a bout of nervous
selling throughout the oil sector. Hints that some of the leading London
broking houses may well be preparing downgrades across the board reversed
the recent rally in BP shares which settled 3 off at 211p on good turnover
of 6.1m shares. Shell dipped 3 to 495p on 3.4m. British Gas retreated 4 to
251 1/2 p on 6.7m shares.
Vague takeover speculation saw Calor edge up 5 to 184p. Enterprise Oil
retreated 6 to 394p, unsettled by falling oil prices, but Lasmo were
especially weak and settled 10 down at 162p, a fall of some 6 per cent, in
relatively heavy trading.
P&amp;O eased 6 to 418p, after a couple of brokers downgraded profit
expectations. BZW reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 35m to Pounds
275m citing continued weakness in the UK economy. Kleinwort Benson was also
cut its estimate. Container group Tiphook continued to recover from Monday's
big falls that followed the release of lower than expected profits. The
shares gained 18 to 365p, as dealers said a large line of stock that had
overshadowed the market in the shares had been absorbed.
Reports that British Airways and USAir were in negotiations about a
transatlantic airline partnership helped the shares of the former harden a
penny to 268p.
Among motors, GKN were in demand, the shares firming 7 to 380p. Financial
worries have continued at BM Group and the shares fell another 17 to 103p,
in response.
'A dead cat bounce' is how the day's trading in British Aerospace was
described by one dealer. The shares jumped 11 to 242p, in modest trade of
1.3m shares.
A Profits downgrading from Smith New Court left BTR lighter 12 at 450p.
A dull day in leisure stocks was enlivened by a bounce in Rank Organisation,
with the market growing in confidence that the group would report
satisfactory results today. The share, up 11 at one stage, retreated to
close a net 3 ahead at 631p.
A big agency deal in Queens Moat Houses saw 4m cross at 68p. The shares
dipped a penny to 70p in overall turnover of 9.2m. Fellow hotel group Forte
slipped 4 to 169p.

FT  09 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak dollar takes toll of
continental bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAK dollar continued to worry bourses yesterday, and Wall Street's
overnight drop exacerbated the issue, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT sank to its lowest close since May 15, the DAX index closing 16.33
lower at 1,751.18 after a 2.91 decline to 694.45 in the FAZ at midsession.
Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM5.2bn.
The slide left 28 of the 30 DAX blue chips with losses. There was good and
bad news in that for Mr Robert Willis and Mr Roderick Hinkel of Hoare
Govett, who have just reviewed the DAX constituents. Of the big fallers,
Metallgesellschaft, down DM10.60 at DM395.20, was one of their principal
sell recommendations; but Degussa (down DM11 at DM323.20) was seen as a
strong buy.
Both companies are under pressure from the weak dollar and the denomination
of their sales in dollar terms. Degussa was also hit by news that it was one
of nine German companies which were searched on Tuesday on suspicion of
making illegal deliveries to Iraq; however, it told Mr Willis later that its
deliveries involved vacuum ovens supplied to Iraq Airways, approved by the
German government, and even insured by the latter under its export guarantee
scheme.
The main rise of the day came in Asko, DM27 better at DM691, on hopes that
its retailing future will outweigh its wheeler-dealer past; the construction
group, Strabag, posted a DM6 rise to DM611 on a good progress report on
1992.
PARIS saw companies with dollar-denominated earnings fall further than the
index. The CAC 40 lost 31.34 or 1.7 per cent to 1,847.75 in turnover of
FFr1.8bn. Alcatel remained the most active stock, rising FFr8 to FFr646 in
arbitrage-related buying.
Among companies with exposure to the US, Pechiney dropped FFr25 or 7.7 per
cent to FFr300 while Lafarge dropped Fr11.50 or 3.6 per cent to FFr312.50.
Saint Gobain lost FFr16 to FFr554.
Continued worries that the banking sector would have to increase provisions
for property-related loans were blamed for the FFr13.40, or 3.9 per cent
drop in Paribas to FFr324.50.
MILAN continued to fall as rumours about the government's planned interim
budget swirled around the market. There was talk of an increase in the
property tax, and fears that drastic government measures could bring on a
painful recession in the economy. The Comit index fell 5.08 to a new 1992
low of 429.12 in turnover estimated at less than Tuesday's L104.8bn.
Generali fell L550 to L26,900, in spite of reports that some domestic mutual
funds had mounted a mopping-up operation the previous day.
Telecoms remained weak, with Stet slipping L79 or 4.9 per cent to L1,550.
Its new warrants are due to be listed today. Sip steadied after falling
heavily on Tuesday, losing just L2 to L1,171.
Fiat dropped below the important L5,000 mark, closing down L54 at L4,977,
but recovered to L5,020 after hours.
ZURICH lost just over 1 per cent, the SMI index falling 19.0 to 1,837.6.
Chemicals came under pressure because of the weak dollar, Ciba-Geigy bearers
falling SFr14 to SFr627 and Sandoz bearers by SFr100 to SFr2,890. Dealers
said that Sandoz was slightly overbought recently following US roadshows
last month.
MADRID saw widespread selling drive down the banking, gas and utilities
sectors as the general index closed down 2.68 at 233.61, a new low for the
year. Volume was weak at around Pta7bn.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index fell 0.9 to 120.7. Nutricia fell another Fl
4.00 to Fl 141.50 after the chairman's comments that earnings would be under
pressure this year.
STOCKHOLM lost 1.9 per cent, the Affarsvarlden General index ending 16.9
down at another new 1992 low of 877.5 in turnover of SKr552m.
Ericsson B led the active stocks, falling SKr3 to SKr127; the pulp producer
Modo, sensitive to fluctuations in the dollar, SKr20 to SKr225.
OSLO dropped almost 1.5 per cent, the all-share index shedding 5.89 at
391.82. Norsk Hydro ended NKr3.50 lower at NKr150 after the US Commerce
Department ruled on Tuesday that Hydro was dumping pure magnesium in the US
market from its plant in Canada. HELSINKI hit a second consecutive 1992 low
as ex index closed 5.5 down at 737.9.
ISTANBUL fell 1.9 per cent on profit-taking brought on by concern about the
Treasury auction and the suspension of shares in in the iron and steel

FT  09 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Mixed company news subdues Jakarta -
But foreign investors may be tempted into Indonesian shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE colour of the trading floor of the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSE) is a
cool blue, in contrast with the heated faces of the traders. In the
visitors' gallery above, anxious investors train binoculars on the boards,
one alloted to each of the 148 quoted companies, to watch their share prices
go up and down.
'There used to be telephones for people in the gallery to call down to the
floor but they've been removed. Occasionally you see pieces of paper pressed
against the gallery window with 'SELL' written in large letters,' says one
broker.
Brokers say that Jakarta's trading floor is similar to that of Singapore's a
decade ago and is changing rapidly. Until recently floor traders sat behind
large desks in armchairs. Now they are perched behind lecterns with two-way
radios and mobile phones. By 1995 the exchange is scheduled to move to a new
Dollars 300m computerised complex.
The move might be overly ambitious given the recent history of the Jakarta
market. Its composite index crashed from a high of 682 in April 1990 to
under 225 last October. However, the market has since risen steadily to
about 320, closing at 319.70 yesterday, although the hope that it might hit
400 by the year-end now appears optimistic.
Equities discounted the result of the June 9 parliamentary election, won by
the ruling Golkar party, in advance of polling day. Having momentarily
broken 330, the index has slipped back in generally quiet trading averaging
about Rp34bn (Dollars 17m) a day.
The subdued mood has been compounded by mixed news from the two largest
quoted companies.
On June 22 Indocement announced acquisitions totalling Dollars 848m from
within the Salim Group of which it is itself a part. Whilst its shares have
only slipped Rp250 to Rp12,250, the nature of the purchases raised eyebrows
amongst brokers and reminded public investors that with most quoted
Indonesian companies they are at the mercy of private majority shareholders.
Shares in Astra International, which accounts for over 50 per cent of
Indonesia's vehicle sales, have fallen back sharply since mid-June, from
Rp14,350 to Rp11,300, following the announcement of disappointing
first-quarter figures which saw net profits fall by 55 per cent to Rp95.6bn.
Brokers are concerned that Astra may not be the only company with poor
results and do not expect the half-year results season, due to be released
in late-July and August, to boost the index.
Lending rates are expected to fall a few points from about 26 per cent at
present, but a concomitant drop in deposit rates will be to the detriment of
many companies, the profits of which have been boosted by high interest
earnings. Whilst economists are optimistic about the long-term growth of the
economy, the prospect of presidential elections next March is beginning to
unsettle some investors.
'President Suharto is almost certain to win, but it's still a bit of a
worry,' says one foreign broker.
There have been comparatively few new issues this year, with an estimated
Rp400bn raised in the first six months compared to Rp5,000bn in the same
period of 1990. As a corollary, however, most new issues have been
oversubscribed and have gone to an instant premium: last week Kabel Metal
Indonesia, a producer of electrical and telecommunication cable, was listed
at Rp3,500 and is now trading above Rp4,000 on the back of foreign interest.
The exchange is also finalising plans to permit rights trading, an area
where profits - and losses - are quickly made. Prices on the exchange cannot
move by less than Rp50, so as one broker explains, 'If the price of a traded
right moves up from Rp200 to Rp250, you've made an instant 25 per cent
profit'.
Where Jakarta may benefit is from investors tiring of other regional markets
such as Hong Kong, Bangkok and Manila. Brokers say that one large US bank
has gone long on Jakarta and, given the market's illiquidity, any surge in
foreign interest is almost certain to send prices rising.
Brokers estimate that foreign investors are holding about Dollars 4bn in
shares of a listed market capitalisation of about Dollars 12bn. A decree
allowing foreigners to hold bank shares is expected to be finalised before
the end of the month which, they say, may give the market some impetus.

FT  09 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Firmer biotechnology
sector lifts Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE rally in the biotechnology sector pushed up share prices, and the
Nikkei average, which had been initially depressed by Tuesday's fall on Wall
Street and concerns about financial problems at construction companies,
closed higher for the first time in four days, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed up 140.71 at the day's high of 16,600.26,
having fallen to the day's low of 16,271.68 in the morning session on
small-lot arbitrage selling.
Volume rose to 190m shares from 160m. Domestic and foreign institutions
refrained from action. 'The foreigners are sitting tight,' said Mr Robert
Wicks at James Capel. He added that apart from dealers and a few individuals
trading 'theme' stocks, the flow of new money into the market had stopped.
Advances led declines by 548 to 377 with 148 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks rose 2.98 to 1,274.13 and in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.45 to 1,000.10.
Dealers tried to generate activity by trading speculative theme stocks in
the afternoon. Issues which have been previously sought on the 'Aids theme',
and the 'blue-fin tuna theme', advanced.
Meiji Milk Products was the most active issue of the day, rising Y34 to
Y985, while Fujisawa Pharmaceutical advanced Y19 to Y989 and Taiyo Fisheries
Y15 to Y517.
However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, regarded as a benchmark for market
sentiment, fell Y7,000 to Y622,000.
Construction-related issues continued to fall as investors remained
pessimistic about the sector following an announcement by Royal
Construction, a small construction company listed on the over-the-counter
market, that the company had dishonoured bills, and would seek court
protection from its creditors.
The Japan Securities Dealers Association said Royal Construction would be
eligible for trading on the OTC market for the next six months as an issue
not registered with the association.
Trading in shares of Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp and Jujo Paper was halted in the
afternoon, after reports of a merger between the two companies. The
companies later announced that the merger will take place next April,
creating the largest company in the industry with annual sales of around
Y700bn. Buying orders surged on the reports, Sanyo Kokusaku rising by Y27 to
Y578, and Jujo adding Y26 to Y536 before the suspension.
Retail issues continued to weaken, with Ito-Yokado down Y30 to Y3,890. Ms
Victoria Melendez, retail analyst at Jardine Fleming, said poor domestic
sales together with losses at Southland, Ito-Yokado's consolidated US
subsidiary, was hurting the share price.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 87.25 to 19,221.76 in volume of 6.9m shares.
Roundup
WALL STREET exerted a persuasive influence on most of the region yesterday
but Hong Kong and, to an extent, New Zealand had other ideas. Bombay stayed
closed.
AUSTRALIA ended lower after the Reserve Bank delivered a long-awaited, but
smaller-than-expected cut in official interest rates. Banks led the way down
as the All Ordinaries index slipped 9.1 to 1,651.4. Westpac and ANZ each
lost 9 cents to ADollars 3.39 and ADollars 3.95 respectively, while
Commonwealth fell 5 cents to ADollars 7.33.
The gold index firmed 2.1 to 1,175.3 after bullion prices leapt above
Dollars 347 an ounce. Pacific Placer rose 8 cents to ADollars 2.78, while
Kidston climbed 5 cents to ADollars 1.57.
TAIWAN was pulled down by heavy selling in the last hour after the central
bank said that it had no plans to cut official interest rates. The weighted
index plunged 102.91 or 2.3 per cent to 4,329.31 in active turnover of
TDollars 26.93bn after TDollars 25.7bn.
Construction shares were hit by fears that the government would crack down
further on land speculation. Cathay Construction fell TDollars 2.50 to
TDollars 63.50.
MANILA continued to fall as investors stayed on the sidelines to assess the
performance of the new government. The composite index fell 14.51 to
1,481.82 in combined turnover of 581m pesos, up from 211m.
HONG KONG closed higher on renewed buying as the market discounted the
failure of Sino-British talks over funding for Hong Kong's new airport. The
Hang Seng index jumped 69.99 or 1.2 per cent to 5,981.91 but turnover fell
to HKDollars 2.88bn from HKDollars 3.56bn.
Blue chips were sought after, with HSBC topping the most active list and
gaining 50 cents to HKDollars 49.50.
NEW ZEALAND ended unchanged after recouping an early loss of 1 per cent. The
NZSE-40 capital index dropped 14 points at the start, overshadowed by the
overnight fall on Wall Street, but closed 0.54 better at 1,570.70 in
turnover of NZDollars 33m.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Confusion on rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERIOD rates in the sterling cash markets ended even firmer yesterday, as
dealers took the whole day to remove a large shortage and the pound slipped
further against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.45bn at the start of the
day and later revised it upwards to Pounds 1.7bn. Once again, the market was
sticky, and the Bank ended the day providing late assistance of around
Pounds 650m. Dealers said that the slowness with which bills were offered
was due to the determination of clearing banks to keep money tight. There
was continuing speculation, too, that the Bank of England might offer money
at cheaper rates.
However, if the Bank had set out with the intention of instigating a base
rate cut last Friday, that policy appeared to have been well-and-truly
abandoned yesterday. Sterling dipped further on the foreign exchanges,
ending the day at DM2.8720. Traders were bemused over the Bank's intentions.
One discount house trader wondered why the Bank did not go ahead with a cut
earlier this week. 'I believe that sterling would have been no worse than it
now is at its current levels,' he said. 'The Bank should have taken the
risk.'
Instead, the Bank continued to deal in Bands 1 and 2 at the established rate
of 9 7/8 per cent, and in repurchase agreements (repos) at 9 15/16 per cent.
One-month money ended the day unchanged at 10 1/16 per cent, but 3-month
money, a key indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, moved up
to 10 1/16 per cent from 10 1/32 per cent. Further out, rates firmed even
more: 6 month money closed at 10 1/32 per cent from a previous close of 9
15/16 per cent, and 1-year money closed at 9 31/32 from a previous close of
9 13/16 per cent.
Sterling futures reflected the bearish mood. The September short sterling
contract closed down eight ticks from its previous close at 90.14 and the
December contract was down 9 ticks to close at 90.38.
In its morning operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 113m of Band 1 bank
bills, and Pounds 45m in a 'repo' for resale on 27 July. Later the bank
purchased Pounds 23m in Band 1 and Pounds 210m in a similar 'repo.' In the
afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 210m in Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 143m
in Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 265m in the 'repo.'

FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver steadier after Tuesday's
plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER PRICES recovered slightly yesterday after the sharp drop on Tuesday
caused by extraordinarily heavy selling by the National Commercial Bank of
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia's sole private bank.
An NCB official told Reuter that the quantity - sold in only two hours  -
was less than 20m ounces. The silver sales were 'a purely commercial
transaction' on behalf of big Saudi clients, said the official.
However, traders were sceptical about this claim. Some suggested it would
have required between 40m and 50m troy ounces, or more than 1,244 tonnes,
worth Dollars 160m, to have driven the price down so steeply. This
represents about 12 per cent of annual world demand for silver, used mainly
by the photographic and electronic industries.
Traders continued to link the sell-off with Tuesday's resignation of Sheikh
Khalid bin Mahfouz, deputy general manager of the NCB, who is fighting
charges by a New York grand jury that he defrauded depositors of the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
After its plunge by 20 cents an ounce on Tuesday, silver closed in London
last night up 4 cents at Dollars 3.91 an ounce. Traders suggested that the
market had been unable to absorb all the Saudi silver and more metal was
likely to be sold if the price rallied above Dollars 3.95.
In 1990 the NCB hit the gold market with heavy sales and there was some
relief yesterday that the Bank had concentrated only on silver on Tuesday.
Some New York speculators sold gold short (sold metal they did not own,
hoping to buy it later at a lower price) on Tuesday, gambling that the NCB
would also drive down the gold price.
They later had to scramble to cover their positions and this helped gold to
rise yesterday. It closed in London at Dollars 347.70 a troy ounce, up
Dollars 2.05.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina tries to rouse
dormant mining sector - A look at efforts to attract foreign investors to a
long-neglected industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S MINING industry is like a sleeping beauty that is gradually
waking from a deep slumber that lasted most of this century. A fortifying
dose of pro-business government policies is reviving the dormant industry,
while the promise of barely explored territory is making Argentina the apple
of many an international mining company's eye.
Mr David Ancieta, executive director of Minera Aguilar, Argentina's largest
mining company, says: 'Argentina is a country of opportunity. There has
hardly been any exploration. It is virgin territory for mining'.
Mr Jorge Cuomo, a mining consultant, says Argentina's mining industry
accounts for just 0.3 per cent of GDP. And 96 per cent of the industry's
output is in industrial minerals like talc and borax, rather than metallic
minerals like gold, silver or copper.
Argentina has never bothered to exploit the Andes' mining potential, even
though neighbouring Chile has developed some of the world's largest mining
projects in its Andean territory.
The distance of the Andes from Buenos Aires, around which most of the
population is concentrated, Argentina's agrarian rather than industrial or
mining tradition, plus six decades of political chaos and bureaucratic
restrictions explain the Lilliputian mining sector.
Furthermore, government policies actually discouraged mining. For instance,
the Andean border region was declared a security zone, effectively closed to
foreign investment.
All that began changing with Argentina's adoption in 1989 of orthodox free
market policies. It has lifted import barriers, made the currency freely
convertible, swept away xenophobic investment controls and introduced
successive deregulation packages. The result of this whirlwind is low
inflation and one of Latin America's most business-friendly environments.
But since mining has never been a national priority, it was only recently
that President Carlos Menem turned his attention to it, announcing in May
new plans to attract private investment and technology to revitalise the
industry.
Mr Luis Prol, hydrocarbons and mining secretary, says: 'If we are to become
a more important mining country, much depends on our geology, our legal and
regulatory framework. We are introducing interesting changes - improving
regulations, making them more transparent and open to investors'.
The government is working on a new mining investment law intended to
buttress the 1886 mining code by further guaranteeing foreign investors'
rights, such as freedom to remit dividends.
It is also trying to convince provincial governments, which are largely
responsible for regulating and taxing the industry, to adopt a uniform
mining policy and tax regime. At present, provincial mining royalties vary
from 2.5 per cent to 12 per cent while both national and provincial
governments apply a confusing variety of taxes.
Mr Miguel Angel Guerrero, national mining director, is also trying to bring
together a wealth of dispersed geological information - some of it once
considered a military secret - and begin a national geological survey. At
present Argentina lacks adequate production statistics, let alone detailed
survey data.
Foreign investment is essential, given Argentina's tiny mining industry. But
while foreign companies obviously applaud the new policies, they are still
wary. After all, few countries can rival Argentina's long history of
military coups, massive inflation, bewildering policy shifts and widespread
corruption.
Mr Ancieta, whose company is based in Bolivia and is part-owned by Britain's
RTZ, says: 'Mining requires considerable risk capital, so Argentina needs to
offer security. If I invest now, will the rules be the same in ten or 15
years?'
The government's planned mining investment law is intended to provide such
guarantees. But laws have traditionally meant little in Argentina. About a
dozen foreign companies are known to be looking at possible projects, but
are expected to wait for Argentina to consolidate economic and political
stability before making significant investments.
Aguilar, which produces lead, silver and zinc at a mine in northern
Argentina, is dusting off a copper project in the Andes it had mothballed
for 20 years because either international prices were too low or Argentina
was too unstable.
Overcoming investors' fears is only part of the trick. Investors will have
to work hard to find attractive investment targets. For example, Cerro
Castillo, Argentina's largest locally-owned mining company, is looking for
foreign partners. But Buenos Aires equity analyst Mr Christopher Ecclestone
says it lacks adequate 'finance skills and management approach'. He says
Cerro Castillo, which operates a gold, silver, zinc and copper mine in
southern Argentina, lost Dollars 15.3m on sales of Dollars 8.7m in the year
to November 1991.
Foreigners can buy into new, untried prospects. The government lists 138
projects of potential interest to investors. But only seven are operating
and only two of them have attracted much interest.
Alternatively, investors can do their own exploration. This seems to be the
favoured approach. Among companies sniffing around Argentina are RTZ's
Australian-based affiliate CRA, Noranda, Cyprus Metals and FMC of the US,
and Canada's Pacific Rim.
Mr Prol says Chilean subsidiaries of multinational companies are expected to
be among the first to invest in Argentina, given their proximity and
knowledge of the Andes. The government's abolition of the border security
zone and other restrictions was specifically intended to encourage Chilean
companies to cross into Argentina.
Argentina must also modernise its uncompetitive economy and reduce costs.
Wages and equipment costs are rising, despite a fixed exchange rate,
threatening competitiveness. The provinces have done what they can to lessen
the tax burden. Fortunately, strong local demand has increased company
profitability, offsetting deteriorating export competitiveness. Aguilar, for
example, has annual sales of Dollars 50m, but last year lost about Dollars
9m. This year it hopes to turn in a profit of Dollars 1m or more.
Yet the inefficient and undercapitalised industry's does offer investors
huge scope for profit-making by applying elementary management and
technological improvements. For instance, the quarrying industry ships huge
marble and granite blocks to Italy where they are processed and re-exported,
rather than being processed in Argentina.
Ultimately, as Mr Guerrero recognises, Argentina must invest heavily to 'add
more value to the final product. Without vertical integration with industry
raw materials are not worth much'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH there is no auction guidance from the main primary markets in
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa prices are still subject to the
vagaries of volatile currency markets. Weakness in the US dollar has
recently been slightly outpaced by weakness in the Australian dollar, and
related prices in Europe have been plumbing their recent lows. Inevitably
this downward drift does not help those who are trying to persuade buyers to
move in. The uncertainty and lack of confidence keeps business quiet, which
in turn tends to soften selling prices further.

London's COCOA market forged ahead to close at two-month highs as dealers
cited positive technicals and the continued absence of origin sales. Concern
about dry weather in the Ivory Coast also prompted some covering of short
positions. Bullishness spread after the near September contract broke
through resistance at Pounds 603 a tonne, a level that had twice before
capped upward moves. 'We're comfortably into money-making levels for
origins, but they're still holding back,' one dealer said. Most dealers
expected prices to continue their upward path before any concerted origin
selling. On the LME ZINC closed off its highs, although the market continued
to attract support on price dips, following three-month metal's break above
Dollars 1,300 a tonne late on Tuesday. ALUMINIUM continued to be restrained
by bearish fundamentals in fully matching the bull trend of other metals. In
Chicago MAIZE futures were lower at midday based on beliefs that heavy rains
were about to hit Illinois yesterday afternoon. Showers and thunder storms
had been forecast yesterday and later in the week, which should provide
adequate moisture during the peak growing period.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Green' currencies head for
knacker's yard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST labyrinthine corpus of European Community law - the 'green'
currency system - is on its way to the knacker's yard.
The European Commission yesterday approved the abolition of monetary
compensatory amounts (MCAs), the system of export subsidies and taxes used
to iron out irregularities arising from the divergence of foreign exchange
rates from the fixed 'green' rates used to translate the EC's guaranteed
farm prices, which are denominated in European currency units, into national
currencies.
This system requires border checks on produce moving across EC borders and
so cannot continue when the barrier-free single market comes into operation
next year. Commision officials believe the 12 will approve the plan
virtually unmodified.
There will still be 'green' currencies, until a single EC currency arrives,
in principle by 1999 at the latest. But green rates will now be set at the
central rate for the seven currencies operating within the narrow band of
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, and at close to
average market rate for the rest. The latter 'floating' currencies are those
of the UK, Spain, Portugal and Greece. The first three are in the wider band
of the exchange rate mechanism while the Greek drachma is outside it.
The stability of the EMS, which has seen no major realignment for five
years, thereby theoretically guarantees a stable green rate, eliminating
MCAs.
The proposal still provides for realignments and would reintroduce monetary
compensation whenever exchange rate gaps widened beyond five percentage
points. This, however, is wider than the present provision for a 4 point
gap, under which the MCA mechanism, once a crucial instrument for EC
agri-traders, had almost withered away. The MCA system for the UK has been
dismantled and the system now operates mostly for the benefit of Greece.
But the agrimonetarist profession built up over 25 years of a system of
ever-increasing complexity will not be put out of business entirely until
the advent of monetary union. Traders will still have to master the rules
governing even much tighter fluctuations, though their task, especially in
the virtually fixed currency countries, will be much simpler.

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Bonds: World Bank launches five-year Dollars
1.5bn global issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank yesterday launched its sixth global bond issue, leading a
number of sovereign and supranational borrowers hurrying to raise funds in
the international market before the summer holiday period.
The World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn five-year deal, lead-managed by IBJ
International and Merrill Lynch, will be priced today to yield 5 to 7 basis
points more than US Treasury securities. On the basis of demand seen
yesterday, underwriters are expecting the yield spread to be set at the
tighter end of the indicated range.
Participants in the deal reported strong buying from investment institutions
in the Far East and Europe. However, US investors appeared less
enthusiastic. At such a low yield spread, most US investors prefer to buy
their domestic government paper.
Even so, demand from elsewhere was easily enough to support the deal and
most underwriters reported demand well in excess of their allocations.
Finland continued its heavy borrowing programme in the international market,
raising FFr4bn 11-year funding. The deal, lead-managed by Credit Commercial
de France, was the borrower's second issue in French francs this year
following a FFr5bn five-year issue in March.
Yesterday's 9 per cent issue was priced to yield 41 basis points more than
French government bonds of the same maturity. However, the government bond
issue maturing 2003 is relatively illiquid. Bankers said the Finland bonds
yielded around 39 basis points more than benchmark French government debt.
Both the pricing and long maturity of the issue were seen as aggressive by
deal participants. Paris-based banks found only lacklustre demand from
French investors although international demand for the issue was more
buoyant.
By the close of trading in Paris, the bonds were trading at 99.20 bid, below
the fixed re-offer level of 99.32 but well inside full fees of 35 basis
points. At this level, the yield spread over the 2003 government issue was
42 basis points.
Norway made a debut issue in the Canadian dollar sector, taking advantage of
good currency and interest rate swaps opportunities. The CDollars 500m
six-year deal, lead-managed by Paribas Capital Markets and IBJ
International, was swapped into US dollars. Another European sovereign
borrower is expected to tap the Canadian dollar sector today.
The 7 1/4 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.55. At this level the yield was 34 basis points more than Canadian
government paper.
The yield spread was initially seen as too tight by some participants in the
deal. However, most reported brisk sales. The Canadian dollar bond market
has rallied strongly on hopes that the debate about the country's
constitution will soon be resolved.
Slough Estates, the property investment group, became the third UK company
this week to raise long-term sterling funding, following issues from Hanson
and Boots. The company launched a Pounds 100m 20-year issue lead-managed by
Warburg Securities.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to refinance part a Pounds 147m
liability relating to a convertible bond which will probably be put back to
the company next year.
Since the put option on the convertible is not exercisable for some months,
yesterday's issue was launched in partly-paid form. Investors must pay 25
per cent of the purchase price this month, with the balance falling due at
the end of December.
The company chose to issue yesterday rather than waiting until later in the
year because long-dated gilt yields are low and - as shown by the Hanson and
Boots issues - demand for long-dated sterling paper is firm.
The 11 5/8 per cent unsecured bonds were priced to yield 255 basis points
more than long-dated gilts. A secured issue could have been priced to yield
around 1 per cent less. However, by issuing unsecured debt, Slough remains
free to trade its property assets.

THE JAPANESE Ministry of Finance (MoF) is to ease shelf registration rules
for domestic bond issuers, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Issuers will be allowed to use credit ratings as a criterion. Companies with
ratings of single A or better from two or more designated domestic or
overseas credit rating agencies will qualify for shelf registration.
Stock market listed companies with an average Y500bn (Dollars 4bn) in shares
outstanding for the past three years will be able to make a registration.
Under the current rules, companies must have Y500bn in share value at the
time of registration.
There is no change in the current requirement that unrated companies wishing
to make a registration must have a minimum three year's financial disclosure
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: L&amp;G increases weighting of
bonds in pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the UK insurance company, has increased the proportion of
bonds held by its pension funds and expects to further increase the
weighting in favour of fixed-income investments through the 1990s.
Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income investment, said the return on UK bonds
and UK equities was likely to be much closer in the 1990s than in the 1980s.
Since 1986, the total return from UK bonds and equities has been virtually
identical, he said.
L&amp;G now holds 5 1/2 to 6 per cent of pension fund assets in sterling bonds,
against an industry average of close to 3 per cent.
Mr Shaw pointed to two main reasons why fund managers are reluctant to
switch cash out of equities:
Most institutional investors are keen to retain existing fund management
business. Maintaining portfolio weightings in line with the industry average
is the safest way to achieve this 'defensive' goal.
Asset allocation decisions are guided by an actuarial assessment of the
returns needed to meet pension fund liabilities. Since most UK pensions are
linked to final salary, real dividend growth from equities is the only way
to match liabilities in periods of high inflation.
Fund managers will be unwilling to switch into bonds until actuarial
assumptions about inflation and dividend growth are changed.

protection from its creditors

<TEXT>
ERCROS, the big Spanish chemicals group controlled by the Kuwait Investment
Office (KIO), yesterday formally filed for protection from its creditors,
along with its troubled fertiliser division, Fesa-Enfersa. The two companies
have combined debts of Dollars 1.56bn.
The filings, in Madrid and Barcelona, end weeks of agonising over how to
deal with the Ercros groups' total debt of Dollars 2.15bn - yesterday's
filings exclude the group's chemicals, mining and explosives businesses -
following the KIO's refusal to make new funds available without a broader
agreement on assistance from creditor banks and the Spanish government.
KIO, through Torras, its Spanish holding company, owns 39 per cent of
Ercros, which lost Dollars 160m last year. Salomon Brothers has been
appointed as adviser to the KIO in an effort to sort out its Spanish
investments.
Mr Francisco Luzon, chairman of the state-owned Banco Exterior, which is
owed more than Dollars 200m by Ercros, has sharply criticised the decision
to go into receivership and has warned that all of KIO's industrial
companies may be threatened by it.
In London yesterday, KIO was taking legal advice on the effect of its filing
on a Pounds 100m convertible guaranteed by Torras. The trustee of the bond
issue, the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, is still considering whether the
filing, which represents an event of default, is prejudicial to bondholders.
If the trustee decides to ask for repayment of the bonds, they would be
repaid at 102 per cent of their face value. Such a step would be subject to
the approval of bondholders. But bondholders will have the option to put the
bonds at 125.25 in August 1993. If they believe the principal is safe,
bondholders may chose to sit it out until next year's put option.
The price of the bonds has fallen sharply in the last few days, due to the
risk of early redemption. In the wake of yesterday's filing, the bonds were
bid at 103, down eight points on last week.

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hafnia wins time in survival bid
 -A look at the problems confronting the Danish insurance-based financial
services group which came close to receivership last weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE HAVE won the first battle, and we have gained the potential to win the
next ones as well,' said Mr Olav Grue, recently-appointed chief executive of
Hafnia, the insurance-based financial services group which came perilously
close to going into receivership last weekend.
The next battles will include cuts in staff and disposal of subsidiaries
which could lead to the company cutting staff by about 1,000 from 3,700.
Sale of Hafnia's UK subsidiary, Prolific, the life assurance and pension
management company, bought by Hafnia in 1989, is thought to be high on the
list of priorities, but Mr Grue would not comment on either this or the size
of staff cuts.
Mr Grue, formerly managing director of an industrial finance fund, was
brought in on June 2, when the company was in serious financial trouble.
Within days the situation worsened.
Denmark's June 2 referendum rejecting the Maastricht treaty caused share and
bond prices to fall, further undermining the group's equity capital.
Then, last week, there was a fresh shock for the group. It was revealed that
a senior manager, since dismissed, had made irregular commitments in the
spring to buy shares forward at a fixed price, with a total estimated loss
to the group of about DKr350m (Dollars 60.8m).
These commitments were not known to the directors and were not correctly
entered into Hafnia's books.
By July 2, the group's equity capital was a negative DKr450m. Over the
weekend auditors worked round the clock to see whether there were any other
hidden losses, which could have forced the group into receivership.
The auditors cleared the group, which meant its banks and the guarantors of
a vital new rights share issue to raise DKr2bn, continued to support Hafnia.
Subscriptions to the rights issue went ahead on Monday. 'We have now gained
the necessary time and freedom of manoeuvre,' said Mr Grue.
A bizarre aspect of the irregular share purchase commitments involved the
country's only stock exchange-listed soccer club, Brondby.
The club held 73 per cent of the shares in a small Copenhagen niche bank,
Interbank, but as the club's fortunes on the football field declined the
club decided to sell the shares. The option deal with Hafnia meant the club
was able to raise temporary finance while it tried to sell the shares.
The first that Hafnia's board knew about the deal, priced at DKr288m and
giving Hafnia a loss of DKr35m to DKr45m, was when the two broking firms
which had arranged the option called last week to ask for their money.
Yesterday, however, Hafnia informed the stock exchange of new
irregularities. Disclosure is obligatory for share holdings of over 5 per
cent, but Hafnia had not disclosed a 41.99 per cent holding in Dansk
Traelast, a large timber and building materials group.
The basic reason for the group's difficulties is not the share deals, but
the sorry story of what happened when the group tried to adapt itself to an
increasingly competitive European insurance market.
After failed merger talks with domestic rival Baltica in early 1990, Hafnia
mounted a hostile raid, buying up over one-third of the shares in Baltica
Holding. Baltica held out against the pressure, and when the price of
Baltica's shares fell, Hafnia's financial position was seriously weakened.
Hafnia's next move was to try to establish a Nordic insurance group. Last
winter, together with Norway's UNI Storebrand, it tried to gain control of
Sweden's Skandia, the largest of the Nordic insurance company's. This
venture, too, fell through.
In the process of acquiring 14.8 per cent of the shares in Skandia, Hafnia
Holding illegally borrowed money from its insurance subsidiaries, which
precipitated the dismissal of Mr Per Villum Hansen, the group's chief
executive, in April. These transactions, as well as the share dealings, are
subject to police investigations.
Over the past 18 months, Hafnia's share capital has slumped from DKr6bn to a
negative figure, mainly because of the decline in the value of the Baltica
and Skandia shareholdings and the cost of financing these investments. As
recently as December 31, the equity capital of the group was worth DKr3.1bn.
Crucial to Mr Grue and his chairman, Mr Holger Lavesen's, strategy for the
group is the disposal of the shares in Baltica and Skandia. Preliminary
discussions are taking place with Skandia, Baltica and Storebrand, but as
yet they do not have the character of negotiations, Mr Grue said.' We are
engaged in mutual discussions, but not negotiations. At the moment that is
all I can say.'

THE privatisation of GIO Australia, the New South Wales government's
financial services arm, closed yesterday with more than ADollars 1bn
(USDollars 746m) in over-subscriptions.
More than 128,000 applicants placed orders worth ADollars 2.22bn for the
ADollars 1.2bn offering, making the share issue one of the most keenly
sought after in the country's history.
A NSW government spokesman said yesterday more than 70 per cent of
successful subscribers would be allocated all shares sought, but
applications for large tranches would be scaled back.
Share certificates and refund cheques would be sent out within two weeks.
The Victorian government has approved the proposed sale of its State
Insurance Office to the GIO for about ADollars 300m.
Amcor, the diversified Melbourne-based paper group, plans to invest about
ADollars 26m in new corrugated box facilities in Western Australia and
Malaysia.
Mr Garry Ringwood, managing director of Amcor Fibre Packaging, said
yesterday a ADollars 15m plant would be built at Perth, replacing two
existing operations in the city, and two further plants would be built at
Penang and Johore Bahru in Malaysia at a cost of ADollars 11m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS for South Korea's listed companies fell slightly in the first six
months of 1992 compared with the same period in 1991, although sales pushed
ahead steadily, Reuter reports from Seoul.
According to preliminary studies by Daewoo Securities, covering 423 out of
the 528 companies whose fiscal year ends in December, sales for the first
half of 1992 amounted to Won77.07trillion (million million), up 14.9 per
cent on the Won67.08tr (Dollars 85bn) a year earlier.
Daewoo said the 95 companies not listed in the analysis were either concerns
declining to take part or finance houses. A total of 688 companies are
listed in South Korea, the remainder reporting their fiscal year at
end-June.
The report showed ordinary profits of the 423 companies in the first half of
1992 totalled Won1.50tr, down 0.4 per cent from Won1.51tr a year earlier;
net profits amounted to Won1.08tr, down 0.1 per cent from Won1.09tr.
Ordinary profits, usually before-tax, are total revenues minus total costs
incurred in normal business activities, while net profits, mostly after-tax,
also take into account extraordinary items.
The 339 manufacturing companies on the list accounted for Won44tr in sales
in the January-June period, a 12.3 per cent increase from Won39.17tr.
These manufacturers' ordinary profits fell 5.1 per cent to Won1.11tr in the
first half from Won1.17tr the previous year. Their net profits also slid 7.4
per cent to Won786.54bn from Won849.17bn.
In contrast to the worsened profitability in manufacturing, the remaining 84
non-manufacturers garnered Won33.07tr in sales in the first half, a hefty
rise of 18.5 per cent from Won27.92tr a year before.
Non-manufacturers' ordinary profits in the first half increased 15.9 per
cent to Won392.67bn from Won338.79bn.
Net profits earned by the non-manufacturing sector in the first half
totalled Won296.85bn, up 21.3 per cent from Won244.63bn, the Daewoo report
showed.
A Daewoo official attributed the lacklustre performance of manufacturers in
comparison with the others to previous heavy borrowings for capital
investment and weakened demand.
All of the companies except those in the water transport sector had sales
increases, with particularly good performances from the metal mining,
telecommunications and construction sectors.

'Basic denim continues to be the strongest performer,' said the company.
Its sales in the US rose by 22 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars

Both Europe and the Asia/Pacific regions fared well, the company commented,

OLYMPIA &amp; York has won an eight-month breathing space to renew its
participation in the vast Yerba Buena property development in San Francisco,
in exchange for giving up claims to the USDollars 26m it has already paid
towards the project.
An official of the San Francisco Redevelopment Authority said yesterday O&amp;Y
has been given until the end of February 1993 to find an investor willing to
pay amounts owing for the purchase of the land.
The ailing Toronto-based developer last week failed to make a Dollars 2m
payment. Under the original agreement with San Francisco, it would have
forfeited all rights to develop the site into a sprawling office and
entertainment centre.
O&amp;Y was seeking an equity partner for Yerba Buena even before its liquidity
crisis surfaced in February. The redevelopment authority official said the
agreement put O&amp;Y in the position of marketing the project on behalf of the
agency.
In return, O&amp;Y has agreed to terminate its original contract with San
Francisco and to release it from any future claims. This means that the
agency will stay outside any bankruptcy proceedings O&amp;Y may file for its US
business. So far, only its Canadian and UK operations are under the
protection of bankruptcy courts.
Bramalea, the ailing Canadian property developer controlled by Toronto's
Bronfman family, will reduce its CDollars 4.8bn debt by CDollars 106m as a
result of selling two shopping centres and 11 industrial properties.
The shopping centres have been bought by Trizec, Bramalea's parent company.
Trizec has taken measures in recent months to support Bramalea, including an
equity infusion and purchases of other properties.
Bramalea is in debt-restructuring talks with banks and other creditors. It
missed a CDollars 5m interest payment on a debenture last week.

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: French vote provides nexttest
for bond markets - Uneasy calm may be challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MONTH after Danish voters gave the thumbs down to the Maastricht treaty,
European Community bond markets have settled into an uneasy calm.
Whether that calm is justified, or whether a new wave of pessimism is about
to break over the European markets, could be tested in the coming weeks.
Two events this week suggest that it will not all be plain sailing - though
most bond investors doubt that the equilibrium that has settled on the
markets will be broken.
The first event was the hike in the Italian discount rate at the weekend,
prompted by a wave of speculation over a devaluation of the lira.
The second was sterling's abrupt exit yesterday from the notional narrow
band in which it had been trading in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The knee-jerk reaction to the Danish vote was a sharp widening in bond
yields between Germany and higher-yielding bond markets. It left
Euro-sceptics feeling vindicated.
'A while back, we put a discount on Europe,' said Mr Terence Prideaux, a
fund manager at Kemper Investment Management. 'It seemed to us to have
become 'politically correct' to be European, and fashions in political
correctness can easily change.'
The correction was sharp and quick. Spain and Italy were the biggest losers,
while UK government bonds - poised delicately in investors' minds between
the high-yielding and core ERM markets - largely escaped the rout.
That was phase one of the reaction to the Danish vote. The markets have
since recovered their equilibrium, and entered stage two: the long wait
until September 20, when French voters deliver their own verdict on the
Maastricht plans for European economic and monetary union (Emu).
'If the French say 'no' there will be a major sell-off in the
higher-yielders,' said Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income at Legal &amp;
General, the UK insurer.
'We got half of it with Denmark - we would get the other half with France.'
But although bond investors' thoughts are fixed firmly on the French
referendum, there is plenty that could yet disturb their summer reverie.
Bond yields in both Italy and Spain have continued to rise, relative to
Germany, as further doubts about the ability of those countries to meet the
convergence criteria laid down at Maastricht take hold.
The foreign exchange markets have begun to ask some demanding questions of
sterling, ending the three-month honeymoon that followed the re-election of
Mr John Major's Conservative government in early April. The convergence
among European bond markets achieved in the past two years may largely
remain intact, but there could be stiff tests ahead.
Italy faces the toughest challenge. Its political and economic problems are
largely internal, and the rosy haze has lifted from international investors'
eyes in the aftermath of the Danish vote, encouraging them to look more
closely at bond yields that had once looked to be treading an inexorable
path towards convergence.
'Maastricht was the first time we've had guidelines laid down against which
economies can be measured,' said Mr Prideaux.
Investors have begun to use the measuring rod mercilessly in Italy's case to
question whether the country's new government has the will and the ability
to tame its budget deficit.
Sentiment in the gilt market, meanwhile, changed quickly this week as
sterling came under pressure. Only last Friday, the Bank of England's
operations in the money market suggested that it was tinkering with the idea
of a rate cut.
'It was very badly timed,' says Mr Andrew Burtenshaw, head of fixed income
at Norwich Union, the UK composite insurer.
The rise in Italy's interest rates and a sharp fall in the US dollar against
the DM this week gave foreign exchange dealers the opportunity to test
sterling for the first time since the general election.
Most doubt that sterling will come under serious pressure - a view
apparently supported by the Bank of England's equanimity yesterday in the
face of the pound's slide.
Although the UK economy has shown little sign of improvement, the UK
government, with an election behind it, is under no immediate pressure to
generate a recovery through a devaluation. Nevertheless, the foreign
exchange markets are likely to cast a shadow over gilts in the near future.
This week's developments suggest that the European bond markets will
continue to reverberate from the Danish vote on Maastricht in the coming
months. But they offer little guide to the two big questions that will
determine the markets' direction over the longer term: will French voters
back Maastricht, and when will the Bundesbank allow German interest rates to
fall?

<TEXT>
SCHERING, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, is negotiating
with Viag, the industrial company, and an unnamed US group about the sale of
its industrial and organic chemicals subsidiaries.
Schering said talks were in their final stages and that a decision was
expected by early next month.
Industrial chemicals contributed DM454m (Dollars 298.6m) out of total group
sales last year of DM6.3bn and organic chemicals made up DM440m. Mr Giuseppe
Vita, the chairman of Schering, said the group planned to concentrate on
pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals in which it had 54 per cent and 28 per
cent of sales respectively in the first quarter of this year.
In a separate move, Schering also offered to sell its electroplating
division which had sales of DM329 last year.
Mr Vita said the divisions up for sale had performed successfully in
profitable niche markets but that these were too small to warrant expansion.
Schering is concentrating the research and development activities of its two
US pharmaceuticals subsidiaries at a former Chevron oil company site in
Richmond, California.
It is also investing a record DM700m this year in new research and
production facilities in Germany and North America.
Schering, like other companies with production facilities in Berlin, is
feeling the impact of reduced federal subsidies for the city such as lower
VAT and corporate taxes which are to be phased out by 1994. But the
company's high profitability has enabled it to easily absorb the extra
costs.

The deal offers the prospects of increased tourist business for both
companies at a time of tougher competition. Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's
chief executive, told yesterday's annual meeting that the airline's losses
in the first five months had already exceeded the figure for all of 1991 by
around DM100m (Dollars 65.7m); last year's group net loss was DM426m.
Lufthansa said last week its operating loss in this period was some DM600m
in the January-May period.
Lufthansa's holding in Lauda Air is being acquired for Sch200m (Dollars 19m)
through Condor, the charter subsidiary of the German airline. It is also
paying more than Sch50m for a 26 per cent stake in ITAS, a travel agency
which markets Lauda Air's services in Austria. ITAS is owned by Mr Basile
Varvaressos, a Greek travel operator who also has a stake in Lauda Air.
The deal comes after a difficult period for Lauda Air following the crash of
one of its aircraft over Thailand last June with the death of all 223
passengers and crew. The airline has six Boeing aircraft and has sought a
partner to strengthen its position against Austrian Airlines, the country's
main carrier, and secure its survival after air traffic liberalisation in
Europe.
At the annual meeting, Mr Weber said the deal would strengthen the German
airline's position in Austria considerably. Mr Lauda said the partnership
would give Lauda Air access to Lufthansa's reservation and maintenance
network and reduce sharply the costs of further route expansion.
He said Lauda Air and Lufthansa would offer jointly flights from Vienna to
Miami and to Los Angeles via Munich. The deal with Lufthansa will increase
Lauda's equity capital by 36 per cent and reduce its debt burden.
The German airline does not have an option to raise its holding further; 21
per cent of the Lauda shares are traded on the Vienna stock exchange.
Despite last year's setbacks, including the Gulf war, Lauda Air made a net
profit of Sch11m and is forecasting Sch40m for 1992. While its charter
business earns profits, its scheduled flights are in the red.

FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Linde to extend activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINDE, the diversified German industrial company, is to extend its fork-lift
truck and materials handling activities in southern Europe through acquiring
control of a subsidiary of Iveco, the truck manufacturer owned by Italy's
Fiat group.
The German company has agreed to buy 51 per cent of Fiat OM Carrelli
Elevatori, which employs 1,150 people and last year had a turnover of L242bn
(Dollars 214m). Fiat OM, which also owns the Pimespo Carrelli Elevatori
operation, has plants in Bari and Luzzara, near Verona.
Linde said the Italian company would retain its own identity and market its
own products in competition with those of the German group.
Last year, Linde posted a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to DM528m
(Dollars 315m). Its turnover was 14 per cent higher at DM6.9bn.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Budgens at Pounds 4.6m as recovery
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGENS, the small food retailing chain where institutional shareholders
last year installed new management, yesterday claimed to have 'won round one
in a fiercely competitive environment'.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.6m in the year to April 26,
compared with a loss of Pounds 14.7m in the previous year. Sales, excluding
VAT, were 6.8 per cent higher at Pounds 290.7m (Pounds 272.3m).
Mr John von Spreckelsen, chief executive, said: 'We have made significant
improvements on all fronts and in the face of strong competition. Current
sales development is satisfactory. The company has demonstrated its
resilience and the management continues with its medium-term plan to restore
acceptable levels of profitability.'
Sales grew less rapidly in the second half, reflecting increased competition
and a reduction in Sunday opening. Having been one of the pioneers of
seven-day opening, Budgens this year reduced the number of its 95 stores
which opened on Sundays after leading food chains followed suit.
Mr von Spreckelsen said distribution costs fell by Pounds 900,000 to Pounds
16.1m, despite higher sales and levels of service to the stores. This had
been mainly achieved by increasing the efficiency of its distribution depot.
Better buying disciplines had resulted in a modest improvement in gross
trading margins. The group hoped to secure further benefits from joining a
retail buying consortium under the auspices of the National Independent
Supermarket Association.
Since the year-end, Budgens has opened two new stores and will refurbish 70
of its existing outlets during the current year, all financed out of
cashflow. The group is on track to introduce a full electronic-point-of-sale
system by 1994.
Trading profits more than doubled to Pounds 6.51m (Pounds 2.96m). Interest
payments fell from Pounds 4.85m to Pounds 2.54m, reflecting a fall in
gearing to 22 per cent from 40 per cent at the time of last July's
refinancing.
Earnings per share, after a reduced tax charge, were 3.5p, compared with a
losses of 13.3p. On a fully-taxed basis, the earnings would have been 2.2p.
Budgens said it would not be appropriate to pay a dividend until it could
report further improvements in profitability.
COMMENT
So far, so good, but is there a long-term future for Budgens? That reaction,
and doubt, encapsulated the City's response to these figures. Mr von
Spreckelsen admits he felt the group was 'a sitting duck' 12 to 18 months
ago, because of its high prices and limited range. He is now confident the
stores are back on a recovery track, with store managers being encouraged to
respond quickly and flexibly to local competition. There is no doubt more
scope for improvement this year, but big stores such as Sainsbury and Tesco
are increasingly looking away from superstores and back to the high street.
The house broker is predicting annual profits of Pounds 8.5m and a 20 per
cent tax rate, which would put the shares, unchanged yesterday at 41p, on a
heavily discounted prospective multiple of 10. Other analysts take a more
cautious view. Investors looking for a recovery play should be able to find
companies facing less ferocious competition.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: DTI and Alan Lewis settle Yorkshire wool
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE which has rumbled around the Yorkshire Dales almost as
relentlessly as Emmerdale Farm looks finally to have been settled following
agreement between Mr Alan Lewis, the wool scouring supremo, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
The DTI has toned down earlier demands that three wool scouring lines, which
clean and de-grease wool, should be sold following Mr Lewis' 1990 purchase
of Jarmain &amp; Son in Huddersfield.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled last year that the takeover was
anti-competitive since it gave companies controlled by Mr Lewis more than 50
per cent of the scouring market.
Mr Heseltine has now relented and agreed one of the lines should be
mothballed for a year while the other two should be sold or closed down in
18 months.
The DTI said the measures would reduce Mr Lewis' capacity and allow other
scourers into the market.
Mr Lewis seemed reflective. 'A sensible compromise has been reached,
although you're never totally happy with these things' he said.
But there will be 'a number' of redundancies from the mothballed line, which
is in Huddersfield, he said.
Finding a buyer for the other two could also prove difficult, since they are
not in operation and one is in poor condition.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Gardiner falls to Pounds 1m as recession
bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDINER GROUP, the distributor of security and surveillance products,
yesterday reported a sharp drop in first half profits as recession continued
to hit volume and margins.
Mr Yashar Turgut, chief executive, said that the recession meant this year
would be 'a bit of a non-event' for Gardiner, but that the strategy of
developing its dominant European position in security systems distribution
had not altered.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to April 30 fell from Pounds 3.45m to
Pounds 1.04m on sales up 28 per cent at Pounds 36.6m.
The result was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 479,000 to cover the
cost of reorganisation, redundancy and compensation for the early departure
of the finance director.
He resigned after it emerged last year, shortly after the company had made
bullish trading statements to the City, that the accounts had been based on
some over-optimistic assumptions about margins.
The poor results follow a traumatic period for the shares after the group
reported pre-tax profits of only Pounds 6.03m last year, significantly below
City expectations. The shares have fallen from a peak of 69p last September
to yesterday's close of 19 1/2 p.
Part of the increase in sales came from the acquisition of Multi-Video
Distributors and AW Alarm System, bought last year as part of the strategy
to reduce dependence on the UK intruder market and enter the closed circuit
television business.
Excluding these acquisitions, sales still grew 13.6 per cent, but at the
expense of lower margins.
Earnings per share fell from 2.56p to 0.72p, but the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.47p.
The UK intruder alarm market showed no volume growth, but Gardiner
maintained market share, albeit at reduced margins.
In Spain, the group suffered from what Mr Thomas Buffett, chairman, called
the discounting policies of certain overseas manufacturers.
In Benelux, however, sales and profits rose while in Scandinavia the group
benefited from the acquisition of AW Alarm System.

<TEXT>
HARRISON Industries, the supplier of doors, control equipment and castings
which was acquired by Antares in a reverse takeover last December, yesterday
reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 908,000 for the 15-month period to
end-March 1992.
Mr Kenneth Hodgson, chairman, said a complete review of the group had been
undertaken and all previous Antares activities had either been sold or
discontinued.
The results for the period reflected the completion of the reorganisation,
said Mr Hodgson, and represented a marked improvement on the pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.49m for 1990.
Turnover was Pounds 17.7m against Pounds 7.58m for the previous year.
There is no final dividend so the total for the 15-month period is 1.25p
(3.25p).

Everards, the family-owned independent brewer of Tiger and Old Original

per cent to Pounds 144,000.
The outcome for the six months to March 28 compared with Pounds 298,000 at
the same stage of the previous year.
Turnover improved to Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 15m) and directors of this
Leicester-based concern stated that sales had improved further since the
period-end. They anticipate profits for the current year to show an
improvement on the Pounds 387,000 recorded in the 12 months to September 28
1991.
Earnings per share emerged at 6.1p (9.5p). The interim dividend goes up to
6.5p (6.2p).

<TEXT>
A 22 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 806,166,
was announced by Gibbon Lyons Group, the USM-quoted printing ink, dyestuffs
and paints company, for the year to March 31.
Mr Michael Gibbon, chairman, said the group had managed to sustain sales at
Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 23.1m) 'in spite of fierce competition and price
cutting'.
A wages freeze and further staff reductions had been made, but profits had
been affected by a need for further provisions for bad and doubtful debts,
he said, including more than Pounds 100,000 in France.
Earnings per share fell from 10.5p to 4.8p and the proposed final dividend
is cut to 3p for a 5p (6p) total on increased capital.
An encouraging start to the current year had been made, Mr Gibbon said,
partly due to the introduction of new projects and efforts to eliminate
lossmaking areas.

BESPAK, a maker of valves and other engineering components, increased
pre-tax profit by 57 per cent, from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 6.92m, in the

The contribution from the original group was in line with forecast at Pounds

Mr Bob King, chairman, said Tenax had significantly increased Bespak's

Group turnover rose 31 per cent to Pounds 38.8m (Pounds 29.6m), with Tenax
supplying Pounds 3.1m.
Earnings per share came to 24.8p, against 20.4p after adjustment for two

The final dividend is 5.5p to make 9p (8p).

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: French Connection dives Pounds 8m into the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH CONNECTION Group, the USM-quoted clothing wholesaler and retailer
which has recently undergone substantial changes of management and
activities, plunged from profits of Pounds 57,000 into pre-tax losses of
Pounds 7.95m in the year to January 31 1992.
Despite the 'entirely unsatisfactory' results, the group won the continued
support of its bankers about six weeks ago. 'We showed them a budget they
could live with and a strategy they could understand,' Mr George Wardale,
chairman, said. At the year-end bank borrowings stood at Pounds 6.7m,
against shareholders' funds of Pounds 3m.
Of the Pounds 49.9m (Pounds 56.7m) turnover, only Pounds 3.1m had been
contributed by Bukta Connection, the specialist company making replica
football strips and not part of French Connection's core that last month was
sold to its management.
After exceptional costs of Pounds 2.93m - Pounds 1.4m in respect of
provisions against stock losses in Bukta and Pounds 1m for losses of the
group's discontinued operations - and before interest payable of Pounds
1.08m (Pounds 1.24m), operating losses were Pounds 6.87m (profits Pounds
1.3m). Mr Wardale said some Pounds 2.5m of these losses derived from Bukta.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 2.19m related to trading losses of - and the
loss on the sale of - Bukta. Losses per share emerged at 40.6p (earnings
1.4p).
Having passed the interim dividend, the final is also omitted. Previously a
total of 2.7p was paid.
Mr Wardale, who was previously chief executive of Highland Spring, the
bottled water company, for six years, said that recessions show up the
cracks in companies and 'our cracks were large'.
Apart from an inability to manage well, he said, the previous management had
become involved in non-essential parts of the business. Bukta had branched
out into shell suits which it had not been able to move.
French Connection (Germany) was closed in January 1990. In September and
November respectively, Mr Michael Shen, group chief executive, and Mr
Stephen Malme, finance director, were dismissed.
to Mr Wardale this April and in Mr Wardale's words 'has moved back to centre
stage concentrating on the product side' as chief executive. Mr John Ellis
has been brought in as finance director.
Mr Shen and Mr Malme won damages and an apology from the group for wrongful
dismissal and its allegations of 'gross misconduct'. Mr Shen was also paid
Pounds 1m owed him by the group.
Mr Wardale said that, coming into a fight that had already started, he
decided that 'the interests of the group and its shareholders were not
served by the continuation of the dispute'. He felt that the whole board
held 'common responsibility for the not very distinguished performance'.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: SB to dispose of its personal care products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, is looking to dispose of its low-margin personal care products.
The company said yesterday it wanted to focus on health products, like
pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter non-prescription medicines and
health-related drinks such as Horlicks, Ribena and Lucozade.
Ideally it would like to swap the personal care brands for OTC
pharmaceutical brands. However, it would be willing to pay cash at the same
time, as the pharmaceuticals business was highly cash generative and
successful OTC brands were difficult to create.
The company refused to say which of its brands were available for sale. Its
personal care products include Brylcreem, Vosene and Badedas. However, it
treats oral hygiene products and feminine brands as OTC products.
SB said it was already in negotiations with a number of companies but
refused to identify them. The move would be part of a wider reorganisation
of the consumer brands business, it said. The personal care products
businesses made sales last year of about Pounds 300m; the OTC operations
generated revenues of Pounds 700m in the same period.
'There are plenty of sensible reasons for strengthening the OTC side,' said
Mr Mark Brewer, pharmaceuticals analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing. 'The
problem is it's difficult to imagine anyone wanting to swap their OTC
products for personal care brands.'
Most pharmaceutical groups are building up their OTC businesses. One reason,
explains Mr Brewer, is to compensate for lost sales of ethical prescription
products when they lose their patents.
SB is looking to gain a licence in the US to sell Tagamet, its best-selling
ethical medicine, over the counter. The drug, used to treat ulcers, comes
off-patent in the US in 1994.
OTC brands based on former prescription products can command higher prices.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks falls 9% as recession
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWMAN TONKS, Europe's biggest supplier of door, window and electrical
fittings to the building industry, reported a 9 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 7.31m to Pounds 6.62m for the half year to April 30.
Mr Geoff Gahan, chief executive, said the fall occurred against a background
of the worst UK building recession in history. He predicted the downturn
would continue for the rest of the year. Sales were static at Pounds 109m.
About half of the group's sales are based overseas. Without this
geographical spread Mr Gahan said the results would have been 'significantly
worse'. The UK workforce was reduced by a further 5 per cent leading to the
loss of 250 jobs.
US companies, particularly NT Falcon, the California-based lock
manufacturer, increased sales and profits.
The group has had to pay an additional Pounds 273,000 for recently acquired
NT Shapland, the largest commercial timber door manufacturer, because its
pre-tax profits for the year to end-March exceeded expectations.
It made Pounds 1.7m against a forecast of Pounds 1.55m. Mr Gahan said he was
'delighted' to have paid the extra money for Shapland because of its profit
growth.
Another recent acquisition, Moller &amp; Auster, the lock distributor and
security systems group, has been integrated into the group's distribution
business in Norway to form NT Moller Undall.
Mr Gahan said the group would continue to review acquisition opportunities.
'Over the last six months we have had more offers than at any time over the
last few years.'
A reduced interest charge of Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 570,000) was due to the
fall in borrowings from Pounds 20m to Pounds 14m, representing gearing of 16
per cent.
The interim dividend is maintained at 3.8p, uncovered by earnings of 3.5p
(4.55p).

JAGUAR is taking the first steps to set up distribution and sales networks
for its luxury cars in eastern Europe.
It expects initial sales to be small, but is anxious to establish a foothold
in the region in the expectation of significant future growth. The company
also indicated that it was wary of growing Japanese manufacturers' interest
in the area.
In twin moves announced yesterday, Jaguar has appointed a distributor in
Poland and is setting up its first service dealership in east Germany. It is
also assessing how best to establish a presence in two other key east
European countries, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Jaguars are to be imported and sold in Poland by Jaguar Poland, a subsidiary
set up by Overseas Marketing Corporation, a London-based independent
Anglo-Polish trading company which already has extensive experience of
automotive retailing in eastern Europe, including that of cars produced by
Ford, Jaguar's parent.
Initially, it is to have premises in Warsaw, which are expected to become
operational within the next three months. First year sales are expected to
be only 20 to 25 cars.
However, 'it is important that we quickly establish a presence in these
markets', Mr Roger Puttnam, sales and marketing director, said. 'They will
undoubtedly grow in the future and as their economies expand so will the
demand for luxury cars'.
Jaguar's service dealership is located at Freital, near Dresden, and is the
first of five sales and service outlets planned to be operational within the
next 12 to 18 months.
Unlike the Polish operation, they are to be set up and controlled by a
wholly-owned Jaguar subsidiary, Jaguar Deutschland.

group
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKSON International, the specialist chemicals group, yesterday announced
the acquisition of Angus Fine Chemicals, based in the Irish Republic, for
IPounds 24.1m (Pounds 22.4m).
The acquisition will be financed by the issue of 12.75m new shares, placed
by Smith New Court yesterday at 175p each. Holders will be free to claw back
shares at the same price on a 1-for-12.57 basis.
The acquisition will give Hickson an entry into the supply of fine chemicals
to pharmaceuticals companies, an area of the fine chemicals market where it
lacks a substantial presence.
Mr Michael Rowley, finance director, said the market for these fine
chemicals was growing by 5 per cent a year, but was confident it could
expand between 6 and 8 per cent.
The group had considered organic investment at its Castleford plant but had
chosen the acquisition route for a number of reasons, including the chance
to buy a plant that was already approved by the US Federal Drug
Administration.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of 40m Abbey National shares, lying unclaimed since the bank's
stock market flotation in July 1989, will be announced today.
The unclaimed shares are currently worth about Pounds 125m. They represent
about 3 per cent of shares issued by the group to its former members when it
shed building society status and became a bank, each member receiving 100
shares worth 131p each.
Abbey National said yesterday that as three years had passed since the
flotation, it was now able to take action.
It did not indicate what the action would be but it could dispose of some of
the remainder by placing them with a charity or selling them in the market.
It is unlikely to favour placing a large number of its shares on the market
at one time.
Former members of the building society who have not already done so will be
entitled to claim their shares for a further three year period.

FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MTM to reorganise with staff cuts and
Pounds 30m disposal plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the troubled chemicals group, yesterday announced a board reshuffle,
organisational restructuring and redundancies.
Mr Ken Schofield, recently-appointed chief executive, also said the company
expected to raise between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m from disposals, although
he admitted it was a tough time to sell businesses.
The reorganisation follows pre-tax losses of Pounds 20.6m last year and the
resignation of Mr Richard Lines, executive chairman, and Mr Tom Baxter,
finance director.
Mr Schofield said he had three businesses that generated 35 per cent of
sales and 85 per cent of profits. He planned to base the company around
these three, which included Hardwicke in the US, the Lancaster research
operations, and the AP speciality chemicals business at Leek in the UK.
'Otherwise we have a lot of non-performing businesses,' he said. 'There is
no reason why we should be in intermediates for agrochemicals, specialised
coatings or packaging. We need to keep it simple and end up with a structure
that we can manage.'
He added that he expected to dispose of the specialised coatings operations
within the next few days. Following the disposals he expects to have reduced
the workforce from 1,100 to 600.
In addition the numbers employed at the Rudby Hall headquarters near
Middlesbrough will be cut from 44 to 16. These changes should achieve
savings of about Pounds 1m this year and Pounds 3m next. They will cost
Pounds 500,000 this year.
Mr Schofield said the company had made available to the Serious Fraud Office
the report from Binder Hamlyn, the group's auditors, on how MTM had come
into its present difficulties. However, the SFO had indicated it did not
believe the matter warranted its attention.
Meanwhile, MTM announced it was restructuring its operations into three
divisions: research chemicals, fine chemicals and performance chemicals. Mr
Schofield said this would give greater orientation towards profit centres.
The company said Mr Kenneth Carter would join MTM this month from British
Fuels as finance director. He will also be responsible for the performance
chemical division. Mr Neville Newson, former head of European operations,
has left the company and the board. Mr James Freiderichsen takes over the
fine chemicals division and Mr Alec Ingram assumes responsibility for the
research chemicals division.

FT  09 JUL 92 / French government report levels criticisms at Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish partner of Renault, the French carmaker, yesterday came
under fire in a French government-commissioned report, a summary of which
was leaked by a Renault union official.
The study, by SRI International, a Californian technical consultancy,
criticises Volvo's car division for losing market share in the US; for
having out of date plants; for inefficiently managing its modern facilities;
and also for failing fully to adapt just-in-time stock control methods.
Renault said that the report was only a working document and that it
reflected neither its opinion nor that of Volvo.
The study was commissioned by Mrs Edith Cresson, the former prime minister,
who was critical of the Volvo alliance and was anxious at the Swedish
carmaker's joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese car group, in
the Netherlands.
However, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, who succeeded Mr Cresson, is content to let
Renault and Volvo deepen their alliance.
The two-year-old partnership has led to substantial savings for both sides,
through sharing important components and the economies of scale achieved by
joint purchasing. The partners have spoken of a possible merger.
The SRI study says that Renault faces 'major risks' in deepening its
alliance with Volvo. It warns Renault not to underestimate the changes
needed in Volvo's product range and production lines, the human resources
required to bring these changes about, and the fast response that Volvo has
to make to the collapse of the US market. The study also estimates that
Volvo will make an operating loss of between SKr995m (Pounds 95m) and
SKr1.3bn this year, after last year's SK1.16bn operating loss.
The study admires Volvo's quality image and its distribution networks, but
warns that the safety and dependability of its vehicles are becoming
standard qualities in the car industry. Volvo needs three models to keep its
distributors going, but only has the means to develop one, the study claims.
The document may fuel French union discontent. 'There is a real danger in
pursuing this accord,' claimed Mr Gerard Muteau, an official from the
Communist-led CGT and Renault administrative board member, who released the
summary.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Dixons falls 14% and sees no upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIXONS, the UK's biggest electrical retailing chain which is widely viewed
in the City as being one of the first beneficiaries of any economic
recovery, said yesterday sales had slipped back in recent weeks as it
reported a 14 per cent fall in annual profits to Pounds 70.3m.
The company's shares shed 9p to 214p on the news that there were 'no real
signs in the UK and US of any sustained economic upturn' and helped
precipitate a weakening of many other stocks in the stores sector.
In January, Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, described how consumers in
some parts of the country 'were bouncing with enthusiasm' with sales
increases running in the 'mid-teens'.
Yesterday he said sales had weakened over the past nine weeks but were still
running 'slightly ahead' of last year. 'We are quite shattered that the
trend has turned off its line,' he said.
In the year to May 2, however, Dixons recorded a continued resurgence of
profitability in the UK, where it runs the Dixons, Currys and Supasnaps
chains. UK operating profits rose one third to Pounds 71.9m on sales 11 per
cent higher at Pounds 1.2bn.
Dixons said the improvement largely stemmed from the greater operating
efficiencies from its growing portfolio of edge-of-town Currys superstores.
Fourteen more were opened during the year bringing the total to 115, while
43 Currys high street stores were shut.
Sales of consumer electronics, household appliances and photographic
equipment remained weak but computer games, business computers and
camcorders showed good gains.
The UK profits were inflated by the inclusion of Pounds 10m from the release
of excess provisions from its product warranties.
Dixons' Silo chain in the US fell into a Pounds 16.9m loss (from Pounds 3.5m
profit) on sales of Pounds 580.9m.
The company's UK and European property interests contributed profits of
Pounds 4.1m (down from Pounds 11m). Total group turnover rose 10 per cent to
Pounds 1.86bn. Dixons swallowed an Pounds 11.2m extraordinary charge
relating mainly to provisions for discontinuing UK property development.
Earnings per share fell from 12.6p to 9.5p. A final dividend of 4.4p lifted
the total 3 per cent to 6p.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Letter: British Rail should concentrate on improving track
utilisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr F ARTHUR S FRANCIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There may be many good reasons for subsidising British Rail but Richard
Tomkins' suggestion ('A long haul to privatisation', July 1) that it should
be done in order to level the playing field between rail and road is not the
strongest.
For the past 16 years I have commuted between Oxford and London. Most of
this has been done by train. Occasionally I have used the bus. British
Rail's most significant cost problem is exemplified by the view from the
window of the Oxford-London bus at Hanger Lane in the morning rush-hour. As
the bus crawls nose-to-tail on a jam-packed, three-lane road one has several
minutes to observe acres of empty railway track. Only occasionally does one
see a train making use of this expensive facility. Similarly, one can stand
on Reading or Didcot stations for many minutes at a time without seeing a
moving train. Meanwhile the M4, a few miles away, carries a constant stream
of traffic.
Railway officials have defended to me this low track utilisation with talk
of congested nodes and signalling constraints. Heathrow airport, by
contrast, dealing with even faster moving traffic, sends aircraft down
runways only seconds apart.
I am sure we should continue to support, and subsidise, British Rail. But
one effective way of reducing expensive track costs must surely be to
increase the utilisation of that track. I have a dream that I shall one day
return to Oxford to find short, comfortable trains leaving for Paddington
six times an hour (the present level of provision by the bus services) and
costing me substantially less than five times the bus fare (the present
price differential at peak times).

FT  09 JUL 92 / Letter: Total value better than earnings per share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GARETH STAINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The view of Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards
Board, is that earnings per share is a poor gauge of underlying corporate
performance ('Shareholder group calls for changes to stock option plans',
July 6) and Lex observes ('UK accountancy', July 6) that market multiples
are meaningless if EPS is recognised as unreliable.
The most direct historical measure of medium-term corporate financial
performance is the total value (dividends and capital growth) that the
company has created for its shareholders.
Shareholder value creation can readily be measured as the return on Pounds
100 invested in the company between two dates. The performance can be shown
relative to the All Share or specific sector indices; it can be compared
directly on the same basis with competitors' performance; and it can also be
adjusted for the relative riskiness of a share.
A few companies in the US use shareholder value creation as their prime
performance measure (eg Quaker Oats). It has always been a source of some
amazement to me that it is never used in UK company reports. It is, after
all, the direct measure of the performance that interests the shareholder,
and for which he invests.
A well-developed set of concepts and much practical experience now allow
companies to link economic value creation within the business with the
creation of shareholder value. It is therefore possible to integrate this
external measure of corporate financial performance with key internal
measures of company performance covering both the profit and loss account
and the balance sheet. Value-based management thus has a comprehensiveness
and coherence that EPS is unable to achieve.
Economic value is created by the effective exploitation of sustained
competitive advantage. Value is driven by cash returns which consistently
exceed the company's cost of capital. The new approach escapes the emphasis
on short-termism which has been characteristic of management's preoccupation
with EPS growth.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Letter: Banks can mitigate high cross-border transaction
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R C BULLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Alan Mackie (Letters, July 7) has reason for complaining about the
cost of his Anglo-French transaction when he had a Pounds 180 cheque cashed
on a French bank. However, for banks to handle one-off transfers without
notice involves them in much manual handling.
Perhaps if Mr Mackie had enquired beforehand about the most cost-effective
way of making this transaction, he would have avoided at least some of the
cost he actually bore.
Opening up the Automated Clearing Houses (the equivalent of BACS in the UK)
around the EC to all EC-registered banks, as should happen when the Second
Banking Directive is implemented on January 1 1993, will enable banks to
improve their cross-border payment services quite markedly, at least for
repeat business. In fact, several UK banks, Barclays included, have already
done this, using ACHs for more effective transmission.
Perhaps because cross-border payments form such a small part of the overall
payments made up by most individuals and businesses, many people do not know
how best to use the banks. It is usually worth inquiring before making the
transaction. At the very least, the admittedly steep costs can be revealed,
if there is no way of avoiding them.

<TEXT>
THE WELFARE OF CITIZENS
Edited by Anna Coote
Institute for Public Policy Research/Rivers Oram Press.
Pounds 22 hardback, Pounds 9.95 paperback.
200 pages
Labour's fourth election defeat in a row has inspired a new bout of
introspection on the political left in Britain. Central planning is
discredited; state ownership has few friends; liberalisation and
deregulation are more in tune with the spirit of the age. What can social
democrats and democratic socialists offer to challenge the apparent triumph
of liberal capitalism?
Some claim that the answer lies in constitutional reform, terrain already
well staked out by the Liberal Democrats. Others follow the German social
democrats in seeing the environment as the new battleground between
unrestrained market forces and human development.
This intriguing book from the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy
Research (IPPR) suggests a third option: a new form of citizenship based not
just on democratic rights but also on economic and social rights. The
contributors examine the case for such rights and explore the scope for
embodying them in a legally enforceable charter.
The argument runs as follows: political freedoms are meaningless if all they
amount to is 'freedom from' interference by others. The only purpose of such
negative freedoms is what they permit individuals to do. But if individuals
lack the resources to make use of their political freedom, they are not free
at all. Creating 'freedom to' requires rights to health, education and
welfare so that individuals can use their political rights to pursue
worthwhile goals.
The case for positive rights is not, of course, new. Mr Roy Hattersley, the
deputy leader of the opposition Labour party, has used it for the past
decade as the centrepiece for his arguments in favour of greater equality.
But it is given a new twist in the IPPR book with the argument advanced by
Professor Raymond Plant, chair of Labour's commission on electoral reform,
that if welfare rights are to be meaningful, they must be conferred upon
individuals who should be given powers to enforce them.
This marks a significant break with the left tradition that welfare should
be provided collectively through the state. Professor Plant accepts the
'public choice' critique which focuses on the alarming tendency of
'democratically accountable' services to be captured by their producers. He
is prepared to consider a wide range of alternative ways of enforcing rights
to welfare, which empower individual citizens to make their own choices
within a framework which guarantees economic and social rights.
One option would be to embody such rights in law - to prescribe basic
standards of health care, social security and housing for example. Attempts
to create legal entitlements to economic rights are notoriously difficult to
pull off, however. International charters which make the attempt are
inevitably vague about the detail and well-larded with exclusion clauses
('as resources allow', and the like). They also have a tendency to provide
at least as much work for lawyers as help for the disadvantaged.
The alternative strategy is to go for procedural rights - rights to fair
treatment for individuals who use welfare services. This approach clearly
attracts the IPPR, which devotes much of the book to devising principles of
procedural fairness and applying them in specific services such as social
work and health care. The discussion is fascinating, particularly in the
detail - for example, how to reconcile the rights of children and parents in
child-abuse cases.
However this emphasis on procedural rights looks very similar to what Mr
John Major, the UK prime minister, is up to with his Citizen's Charter.
That, after all, is an attempt to provide a set of such rights for users of
public services, including information about quality targets and
compensation when things go wrong. Is the IPPR's approach any different?
The book argues that Mr Major's system of charters is a cosmetic attempt to
hide deficiencies in underfunded public services. More tellingly, it says
that the provision of essential public services cannot be reduced to the
sort of simple consumer model envisaged by some supporters of the Citizen's
Charter. Collective action is needed to decide on levels of provision and to
ensure equal access to health, education and welfare.
But perhaps the truth is more prosaic: we are all charterists now. Outside
the ranks of a few die-hard libertarians, agreement is widespread that there
are core public services which cannot be privatised and must be funded by
the exchequer.
In the absence of appropriate incentives, centrally-funded services will
undervalue the needs of the users. Charters which give the users rights to
bang on the table and extract compensation for bad service are one way of
redressing the balance. Whether they provide Labour with the means to seize
back the initiative on the welfare state is another matter.

Olympia and York is not only one in trouble because of building schemes in

went into receivership during the building of Canary Wharf, most because
they could not get their money from the big boys for work they had
completed. The programme investigates the growing problem of late payment to
sub-contractors (7.30 BBC2).
If there have already been full-length profiles of Ross Perot on British
television I have missed them. This Week fills the gap with a portrait of
the Dallas businessman who is running neck and neck with George Bush and
Bill Clinton in the race for the US presidency, though he has not even
declared his candidacy (8.30 ITV). Wildlife Showcase documents the return of
three dolphins, previously held in dolphinariums, to the sea off the West
Indies (8.30 BBC2).
In True Stories a collection of remarkable short films about life in
post-communist St Petersburg, shown earlier this year on C4, is edited into
a single 90-minute programme. Much of the time it seems as though a war is
going on, without anybody knowing who the enemy is (9.30).

<TEXT>
The Australian Ballet has come a long way in 30 years. The tour which now
brings the troupe to the Coliseum is more than mere celebration: it speaks
of a confidence in the company's identity which is well founded, and it is
an assertion of the progress the ensemble has made during the decade of
Maina Gielgud's directorate.
The decision to open the season on Tuesday night with Coppelia was wise. The
production is intelligent, fresh, respectful enough of tradition not to
offend against the work's own history, and it provides a flattering setting
for the company's style and its artists. The classic dance is a discipline,
not a strait-jacket, and as we see it with the Australian Ballet, it has a
vitality quite as impressive as the academic rectitude of the dancers'
manner.
The performers look assured, alert to the possibilities of movement, and
they bring an enthusiasm, a full tone to step and drama, that is entirely
right in this dear ballet. They are, and this seems to me most significant,
a coherent ensemble, whose dancing is strong, and identifiably Australian in
its brightness of purpose.
This Coppelia was set by Dame Peggy van Praagh, founder of the company. With
great good sense, she entrusted the production to a theatre director, George
Ogilvie, who shaped the action, integrated character and movement, without
destroying the identity of the traditional text. There results a dramatic
logic - 'In Coppelia?', marvels the balletomane - that touches each
character, each scene.
Narrative winds skilfully through general dances; bravura moments spring
easily from mimetic action; there is even, in the second act in Coppelius'
house, a frisson of Hoffmannesque mystery.
The greatest compliment that can be paid to this staging is to say that it
does not minimise the beauty and emotional felicity of Delibes' miraculous
score - which, with a couple of additions from Sylvia and La Source, sounded
well under Ormsby Wilkins' baton. Design by Kristian Frederikson -
attractively traditional, and with enchanting costumes - sets the scene in
the Galicia of nineteenth century operetta, and is very fetching.
Coppelia is a ballet crammed with good things, more vivid and more beguiling
than managements often seem to believe. Its story is serious in requiring
young love to prove itself against the lure of alchemy.
Its choreography - in spanking national ensembles and in classical numbers -
demands wit, prowess, an unfailing sense of style. These challenges the
Australian Ballet handsomely meets.
Miranda Coney sparkled as Swanilda, and pouted, and dealt joyously with
virtuoso demands. David McAllister was her Frantz, playing and dancing with
an eager verve. Colin Peasley was a Coppelius entirely serious, and in the
role's darkest moment at the end of Act 2 - the old alchemist surrounded by
his gesticulating dolls, clutching the inanimate Coppelia - a figure of
tragedy.
These are admirable performances, and they are framed by a company having
the right dash for the czardas and mazurka, and a disciplined and
well-mannered style for the classic ensembles (in which the men also get a
chance to shine). In this happy masterpiece, the Australian Ballet made a
happy - and impressive - start to the season.
The Australian Ballet season continues at the London Coliseum (071) 836
3161, with varied programming, until July 18. Tour sponsors include Qantas
and the Australian National Line

Ninety years old and still game for a song: Hugues Cuenod, Swiss tenor
extraordinaire, celebrated his 90th birthday last month with a special
concert in his home town of Vevey on Lake Geneva.
With Cuenod, the years do not seem to count. Here was a spry man of tall,
upright posture, elegant and witty, occasionally extravagant in manner,
keeping his audience amused with a few select stories and songs, and
generously sharing the stage with pupils and friends.
Cuenod is the sole surviving link with a whole era of composers, performers
and teachers who helped shape 20th century musical history.
He premiered works by Honegger and Milhaud in the 1930s, was a regular
recital partner of Clara Haskil and Dinu Lipatti, created the part of Sellem
in The Rake's Progress in 1951 and was a noted interpreter of Schutz,
Monteverdi and baroque composers long before they returned to fashion.
British audiences know him primarily from his Glyndebourne days (more than
400 performances).
In recent years he has won admirers among a younger generation at master
classes in Aldeburgh and Manchester - and it is good to know he intends to
return.
His birthday concert, attended by le tout Vevey and televised throughout
Switzerland, was a pot-pourri designed to appeal to the widest possible
audience, and yet it summed up the man and his artistry.
On stage, Cuenod has never pretended to be anything more than a character
tenor but his gifts go much further. A selection of Apollinaire songs by
Poulenc, followed by Babar the elephant, demonstrated undiminished powers of
characterisation and timing.
His unaccompanied rendering of a fragment of Orlando di Lasso found him
still capable of a long vocal line.
Like Peter Pears, Cuenod's trademark has always been his command of style
and expression: what appealed was not so much the timbre of the voice, but
what he did with it.
Judging by the rest of the Vevey programme, Cuenod remains young at heart.
There were interludes of soul, jazz and contemporary dance. Michel Dalberto
played Debussy, Nikita Magaloff a Faure Impromptu. Nicolai Gedda offered
Lensky's aria, revealing technique and artistry unimpaired, even if the tone
has lost its bloom.
The event was staged in Vevey's attractive little theatre, which after lying
shut for the best part of 20 years has just been given a SFr15m renovation
(a quarter paid by Nestle).
The other outstanding end-of-season event in western Switzerland was Attila
at the Grand Theatre, Geneva, with Samuel Ramey and Elizabeth Connell (which
was broadcast live on Radio 3).
Ramey's prowess in the title role has helped re-establish this opera on both
sides of the Atlantic over the past 10 years.
His voice has the agile muscularity to cover up Verdi's fitful inspiration -
the cabaletta to his dramatic first act aria brought the house down, a rare
accolade in Geneva - and he looks so good, with bare breast, pony-tale and
fur cloak, like an amalgam of Noble Savage and Genghis Khan.
But with Ramey, physique and voice are everything: despite his vast
improvement as an actor, he still lacks the animal magnetism of a Raimondi.
Jerome Savary's production, a succession of picturesque early Romantic
landscapes first seen last year in Milan, offered an equally flattering
platform for Miss Connell, who has now unmistakably settled into her prime
in the dramatic soprano repertory.
Her high-voltage Odabella (which is to be repeated alongside Ramey at Covent
Garden next season) has everything this fearsome role needs - grandezza,
confident, declamatory attack and pearl-like mastery of line and decoration
 -and she moves remarkably well on stage.
With strong performances from Paolo Coni as Ezio and Michael Sylvester as
Foresto, and lusty contributions from chorus and orchestra under Gabriele
Ferro, Attila came across as an exciting foretaste of Macbeth and later
operas, laced with the irresistible vitality of youth.

BATMAN RETURNS (12) Empire, MGMs West End
THE BUTCHER'S WIFE (12) MGMs West End
SLEEPWALKERS (18) Odeon West End
STEPKIDS (PG) Odeon Mezzanine, MGM Tottenham Ct Rd
PEPI, LUCI, BOM. . .(18) Metro
It is an interesting title: Batman Returns. Does it refer to the caped
crusader's comeback or the series' box-office revenue to date? The returns
from Batman 1, as we know, were roughly equivalent to the gross national
product of Phrygia under King Midas. Now here comes Batman 2, which in two
weeks in America has notched up Dollars 100m, enough to make Midas sell his
kingdom for shares in Warner Brothers.
What can it mean? I am leasing space briefly in this column to two
authorities who may shed light. First, my six-year-old nephew. 'Well, in the
film, Batman fights the Penguin who is very nasty and wants to have the
power over Gotham City, 'cos Penguin is this big, fat thing who squawks and
has these penguin soldiers with rockets and, and, and, Catwoman, who was the
bad millionaire's secretary but now has been made into a cat by falling out
of a window and then cats breathe in her face and she helps Batman and
fights him.'
All clear so far? Let us proceed to my second authority, a
sociologist-structuralist friend. He prefers not to be quoted direct but
maintains that Batman is a symbolic alter ego for developed Western
civilisation today. Batman/Bruce Wayne acts out our own identity crisis as
we make amends for our guilty affluence, amassed over the century, with
guerrilla deeds of heroism (like Iraq) or fly-by-night flourishes of
socio-ecological conscience (like the Rio summit).
Possibly. What I saw and heard in Batman Returns was two hours of noisy,
lurid pyrotechnics. Experiencing the soundtrack, all bangs, shrieks and
maniacally repeated signature tunes, is like being lost in an exploding
American theme park: Anaheim agonistes or Orlando furioso.
The sets, plundering everything from Citizen Kane to Socialist Realism, pile
design plagiarisms on the late Anton Furst's haunting original. (Furst won
an Oscar for Batman and then died after throwing himself from an eighth
floor window, in bizarre premonition of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman). And
the actors, Miss P apart, either offer languid read-throughs of
underdeveloped roles (Michael Keaton's Batman, Christopher Walken as demon
millionaire Max Shreck) or scream and gesticulate as if someone has set fire
to their trousers (Danny De Vito's Penguin).
As for the script, co-written by Daniel Waters with director Tim Burton who
fashioned Batman 1 and the gentle Edward Scissorhands, it seems aimed at two
main social groups.
One is sub-literate morons who can recognize a pun only when it swats them
firmly in the face. ('Just the pussy I was looking for]' cackles Penguin on
first sighting Catwoman.)
The second is people with cloth ears who need a joke repeated in case they
missed it the first time. Thus Miss Pfeiffer's pre-feline spinster
secretary, tripping into her lonely flat, says 'Honey, I'm home - oh, I
forgot, I'm not married.' We laugh. Then 20 minutes later she says it again.
The cloth-ears laugh.
Pfeiffer, it happens, is the treat of the film. She begins as a female Clark
Kent, all spectacles, gaucherie and tangled ankles. Then, metamorphosed into
Catwoman, she purrs and miaows with leather-clad panache. Not since Diana
Rigg in The Avengers have so many large animals lost their skins to so great
sartorial-erotic effect.
muddle-headedness that Pfeiffer is given no clear role in either the romance
or the action. She sets Batman and Penguin each a-tremble, but by climax
time she has been sidelined by both.
The story's last-act spotlight, jiggling away in the glory of Batvision and
Bat-erama, shines down fulsomely, exclusively on hero and villain. What a
shame they are both so dull. Keaton the actor has vanished forever into his
designer-muscled Batsuit. And De Vito's Penguin suggests a Jimmy Durante
impersonator trying to shout himelf silly from a mountain-top. Will there be
a Batman 3? Buy earplugs and other necessary protective devices while stocks
last.
* * *
The Butcher's Wife is a comedy so sotto voce, by contrast, that you should
borrow your great aunt Norma's ear trumpet. Scripted for gentle whimsy by
Ezra Litwak and Marjorie Schwartz, it plants North Carolina psychic Demi
Moore in New York where she falls out of love with her butcher husband
George Dzunza and in love with psychiatrist Jeff Daniels. Throwing her
clairvoyant powers around like confetti, she also changes the lives of
spinster, and Frances McDormand, literate lesbian.
Has Demi Moore, wan of voice and manner, been on a charisma reduction
course? Here she vanishes into the recycled Greenwich Village wallpaper,
more Hemi-demi-semi Moore, while Daniels and the minor characters come forth
with the charm. The mad offhand grace-notes are best: like the actions in
one scene of a patient in Daniels' office when no one except us is looking.
(I shall reveal no more: giggle yourself). Britain's Terry Hughes directed.
How I wish that some pairs of unrelated films could be introduced to each
other, like boxers touching gloves before Round One, and then set scrapping
with no holds barred. Joan Micklin Silver's Stepkids, an icky tale of family
bonding, would be greatly improved by the attentions of Clovis the Attack
Cat from Stephen King's Sleepwalkers, directed by Mick Garris.
Clovis is a police cat with a mission: to tear apart over-bonded families
like Alice Krige and Brian Krause, an incestuous, vampiric mother-son duo
who settle in a small Southern town where he brings home date-rape victims
for her to eat.
Meanwhile large numbers of famous horror writers and directors pop up
through the cracks in the plot doing cameos: John Landis, Joe Dante, Clive
Barker, King himself. They distract us from the gathering daftness, but not
enough. The film's blood count is high and fine, its special effects
likewise. But plot logic is savaged early on - why do Krige-Krause stay in a
town with such an active police force, why do cats gather in unexplained
dozens outside their window? - and never fully recovers.
Stepkids is a moral fable set in America's Laocoon age of serial polygamy
and multiple half-siblings. When young Laura (Hillary Woolf) runs away from
a lakeside visit to her stepbrother, a platoon of parents, step-parents and
semi-brothers and sisters descend to search for her and sort out their own
lives. It is a comedy of extended families by a director not extended at
all: Joan Micklin once made, though you would not think it, Hester Street
and Between The Lines. Frank Mugavero wrote the homiletic script, Griffin
Dunne, Margaret Whitton, Adrienne Shelley and ohers try to bring it to life.
I have one more job for Clovis the Attack Cat. After his visit to Lake
Homily, he should go to Madrid to sort out problem elements in the city's
post-liberation subculture.
Pepi, Luci, Bom .. is an early Pedro Almodovar comedy - how many more are
still to come? - featuring drugs, sex, violence, urination and the other
things not possible under Franco. It also features a plot of sorts, but we
cannot expect you to find that when even critics with helpful Press handouts
are powerless to do so. In short, a shambles. Clovis's mission is to track
down any further early Almodovar films and shred them on sight.

FT  09 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Marine insurance claim fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WONDROUS
Court of Appeal
(Lord Justice Lloyd, Lord Justice Nourse and Lord Justice McCowan):
June 16 1992
A SHIP'S loss of earnings arising out of its inability to leave port because
of failure to pay port dues is not covered by loss of hire insurance
incorporating the new Institute War and Strikes hulls clauses, unless it
tries to leave and is forced to stay, in that there is no 'detainment'
within the meaning of the policy, or if there is it is a conditional
detainment dependent on a conditional infringement of customs regulations
and is excluded from the policy as being 'by reason of' infringement.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Ikerigi Compania
Naviera SA and others, owners of the Wondrous, from Mr Justice Hobhouse's
decision that they could not recover from underwriters, Mr GCF Palmer and
others, under two policies of marine insurance.
LORD JUSTICE LLOYD said the Wondrous was chartered to load 30,000 tons of
molasses at Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf for carriage to Europe. It
arrived on March 10 1987. It did not sail until October 17 1988. By then
huge liabilities had been incurred for port dues and demurrage.
On October 20 1987 the shipowners claimed against the Hellenic War Risks
Club for constructive total loss of the vessel. On July 14 1988 the club
compromised the claim. It paid fifteen-sixteenths of the insured value of
the hull but declined to accept notice of abandonment.
So the shipowners were left with the vessel, which they sold, and the
proceeds of insurance. They also received gross freight of Dollars 644,000
when the vessel eventually discharged at Aarhus in Denmark, plus Dollars
84,000 dead freight. Out of the gross freight they paid port dues and other
charges. The net freight received was Dollars 326,607.
The shipowners were covered under a loss of hire policy for 'war loss of
hire and/or earnings'.
The policy was subject to the Jardine Glanvill Ltd war loss of hire wording
No 1, 17.4.84 which provided that the policy should only pay if, in
consequence of the risks enumerated in the Institute War and Strikes Clauses
Hulls Time 1.10.83, the vessel was prevented from earning hire.
By clause 1.2 of the hulls clauses the insurance covered loss to the vessel
caused by 'seizure, arrest, restraint or consequences thereof'. By clause
4.1.5 it excluded 'arrest, restraint, detainment . . . under quarantine
regulations or by reason of infringement of any customs or trading
regulations'.
The shipowners said the vessel was prevented from earning hire in
consequence of being 'detained' within the meaning of clause 1.2, and that
they were entitled to recover Dollars 900,000.
The underwriters relied on the clause 4.1.5 exclusion of detainment 'by
reason of any customs or trading regulations'.
Mr Justice Hobhouse found that until October 1988 the vessel did not have
clearance under local customs regulations to leave Bandar Abbas. If it had
tried to leave it would have been forcibly detained.
There were two requirements to be satisfied before it could obtain
clearance. The first, which was the vessel's responsibility, was payment of
port dues plus a local tax on freight. The second, which was the exporter's
responsibility, was the furnishing of a foreign currency guarantee (FCG) in
respect of the cargo.
As to the first requirement, the judge found that the immediate cause of the
detention was failure to comply with local custom laws. But he referred to
'detention' in the conditional sense that if the vessel had tried to leave
before paying port dues it would have been forcibly detained. In that sense
only was it being detained.
As to the furnishing of the FCG by the exporter, he found that if the owners
had been prepared to put up the foreign exchange, the Iranian authorities
would have been satisfied.
As to clause 4.1.5, he held that the exclusion of loss arising from
restraint or detainment 'by reason of infringement' of customs regulations
applied. He said 'restraint' and 'detainment' had to be given a wide
commercial interpretation and in a commercial sense the vessel was detained
'by reason of infringement' of customs regulations. It was the customs
regulations that made it illegal to sail.
That reasoning was correct. The judge correctly emphasised that the
detention was conditional. The threat of detainment depended on prior
infringement. Therefore, if 'detainment' in clause 1.2 must be read as
including conditional detainment, so must 'infringement' in clause 4.1.5
include conditional infringement.
Mr Hallgarten for the shipowners argued that infringement must mean 'actual
infringement'.
That was an oversimplification because:
(1) In the case of quarantine regulations there did not need to be actual
infringement - it was sufficient that detainment was 'under' the
regulations. Why should the parties have required something different in the
case of customs and trading regulations?
(2) It did not make commercial sense to distinguish between actual and
threatened infringement. If the vessel had attempted to leave but had been
stopped the exclusion would have applied. Why should owners recover merely
because they made no attempt to leave?
(3) 'Capture, seizure, arrest etc' in the context of a war risks policy
referred to political or executive acts. Clause 4.1.5 identified the sort of
arrest, restraint or detainment the draughtsman had in mind.
If that was the right approach, failure to obtain normal customs' clearance,
for whatever reason, was outside the cover whether or not there was an
actual infringement of customs regulations.
If there was a detainment within clause 1.2, there was an infringement
within clause 4.1.5.
But it was preferable to say reading the two clauses together that there was
not a detainment within clause 1.2 at all.
It was common ground that if there was no detainment within clause 1.2, the
shipowner's claim under the loss of hire policy must fail.
Clause 4.1.6 excluded loss or damage 'arising from . . . any financial
cause'.
The judge thought failure to provide the FCG was not a financial cause since
'financial cause' must be read as applying to the ship and owners but not to
cargo.
There was no reason to confine the words to causes for which the shipowners
were responsible. In the context of a war risks policy they should be given
their ordinary meaning.
The shipowners were also covered under a freight policy for risks set out in
the Institute Time Clauses Freight, and the Institute War and Strikes
Clauses.
The judge held there was no loss of freight. He was right. Gross freight was
earned on the cargo when the vessel discharged at Aarhus. The policy did not
cover the increased cost of earning the freight, or the charterers' failure
to pay freight when earned.
Nor was there a partial loss of freight.
Inman (1882) 7 App Cas 670 decided that, where there was a deduction from
freight under a discretionary power conferred by charterparty, there was no
loss of freight, total or partial.
There was no difference between a discretionary power conferred under the
charterparty and a subsequent agreement whereby shipowners agreed to defray
certain expenses out of gross freight receivable.
The claim for partial loss of freight was rejected.
The appeal was dismissed.
Their Lordships agreed, but Lord Justice McCowan took the view that in the
wording of clause 4.1.5 the parties had chosen to distinguish between
quarantine regulations and customs and trading regulations, and that the
courts were not entitled to redraw the bargain for them.
For the shipowners: Anthony Hallgarten QC and Charles Haddon-Cave (Davis
Grant &amp; Horton, Plymouth).
For the underwriters: Nicholas Legh-Jones QC and Timothy Young (Hill Taylor
Dickinson).

FT  09 JUL 92 / People: Turning the wheel at Saab UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bryan Hatter is sliding out of the driving seat at Saab Great Britain, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Swedish executive car-maker which is now
controlled jointly by Saab-Scania and General Motors.
Hatter, 56, who cut his executive car sales teeth with rival BMW (Great
Britain), where he was national sales manager until joining Saab in 1987, is
Singapore-bound.
There he will take the wheel as regional director for Saab Automobile's
Region Asia/ Pacific, a vast sales zone which under Saab's broad definition
includes the Middle East.
Hatter's move is part of a general shake-up of Saab - still making losses,
albeit much reduced - as it prepares for an intensive new model programme
which, thanks largely to GM cash infusions, will see a succession of wholly
new cars being launched from next year.
Earlier this week it was announced that David Herman, who has overseen the
start of the revival at Saab Automobile since it became a joint venture
company with General Motors in 1990, was moving on to become chairman and
managing director of Adam Opel, GM's German car subsidiary.
Moving up to succeed Hatter as managing director at Saab GB is 42-year-old
Will Edwyn-Jones, who has barely had time to warm the seat of the company's
sales and marketing director, to which he was promoted from general sales
and marketing manager earlier this year.
Completing the shuffle inside the UK operation is the appointment of Paul
Richmond, formerly finance director, to be Edwyn-Jones' deputy, and the
appointment to the board of Chris Banks, to be responsible for all sales,
dealer development, business management and training activities.
Hatter's departure also leaves the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders with a gap on its Car Importers Section, of which he has been
chairman.

The first price skirmishes of the summer holiday season are over and
Britain's tour operators are waiting to see whether fierce and damaging
discounting continues into July and August.
The tour operator UNIJET has used the lull in hostilities to appoint Philip
Ovenden as managing director of its Viking International Air Chartering
subsidiary. The subsidiary sells aircraft charter seats both in-house and to
other providers of package holidays.
Ovenden is no stranger to travel industry boom and bust. He previously
worked for Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group, which collapsed last
year. He has since been responsible for long-haul operations at tour
operator Meon Villas.
*****
Robert Fox, chairman of Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and a former Lasmo director, is
to become chief executive of the London-quoted, US-based natural resources
company. Joint managing directors David Wilkinson and Michael Hogue will
report directly to him. Fox was appointed chairman in 1990 at the
instigation of large shareholder County NatWest, following the failure of a
Pounds 31m placing to fund acquisitions.

Devaney, who replaces Walter Waring when he retires in August, is a
chartered engineer and a Lancastrian by birth. After training with Perkins
Engines in Peterborough, where he became managing director in 1983, he moved
to Toronto with Varity Corporation in 1988. He took up his present
appointment in 1989.

people in danger of losing their properties as a result of the failure of
home-income schemes, Ivor Owen writes.
In a debate on the Finance Bill he said building societies that had traded

While expressing sympathy for those concerned, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR backbenchers are taking steps to counteract the possibility that Mr
John Smith might develop a 'bunker mentality' after he is elected leader of
the opposition at the end of next week.
After years of behind-the-scenes griping that Mr Neil Kinnock's staff
overprotected the leader from his troops, several MPs are taking precipitate
action to ensure clearer lines of communication are kept open to the new
leadership.
Yesterday, Mr Graham Allen, the Nottingham North MP, won unopposed support
at the parliamentary Labour party weekly meeting for a general review of the
organisation and workings of the PLP, aimed at involving backbench MPs more
closely in decision-making.
Aware of the mood within the party, Mr Smith had already promised such a
review when he made his leadership campaign presentation to the party last
month.
Mr Derek Foster, the chief whip re-elected last week, also made representing
backbench interests an important element in his campaign.
In a letter to MPs, Mr Allen emphasised his motion for a review committee
was 'entirely constructive'. He added yesterday: 'In the past, in order to
get a helpful suggestion considered you had to create a campaign or a row.
There should be a mechanism whereby good ideas as well as discontent can be
expressed.'
Under his proposed review committee, the PLP chairman, three nominated
shadow cabinet members and three elected MPs would meet regularly to discuss
issues and report back to the PLP.
Supporters of Mr Smith say he will conduct his leadership in a more
collegiate style than Mr Kinnock, thereby provoking less of the 'insiders
and outsiders' divisions complained of by the left.
However, some more cynical MPs say that whatever the well-meaning intentions
of the party's leader-to-be, the fierce rivalries within the PLP inevitably
lead to a bunker mentality emerging.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Political Notebook: A time for radicalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW is the time for audacity: for the government to think about risky and
unpopular decisions.
It is hardly a welcome thought for Mr John Major as he peers through the
gloom enveloping the economy into his party's renewed hostilities over
Europe. His post-election honeymoon has been one of the shortest on record.
Instead of pausing to rest and reflect, ministers have been trapped in the
familiar business of tactical fire-fighting.
There is no sense of panic. The prime minister is irritated but essentially
unruffled by the sporadic outbreaks of dissent on the Tory backbenches.
The message is that the government will play it long: over Europe and the
economy, over Canary Wharf, even over such minor issues as the LSE's bid to
occupy the former County Hall. Whitehall is awash with committees chaired by
Lord Wakeham, the cabinet's fixer-in-chief.
Mr Major, committed as ever to the ERM and to Maastricht, is prepared for a
fractious rather than celebratory party conference.
Colleagues share the judgment that the electorate had enough of Maoist-style
permanent revolution during the late 1980s. The government's plans to shake
up the public sector may be no less radical for their deliberate
incrementalism.
But there is a suspicion also that ministers have not adjusted their focus
since April 9. Tory backbenchers, always uneasy about inaction, want a
firmer sense of the government's agenda.
Some 18 months of electioneering have produced instant reflexes, but too few
ministers appreciate that victory has given them the most precious commodity
in politics: sufficient time to first annoy and then placate the electorate.
If vested interests and conventional orthodoxies are to be challenged and
the tax system shaken up, the momentum must be established within the first
year of a new parliament.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, a shrewd cabinet heavyweight, has grasped the point. His
inquiry into policing heralds a radicalism in the government's approach to
law and order from which Lady Thatcher recoiled. His determination to
abolish the Edmund-Davies pay formula will provoke a row with the police
next year.
So, too, will his plans to break the prison officers union's grip on the
nation's prisons. But it should all be forgotten by 1996.
Elsewhere there is less certainty. At education, Mr John Patten has grabbed
some easy headlines with his championship of Shakespeare over Neighbours. A
three-stage strategy to take over, revitalise and then return to parents the
worst inner-city schools should guarantee a few more.
Cabinet colleagues are less confident that his proposal to establish a
centralised schools funding council will create a durable balance between
parental choice and educational anarchy.
In other areas - housing is one - there are plenty of ideas but also a sense
that the strategy is fragmented. Why, one Tory MP asked this week, is the
government promoting a myriad of small-scale schemes to encourage home
ownership and then channelling billions of pounds to housing associations
that refuse their tenants the right to buy?
The public-spending round has a similar short-term focus. Ministers are
concentrating on immediate savings rather than on strategic decisions that
would deliver large cuts four or five years hence.
Many Tories believe that the most pressing need for radical thinking -
followed by action in next year's Budget - is on tax policy. A distinctive
low-tax policy could be as decisive for Mr Major at the next election as it
was in the last. For the foreseeable future, there will be no room for large
net reductions, but there will be the opportunity to reshape the system.
Mortgage interest relief is said to remain inviolate, but some of his
colleagues wonder whether Mr Norman Lamont will be brave enough to extend
the VAT base. An end to zero-rating on food would raise over Pounds 7bn.
That might be too daring, but VAT on domestic fuel would raise Pounds 2.5bn,
on new house construction Pounds 3.4bn, on transport Pounds 2.3bn and on
newspapers Pounds 1bn.
The money raised could be used to meet Mr Major's ambition to level the
playing field on the tax treatment of savings, to reduce capital taxes, and
to make a credible move towards a 20p basic rate of income tax.
There would be howls of protest - for a year or so. But in the first year of
a new parliament, the priority for Mr Major must be to ensure that
incrementalism does not turn into drift.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Plans for committees spark row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT business managers yesterday precipitated a Commons row over the
departmental select committee system by trying to remove the Tory chairman
of the health committee and giving Labour the chairmanship of the trade and
industry committee.
Labour is expected to take the chairmanship of six committees, including the
social security committee, which is poised to revive its investigation into
the Maxwell affair.
Mr John Watts, Conservative MP for Slough, was last night emerging as
favourite to become chairman of the Treasury select committee. He will
replace Mr Terence Higgins, who is leaving the committee.
However, Tory MPs on the trade and industry committee are threatening to
rebel against the Conservative whips' decision to give the chairmanship to
Labour - probably either Mr Doug Hoyle, MP for Warrington North, or Stan
Orme, MP for Salford East. A possible Tory candidate would be Sir Anthony
Grant, MP for Cambridgeshire South West.
The departmental select committees have grown considerably in importance
since being set up first in 1979. The televising of their proceedings has
increased their powers to intimidate the executive by calling ministers and
officials to give evidence.
The selection committee's decisions, based on the nominations of party
Whips, will be announced today and be debated on Monday. Each committee will
then meet before the summer recess to chose a chairman - possibly
overturning the whips' intentions - and discuss a possible inquiry
programme.
Certain to protest is Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative chairman of
the health committee of the last parliament, who frequently criticised
government policy. The selection committee agreed last night to remove him
from the list of MPs proposed for the health brief.
Mr Winterton yesterday complained that the Tory whips were 'bully boys'
acting 'on behalf of the establishment'.
Among other committees, Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, is set to
retain the chairmanship of social security; Mr David Howell, Tory MP for
Guildford, should win foreign affairs; and Sir John Wheeler, MP for
Westminster North, should keep home affairs.
Besides trade and industry and social security, Labour is also expected to
take the chairmanships of the Welsh and Scottish committees, employment and
the newly created national heritage committee.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: BR sale to stress quality of
service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT ministers will next week try to present the privatisation of
British Rail as an opportunity to improve service quality before the next
general election, Ralph Atkins writes.
The long-awaited white paper on BR's privatisation will stress the possible
benefits in terms of increased flexibility in rail services, improved
customer service and lower fares. The department regards the sell-off as
unique in that there will be less emphasis on the amount it will raise for
the Treasury.
Legislation for the sale allowing private-sector companies to bid to run
services is expected to be brought before parliament after the summer
recess, with the first franchises in 1994.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is expected to argue that the
continuing high level of public subsidy for the railways continuing means
the government will continue to have a say over the level of services. No
rush for franchises is expected.
His department has been talking with private-sector companies, particularly
those already involved in transport, about possible deals and about the
transfer of more freight on to rail. BR's freight division will be sold
outright.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Row over youth training places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW broke out yesterday between the government and the Labour party over
the number of unemployed young people waiting for places on Youth Training,
the scheme for people aged 16 to 19.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, dismissed as 'absolute
fantasy' a claim by Mr Tony Blair, her Labour shadow, that a survey of
careers services showed 55,000 young people waiting to go on YT.
The survey, drawn from a majority of the 107 careers services, showed that
almost 40 per cent of those waiting were 1991 school leavers. A third had
been waiting for more than eight weeks. Some had to wait up to eight months
for a training place.
Mr Blair said the government claimed it had no information on the number of
young people without training places. He claimed the government was
'deliberately with-holding information' because the Department of Employment
had compiled figures for waiting lists as part of an official survey earlier
this year.
According to the department, no full survey has taken place. However, it is
understood that civil servants estimated that about 20,000 people were on
careers services' books in March.
The government guarantees a training place to all those aged 16 to 19 who
want one - a promise restated by Mrs Shephard this week - and any breakdown
in that is politically embarrassing. Last year, the government had to spend
Pounds 15m more than it forecast on upholding the guarantee. YT cost about
Pounds 850m last year.

FT  09 JUL 92 / State of defence vehicles attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence should consider contract hiring or leasing of new
vehicles because the old ones cost too much to repair, the Commons Public
Accounts Committee said yesterday, Daniel Green writes.
The MoD was 'running over-age vehicles and incurring costs on uneconomic
repairs' because it lacked the cash for purchases of replacements, the
committee said. The Treasury and the MoD should consider alternatives to
purchase.
The MoD was also criticised for poor management information on the state of
its fleet of support vehicles. The committee called for 'a careful
independent review' of the vehicle needs of the services.
The recommendation comes as defence budgets are under scrutiny from the
Treasury. This week's white paper forecast a fall in real defence spending
over the next three years.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Engineering workers reject 5% pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 1,300 engineering workers yesterday rejected a 5 per cent pay
offer that involved the introduction of performance pay and the end of
collective bargaining.
Pay has been frozen for 18 months at the two British Timken engineering
parts factories near Northampton, according to the AEEU engineering and
electrical union, which represents the manual workforce.
Performance pay has grown rapidly in the private sector for white-collar and
professional workers, particularly in financial services, but is uncommon
among manual workers.
Members of the union voted to reject the proposed package by a majority of
70 per cent at British Timken's factory at Daventry and by a majority of 85
per cent at its Duston site. The union had not directed the workforce to
reject the offer.
Mr Duncan Simpson, AEEU divisional organiser, said the union would 'consider
its position' should the company decide to impose the package.

FT  09 JUL 92 / DTI to ease disclosure rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUND managers would not be required to disclose stakes below 10 per cent in
companies held by clients, under rules proposed by the Department of Trade
and Industry. The present ceiling is 3 per cent.
The DTI has been under pressure from the Institutional Fund Managers
Association, the industry trade association, to ease disclosure requirements
that fund managers say are expensive and unnecessary.
'In no way would you say that these stakes are predatory,' said Mr Richard
Weir, director general of the IFMA.
The DTI first consulted on its draft directive in February 1991 and its
proposed rules have been prepared in the light of its consultation and other
developments since then.
The proposed rules are set out in a paper being circulated within the
industry. They will apply to fund managers charged with buying, selling and
voting shares held in segregated accounts in the names of individual
clients.
At present, fund managers whose sole job it is to sell shares on behalf of
clients need give notification only of stakes of 15 per cent or more. That
ceiling will be lowered to 10 per cent under the proposals.
The rules say stakes in companies in pooled funds managed by fund managers
need be disclosed only when they reach 10 per cent.
While the directive is generally a relaxation of notification rules, they
will be tightened in respect of unlisted companies. For the first time,
stakes in unlisted companies of 10 per cent or more will have to be
disclosed as well.
The fund management industry has argued for a relaxation of notification
requirements, saying the present rules are cumbersome and expensive to
administer. Large fund managers typically need a half-time to a full-time
staff person simply to administer notifications at a cost of Pounds 15,000
to Pounds 20,000 a year.
IFMA also argues that no European country has a requirement to disclose
stakes below 10 per cent and a 1988 directive set 10 per cent as the minimum
size of a notifiable position.
Nevertheless, in what is likely to be a disappointment to the pension funds
industry, the DTI declined to lift the ceiling on notifiable stakes held by
pension fund trustees. In its original proposal, the DTI suggested that
trustees should be subject to the 10 per cent rule, rather than the current
3 per cent ceiling.
In its paper, circulated to the industry, the DTI said it had decided to
take no action on trustees' holdings. It cited a wide-ranging go-vernment
review of pension law.

<TEXT>
MR Kevin Maxwell, faced with an income-tax demand which he says he is unable
to meet, was yesterday granted an interim High Court order that temporarily
stops creditors bringing civil proceedings against him.
At a private hearing before a Chancery Court registrar, Mr Maxwell, son of
the late Robert Maxwell, won an order under Section 252 of the 1986
Insolvency Act allowing him time to seek an 'individual voluntary
arrangement' with his creditors.
Mr George Auger, of accountants Stoy Hayward, was appointed to act as his
nominee in seeking the arrangement.
Mr Maxwell said through his solicitors, Peters &amp; Peters: 'A demand for the
payment of income tax by the Inland Revenue, which I was advised is due and
owing and which I am unable to meet, has precipitated my application today
for the interim order.
'I have taken this course solely to assist the realisation of my assets for
the benefit of all my creditors. I shall do all I can to that end.'
The order granted to Mr Maxwell today 'stays' all existing or pending civil
proceedings against him, including those brought by creditors, for 14 days
to give him time to prepare voluntary settlement proposals for consideration
by his nominee.

FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Rushdie shadow over UK-Iran trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Salman Rushdie affair is harming British companies' chances of winning
contracts in Iran, according to the British Consultants Bureau (BCB), a
non-profit group which promotes UK consultants overseas, and recently sent a
mission to Iran.
The eight-member mission said yesterday, after a 10-day trip to Tehran and
Isfahan, that British groups were falling behind US, Japanese and European
competitors in gaining contracts from Iran's ambitious plans for developing
its infrastructure. This follows the souring of relations because of the
late Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Mr Salman Rushdie, whose book, the
Satanic Verses, Moslems regard as blasphemous.
Mr Nigel Thompson, a director of Ove Arup who led the mission, said Iran
offered a 'huge potential market' for UK groups, notably in petro-chemicals,
power, water and sewage schemes, but that Iranian officials wanted to see
the British government distance itself from Mr Rushdie.
The mission was critical of the level of official British commercial
representation in Iran, saying the embassy in Tehran was understaffed,
underinformed and should raise the status of its chief representative from
charge d'affaires, to full ambassador.
The mission, three of whom remained in Iran to pursue possible contracts in
transport, construction and water, also said they believed Britain should
extend the level of export credit financing available to Iran through the
Export Credits Guarantees Department (ECGD).
Iran is on medium to long-term cover from the ECGD, and the agency said
yesterday that cover for actual and potential contracts already exceeded the
country limit - a total demand estimated to be around Pounds 1bn.

FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Private surge in Indonesian power sector -
Jakarta opens to foreign capital, but experts warn contracts taking too long
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA has taken the first steps towards private participation in its
power sector. But industry experts say negotiations on new projects will
need to be speeded up if the country is to avert an electricity crisis.
The state utility PLN has more than doubled installed capacity in the past
decade to more than 9,000MW. Demand, however, is growing at 10 per cent a
year, and the government plans to double capacity again within eight years.
To meet the target, about Dollars 30bn of investment is required by the year
2000. Neither the government nor donors such as the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank can fully fund the programme.
The government is looking for up to a third of the investment to come from
the private sector and, under advice from the donors, is set to break PLN's
monopoly over power generation for the national grid.
The government this year ended a protracted period of negotiations with
foreign companies by asking Mission Energy of the US to lead a consortium to
build, own and operate a 2,400MW coal-fired Paiton project in East Java.
In 1990, as the first step toward private participation, the government
offered four 600MW units at the Paiton complex. Companies owning the units
would get a return on their investment under a tariff structure agreed with
PLN for the supply of electricity.
At first the government invited private proposals for two of the units, and
a short-lived consortium of Hopewell Group of Hong Kong and the Bimantara
Group, led by President Suharto's second son, first studied the project in
1990.
Hopewell pulled out and Bimantara switched allegiance to Intercontinental
Electric Inc (IEI) of the US which, Indonesian government officials say,
received a Dollars 500,000 grant from the US government towards a
feasibility study.
A second consortium was formed, led by Mission Energy and including Mitsui
of Japan, General Electric of the US and Batu Hitam Perkasa, an Indonesian
coal mining company led by Mr Hashim Djojohadikusomo.
The consortia made preliminary proposals last September for construction of
the two units at a cost of up to Dollars 2.5bn. Then, in mid-October, the
government unexpectedly awarded IEI an exclusive right to continue
negotiations.
The decision triggered alarm among some donors who said that the government
had failed to evaluate fully the two proposals. In a recent report on
Indonesia, the World Bank said that the key issues raised by the project
have been 'allowing adequate competition in bidding; putting in place
transparent procedures for bid evaluation; applying sound principles in bid
selection.'
By December, the government, under pressure from the donors, had compromised
and informed Mission Energy that it should prepare a proposal for the
remaining two 600MW units.
Industry officials, however, said that the prospect of the complex having
different designs, suppliers and operators threatened to undermine its
viability. 'The project is too large, and, with all the politics, everyone
wants a piece,' complained an executive of one company involved in the
project.
The government changed its mind again in May. In a meeting with IEI and
Mission Energy, it said that it wanted just one consortium to build all four
units and expressed a clear preference for Mission Energy.
While both consortia were hopeful of raising the required finance, the
government said that Mission Energy had a superior technical proposal and
that the consortium members were better able to provide equity. The cost of
Mission Energy's proposal per pair of units is estimated at about Dollars
1.8bn.
The government has suggested that Mission Energy might take on board some
members of the rival consortium, including suppliers such as Westinghouse
and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Government officials say that Bimantara is
negotiating with Batu Hitam Perkasa and is asking for up to a 10 per cent
equity stake in the project.
Finalising the consortium might entail vexed negotiations and additional
suppliers will require a new design for the plant. As one government
official noted, the project 'cannot accommodate all these firms. It's just
too crowded.'
The complex is still to be built in two stages - the consortium will have a
first option on the second stage - and detailed discussions are expected to
begin in August, with the contract to be signed by April. Much depends on
the government finalising conditions such as the tax regime under which the
plant will operate.
While the length and manner of negotiations have shaken the confidence of
the private sector, this could be restored if the deal is quickly concluded
and the first stage is completed as planned by 1997.

FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Typewriter rivals in phantom factory feud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE trade bill debated by the House of Representatives yesterday includes a
controversial clause which would make it more difficult for foreign
companies to circumvent anti-dumping duties.
The bill's supporters, mostly Democrats, want to close a loophole in the
1988 trade law allowing foreign companies to avoid anti-dumping duties by
setting up 'phantom' factories in the US. These assembly operations import
all their parts from third countries which are not covered by the
anti-dumping order.
The bill would give the US Commerce Department added authority to judge
whether a company is evading anti-dumping duties by considering 'actual and
potential' threats to US industries. This change in the law primarily stems
from a trade feud between Smith Corona and Brother Industries of Japan.
Smith Corona accuses Brother of evading a dumping duty by assembling
typewriters at its Tennessee plant with parts imported from Singapore and
Malaysia.
Mr Lee Thompson, Smith Corona's chairman, says Brother set up the low-wage,
low-skill assembly plant expressly to circumvent the 60 per cent duty.
Brother admits it swallows losses to keep market share (a tacit admission of
dumping, argues Smith Corona). Mr Patrick O'Leary, the company's lawyer,
counter-attacks with the charge that Brother loses money because Smith
Corona dumped the US market with personal electric typewriters made in
Singapore.
The Japanese company filed its own anti-dumping case against Smith Corona.
However, the Commerce Department last year ruled Brother had no standing
because it did not qualify as as American manufacturer protected by the law;
the case is now in court.

FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Rockwell to set up Czech parts venture
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROCKWELL International, the US automotive, electronics and aerospace
multinational, is to set up a joint venture in Czechoslovakia to supply
components to the country's rapidly developing vehicle industry.
The venture is the first in eastern Europe for the Dollars 12bn-a-year
turnover Rockwell group. However, it is now exploring investment potential
throughout the region, and is planning a significant presence at the first
international Moscow motor show this year.
Volkswagen, through its equity holding and management control of Skoda, is
expected to be the leading customer for the Czech venture, in which an
initial Dollars 11m is being invested.
However, Rockwell said yesterday it is expected that the venture will supply
other vehicle makers in Czechoslovakia and export markets.
The agreement, reached with the Ministry of Privatisation of the Czech
Republic, provides for Rockwell to assume control and majority ownership of
manufacturing facilities at Liberec, 120km north-east of Prague.
The venture, to be known as Rockwell Automotive Body Systems - Liberec,
initially will develop, manufacture and market window regulators, seat
slides and other body components. Its products and manufacturing programmes
will be integrated into Rockwell's global Automotive Body Systems division.
In Europe alone, these operations employ 4,300 people at plants in France,
Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, with sales last year of Dollars 580m.
Rockwell said yesterday extensive training programmes would be introduced at
Liberec to bring the plant up to 'world class' manufacturing standards.
The deal comes as Rockwell and other large components groups are preparing
for a big expansion in the value and complexity of the vehicle body systems
they supply to vehicle assemblers.

THE Philippine government may drop its civil cases against former first lady

wealth, a senior official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Manila.
The head of a government panel trying to recover the funds said Mrs Marcos
had agreed to such an arrangement in principle and talks on a settlement
could begin in Manila next week. However, he suggested that there were no
plans to drop the criminal cases against Mrs Marcos.

SENIOR Palestinian leaders in the Israeli-occupied territories yesterday
struggled to defuse the most serious dispute to date between Islamic
fundamentalists and the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Gaza.
The row erupted on Tuesday night into gun battles and street fights in which
a teenager died and 50 people were wounded.
The unprecedented fighting, which followed a period of growing internal
tensions in the densely populated strip, was between the so-called military
wings of Hamas, a popular Moslem fundamentalist group, and Fatah, the
mainstream PLO faction headed by Mr Yassir Arafat, the organisation's
chairman.
Young Fatah and Hamas activists have jostled for supremacy in Gaza's refugee
camps and towns for several years. But the sharp escalation of their rivalry
may have wider implications as Palestinians prepare for peace talks with the
new government led by Mr Yitzhak Rabin.
Hamas, which is estimated to have the support of about 40 per cent of
Gazans, opposes the peace talks and is particularly hostile to accepting an
interim settlement based on limited Palestinian autonomy, as outlined by Mr
Rabin. Most in the PLO, including Fatah, have accepted the proposals in
principle, but now face the task of making a deal acceptable to the
Palestinian public.
Yesterday, Dr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the Gaza-based head of the Palestinian
peace talks negotiating team, met Hamas leaders in an attempt to bring the
latest fighting under control. But Hamas activists are determined not to
have their voice suppressed.
The European Community yesterday handed over Dollars 35m (Pounds 18.3m) to
aid the building of homes for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

<TEXT>
THE Lebanese government plans to move more than 350,000 citizens displaced
by the 1975-1990 civil war to their pre-war homes, writes Lara Marlowe in
Beirut.
The proposal seeks to defuse Christian opposition to the holding of
parliamentary elections before a scheduled Syrian redeployment to eastern
Lebanon in September. The first relocations should begin within two weeks.
They involve Maronite Christians from more than 80 villages in the
predominantly Druze Chouf mountains and the region east of Sidon.
Maronites have objected to the elections on the grounds that free elections
cannot be held while foreign troops are still present in Lebanon, and that
the failure to return displaced people would weigh against the Christians in
the poll.
People's right to return to their homes was recognised in the October 1989
peace accords, but the government has been slow to spread its authority.
The government now promises to provide Lebanese army protection for
returnees. Mr Elie Hobeika, the minister for displaced persons, is best
known as the man the Israelis claimed led the Phalangist militia when it
massacred hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in
1982. He is now responsible for establishing co-ordinating committees in the
villages to be repopulated.
The government has not said how it will finance the operation, or what will
happen to those who have moved into the homes of the displaced. The
director-general of the Ministry of Housing recently estimated the cost of
rebuilding nearly 87,000 destroyed homes at more than Dollars 750m (Pounds
393m) and said another Dollars 1.6bn would be needed for new housing.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Japan posts huge May trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN POSTED another huge increase in its current account surplus in May,
with the broadest measure of Japan's external trade balance rising by 128
per cent to Dollars 9.49bn (Pounds 4.96bn) compared with a year ago.
The trade surplus alone, which excludes invisible items such as tourism,
rose by 85 per cent to Dollars 10.09bn, putting Japan on course for a
possible record trade surplus this year.
The steep rise in the trade balance resulted from a 4.6 per cent increase in
exports to Dollars 24.8bn and a 19.4 per cent decline in imports to Dollars
14.7bn.
The sharp deterioration in imports will put increased pressure on the
government to enact measures that will stimulate the economy and increase
domestic demand.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, has told his counterparts at the Munich
economic summit that Japan is committed to a long-term programme to boost
domestic demand, and is considering measures to increase government spending
by between Y6,000bn (Pounds 25bn) and Y7,000bn in the autumn.
The government said the steep fall in imports was accounted for partly by a
Dollars 1.2bn decline in purchases of gold for investment purposes. Exports
were boosted by strong automobile and ship sales.
The trend towards a large trade surplus, however, was expected to continue
because of the continuing weakness of the Japanese economy and the expected
recovery in the US.
The recent rise in the value of the yen also boosts the value of exports
while reducing the value of imports, although in the long run it should, in
theory, stimulate imports while making Japanese goods less competitive
internation-ally.
Japan was in May a net exporter of long-term capital, amounting to Dollars
1.89bn, for the second month in a row.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Voters likely to give Miyazawa a rough passage: Ruling party
faces uphill battle to make gains in elections to the upper house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, faces a tough time when he
gets back to Tokyo from the Munich summit. He will start a gruelling round
of electoral meetings in a national campaign for half the seats in the
Diet's upper house. Yesterday was the official start of a two-week campaign
leading to polling on July 26.
It will be Mr Miyazawa's first national election since he took office last
November. The prime minister is closely identified with the issue which is
expected to dominate the campaign - the newly-passed controversial law to
allow Japanese troops to serve on United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Japan appears to be equally divided between those who support the law for
its effort to increase Japan's role in international affairs, and those who
are opposed because it might revive the role of the Japanese military. Mr
Miyazawa said that Japan had to assume international responsibilities
because the country's fate was common with the rest of the world's. He felt
at the summit how much other countries expected of Japan, he said.
Mr Miyazawa will be under pressure to explain his plans to boost the
economy, which is suffering its most serious slowdown since the oil shocks
of the 1970s. Leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic party have proposed a
public spending increase of Y6,000bn (Pounds 25bn) to Y7,000bn but the plan
has yet to be adopted by the government. Voters are also angry about
repeated involvement of politicians in financial scandals.
Half the seats in the upper house are contested every three years. The
ruling party, which has controlled the Diet's lower house since the 1950s,
lost its majority in the upper house in the last election in 1989 at the
height of the Recruit bribery scandal. It stands little chance of recovering
that majority because it is defending seats last contested in 1986, at the
peak of the popularity of Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, former prime minister.
The LDP is defending 75 of the 127 seats at stake. Party officials believe
they might secure 64, although analysts think it could be below 60. Either
way, the party will need to rely on centrist parties to secure passage of
bills through the upper house.
Until now, the ruling party with 114 seats and the Komei party, its chief
ally, which has 20 seats, have managed a majority of 134 in the 252-seat
upper house.
The loss of just 10 LDP seats would rob the allies of their majority and
force the LDP to seek other partners, such as the small Democratic Socialist
party, which has co-operated before with the ruling party. But the LDP's
clout in inter-party negotiations declines as it loses seats.
Fortunately for the ruling party, the main opposition Social Democratic
party has annoyed voters for attempts to filibuster the peacekeeping forces
bill. The ox-walk, a slow-voting technique, was widely seen as a waste of
time and of taxpayers' money.
The Japanese often use upper house elections to lodge protest votes, so
support could swing to smaller opposition parties, including Rengo no kai, a
party sponsored by Japan's trade union confederation, with 22 candidates,
and the New Japan party, which is contesting 16 seats.
The New Japan party was founded this year by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, a former
LDP member and prefectural governor. Mr Hosokawa, revelling in his image as
political renegade, is campaigning on a ticket of radical political reform.
He is courting publicity by naming some high-profile candidates including Mr
Yoshi Terasawa, former chief of the New York office of Nomura Securities,
the broking company.
Of the 127 seats being contested, 77 are decided in 47 prefectural districts
where voters choose candidates by name. The remaining 50 are allotted by
means of proportional representation, where voters cast ballots by party.
With 38 parties fielding candidates, voters are spoilt for choice. Those
disinclined to vote for the main parties can opt instead for the UFO
(Unidentified Flying Object) party and the health-conscious Vinegar-Loving
party.

<TEXT>
VIETNAM has accused China of landing troops on a reef of the disputed
Spratly islands in the South China Sea and planting a territorial marker.
Vietnam's Beijing embassy confirmed reports of the landing, first published
in the official Nhan Dan newspaper, and said Vietnam had lodged a formal
protest. The protest note accused China of serious violation of Vietnamese
sovereignty and demanded the marker be removed.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment and there was no immediate
independent confirmation of Vietnamese claims.
The Spratly island group consists of 33 islands and 400 islets and atolls,
straddling shipping lanes in the South China Sea. Its considerable strategic
value is complemented by rich fishing grounds and deposits of oil and gas.
Besides Vietnam and China, there are four other claimants to part or all of
the disputed archipelago - the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei.
Vietnam protested loudly in May when China gave oil prospecting rights
between the Spratlys and the Vietnamese coast to a US company, fearing
Beijing was, in effect, annexing the territory.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Toyota sees sales recovery
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA Motor, Japan's largest car maker, yesterday said the Japanese
automobile market had hit bottom and predicted increased sales in the months
ahead as government measures to stimulate the economy took effect.
The prediction by one of Japan's largest industrial companies marks an
important change in attitude that contrasts with the widespread gloom among
Japanese manufacturers, who have been struck hard by the slowdown in the
Japanese economy.
A recovery in automobile demand could mark a turning point for the economy
as a whole, given the industry's size. Automobile sales led the economy down
last year, along with housing, which has since shown signs of recovery.
The upbeat prediction came as Toyota revised its domestic sales projections
for the calendar year downward by 4 per cent to 2.36m units, roughly the
same as last year. The entire decline, however, came in the first half of
the year, when sales fell by 4 per cent to 1.17m units. Toyota expects sales
to rise by 5 per cent year-on-year in the second half of the year, to 1.9m
units.
Mr Soichiro Toyoda, Toyota president, pointed out that industry-wide sales
had increased year-on-year in June for the first time in 14 months.
Mr Toyoda's upbeat remarks came as Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan
Motor, said that Nissan was considering whether to slash its capital
spending plans in the current fiscal year, which began in April, in response
to poor sales. Sales of Nissan cars fell by 5.3 per cent to 288,232 units in
the April-to-June quarter.
Nissan had budgeted Y240bn (Pounds 1bn) for capital spending this year,
Y30bn below last year.
Meanwhile, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, acknowledged
that the clearing of excess inventories, which has depressed manufacturing
activity, would take longer than originally expected. But he predicted,
based on reports from branch managers of the central bank who met on Monday,
that this process would be completed in the fourth quarter of the year.

FT  09 JUL 92 / HK airport financing under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Air Transport Association (Iata), the airline industry
grouping, yesterday attacked the way Hong Kong planned to finance its
multi-billion dollar airport project.
It asserted there were better ways to fund the scheme than trying to raise
HKDollars 4.3bn (Pounds 290m) between now and 1997 through a charge levied
on airlines using the colony's current international airport.
On the eve of Mr Chris Patten's arrival today to assume the governorship of
the colony, Mr Gunter Eser, Iata's director-general, speaking in Hong Kong
yesterday, called on the government to reconsider. He claimed plans to
treble charges at Kai Tak, Hong Kong's existing international airport, were
discriminatory.
He said the proposals were made because the government wanted to pay back
loans on the airport too quickly and was demanding an unrealistic 15 per
cent return on the airport investment.
Mr Eser said that to reduce the cost to users, the government could allow
airlines to take equity in the airport or use alternative sources of finance
to fund the project - such as Kai Tak's recurrent profits and the tax the
government levies on departing visitors.
However, Mrs Anson Chan, a senior civil servant, said it was fair that those
who benefited from the new airport should pay for it. If the airlines paid
less taxpayers would have to pay more.
Iata argued that airlines should not pay until the airport came into use. It
cited an International Civil Aviation Organisation recommendation that
airport users should not be charged for facilities and services they do not
use.
The government responded that the new airport represented an expansion of
Hong Kong's international aviation facilities and that for any utility,
prices for existing services rise as the construction of new capacity is
embarked on. Officials pointed out that Kai Tak would close when the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok opened.
In a related development, Wen Wei Po, a Beijing-funded daily, sought to put
the blame for any delay in the airport's construction with Britain.
In a commentary on unsuccessful Sino-British talks held this week in Beijing
it said it was unreasonable for the UK to ask China to accept a financial
plan that was short of details and did not have a ceiling. 'If there is any
delay, Britain should be blamed for being too careless when drawing up the
financial plan which is not in line with the memorandum of understanding,'
the newspaper said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton took another step towards uniting the Democratic party
behind his run for the White House yesterday by winning the endorsement of
Mr Paul Tsongas, who mounted the strongest challenge to him during this
spring's primaries.
Mr Tsongas declined to endorse Mr Clinton immediately after he withdrew from
the race, but was due to announce his endorsement in Boston yesterday after
winning an opportunity to speak to the Democratic convention in New York
next week.
'Bill Clinton won the nomination and I did not. Were I the victor I would
expect him to endorse me,' said the former Massachusetts senator.
Mr Clinton and Mr Tsongas often differed during the primary campaign. Mr
Tsongas accused his opponent of 'pandering' to voters with his call for a
cut in taxes on middle income families. Mr Tsongas sought to convert the
Democratic party to a more business-oriented economic policy.
Nevertheless, the Arkansas governor yesterday hinted that he might offer
more than a speaking slot to Mr Tsongas, should he win the presidency.
Barely a month ago, segments of the Democratic party establishment were
keeping Mr Clinton at arm's length, even though he had enough votes to win
the nomination.
But the Clinton campaign has gradually brought together one-time critics,
such as Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, who this week agreed to make the
formal speech nominating his fellow governor at the convention.
Mr Clinton still has differences with Mr Jesse Jackson, whose demands posed
many problems for Democratic nominees at the 1984 and 1988 conventions, or
with Mr Jerry Brown, whose unconventional campaign won him more than 600
delegates and who wants Mr Clinton to accept his 'humility agenda'.

   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community must 'attempt less, and accomplish better what it
does attempt,' it was told yesterday by its new British presidency.
In a speech to the European parliament outlining a low-key and pragmatic UK
programme for the next six months, Mr Douglas Hurd, British Foreign
Secretarypledged 'energy and determination' in consolidating the EC's nearly
finished single market programme and its unfinished negotiations on future
financing and in opening up the EC more to the world with agreements on Gatt
and Community enlargement. But his rather dour message that Britain would
not be in 'the business of ignoring what is difficult, or of chalking up
easy agreements' did not go down very well with most MEPs.
Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the 180-strong Socialist group, the biggest in
the Strasbourg assembly, warned that the UK had no right to impose its
minimalist view of Europe on others, or to use enlargement as a pretext to
weaken integration.
The idea of legislative self-restraint is perhaps least appealing to the
European Parliament, which feels that even the controversial Maastricht
union treaty has failed to give it adequate say in EC law-making.
But Mr Hurd said that even where the EC has unquestioned competence, it
should think twice before legislating because 'excessive intrusion is one of
the accusations most often brought against it'.
Britain would work to give subsidiarity, or the principle of minimum
interference, concrete shape.
Mr Hurd spelt out several priority areas:
Britain intended to complete the last - and by definition hardest - 10 per
cent of legislation needed to create the EC single market plan.
The eventual compromise on future EC financing would have to cater for the
needs of - and Maastricht pledges to - poorer states .. 'But the final
agreement will need to .. recognise the budgetary pressures faced by all
member states.' The UK presidency would persevere with the Gatt talks,
because failure 'would confound our hopes for a more prosperous world and
run counter to Europe's interests'.

FT  09 JUL 92 / OECD forecasts French economy will grow 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French economy has performed better than most of the world's leading
industrial countries, but will only gradually return to a faster rate of
growth, according to the latest annual report by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
After last year's real growth in output of only 1 1/4 per cent, the OECD
anticipates growth of about 2 per cent this year, followed by 2 1/2 per cent
in 1993.
The one aspect of the French economy which remains a black spot is the high
level of unemployment, which has remained in the 9-10 per cent range for
about eight years, 'one of the worst outcomes among OECD countries'.
Since there is little or nothing the French government can do to hasten
economic recovery in the short term, the Paris-based organisation urges it
to stick more firmly to its established medium-term policy guidelines,
notably its earlier trajectory of steadily declining budget deficits.
For the past two years, the national budget has swung into unplanned levels
of deficit as a result of the economic slowdown. Now that recovery lies
ahead, says the OECD, the government should hold down spending increases
below the level of GDP growth, especially on current expenditure, whereas
capital spending should be maintained.
The report rejects suggestions the government could hasten economic recovery
by a monetary relaxation and a devaluation of the franc.
It also rejects the argument that this would allow lower interest rates and
faster export growth as a result of greater competitiveness. The credibility
of the government's successful anti-inflation policy would be destroyed, and
the risk premium embodied in long-term interest rates would almost certainly
rise.
'A policy reversal would not be consistent with France's central role in the
process of European economic and monetary integration; it would also
discredit the whole European enterprise,' says the OECD.
'Given a continuation of prudent macro-economic policies, once the current
slow-down in partner countries is overcome, there is every reason to believe
that activity will pick up and unemployment will begin to ease, while
disinflation resumes and competitiveness continues to improve'.
To help deal with the structural problem of unemployment, especially among
the young,the OECD recommends the balance of labour market policy should be
shifted away from unemployment benefit and early retirement, towards more
active training and job placement policies.

<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday broke the back of the 10-day truck strike,
as riot police escorted most of the protesting drivers away from motorways
and continued to make arrests.
Traffic started to flow again on most main inter-city routes by mid
afternoon, but motorway organisations warned that it will be several days
before roads are back to normal.
The end of the blockade comes as 5m French and foreign tourists are expected
to drive across France in the next few days.
The strike, over tough new driving regulations, has cost the tourism
industry, France's biggest foreign exchange earner, FFr1bn (Pounds 100m),
estimated Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister. He was considering
aid for farmers' wasted produce, and for small businesses, which had
suffered more than big companies.
The government persuaded drivers to lift the blockades with a mixture of
threatened and real force, plus negotiations to ease the impact of the new
rules, under which drivers risk being banned after getting six penalty
points. Truckers argue that many risk losing their jobs because the long
distances they drive mean they cannot avoid losing points.
Riot police started removing road blocks peacefully on Monday, but started
to use force as they stepped up their campaign on Tuesday. By early
yesterday morning truckers started to drive off of their own accord, having
had a day to digest the contents of a pay and working conditions accord
between the government, unions and truckers' organisations.
As a mark of the international impact of the strike, the Belgian government
announced it would review the application of its own proposed points system,
contained in a 1990 law which has yet to be put into effect.
The Spanish government, estimating losses in agriculture and tourism at
around Pta3bn (Pounds 16.4m), sent France a formal note of complaint on
Tuesday and said it would seek compensation. Spain's National Farmers' Union
estimated farmers had lost Pta6.2bn in exports.
Industries hit by supply shortages began to recover as deliveries started
again yesterday. Renault resumed production at its Douai car plant in the
north, though a plant at Vilvoorde near Brussels was brought to a halt by
parts shortages. The Peugeot car plants at Poissy outside Paris also resumed
working.

NEW genetically engineered food and food ingredients would be subject to
common authorisation procedures under a proposal approved yesterday by the
EC Commission.
The regulation which the 12 are expected to approve would monitor such
products as the 'flavour-saver' tomato - dependent on a gene which blocks
the ripening process - or the 'viruscoat' protein for potatoes, to cut use
of chemical products during storage.
The planned law, to cover everything except additives, should screen the
entry of all new or genetically altered substances into the food chain.
Manufacturers will first have to notify their national authorities of a new
product, which will look at it in the light of 'generally accepted
scientific criteria' and the new regulation. Normally, the product will be
waved through. But 'if there is a substance on which there is no established
history of safe use, then it has to be authorised' by a committee of
scientific experts from member states.
The move drew fire from Green Euro-MPs who called it 'a collection of giant
loopholes'.

FT  09 JUL 92 / Russian defence ministry turns on Kozyrev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A BITTER struggle erupted yesterday within the Russian government, as the
ministries of defence and security turned on Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign
minister - accusing him of doing the job of US intelligence in seeking the
reform of the security and defence systems.
Their spokesmen rejected claims by Mr Kozyrev last week, that a 'party of
war' was operating in military circles and that security and defence
officials were nurturing a coup. They said that local disturbances based on
economic grievances were possible, however.
They said Mr Kozyrev's call for 'radical reform' of the KGB and defence
departments would destroy the professional competence of these agencies  -
the aim of the US Central Intelligence Agency.
Last week Mr Kozyrev also accused the Russian military of supplying the bulk
of the arms being used in the conflict in Moldova and its breakaway region
of TransDnestr, and asked - 'Why are the military deciding major political
questions? When tanks turn into an independent political force, this spells
catastrophe.'
General Alexander Lebed, recently appointed head of the 14th Russian Army in
the TransDnestr, which has a majority Russian/Ukrainian population,
responded by saying that Moldova's government was a 'fascist' one and that
the TransDnestr, which is claiming independent status, would be defended.
The defence ministry yesterday refused to condemn General Lebed's remarks.
On the contrary, General Alexei Gulko, one of its representatives, said that
'Alexander Lebed is a Russian patriot, and his statement met with
understanding from the officers of the 14th Army.'
The defence and security ministries initiative yesterday casts doubt on the
worth of the agreement reached at the meeting of the heads of the
Commonwealth of Independent States on Monday to send a peace-keeping force
to Moldova to separate the warring forces.
A ceasefire called in the region for Tuesday night was reported to have been
violated several times yesterday, and the government of Belarus, one of the
states which was to have sent a peace-keeping contingent, said it will not
do so.
However, Marshall Yevgenny Shaposhnikov, head of the CIS armed forces -
which largely now consists of strategic nuclear weapons - said yesterday
that General Boris Pyankov, his deputy, would be in charge of settling armed
conflicts within the CIS countries - and that foreign and defence ministers
are scheduled to meet in Minsk next Thursday to define how and where a
peace-keeping force would be used.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS yesterday accused G7 leaders of failing to keep their
promises, Reuter reports.
The final summit communique said last month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
had heightened awareness of global environmental problems. 'Rapid and
concrete action is required to follow through on our commitments on climate
change, to protect forests and oceans, to preserve marine resources and to
maintain bio-diversity.'
It listed nine action points which were almost identical to a proposal
agreed by EC leaders in Lisbon last month.
Environmentalist groups were not impressed. 'The G7 leaders reveal an
inability or unwillingness to think through the environmental implications
of the major issues that occupied them,' said Mr Scott Hajost, of the US
Environmental Defence Fund.
Mr Andrew Dilworth, of Britain's Friends of the Earth, said the leaders were
like actors who had dried up and could only repeat the same old lines.
'After the Earth Summit, the G7 should be setting an example by announcing
detailed plans to reduce their emissions of the main greenhouse gas, carbon
dioxide.'
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, was heckled at a news conference by a man
shouting that the summit was nothing but empty words and 'something must be
done' to save the forests.
In their statement, the G7 also:
Reaffirmed their commitment to supporting reforms in eastern Europe. They
backed reallocation of a Dollars 1bn fund for Polish foreign currency
stabilisation, which has not been drawn upon, to strengthen companies'
competitiveness.
Accepted Japan's invitation to a summit in Tokyo next July.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: G7's annual gathering borders on the
irrelevant - Nothing was decided in Munich that could not have been
determined in other national, bilateral and multilateral forums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS too easy to say the Group of Seven economic summits have outlived
their purpose. What is becoming increasingly apparent, however, is that
there is no point in holding them, like clockwork, once a year.
They should be convened not merely for serious discussions, but when there
is something serious to decide. There is a big difference between the two.
Gatt, the state of the world economy, the importance of financial and other
assistance to the former Soviet republics and, on the political side, the
plight of what was Yugoslavia, all constitute serious subjects.
But on none of them was anything decided in Munich that could not have been
determined in other national, bilateral and multilateral forums and, in the
case of the world economy and supporting President Boris Yeltsin, already
has been.
A case existed for a summit devoted to giving what is now laughably called
the final political push to a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
But it has been apparent for some weeks that France did not want a Gatt
agreement as a hostage to fortune prior to its September referendum on the
Maastricht treaty, while President George Bush is equally nervous about
alienating his farmers before November's presidential election.
For all the heads of government, their finance and foreign ministers and
other officials beyond number to convene in Munich to hear the obvious makes
mockery of the process. The sheer size, formality and expense of the summit
exercise may also be questioned in the age of instant and efficient
technological communication.
Of course, much is made of the value of the informal exchanges that
summiteers may derive from their wining and dining. The problem is that this
goes on all the time anyway. They all met in Rio de Janeiro less than a
month ago for the Earth Summit, and the Europeans in Lisbon 10 days back.
Mr John Major met Mr Bush in Washington prior to the Earth Summit and Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan met the US president last week. Mr Bush and Mr
Brian Mulroney of Canada confer all the time.
Mr Yeltsin has been to Washington, Ottawa, London and Paris since becoming
president. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand are
always getting together. It is hardly as if the leaders do not know each
other, with the possible exception of Mr Giuliano Amato, the new Italian
prime minister.
A case once existed for building up the G7 into something it was not,
perhaps by providing it with a permanent secretariat beyond the floating
crew of sherpas. But the determination of all G7 countries to vest the
United Nations with greater authority, together with renewed reliance on the
technocrats of the International Monetary Fund, has rendered this
unnecessary.
A summit might also be appropriate to celebrate something remarkable - the
collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, for example.
Houston in 1990 and London last year constituted such, in their way,
appropriate venues, given the roles played by President Ronald Reagan and
Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Causes for celebration are not now conspicuously
evident.
There used to be a belief, too, that national electorates would be impressed
by their political leaders striding purposefully on the world stage, or
being ferried around on golf carts.
However, the domestic political benefits of summits has always been wishful
thinking.
President Gerald Ford hosted the second summit in Puerto Rico in 1976 and
was out of office a few months later. Venice in 1980 did nothing for
President Jimmy Carter nor Tokyo in 1986 for Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone. The
casualty list is so long that it is surely apparent that most people back
home care little.
It can be worse, too. Mr Bush is not getting the glowing press coverage of
his performance at Munich, while Mr Major is not without egg on his face for
his aborted attempt to rescue Gatt. It is hard to think of a single
statesman who leaves with an enhanced reputation.
The curious thing is that the above criticism is not confined to the
thousands of journalists who scurry from one national briefing to another in
search of the slightest nuance. It is now the stuff of private conversations
of any number of senior officials gathered here.
One finance minister has been heard to remark he enjoyed his holiday in
Munich.
The perfect testament to the irrelevance of this summit is that it has
effectively been hijacked by Mr Yeltsin, whose country is not even a member
and who has come to Munich cap in hand.
The conclusion must be that summits can still serve a purpose, but that this
must be evident beforehand. The emptiness of all the communiques and
statements issued in Munich demonstrates a lack of this essential
ingredient.
Organisations survive by adapting to change. Party political conventions in
the US are under fire because they no longer serve their original purpose of
choosing presidential candidates, who emerge from the preceding primaries.
The annual economic summit of the biggest and richest nations faces a
comparable challenge.
Its future and relevance are now in doubt. The summiteers should count
themselves lucky that Bavaria is rich enough to foot the bill, but it is
easy to think of better homes for its money.

<TEXT>
THE world's leading industrial democracies yesterday vowed to make another
attempt to resolve the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
But it became clear that a breakthrough cannot be expected before France's
September referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Undeterred by their failure to meet an end-1991 deadline for concluding the
round that was agreed at last year's London summit, they set the end of 1992
as a new deadline.
In their statement at the end of this year's summit, the leaders of the US,
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Commission
expressed 'regret' at the slow pace of negotiations since the London
meeting. But said they were convinced a balanced agreement was within reach.
The communique said that an accord to create more open markets for goods and
services 'will require comparable efforts from all negotiating partners'.
The statement, which G7 officials said represented a firmer commitment than
last year's, outlined areas of further work for negotiators in the trade
round, which is being carried out under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The G7 leaders said more work was required on making internal farm support
consistent with the EC's recently adopted reform of the common agricultural
policy as well as on dealing with volumes of subsidised exports and the
avoidance of future trade disputes. Problems over market access and trade in
cereal substitutes also had to be resolved.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, who tried and failed to achieve a
breakthrough on Gatt at the meeting, said afterwards that he thought
progress had been made. He warned that Britain would keep returning to the
subject and he would 'continue to bully and badger, cajole and encourage the
negotiators to get together for there to be a speedy settlement without
delay'.
The remaining gap in the Uruguay Round talks was relatively small, he said.
In Britain's case 'we could settle our differences in 30 minutes'.
President George Bush also said he was ready to conclude a Gatt agreement
'right now'.
However, the best time for such negotiations is generally considered to be
between the French referendum and the US presidential election at the
beginning of November. This is understood to be the view of the European
Commission, which is the Gatt negotiator for the Community.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who chaired the summit, said the talks in Munich had
shown that a breakthrough and a balanced result on Gatt were possible. 'I'm
not only optimistic,' he said. 'I will go further. I expect that we will at
last have reached that objective by the end of this year.'
Mr Major said it was 'essential to have a discussion here. As a result, we
have got a firmer commitment to detailed negotiations on the outstanding
issues than we have had before.'
Although his efforts seemed to many observers to be a political setback, he
won support from some delegations. 'If no European had tried, if there had
been no signal from Europe, we would have had a very unhappy President
Bush,' a Canadian official said.
In Geneva, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, said there would be
disappointment that recognition that a balanced trade agreement was within
reach had 'not led to a more substantial step forward in Munich'.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Mitterrand basks in the Bosnia afterglow
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the combined efforts of the 'Anglo-Saxon' press to blame France
for the failure to achieve a breakthrough on Gatt, President Francois
Mitterrand was looking particularly relaxed at the end of the summit.
Gatt aside, he has had a good conference. The international prestige he
gained by his recent walkabout in Sarajevo placed him at the centre of the
debate on Yugoslavia. His views on dealing with the situation there were
listened to with respect and were fully reflected in the leaders' special
statement on the subject.
It was Mr Mitterrand who proposed that the European Community peace
conference on Yugoslavia, chaired by Lord Carrington, should be expanded
into a wider international conference under United Nations aegis, a
suggestion not entirely to Britain's taste.
At his final news conference, Mr Mitterrand went out of his way to reject
the conventional wisdom in the conference centre, which the US delegation
did nothing to dispel, that France's relations with the US had reached rock
bottom. Not at all, he proclaimed. His personal relationship with President
George Bush was excellent. They agreed on many more issues than they
disagreed over. If their views on Gatt, though closer than before, were
still some way apart, that was normal for two leaders representing different
national interests.
Nor was the French president ready to accept, somewhat less convincingly,
that he could make no more concessions on Gatt agricultural problems before
the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September.
France, after all, had agreed to the recent reforms of the EC's common
agricultural policy regardless of the unfavourable domestic reactions these
were bound to cause. France was as anxious as anyone to reach an equitable
Gatt agreement, he said, but this required concessions by all sides. The
ball was now in the US court. He was fully prepared to examine any new
proposals from Washington before the French referendum.
Normally rendered comatose by technical economic discussions, Mr Mitterrand
found the predictable economic platitudes dispensed by his colleagues on
this occasion rather more comprehensible and to his liking. Even he found no
difficulty in subscribing to concepts such as 'world growth is the
prerequisite for solving a variety of challenges we face in the post-cold
war world' (the words of the final communique) and to joint action to assure
that the sluggish global economic recovery gathers strength.
Basking in the Bosnian after-glow, Mr Mitterrand found no reason to share
the widely-held view that G7 summits had become an expensive waste of time.
The debate on Yugoslavia gave him a good opportunity to hold forth on a
subject with which he feels comfortable and on which he has well-defined
views. And the park around the Residenz palace where the conference was held
allowed him to take walks among the trees he loves so much as a relief from
growth and interest rates.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Kohl tries to dispel domestic disquiet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the Munich summit extravaganza is likely to
prove a mixed blessing.
He managed to get through the event unscathed by any substantial criticism
of Germany's budget deficit and high interest rates. By producing his draft
budget for next year just a week beforehand, showing a strict 2.5 per cent
nominal spending growth, he defused any harsh words there might have been.
On the home front, however, the sight of huge security arrangements,
cavalcades and celebrations for his fellow-heads of state, and the bill  -
at an estimated DM35m (Pounds 12m) - have irritated the electorate. 'It's a
disgrace,' was the most printable comment from a Munich taxi driver.
The perception of conspicuous consumption was compounded by graphic
television pictures of Bavarian police manhandling demonstrators who dared
to boo and whistle at the visitors. Add to this the feeling that on the
environmental front, including action to make safe the worst nuclear
reactors in eastern Europe, Mr Kohl secured less than he should or could
have done, and it is no wonder he was on the defensive at his closing press
conference.
When asked why there was no successful conclusion on Gatt, Mr Kohl insisted
negotiating positions had converged in recent months. He stopped short of
blaming his friend President Francois Mitterrand for the final stumbling
block, as some of his colleagues had done, but he was confident there would
be a deal by the year's end.
When questioned on the half-baked nuclear deal, he admitted it was only a
first step, but Germany could not do it alone.
An attack on police tactics won the longest reply of all.
The whole point of the summit was to 'show Germany in a most commendable
light, and at the same time to fulfil the demands made of us
internationally,' Mr Kohl said. 'When flags are flown, and leaders of other
countries visit us, this must happen in an atmosphere of dignity.
'People who come along to shout unpleasant things at guests should not
expect any sympathy. It is deliberately doing down our country.'
It was an answer that might appeal to the conservative lobby. But it will
not dispel the impression of an extravagant event, with too little substance
to appeal to voters.

FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Soviet N-reactor safety cash cut down to
Dollars 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the G7 yesterday failed to agree on a Dollars 700m emergency fund
to make Soviet-designed nuclear reactors safe, but decided on a much smaller
Dollars 100m fund to complement their bilateral programmes.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl admitted that the outcome amounted only to 'the first
steps. Much larger steps are necessary in the future'.
The G7 did agree to back a common programme of action, based on the
conclusions of a nuclear safety working group, which warned that no fewer
than 25 power stations in Russia and eastern Europe should be closed
urgently.
However, the lack of alternative energy supplies means that at first only
emergency safety measures will be carried out. The 15 remaining
Chernobyl-type reactors, and 10 other early model pressurised water reactors
will stay in operation until alternatives are available.
The programme contains three parts: urgent safety measures on the power
stations; more substantial redesign alterations; and help for the affected
countries in establishing more rigorous safety control and inspection.
The plan is to carry out the programme through bilateral contracts, all
co-ordinated through the 24 OECD industrialised countries, and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The compromise on financing amounts to a disappointment for the Europeans,
and above all for Mr Kohl, although all attempted to put a brave face on it
yesterday.
It resulted from US and Japanese resistance to the idea of a common nuclear
safety fund. On the US side, this was stated as a worry that a multilateral
fund would be excessively bureaucratic, and take too long to put into
action. US officials also expressed doubt about the ability of the EBRD to
supervise the entire programme.
Japanese doubts about the effectiveness of a multilateral fund were
compounded by unwillingness to make substantial further financial
commitments until the political dispute with Russia over the ownership of
the Kurile islands is resolved. The Chancellor questioned Japan's reserve.
'Japan is pretty close to Vladivostok. There are nuclear power stations in
Vladivostok, of the same design,' he said.
Officials involved in the programme suspect that a desire to protect
national nuclear contractors, such as Westinghouse in the US, Siemens' KWU
in Germany, Framatome in France, GEC in Britain, and Mitsubishi in Japan,
also made agreement difficult.
The Dollars 100m fund will be used to carry out those emergency measures
which the bilateral contracts fail to include. The European argument in
favour of a joint programme was based on the fear that individual countries
would avoid the most difficult safety programmes.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said all G7 members would
contribute to the smaller fund, a success in itself in persuading some
movement from the US. Non-G7 countries will be encouraged to contribute.

FT  08 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Barter trade to grow with CIS states
despite big risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPENSATION trade, a sophisticated form of barter, will grow in importance
with the financially-pressed states of the former Soviet Union, according to
Mr Hans-Joachim Skrobanek, a specialist in this field who heads Finance by
Trade (FTB), a subsidiary of Berliner Bank.
The risks involved are considerable and grow with the number of official
approvals needed before Russian and Ukrainian products, for example, can get
from the producer to the western buyer. 'Each one of the official links can
fail to keep a promise or simply break it,' he said.
Nevertheless, compensation trade, or buy-back as it is also known, was
likely to make up a significant proportion of German trade with CIS
republics and some eastern European countries for some time to come. One
reason was that the German government was unlikely to expand its Hermes
export credit guarantees for CIS beyond the DM10bn (Dollars 6.5bn) promised
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Mr Skrobanek estimated that in 1990, 25 per cent of west German exports to
the Soviet Union were based on compensation trade and variations of it. The
percentage rose sharply in 1991 when many Russian companies carried out
non-approved barter deals with the west.
FTB, which does nearly DM150m (Dollars 98.6m) in business with the east  -
mainly Russia - is the only compensation trade company owned by a German
bank. Nearly half its customers are east German companies whose trade with
the CIS has declined greatly.
There has been a recent fall, however, in barter-type transactions with the
CIS as deals need to be individually approved by the Russian government.
This has been a reaction to an estimated outflow in 1990/91 of DM12bn-DM15bn
which was deposited by Russian companies in western bank accounts after the
old approval mechanism broke down, Mr Skrobanek said. The companies are now
forced to pay nearly half of the hard currency they earn to the state and
receive roubles in return.
The Russian government's refusal to allow Russian companies to deposit their
earnings from barter trade in western banks has made barter deals more risky
for western exporters.
Oil, precious metals and chemicals remain the products most commonly
bartered by the Russians but even these run up against logistical problems.
Heating oil and metal ore are partly shipped via Baltic ports but the
newly-independent Baltic republics frequently restrict the amounts, and the
ports of Leningrad and Kaliningrad cannot cope with any increase.
Romania and Bulgaria, whose market economies are rudimentary, have the
greatest need for barter trade in eastern Europe. By contrast, only 5 per
cent of the trade with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary - all of which
have internal convertibility of their currencies - is based on barter deals.

pipeline across the Andes at an estimated cost of Dollars 200m, writes
Leslie Crawford in Santiago.
The pipeline, which will be ready in late 1993, will link oil fields in the
Argentine province of Neuquen to an Enap refinery in Concepcion, southern
Chile. An extension to the port of San Vicente will give Argentina a Pacific
outlet for its crude exports.

<TEXT>
THE German authorities carried out a huge operation yesterday to seize
documents from nine German companies which are suspected of illegally
exporting weapons materials to Iraq, AP reports from Darmstadt.
The action in the western Rhineland area was part of ongoing government
attempts to track down businesses that supplied Iraq with parts for
President Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons programme.
The Darmstadt prosecutor's office said that 400 customs investigation
officials and 11 state prosecutors were involved in the series of raids
against the suspected companies. The case against the companies, which were
not named, is based on a report issued in January by United Nations weapons
inspectors.
The UN's report cited evidence that Iraq was trying to build special
centrifuges which are needed to produce enriched uranium used for assembling
nuclear weapons.
Companies throughout Germany were said to be implicated in the supply of
parts.
Stung by criticism that German companies for many years sold arms to foreign
dictators, the country's parliament gave the go-ahead in February for tough
new weapons export controls.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Italians lobby Brittan on steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S new government is lobbying Sir Leon Brittan, the European
Community's Commissioner for competition policy, on behalf of the
loss-making Ilva state steel group, just as discussions start today on
initiating a formal procedure against the company's recent capital
increases.
The government has argued that Ilva's two-stage L650bn (Dollars 566m)
capital increase represents urgent assistance for restructuring, rather than
state subsidies, which would infringe EC rules.
In a letter to Sir Leon, Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the new industry minister, has
repeated the previous government's support for Ilva's plans to quote its
shares and bring in new private-sector steelmaking partners.
Mr Guarino has offered to come to Brussels to explain in detail the new
government's position, which is identical to that of Mr Giulio Andreotti,
Italy's former prime minister. The same message was conveyed to Sir Leon
yesterday by Mr Federico di Roberto, Italy's EC ambassador.
Commission concern about a possible strategy shift grew last month when Ilva
announced a L498bn 1991 loss. The results cast doubts on the company's
intentions to go public, as Italian bourse rules require companies to show
three consecutive years of profits before floating their shares. There have
also been delays in Ilva's plans to bring in private-sector steelmakers at
its big Piombino plant in Tuscany.
In its new initiative, the government has asked for more time to present its
case before the Commission decides on a formal procedure.
The request follows a meeting in Brussels last week between Sir Leon, Mr
Franco Nobili, chairman of the IRI state holding company which owns Ilva,
and Mr Giovanni Gambardella, Ilva's chief executive. Mr Nobili then
discussed the outcome with Mr Guarino on his return, leading to the latest
appeal.
The government has stressed that Ilva's 1991 losses stem purely from the
decision to divert capital gains from asset sales into a special reserve
fund, rather than to cover operating losses. Plans for a flotation remain on
course, as the company is expected to opt for the expedient of merging with
an already-quoted concern. The most likely vehicle would be Dalmine, a north
Italian tube-maker in which Ilva has a 66 per cent stake.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Pentland to buy Adidas from BTF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PENTLAND Holdings, the UK consumer products company, yesterday ended weeks
of negotiations by agreeing to buy Adidas, the German sporting goods group,
from Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF), in a deal worth worth DM621m (Pounds
215m).
The transaction, which values Adidas at FFr3.1bn (Pounds 300m), ends
speculation about the future direction of cash-rich Pentland. The UK company
first set its sights on Adidas last summer, when it negotiated the purchase
of 20 per cent stake and an option on a further 5 per cent in BTF for Pounds
46m.
Pentland became a stock market favourite in the 1980s on the windfall
Dollars 777m profit from its investment in Reebok, the US sports shoe
company. Mr Frank Farrant, Pentland finance director, insisted the company
had not been 'bounced into a deal' by press speculation about management
bids.
'Pentland had always made it clear we would be very interested in taking
control of this company at the right price,' Mr Farrant said. 'If you look
at the price we paid relative to the DM1bn that was mooted last week, it is
a very good price.'
The deal is a watershed for Mr Tapie, who has been struggling to repay debts
he took on to buy Adidas two years ago.
Pentland has agreed to pay DM621m in cash for BTF's 58 per cent stake in BTF
GmbH and also to buy out the other minority investors. Pentland's shares
rose 14p to 144p in London. BTF's shares remained suspended in Paris at
FFr130.

FT  08 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Recs gain on price leniency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE regional electricity distribution companies ('Recs') surged after news
that the electricity industry watchdog, Offer, is to impose a more lenient
price formula on the National Grid Company (Gridco) than had been forecast
by some analysts.
Offer announced yesterday that, as from April 1993, electricity price rises
would be allowed to rise by the retail price index (RPI) minus three
percentage points. As recently as last week there had been rumours in the
market that a much stricter formula of RPI minus five points would be
introduced.
Gridco is owned by the 12 Recs which derive some 10 per cent of profits from
their holdings in Gridco.
'This is a good result for the electricity distribution sector,' said Mr
Kevin Lapwood, a utilities specialist at Nomura. Other analysts said the
review was certainly not as bad as had been expected, with a pricing formula
of RPI minus four points said to have been the general consensus figure. 'It
doesn't choke off the Recs' dividend policy which is targeted at seven or
eight per cent real growth,' said one observer.
The Offer news coincided with good results from Seeboard and Yorkshire
Electricity, with Seeboard's 17 per cent dividend increase 'trumping the
rest of the pack', according to Mr Lapwood. East Midlands delivered the best
individual performance, closing 20 up at 315p, closely followed by Manweb,
373p, and Norweb, 363p, both up 18, and Yorkshire, 17 firmer at 383p. The
Electricity Package, which ceases trading on September 16, when the packages
are split up, raced up 150 to Pounds 3,148.
BAe active
Speculation early in the session that Italy or Spain could soon follow
Germany out of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), put the skids under
British Aerospace (BAe), the UK's lead contractor on the project, sending
the shares tumbling to a new low.
At the day's worst, the shares were off 29 at 208p, though few shares
changed hands at that stage. Concern about the dividend and provisions that
may have to be made for the regional aircraft division also continued to
affect sentiment.
But later reports from Spain that it would remain involved in the project,
combined with 'bottom fishing' by what one analyst called 'those brave
enough to be in this stock', helped the shares rally off the day's low point
to end a net 6 down at 231p, a three-year low.
Wellcome bounce
As the bear raiders begin to lose their influence and the global
book-building exercise gets under way, Wellcome bounced 17 to 900p. One
investment house was talking of bids between 750p and 800p a share for the
330m shares scheduled to be released by Wellcome Trust, the charitable trust
which holds 75 per cent of the stock.
However, Robert Fleming, the private investment bank which is leading the
global flotation, is believed to be confident that the strike price will be
significantly higher. One source close to the company said: 'I would just
draw people's attention to the share price at 900p.'
ICI recovered 6 to 1145p despite a profit forecast cut by securities house
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. UBS reduced its 1992 estimate by Pounds 50m to Pounds
800m and its 1993 figure by Pounds 120m to Pounds 880m. However, the house
maintains a buy recommendation.
The oil majors moved ahead strongly, as did British Gas, but the
second-liners were significantly lower. There were hints around the market
that one of the UK's biggest institutional investors in the oil sector had
been unloading large lines of stock in the smaller exploration stocks such
as Premier, 1 1/2 off at 18 1/2 p, Goal, 2 lower at 49p, Monument Oil &amp; Gas,
a penny easier at 31 3/4 p and Clyde, which dropped 3 to 43p.
But Enterprise Oil improved 6 to 400p despite rumblings around the oil
sector about the resignation of Mr Peter Kingston, Enterprise's technical
director, seen by some analysts as a potential successor to Mr Graham Hearn,
the current chairman and chief executive.
Vodafone was keenly sold, closing 5 off at 326p on 5.5m shares traded amid
fears of much keener competition from Cellnet. Securicor 'A', which has a 40
per cent stake in Cellnet with BT owning 60 per cent, jumped 15 to 571p
after the near-doubled profits. BT moved up 5 1/2 to 346p.
Glaxo bounced 28 to 677p as UK buyers returned. However, one trader said the
stock needed a kick start from some genuine good news before it would see a
return to former levels.
Rumours of a profit forecast cut were said to have prompted a slide in
Fisons. The rumour never materialised into fact but the damage was done and
the shares fell 5 to 210p.
Dollar-sensitive Rothmans International lost 23 to 1076p reflecting a weak
US currency.
Shares in Vickers fell 6 to 135p after two brokers weighed in with savage
profit downgrades. Carr Kitcat reduced its current forecast by Pounds 21m to
Pounds 10m, blaming continued weakness at the company's Rolls-Royce
subsidiary. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was also reported to be expecting profits of
around Pounds 10m.
The building sector tended to absorb another string of profits downgradings.
A big seller moved in on Taylor Woodrow, leaving the stock 5 off at 80p.
Tarmac dropped to 89p after BZW and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew chopped their
profits estimates, but then responded to a flurry of stories suggesting that
Charter Consolidated was still taking a hard look at acquiring the group and
settled 3 up at 96 1/2 p. BZW also lowered its estimates for Blue Circle,
finally 3 firmer at 210p.
With recriminations still flying over the collapse of talks to sell its
catering division, Forte remained friendless. The shares slipped 5 to 173p.
After its recent poor run, Rank Organisation bounced ahead of figures
tomorrow, the shares rising 5 to 628p.
After outperforming the market by some 15 per cent in the last month,
Northern Foods found itself out of favour. Investors took a subtle shift
from Smith New Court as an excuse to take profits. The shares tumbled 14 to
608p

FT  08 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Heavy program selling spurs
decline in Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets fell sharply yesterday on heavy program selling and
continued investor uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and
corporate earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 44.03 at 3,295.17,
with the bulk of the losses incurred in the final hour of trading.
The broader based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, ending
4.67 lower at 409.17, while the Amex composite fell 2.32 to 380.26 and the
Nasdaq composite 5.77 to 557.40.
Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 220m shares and declines outpaced rises by
1045 to 690.
Ever since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week in reaction to
bad employment news, the market has struggled to find a direction. Investors
are hoping that the rate cut will trigger a rush of funds into equities, as
happened the last time the Fed eased, in late 1991, but concern about the
economy and second quarter earnings is keeping enthusiasm in check.
Among individual stocks, Georgia-Pacific fell Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 55 in
heavy trading after the wood and paper products group issued a warning that
its second-quarter results would be only slightly better than break-even and
well below the Dollars 33m profit it reported at the same stage a year ago.
Other paper stocks fell in sympathy, with International Paper dropping
Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 65 3/4 , Louisiana-Pacific falling Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 41 7/8 and Weyerhaeuser easing Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 31 1/8 .
Digital Equipment, bucked the trend, rising Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 34 1/4
as investors bought the stock ahead of yesterday's expected overhaul of the
computer company's product lines, which will include producing new machines
for the mainframe market.
Other computer stocks opened firmer but fell on the late program sales, with
Hewlett-Packard down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63 7/8 , IBM down Dollars 1
3/8 at Dollars 96 3/4 and Motorola Dollars  1/8 weaker at Dollars 75 5/8 .
W R Grace fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 in turnover of 1m shares
after Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street broking house, reduced its rating on
the stock from 'outperform' to 'neutral'.
Motor stocks were mixed, despite news of lower oil prices, with Ford up
Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 42 5/8, General Motors unchanged at Dollars 40&lt; 3/4
and Chrysler Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 19 3/8 .
American Health Products plunged Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 28 3/4 on the news
that the company plans to divest certain psychiatric properties. Although
the company said the divestment would not threaten its dividend, a writedown
may be required.
On the Nasdaq market, Micrografx plummeted Dollars 5 3/4 , or 43 per cent,
to Dollars 7 3/4 after the software company said that charges relating to a
cancelled secondary stock offering and other non-recurring costs would mean
that it will report only break-even per-share results for the fiscal first
quarter.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed lower in active trading. According to preliminary
data, the TSE 300 composite index fell 10.62 points, or 0.31 per cent, to
3,416.29. Declines led advances by 298 to 219. Trading volume of 30.8m
shares was above Monday's 20.6m, and trading value was CDollars 361m
compared with CDollars 242.6m.
Ten of the 14 stock groups closed lower. The industrial products group
posted one of the day's biggest declines, off 1.17 per cent on index.
Energy and golds were down moderately, and financial services, mining, and
consumer products were little changed.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Withholding tax agreement helps lift
German paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that an agreement had finally been reached in Germany on withholding
tax on interest income lifted bund prices yesterday, with gains for both
short and longer-dated bonds. But the bund market failed to take any further
heart from comments by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, that
the German authorities are in a position to cut interest rates soon.
Mr Brady's suggestion that German interest rates could come down - 'not
tomorrow, not the next day, but some time in the near future' - was widely
seen as a manifestation either of wishful thinking or politicking.
A sharp fall in the dollar helped to spur some other bond markets,
particularly Japan.
Yesterday's agreement for a 30 per cent withholding tax in Germany, reached
by an arbitration committee, was in line with the market's hopes. No
attempts will be made to reduce bank secrecy, stemming fears of a capital
flight from the country. The new tax, to be levied from the beginning of
next year, is projected to contribute some DM4bn in 1993 and 1994 to the
German unity fund.
The news helped lift prices - though with a larger than normal issue of
bonds expected later in the week, the reaction was muted. The 8 per cent
bonds due 2002 rose to 100.20 by the close, from 100.16 the previous day. On
Liffe, the bund futures contract, which opened up at 88.19, eased off during
the day to end at around 88.15.
FURTHER sterling weakness yesterday meant a lacklustre day for UK government
bonds, with the pound dropping closer to the 2.88 level against the D-Mark.
The Bank of England was able to supply more gilts to the market, selling
more of the 2 1/2 per cent index-linked issue announced last Friday.
However, the bulk of the Pounds 700m announced continues to hang over the
market, holding back prices.
Prices moved up during the day, only to fall back to around their opening
levels. The partly-paid 9 per cent bonds due 2012 gained  1/32 of a point on
the day to 36 7/8 , while the 11 3/4 per cent bonds due 2003/07 lost  1/32
of a point.
Losses among shorter-dated bonds were more marked, continuing the
disappointment at the Bank of England's failure to engineer an interest rate
cut after optimistic signs on Friday. The 10 per cent gilts maturing in 1996
lost  5/32 of a point, to 103 5/32 .
US Treasury securities retained their firm tone, and with demand stronger at
the market's short end the yield curve continued to steepen.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  7/32 at 104
5/8 , yielding 7.598 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32
at 101 3/16 , to carry a yield of 4.350 per cent.
For the second consecutive day investors showed a preference for shorter
over longer-dated securities, with the yield on the two-year note falling
further than the yield on the 30-year bond.
Analysts said that the steepening of the yield curve was a reflection of
investor concern that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate cut
last week could eventually revive inflationary pressures in the economy over
the longer term.
JAPANESE government bonds continued their advance as the yen gained ground
against the dollar. Although the Bank of Japan continued to signal that a
cut in the Official Discount Rate, currently at 3.75 per cent, was not
imminent, the market remained confident that a cut would come before long.
The benchmark No 129 was trading late in the day in London at a yield of
below 5.20 per cent, down from 5.23 per cent yesterday.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Anti-histamine warning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US Food and Drug Administration yesterday asked Marion Merrell Dow, the
American pharmaceuticals group, to warn doctors that Seldane, its
anti-histamine, is potentially dangerous to certain patients.
The drug had worldwide sales of Dollars 768m last year, of which Dollars
534m were in the US. In the UK, the company claims Seldane is the
best-selling over-the-counter remedy.
The FDA said the drug was potentially dangerous when used by patients with
damaged liver or those taking two other drugs, Ketoconazole, an anti-fungal
treatment, and Erythromycin, an antibiotic. Although one patient has died,
the FDA stressed reactions were rare.
Marion Merrell Dow said it was changing the labels, warning of such problems
and the need to restrict dosing to less than 120mg a day.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: KIO's main Spanish unit 'in
danger of default'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office's main Spanish holding company, Torras, is in
danger of defaulting on a Pounds 100m (Dollars 192m) convertible bond,
should Torras' large chemicals affiliate, Ercros, press ahead with its
decision last week to file for protection from its creditors.
The Pounds 100m Eurobond, issued in 1988 by Phoenix International, is
guaranteed by Torras, which owns 40 per cent of Ercros.
According to the offer document that accompanied the bond issue in 1988,
Ercros is a 'principal associate' and the offer stipulates that any such
company which is unable to pay its debts or suffers the appointment of a
liquidator or receiver, could trigger a default on the bond.
'If Ercros files for protection, it could well trigger an event of default,'
said Mr David Norris, a director of the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, the
trustee of the bonds.
The trustee, however, would then have to evaluate whether the event of
default was prejudicial to bondholders, according to Mr Norris, before
asking for the bonds to be repaid. It could be decided that, if Ercros files
for protection, Torras itself will be in a stronger financial position as a
result, which would in turn benefit the holders whose bonds are guaranteed
by Torras.
The trustee is in communication with Torras, in an effort to clarify the
situation.
An investment banker who was close to the Phoenix bond issue said a default
on the security could have a 'significant effect' on Kuwait's status as a
borrower. Last year, KIO launched a Dollars 5.5bn jumbo bank loan to help
rebuild Kuwait after the Gulf war.

<TEXT>
GEORGIA-PACIFIC, the US paper group, warned yesterday its second quarter
results would be 'slightly better than break-even', with net income lower
than the same period of 1991.
The news hit the company's shares and the paper sector in general, with
Georgia-Pacific stock down Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 55 by the close on Wall
Street.
The company made Dollars 33m, or 38 cents a share, in the second quarter of
last year on revenue of Dollars 2.981bn. The period included an after-tax
gain of Dollars 29m, or 34 cents a share, on the sale of property.
The paper sector has been suffering from a cyclical downturn in profits,
partly because of increased industry capacity, but analysts have been
forecasting a gradual rise in net income during 1992, assuming the US
economy sustains its slow upward momentum. A Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman
noted US prices for timber used by the building industry had dipped somewhat
from the record levels seen during the first quarter of this year, while
paper markets were similar to the first quarter.
During the first quarter, Georgia-Pacific reported record operating profits
of Dollars 183m from its building products division, compared with pulp and
paper profits of Dollars 46m.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Man with a mission moves from
Saab to Opel - Robert Taylor profiles David Herman, new chairman of General
Motors' German subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Herman arrives at the head office of Adam Opel, the German
subsidiary of General Motors, this morning with a mission to halt the
profits slide by boosting productivity and cutting costs.
He takes over after two-and-a-half years as president and chief executive of
Saab Automobile, GM's joint venture with Saab-Scania, where he spearheaded a
turnround in its performance despite the slump in the world car market.
'The underlying problem in Germany is inflation and high costs, but changes
are coming at Opel,' he promises. 'I hope I can be part of the transition to
improved competitiveness.'
Mr Herman comes to his new post as Opel's chairman and managing director
with clear lessons from his Swedish experience: to encourage greater
flexibility and hold down excessive wage costs.
During his spell at Saab he did not take the company back into profit but he
pulled it through a difficult period. In the year before the company was
formed out of Saab-Scania's car division in January 1990, it had make a
SKr2.1bn (Dollars 384m) operating loss.
Mr Herman says he does not know when Saab will be in the black, but its
losses are likely to be much less this year than last year's SKr1.39bn
deficit.
Productivity has more than doubled. In early 1990, it took around 120 hours
to build a Saab car. Now that figure is down to 58 hours. Although still far
behind the Japanese 30 hours per car, it is in the mainstream of European
auto production. It was achieved with plant closures and a cut of nearly
one-third in the workforce. Latest sales figures suggest Saab is bucking the
trend.
In Europe, it increased sales in the first six months of the year by 16 per
cent to 2,500 units, with a 66 per cent surge in Italy. In the vital US
market in June, Saab recorded its highest monthly figure since August 1987,
despite the recession. In Sweden, the Saab 9000 has topped the sales
statistics for three out of the past four months.
'I have been the catalyst for change,' declares Mr Herman, but he is warm in
his enthusiasm for the 'tremendous adaptability' of his Swedish workforce.
'When I arrived the arrows were not pointing in the right direction but now
they are,' he explains. Absenteeism is down from 10 to less than 5 per cent
and labour turnover has declined from 25 to less than 8 per cent. Mr Herman
praises the Swedish trade unions for their positive response. 'It has been a
partnership,' he asserts. 'Our labour people have not just been rubber
stamps. The workforce has been involved in all the discussions. There is a
real team spirit here.' Indeed, union leaders are disappointed at his
departure, even though he was forced to close a new SKr1.3bn assembly plant
in Malmo.
The turnaround at Saab comes from its Swedish managers and workers. Only
around 10 of its personnel were drafted in from outside by GM.
The long, hard road back to profitability at Saab was made no easier by
events outside the company's control. In particular, the low exchange rate
of the US dollar against the over-valued Swedish krona has made it hard to
recover in the US market.
The chairman is critical of past Saab management. 'They were less willing to
accept the burdens of responsibility for productivity problems,' Mr Herman
suggests.
What he believes he provided was a strong sense of leadership. Mr Herman did
not bring the ways of Detroit to Sweden. He remained keen to work with the
grain of the country's industrial culture. However, he also believes Saab is
much more aware of the worldwide perspective.
He also believes the true test of his time at Saab will not come until the
company's new models are in the showrooms in the next few years. 'The
product comes first before anything else,' Mr Herman argues.
Saab is set to sell up to 100,000 cars this year compared with 87,500 in
1991, and he can see the day when the Trollhattan plant will turn out an
annual figure of 150,000. With a new paint shop on stream and an extra 500
jobs to come, he declares that GM is not going to abandon Saab. 'There is no
turning back,' he says.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Saks document shows after-tax
loss of Dollars 398m
</HEADLINE>

   By AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAKS Fifth Avenue, the upmarket US retailer, incurred after-tax losses of
Dollars 398m in the 19 months to January 31 1992, AP-DJ reported yesterday.
It said the figure was disclosed in 'a confidential Saks document' obtained
by Dow Jones.
Yesterday, Mr Arthur Martinez, Saks' vice-chairman, declined to comment on
any specific figures. However, he stressed that the retailer faced no
liquidity problems and had breached no banking covenants. Saks was acquired
from Britain's BAT Industries in 1990 by Investcorp, an investment company
backed by Middle Eastern funds.
Earlier this year, Saks announced that Investcorp was injecting another
Dollars 300m of equity into the retailer - a move which came amid rumours of
poor operating performance and late payments to suppliers. The latter was
emphatically denied, although Saks said trading was 'clearly very
difficult'. Yesterday, Mr Martinez said again that this move was unconnected
to trading results, and designed to continue the 'deleveraging' of the
company.

from sale to BASF

<TEXT>
MOBIL, the US oil and gas group, yesterday said it would record an Dollars
80m third-quarter gain on the sale of its polystyrene resin business to BASF
of Germany.
In the 1991 third quarter the group earned Dollars 365m, or 87 cents a
share, on revenues of Dollars 15bn.
Mobil also said it had further cut its capital appropriations budget for the
year, to Dollars 4bn from Dollars 4.8bn, in response to sluggish economic
growth and depressed margins in its downstream operations and chemicals
business.
At the end of last year, Mobil said its 1992 appropriates budget would be
Dollars 4.8bn, about Dollars 1bn below previous projections.
Mr Allen Murray, Mobil's chairman and chief executive, said: 'At that time,
I indicated that the 1992 budget included Dollars 800m which would not be
appropriated this year unless business conditions improved.'
The company expects the impact from lower appropriations to be seen beyond
1992, since there is a lag between a cut in capital appropriations and lower
capital expenditures.
As a result, 1992 spending will be only slightly below the Dollars 5bn spent
in 1991. Mr Murray said that Mobil's savings from a recently announced
restructuring would be 'greater than previously anticipated'.
Salaried payroll in the US is expected to fall by about 10 per cent, or
2,000 people, by the end of 1992.
In addition, it expects to sell more than Dollars 600m of assets this year,
exceeding 1991 asset sales. Between 1986 and 1990, Mobil sold nearly Dollars
7bn of assets, Mr Murray said.
On Wall Street, Mobil's share price closed Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 62
1/2 .

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex set to mix it with
European heavyweights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pace of takeover activity in Europe's troubled cement sector shows
little sign of slackening as producers struggle against falling sales and
accusations that they have been involved in illegal market-sharing
agreements.
Yesterday's agreed offer by Cementos Mexicanos to buy Spain's largest cement
producer, Valenciana de Cementos, for up to Dollars 1.7bn, represents the
biggest takeover in Spain and the first significant purchase by a North
American cement producer in Europe after a decade of heavy cement
investments in the opposite direction.
Spain is the second largest cement market in Europe, and the takeover bid by
Cemex is a powerful challenge to European dominance of the industry on both
sides of the Atlantic. It places Cemex in direct competition with the giants
of the European Industry, Holderbank, Italcementi and Lafarge Coppee, which
have all made big acquisitions in Spain in the past four years.
But Cemex is entering a period of turmoil in the European cement industry.
The European Community has written to 75 European cement manufacturers and
their subsidiaries accusing them of breaching its competition laws.
Investigations began three years ago after officials became concerned at the
low level of cement exported between neighbouring European countries,
particularly where works were situated close to borders.
This has not prevented some of Europe's biggest building materials companies
from buying substantial interests in cement industries in neighbouring
countries.
Acquisitions and strategic stake-building are increasing. A new development
has been the recent arrival of Italian companies on the takeover trail.
At the end of April, Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement company, paid
FFr6bn (Dollars 1.07bn) for a controlling interest in Ciments Francais,
France's second-largest cement producer.
A month earlier, Calcestruzzi, the Italian maker of ready-mixed concrete
which is a subsidiary of the Ferruzzi group, in a joint venture with the
National Bank of Greece took control of Heracles, one of the two biggest
cement makers in Greece.
It is unclear whether the recent purchases by Italcementi and Calcestruzzi
will prompt further cross-border moves by Italian cement and concrete
companies.
Conversely, it could draw the attention of other manufacturers to Italy,
which remains a highly fragmented market and boasts the world's second
highest per capita consumption of cement behind South Korea.
The driving force behind many cross-border acquisitions has been the desire
of manufacturers to reduce their vulnerability to sharp falls in domestic
construction output. Holderbank of Switzerland, Lafarge Coppee of France and
Blue Circle of the UK, for example, bought heavily in North America in the
1980s.
European purchases, in some cases, may have been also dictated by a desire
to gain control of previously state subsidised companies in eastern and
southern Europe which could undercut local prices by exporting surplus
capacity.
Mr Laurence Amboldt, construction analyst with Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of
the Suez group, says: 'As the major groups look to spread their activities
over a number of European regions in order to reduce the impact of local
construction cycles, works with direct access to waterborne transport will
be seen as particularly valuable as these provide economic transport of
cement to various parts of Europe.'
The result of all this activity has been to reduce the number of independent
cement companies and to concentrate power in the hands of about eight large
European cement groups.
Italcementi, including its controlling interest in Ciments Francais, has
overtaken Holderbank as the biggest seller of cement in Europe. Holderbank,
however, is larger in the US and remains the world's biggest cement group.
Cement prices, however, have remained surprisingly stable despite the
recession in the construction industry, affecting many parts of Europe.
This has led to accusations that relationships between the large cement
manufacturers has become too cosy.
Critics of the industry contrast the stability of cement markets with the
very sharp price falls which have occurred for other basic building
materials.
Companies, meanwhile, have complained to the Commission that Turkish,
Romanian and Tunisian companies have been dumping cut-price cement in Spain,
damaging the local market. Cement prices along the Mediterranean coast of
Spain fell by 15 to 20 per between June and December last year.
Moves by Ciments Francais to establish strategic alliances with cement
manufacturers in Romania - possibly as a prelude to an acquisition - is
regarded by some analysts as a defensive measure to prevent cheap Romanian
cement from flowing into other European markets.
Spain, Europe's fastest growing construction market during the 1980s, has
been a very attractive market for European cement manufacturers both for its
size and the availability of local companies which traditionally have been
family controlled. Most of the leaders have Spanish subsidiaries.
Ciments Francais last month offered Dollars 44m to acquire the outstanding
22 per cent it does not own of Cementos Rezola the biggest cement producer
in the Basque region of Spain. Unifund, a relatively obscure Swiss-based
holding company with cement interests in Asia and South America, has just
taken out an option worth more than Dollars 700m to buy Sanson, Spain
second-largest producer, from the Banesto banking group.

FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cementos Mexicanos to pay up to
Dollars 1.7bn for Valenciana

CEMENTOS Mexicanos yesterday released details of its agreed bid for
Valenciana de Cementos, Spain's largest cement producer. The company is
paying Dollars 1.25bn for a 75.1 per cent stake after acquiring a 24.1 of
Valenciana's treasury stock for Dollars 420m on Monday.
Valenciana, controlled by the Serratosa family, was paid Pta14,850 a share
for its treasury stock and Cemex is to make its bid for the rest of the
company at Pta15,075 a share.
The Spanish company, which has about 15 per cent of the Spanish market,
reported a turnover of Pta63.7bn (Dollars 665m) last year, to make net
consolidated profits of Pta10.2bn.
Aker, the Norwegian industrial group, will receive NKr1.3bn (Dollars 219m)
in cash through the takeover, netting it a NKr300m profit. This arises
through the disposal of the 13 per cent stake acquired during a series of
deals aimed at strengthening its international presence in the cement
business. It began accumulating the holding in 1984.
Euroc, a Swedish cement producer, which also has a 13 per cent stake will
suffer a SKr140m (Dollars 25.6m) loss, having acquired its stake in 1990 at
a price considerably above that paid by Aker. It will also incur holding
costs for the financing of the purchase also made as part of an expansion
plan.
The two companies in 1990 transferred their shareholding to Scancem, a joint
venture. Last April, the companies bought back their shareholdings, yielding
Aker a total profit on the Spanish investment of NKr680m.
The deal will put Cemex, the world's fourth-largest cement producer, in
direct competition in Europe with its main North American rival, Holderbank
of Switzerland, which controls Spain's fourth-largest producer, Hisalba.
It will more than double the Mexican group's debt, to around Dollars 2.8bn,
giving it a debt equity ratio of around 100 per cent. US analysts were
concerned about the effects the bid might have on Cemex. Unlike Mexico's
growing cement market, consumption in Spain is slowing rapidly as the
economy cools and construction activity slows.
Cemex, for its part, has felt particularly vulnerable in the face of
expansion planned by Apasco, its main competitor in Mexico.
Apasco, controlled by Holderbank, has just 17 per cent of the Mexican market
but has launched a four-year Dollars 260m programme to increase production
from 5.4m tonnes last year to 7.15m tonnes in 1994.
Cemex stocks fell by about 10 per cent in Mexico City after the
announcement, prompting a fall of 58.73 (3.51 per cent) in the Bolsa index
of 40 most-traded issues, which closed at 1,614.19, Reuter reports.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: An automatic initiative to take on Goliath
 -Andrew Baxter on how Control Techniques plans to attack a global mass
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS nothing wrong with being ambitious, but some western industrialists
who have seen their markets hammered by Japanese competition might think Mr
Trevor Wheatley and Control Techniques have gone too far.
Mr Wheatley, chairman of the Powys-based controls and drives producer, is
about to attack a mass market of fundamental importance to the development
of factory automation but one where the UK has been conspicuous for its
absence - except, as so often happens in engineering, in the pioneering
years of the 1950s and 1960s.
This autumn, two years after CT bought Cranfield Precision Systems, it will
start shipping a product that it hopes will put the British flag on a map
dominated by powerful Japanese, US and continental European companies - the
world market for computer numerical control (CNC) equipment used to run
machine tools.
The story has all the hallmarks of a David and Goliath encounter, with no
guarantee of a similar ending. Control Techniques is no minnow - sales could
reach Pounds 100m this year - but recognises it faces a tough challenge
against far larger companies, Fanuc of Japan and Siemens of Germany.
Fanuc has about 50 per cent of the world market, while Siemens is market
leader in Europe and credited by many European machine tool builders for
polishing up its act in recent years. And Allen-Bradley, the CNC supplier
owned by Rockwell of the US, hopes that with a new product range it will
regain market share lost over the past decade.
According to the UK head of one big rival producer, therefore, CT 'would be
better to concentrate on a niche rather than take us on head-on.'
However, Mr Terry Margetts, Cranfield's sales and marketing manager, says he
would like to see CT being number one in the European market in five years
time. 'It will mean a lot of work, but it's not impossible,' he says.
The CT initiative raises some questions: is it launching too late into the
mass CNC market, or right to take the plunge in the middle of a worldwide
machine tool recession, and, most importantly, does it have the right
product?
Mr Wheatley robustly defends the initiative. First, he says, it was
important for CT to have a CNC range to accompany drives and servos that are
increasingly bought in a package by machine tool builders.
As such, the CNC launch caps an acquisition programme that began with
Soprel, the Italian servo drive company, and Moore Reed, the UK brushless
motor producer, before CT took over the Cranfield company in 1990.
Secondly, CT genuinely believes it has come up with something different. Its
new flexible numerical control (FNC) technology has been developed as a
mass-market product from Cranfield's existing, highly sophisticated CNC
equipment.
According to Mr Margetts, CT found that while there was still a market for
Cranfield's highly-specialised 16-axis control, the machinery industry
overall was crying out for a low-cost but flexible approach where optional
extras are standard, and end-users have the power to customise their system
whenever and however they wished.
'We now have a highly competitive total package to offer to the machine tool
industry,' says Mr Wheatley.
CT is gambling that the machine tool industry and its customers will like
FNC enough to specify it in preference to other CNC technology.
In its favour is the Cranfield name, and the fact that there are already
plenty of big users of its existing top-of-the range system. Machine tool
builders are often willing to switch CNC systems if a customer requests it,
so long as there are no technical obstacles.
The recession, too, could even have a beneficial effect on early sales of
the FNC system, says Mr Wheatley. 'If you are a machine tool builder and
you're not selling, you've got to look at every aspect of your machine. If
we can offer a new product at a lower price or at a competitive price, he's
going to take it.'
Initially, the challenge for CT will be to win market acceptance for the
product. One UK machine tool builder said it had no doubts about FNC's
technical excellence, but felt it should wait a few years to see how the
initiative developed before committing itself to a new supplier.
A second problem for CT is the risk of being drawn into a price war by the
larger concerns. CT plans to be competitive, but will also stress other
factors such as UK delivery times of one to three days compared with seven
weeks for some competitors.
For a UK entrant to the market, CT also faces the need to develop overseas
sales quickly without overstretching itself. The company is now working on
engineering support and training for the European market, but Mr Wheatley
says: 'We're not going to rush in. We'll select where we go, and the way we
do business.'
CT is discussing two deals, one in Germany and the other in the US, to
supply FNC to electrical companies which offer part of the machine tool
drive package but lack a CNC range. This, says Mr Wheatley, would be a way
for CT to develop volume quickly.
Along with the other acquisitions, the FNC initiative ought to enable CT's
automation division to double or treble its Pounds 20m sales over the next
two to three years, he says. CT now has the potential to sell a Pounds
10,000 package to machine tool builders, compared with Pounds 1,000 before
its acquisitions programme.
This could transform the shape of CT, which is selling its loss-making
process control division to concentrate on automation, and motion control
where it makes most of its profits. The bulk of the process control side has
been bought by Coreci of France in a deal announced last month.
This year, the City expects CT to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 7m,
up from Pounds 4.1m in 1991, on turnover boosted by the 1991 takeover of
Emerson Electric's industrial control drives division. The US company gained
a 29.9 per cent stake in CT in exchange.
For the FNC initiative to succeed the company will have to do more than win
technical plaudits from the machine tool industry. In the UK, Mr Margetts'
plan to extol the virtues of buying British might strike a chord with
machine tool builders worried about foreign dominance of the CNC equipment
used on most metal cutting machine tools. 'The UK machine tool industry
would welcome a British CNC producer,' said one potential customer. Buying
it will be the acid test.

FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Electricity improves to Pounds
142m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Electricity yesterday announced one of the more modest profit
increases of the sector reporting season.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 141.9m, a
21 per cent increase on the previous year's pro forma figures, giving
earnings per share of 48.3p.
A proposed final dividend of 12.53p lifts the total to 17.76p; the company
said it expected to maintain real dividend growth of between 5 and 8 per
cent.
The reason for the modest underlying growth in earnings was that the company
was not forced to push tariffs up as sharply in April 1991 as regionals who
had undercharged the previous year.
The main distribution business contributed most to the profits upturn,
making operating profits of Pounds 135.3m against Pounds 107.4m.
This was mainly due to higher tariffs, but about 1.5 per cent of the
increase came from a modest 0.9 per cent increase in volumes sold.
Costs in the business rose by about Pounds 4m net, after a saving of 2 per
cent real, or about Pounds 3m after 100 jobs were cut.
The supply business saw operating profits fall to Pounds 8.9m (Pounds
14.2m). Costs rose as the company made a Pounds 6m (Pounds 3.5m) provision
for bad debts and spending on customer services rose.
The retail business incurred a loss after a bad debt provision at the
interim stage of about Pounds 10m, but was now trading profitably.
Contracting and other non-core businesses made a small contribution.
The company expects little improvement in electricity sales, but fairly
consistent cost and job cutting.
The gas marketing business, set up last month, will begin earning in August.
COMMENT
Yorkshire deserves a prize for avoiding the cliches of every other regional
company about matching shareholders' and customers' needs. It has a good
record on customer service and its tariff increases this year are the second
lowest of the 12 companies. Thus, it can afford to express confidence in the
regulatory formula by charging customers the maximum allowable. This
strategy of collecting a bit extra in advance has pleased shareholders, made
sure the supply business is in profit, and cushioned the company against
unexpected cost increases. But given that the regulator yesterday emphasised
that he would clamp down on companies' charges to customers if he thought
they were not cutting costs enough, Yorkshire's 2 per cent real cost saving
might look a little modest. Analysts expect pre-tax profits this year of
Pounds 155m-Pounds 160m, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of 6.4 to
7.9. A dividend of between 19.5p and 19.9p is forecast.

FT  08 JUL 92 / British Airways discusses partnership with USAir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between British Airways and USAir to form a transatlantic
airline partnership appear to be nearing a conclusion,airline industry
officials said yesterday.
If successful, a deal would achieve BA's long-term aim of linking with a
large US carrier to strengthen international competitiveness and increase
penetration of the US market.
If completed, the two partners are expected to consider acquiring assets
from Trans World Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn.
Both BA and USAir declined to comment yesterday, but sources in the US
suggested that the two airlines had been due to meet ahead of the July 4
holiday weekend and decide whether to proceed with negotiations.
Since then, the talks are understood to have continued. Other European
airline industry sources suggested yesterday that a deal could be imminent.
Questions about the proposed link-up with USAir are expected to be raised by
BA shareholders at the UK airline's annual meeting on Tuesday.
TWA confirmed last week that it was discussing an important sale of assets
to USAir. But it appears that both BA and USAir are seeking to complete a
deal between them before considering the purchase of TWA assets.
Analysts believe USAir is seeking a substantial capital injection from BA as
part of any deal, to help reduce its Dollars 2bn debts.
BA, which reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 285m for the year ending March
1992, has long sought to invest in an American carrier. It came close to a
deal with United Airlines three years ago.
The apparent progress in the talks with USAir may have been influenced by
proposed changes in US aviation policy to allow more 'open skies' for
foreign carriers within the US.
USAir, the sixth-largest US domestic carrier in terms of revenue passenger
miles flown, recently said it had two international marketing objectives: to
continue to add international service from its US hubs and to develop strong
partnerships with international carriers.
The carrier has made after-tax losses of about Dollars 760m during the past
two years. However, there have been management changes and attempts to cut
costs.
A partnership with USAir would give BA a US feed into its international
routes. One attraction of USAir is its strong domestic network, focused in
the eastern US where most European travel originates. BA would also gain
wider access in the US if the two airlines were to conclude an asset
purchase deal with TWA.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Tapie hands on baton to Pentland: The Adidas shoe is now on
another foot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN Rubin, chairman of Pentland, says he has spent a lifetime trying
to get out of shoes. Yesterday's announcement that his company had finally
won control of Adidas means it is unlikely that he will ever achieve that
ambition. The purchase represents an opportunity to achieve Pentland's other
long-held ambition of owning one of the world's best-known brand names,
which also happens to be in shoes.
Pentland set it sights on Adidas last summer, when it bought a 20 per cent
stake from Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French businessman who paid
FFr1.6bn (Pounds 165m) for the sporting goods group in a highly leveraged
deal in 1990. Pentland also negotiated the pre-emptive rights over any bid
for Adidas which have proved to be the company's ace, following weeks of
speculation over a possible management buy-out.
Pentland - with roots in Mr Rubin's family business, the Liverpool Shoe
Company - shot to fame with its transformation of a loss-making sports shoe
manufacturer, Reebok. In only 10 years, holding a 55 per cent stake,
Pentland transformed Reebok into an international group with annual turnover
of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m). By the late 1980s, however, it became apparent
that Reebok had outgrown its majority shareholder. A small setback for
Reebok's profits was able to knock a disproportionately large hole in
Pentland's return.
By 1990, Pentland's stake, originally bought for only Dollars 77,500, had
fallen to 31.6 per cent. That investment yielded a total profit of Dollars
777m, with the last sale of Reebok shares at Dollars 27 last year. Reebok
yesterday closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 24 3/8 .
With the proceeds of the Reebok investment, Pentland has built a group which
owns the worldwide rights to Speedo swimwear as well as sourcing and
licensing agreements for a series of sports related products. Yet it has
found it difficult to match the Reebok success.
Adidas, like competitors, has found life more difficult in recent years. Mr
Frank Farrant, Pentland's finance director, rejected criticism that, by
buying Adidas, Pentland is returning to the problems it had with a rapidly
growing Reebok. 'Pentland is much bigger now in its own right,' he said. 'We
have had the experience of building up Reebok and we have more financial
muscle.'
Nevertheless, the sports shoe market of the 1990s is very different from
that of the fitness-mad 1980s. The US and Europe are the focus of fierce
competition by players such as Nike and Reebok. Pentland also makes no
secret of the fact that Adidas has suffered setbacks in Germany, where Nike
and Reebok have squeezed its share by more than 10 points to about 40 per
cent.
Mr Farrant maintains Adidas will find opportunities in eastern Europe, Asia,
the Far East and even the US. Adidas's 3 per cent share in the US, compared
with 28 per cent for Nike and 23 per cent for Reebok, is a strength, not a
weakness, he says.
The first task will be to bring the 1 per cent net margins at Adidas nearer
to the 14 per cent and 15 per cent achieved by its main competitors.
Although existing management has already begun rationalising Adidas, Mr
Farrant said there was more to do. After the deal is completed,
rationalisation costs would total less than DM50m (Pounds 17m).
Mr Rubin said current management will be left to carry on the business they
know best. 'All our successes have been where we have given management as
much power as possible,' he said.
Meanwhile, Mr Tapie faces the task of reconstructing his business armed with
the FFr500m profit on his Adidas investment.
Although he has spent the past few months waxing and waning over whether to
sell Adidas, Mr Tapie really had no choice.
The Adidas acquisition was far bigger than his existing businesses and
marked a move into the mainstream for Mr Tapie, who had previously
specialised in buying up bankrupt companies. BTF borrowed FFr1.6bn in
short-term loans to do the deal.
The pressure of repaying these loans has already forced Mr Tapie to sell
almost all his original interests.
After the Adidas sale, BTF will be left with only two companies - Testut, a
weighing machine manufacturer which lost FFr8m on sales of FFr450m in 1991,
and Scaime, a small industrial company, which produced profits of FFr2m on
sales of FFr60m. Both companies are on the market.
Mr Elie Felous, who took over as BTF's chairman in April when Mr Tapie began
a short-lived ministerial career, said that, after selling Testut and
Scaime, BTF should have surplus cash of about FFr1bn. That will be used to
buy new businesses, although Mr Felous said it had not yet been decided how
the money would be invested, or whether Mr Tapie will return to his role as
chairman.
BTF's investors will probably have to wait until the autumn to hear the
answers to both questions. Mr Tapie and Mr Felous, like many other French
businessmen, plan to take long summer breaks.
'July and August are months for relaxation, not for business decisions,'
said Mr Felous. 'We will leave all that until the rentree after the holiday
season.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / Lamont warned of flawed forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has been told to take all forecasts about the UK economy in the
next few years - including its own - with several bucketloads of salt.
These projections are likely to be deeply flawed because of a lack of
knowledge about how the economy works, and in particular those aspects
linked to financial deregulation, according to preliminary results from a
study financed by the Treasury.
The analysis by the independent National Institute for Economic and Social
Research is a painful rebuke for most economic forecasters and raises
awkward questions for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as he struggles to
end the recession.
The analysis was sponsored by the Treasury to gain better insights into
inadequacies in its own forecasting methods. Government economists - as well
as those in the City and in academic institutes - failed to foresee the
extent both of the 1986-88 boom and of the current recession.
In the most authoritative study yet into these failings, Mr Andrew Britton
and Mr Nigel Pain of the institute say the Treasury and most outside
forecasters were equally inaccurate, probably because the standard computer
models of how the economy works are faulty.
It suggests the Treasury's techniques to calculate the effects of policy
switches such as interest rate shifts may not have caught up with the
financial reforms of the 1980s.
The study - results from which were released yesterday at a conference at
Warwick University on forecasting - says economists should take more notice
of advance indicators of activity such as housing starts, business
confidence and equity prices. It adds that most private sector economists
tend to take a consensus view to avoid extremes.
The report clears government statisticians - who have been blamed for some
of the Treasury's recent forecasting errors on the grounds that they failed
to measure the economy properly - of any substantial blame for the
inaccurate projections.
Looking at specific forecasters, the institute says economists at Shearson
Lehman Brothers, the US investment group, were 'perhaps the quickest to pick
up the trends within the economy'. The Confederation of British Industry,
the City University Business School and Liverpool University gain honourable
mentions and Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University is singled out
for giving an early warning of the recession. The Treasury said it was
looking at the results of the study to 'review directions for new research'.
According to Mr Britton and Mr Pain, a strong possibility is that
'structural change, due for example to financial deregulation, has changed
the parameters of a number of relationships (in economic models) . . . If
this is true, then it may be some years before sufficient data are available
to estimate those new parameter values correctly'.
The change triggered by financial liberalisation is 'particularly worrying
because it could mean that we do not know how the economy responds to
instruments of monetary policy'.

FT  08 JUL 92 / White paper sets out Britain's post-Cold war defence
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday set out its post-Cold war defence strategy designed to
allow the UK to respond to a threat anywhere in the world, rather than just
in Europe.
'The strategic environment has been transformed over the last four years,'
said Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, in the defence white paper
published yesterday. The distinction between tasks in Europe and 'out of
area' had become blurred, the white paper says.
In a separate move yesterday, the government confirmed its order for a
fourth and final Trident nuclear submarine. It will be built by Vickers at
Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
The white paper says policy aims in place since 1975 should now be replaced
with three new overlapping roles: the protection and security of the UK and
dependent territories, even when there is no external threat; insurance
against any external threat to the UK and its allies; and promoting the UK's
wider security interests through the maintenance of international peace and
stability.
Britain's new defence roles replace a four-pronged policy which specified
commitment to Nato, the UK, mainland Europe, and sea power in the eastern
Atlantic and the English Channel. Mr Rifkind said that Nato, nevertheless,
remained the 'bedrock' of UK defence policy.
Defence spending will rise slightly in cash terms over the next three years,
the white paper says. Mr Rifkind said this still would represent savings of
up to Pounds 4bn a year in real terms by the end of that period.
But defence has already been identified by the Treasury as being ripe for
cuts in this year's public spending round, and there are signs that a tough
battle lies ahead, in spite of Mr Rifkind's assurances on cost control.
Mr John Townend, the chairman of the Conservative backbench finance
committee, said the UK could take on an international peacekeeping role, but
the new strategy should not mean that the UK had to bear a
'disproportionate' share of the cost.
Payments from other countries are a possible solution. The white paper
reveals that the UK will have received Pounds 2bn in cash from Gulf war
allies in payment for the UK's involvement.
Opposition spokesmen condemned the white paper as a 'catalogue of lost
opportunities' which showed no evidence of fresh thinking.
Mr Martin O'Neill, the shadow defence secretary, highlighted what he called
the paper's failure to deal adequately with the 'challenge to maritime
security and air power presented by the new world order'.

FT  08 JUL 92 / French truck drivers accept outline accord: Slow progress in
lifting blockades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH TRUCK drivers' repre-sentatives yesterday accepted an outline accord
on pay and working conditions, but vowed to keep up the pressure on the
government in their nine-day stoppage.
The move, which comes as some of the barricades are being dismantled, is a
significant climbdown by truck drivers' organisations in the face of the
government's determination to hold on to the principle of tough new licence
regulations.
Under the new rules, drivers could be banned if they clock up six penalty
points.
However, the organisations added that this was only the start of
negotiations.
Progress was slow in clearing the blockades which have left thousands of
motorists and foreign truck drivers stranded.
By the early afternoon the government reported that more than a third of the
roadblocks had been lifted, though sporadic protests broke out in new areas.
Farmers blocked trains in the Loire valley in protest against supply
shortages and European Community agriculture policy reforms.
The two main professional bodies, FNTR and Unostra, yesterday called on
truck drivers to abandon their barricades, but to continue to strike.
The shift from open anarchy to the first stages of negotiation came as a
result of an overnight meeting between the government, unions and the two
main driver employers' organisations to draft plans to soften the impact of
the new rules, which came into effect on July 1.
Truck drivers argued that the rules would put many of them out of work
because they could not avoid breaking the law on the long distances that
they have to drive.
One-man subcontractors, who make up nearly 40 per cent of French haulage
companies, have suffered from a sharp fall in rates since prices were freed
in 1986, which has put pressure on them to drive longer and faster.
Unostra, the subcontractors' organisation, said that Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
the prime minister, had promised to reintroduce fixed minimum rates for
subcontractors. The group said it would call its men back to work once the
government had confirmed 'the installation, as soon as possible, of
subcontracting rates that enable carriers to cover costs'.
The FNTR said this was 'only the opening of negotiations on improved working
conditions'.
The other main aspects of the eight-point deal are: to review working hours;
to consider adjusting the application of the points system to truckers; to
oblige employers to find other jobs for banned drivers; to pay for driving
lessons for banned truckers; and to ban bonuses likely to reward unsafe
driving.
Few truckers are union members, but the trade unions involved in the talks
recommended the deal, sensitive to union members in other industries who
were laid off as a result of the truck siege.
In another attempt to defuse labour unrest, the government has brought
forward, by 11 days to July 20, the announcement of an aid package for
farmers hit by EC agriculture policy reforms.

FT  08 JUL 92 / A chance to fix Europe: Britain must use its presidency of
the EC to champion a more democratic union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All right, I admit it. My advice three weeks ago to Irish voters was
frivolous and utopian. I urged them to follow the Danish example and vote
'no', in the hope that this would force European governments to come up with
a clearer and more rational proposal for European union than the one
contained in the Maastricht treaty. Surprisingly but sensibly, knowing well
on which side their bread is butter-mountained, the Irish endorsed the
treaty.
Mind you, I really do find the treaty unreadable and, in parts,
incomprehensible - though I am grateful to British Management Data
Foundation* for supplying a relatively comprehensible edition of it, giving
a consolidated text of the Treaty of Rome as Maastricht proposes to amend
it, and using bold type with a different lay-out to identify the new or
amended articles.
I should still like to see a clearly drafted European constitution - call it
federal, if you like - defining the powers of the union and expressly
reserving everything else to the member states.
Mr Christopher Kane, a lawyer in Seattle, has kindly written to the
Financial Times offering a model clause to that effect, namely the 10th
Amendment to the US Constitution which says: 'The powers not delegated to
the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'
That is certainly a lot clearer than the now famous Article 3b of
Maastricht, which says that 'in areas which do not fall within its exclusive
competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the
principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the
proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can
therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be
better achieved by the Community'.
My union would have power to conduct a common external policy, to defend and
police its external frontiers, and to ensure free circulation of goods,
persons and capital throughout its territory. (Does that entail a single
currency? I remain agnostic on that point.)
For those purposes a central union executive would be needed, which should
be accountable to an assembly elected by the people of the union as a whole.
The assembly could also be the legislative body. The areas of union
competence should only be extended with the consent of all member states.
Such is my idea of European Union. But I know that the chances of such a
union being constructed on the ruins of the Maastricht Treaty are nil.
Although many English people think of the EC as a tiresomely Cartesian
phenomenon, full of abstract logic and inapplicable principles, in reality
it is and always has been something much more Burkean in nature. It is
misshapen because it is organic, forever adapting itself to circumstances
through a process of illogical but creative compromise. That is not likely
to change to satisfy me or any other doctrinaire federalist.
The point is eloquently explained by someone I used to regard as a much more
doctrinaire federalist than myself: Mr Peter Ludlow, director of Brussels's
own think-tank, the Centre for European Policy Studies. In a lecture**
delivered in Stockholm in May, Mr Ludlow mounted a resolute defence of the
Maastricht treaty, based on a close reading of the text.
He starts from the observation that the EC is neither a purely
inter-governmental organisation nor a classic federal system, but an
original construct combining elements of the two. Therefore, in his view,
the argument between federalists and inter-governmentalists is ultimately
sterile.
In his eyes the Maastricht 'three-pillar' structure, which sets both
'foreign and security policy' and 'justice and home affairs' outside the
purview of the EC proper, is redeemed by the overall provision that 'the
union shall be served by a single institutional framework'. It is also saved
by the specific provisions which give the Council (of ministers) the main
authority in these matters, as in the EC itself, while associating the
Commission with the work to be carried out.
Mr Ludlow points out that the Council, whose role 'at the heart of the
Community's unique institutional structure' the treaty 'reaffirms and
reinforces', is more than a purely inter-governmental institution, even
though made up of ministers of the member states.
In recent years, he says, its decisions 'have not only been much more than
the lowest common denominator of agreement among those present, but have to
an uncomfortable degree bound those who were least happy about them'.
In saying that, he puts his finger on precisely the thing which makes so
many people unhappy about Maastricht: the treaty reinforces the authority of
a body which, even though its individual members are accountable to national
parliaments, is not collectively accountable to any representative assembly.
Does Maastricht not thereby exacerbate the EC's notorious 'democratic
deficit?'
Mr Ludlow concedes that this argument 'must be taken seriously'. He points
out that the European Parliament already has a significant role in EC
legislation, and that this role is further enlarged by the new treaty.
Politically, he says, the parliament has only itself to blame for its
failure to act as an 'effective watchdog'.
This could be remedied if political parties did more to co-ordinate the work
of the European Parliament with that of national parliaments. But he adds
that the democratically elected governments of member states must
'constitute an indispensable brake on an over-mighty centre', and claims
that the treaty adds checks on the growth of irresponsible power  - though
these, on inspection, do not amount to much.
In an appendix written after the Danish referendum, Mr Ludlow blames the
result partly on the Danish political establishment for failing 'to explain
to its voters at large what the European Community has always been about'.
He also partly blames the Commission, which 'perhaps involuntarily, conveyed
the impression that Maastricht was only the beginning of something that was
to be much worse as the future unfolded'. Mr Ludlow urges the other 11
governments to 'engage in a systematic effort to explain and justify the
character and logic of the EC's unique political system, as it has developed
over 40 years and as it is confirmed and consolidated in the Maastricht
treaty'.
Such a campaign is indeed necessary, and the UK government should take the
lead - both because it occupies the presidency at this crucial moment, and
because it involves explaining that the union is something much more British
and less continental in its nature than it looks at first sight. That may
not satisfy utopians, but it may be more acceptable to seasoned
practitioners on the back-benches in the House of Commons.
Whether it can be made acceptable, after all, to Danish voters we shall see.
If not, some further piece of untidy pragmatism can no doubt be devised to
govern their future relationship with the union they have rejected.

Did you know that Bengt Dennis, governor of the Swedish Riksbank - the
oldest central bank in the world - is one of the most lowly paid members of
his fraternity?
He earns a mere 55,000 crowns a month (Pounds 5,230) from his employment in
Stockholm. But he manages to double his annual earnings as a result of
plentiful emoluments from the Bank for International Settlements, of which
he is currently president - a mandate which runs out at the end of next
year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One cannot question the loyalty of George Younger, the former defence
secretary. Who else would prefer to adopt the title of an obsolete Scottish
airport rather than some pretty glen?
Lord Younger of Prestwick, as he will soon be known, has always been
uncommonly faithful to the under-utilised airport in his former constituency
of Ayr. In the 18 years he was an MP, he led the lobby which persuaded the
government to keep Prestwick's monopoly on transatlantic flights to and from
Scotland.
Because the airport was highly inconvenient for much of the Scottish
population, its traffic dwindled to the point when on some winter days there
were no passenger flights at all; the development of air services from
Scotland was retarded by a decade, often to the benefit of airports like
Manchester.
However, Younger lost his battle in 1990 when the government finally allowed
neighbouring Glasgow to break Prestwick's transatlantic monopoly.
As a result BAA sold Prestwick earlier this year to a consortium, backed by
the local authority, with Younger a prime mover.
Prestwick is now developing its freight business and hoping for the day when
Glasgow becomes too congested. However, if Prestwick really proves a white
elephant, Younger won't necessarily be tagged for life. He should eventually
succeed to his father's title Viscount Younger of Leckie, the name of the
family home, a long, long way from Prestwick.

Come back Wynne Godley, all is forgiven. Yesterday marked the start of the
rehabilitation of the left-leaning Cambridge don best known for his gloomy
views about the UK economy and the need for import controls.
A government-funded study into the biggest forecasting errors by government
and private-sector economists in recent years says that 'more attention
should have been paid' to the warnings of Godley, who predicted a long and
severe recession before virtually anyone else.
Given the exclusion of the 65-year-old Godley from the inner circles of
policymaking during the 1980s - he lost his government funding in 1982
largely because of his non-Thatcherite views - the irony is delicious.
It was not lost on Godley yesterday on sabbatical from Cambridge at the
Jerome Levy Institute in New York. 'Over the past few years, I have had a
strong sense of not existing. It's been like walking past a mirror and
seeing nothing,' says Godley. One could almost hear the maverick making
merry with his oboe at the welcome news.

Nicholas Soames, the new junior agriculture minister, is fast becoming the

the Treasury despatch box, he likened winding up a debate to the
'parliamentary equivalent of the Grand National'.
As the subject was bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease),
Soames made certain he did not fall at the first fence by having a
preliminary canter around the pronunciation in his office.
And how long does it take for the BSE agent to pass from the gut to the

FT  08 JUL 92 / Observer: Interference on the line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to corporate shenanigans, it is hard to beat the comings and
goings at the top of Ireland's state-owned telephone system - Telecom
Eireann. Yesterday, Professor John Scanlan became the third chairman in the
utility's eight year roller-coaster history. Given that his predecessors
fell out with the government he would be wise to keep his hand in teaching
electronics.
The relationship between the Irish government and its telephone company has
always been a prickly one. There is an apocryphal tale of how one junior
minister of posts and telecommunications used to travel around the country
with a car full of telephones. When a constituent complained that he had
waited for months for a phone, the minister would solve that little problem
by going round to the boot of his car.
Like British Telecom, Telecom Eireann's service is much better than it was
and waiting lists have been dramatically reduced. But its relations with the
government have not improved. Hence the revolving door at the top of the
organisation. The government would dearly love to privatise the company but
until it stops interfering it's going to have a job persuading foreign
investors to take it off its hands.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Personal View: Preaching pragmatism to free trade church
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The free trade church is in need of a Reformation. Consider Britain's recent
history. From the first impact of Honda's arrival to the death of the
British motorbike industry was about a decade. By the time colour
tele-visions and cars began to come from Japan the UK had learnt its lesson.
It trumped up charges of dumping to justify punitive tariffs, and thereby
pushed the Japanese into VERs - 'voluntary' export restrictions. They
responded - resentfully and reluctantly - by manufacturing inside the UK
market. The result: Britain now has flourishing colour television and car
industries.
True, sad things have happened to British companies in those industries. But
they would have happened anyway - faster and more brutally - under free
trade. And at least a very large chunk of the value-adding activity which
goes into making our cars and televisions takes place in the UK and
generates labour incomes in the UK. As for the capital income - who gets the
profits - British insurance companies and pension funds long ago shifted
their investments out of British car manufacturers and into Toyota and
Nissan.
British bureaucrats had stumbled on a sensible and pragmatic form of
protectionism. But how will the economist high priests of the free trade
orthodoxy describe it? As the unprincipled and self-defeating expediency of
short-sighted politicians. They will tell you precisely how much extra this
protectionism makes us pay for our cars; how big the extra profits of Nissan
and British Rover. What they will not tell you is how much of the 'consumer
surplus' yielded by cheaper cars would have been mopped up in unemployment
pay, or how many fewer pounds we would have had for spending on cars if the
car industry had gone the way of the motorbike industry.
The high priests of free trade frequently pretend to despise such a
self-centred single country calculation. Has world GNP been increased or
diminished by British protectionism? The answer is it has probably
increased. Thanks to the chicanery of anti-dumping tariffs, less of the
Japanese surplus has been channelled into buying US Treasury bonds and real
est-ate, more into direct overseas investment, thereby doing more to add to
world efficiency by diffusing their work practices around the world.
Suppose we did reform the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to
allow for such sensible pragmatism. What might it mean in practice?
First, it would mean dropping all the provisions which allow protectionist
measures to be justified by charges of dumping or hidden subsidies. (But not
those that allow developing countries to protect infant industries to gain
learning time.) Anti-trust prosecution of predatory pricing can still
continue - without discrimination between imported and domestically produced
goods.
Second, introduce a new concept: Investment Inviting Import Quantity
Restrictions (IIIQRs). These do not, like anti-dumping actions, say: 'You
are cheats and we are going to block your imports.' They say: 'You are
clearly more efficient than us. But we don't want to lose the industry. We
shall import only a certain number of your widgets per year for the next ten
years. But by all means come and manufacture here. We shall give you all the
facilities available to domestic start-ups, though we shall insist on
enhanced phased-in local content rules.'
The conditions for IIIQRs should be defined tightly in the Gatt - in terms
of an industry's share in GNP, its multiplier effects on the economy, the
growth rate of import penetration, and so on - taking care, probably by some
measure of labour-intensitivity, that IIIQRs cannot be used against
developing countries' attempts to escape poverty by trading on their sole -
cheap labour - advantage.
What are the implications of such a Lutheran shift, making free trade no
longer absolute virtue, and discrimination no longer absolute vice?
An end to the most poisonous feature of our current hypocritical orthodoxy;
the fact that the way to practice (frequently sensible) protection is by
calling a trading partner a cheat. It takes experts to expose the dishonest
chicanery of anti-dumping suits. But every newspaper reader can see how
unhealthy Japan-bashing is for US politics, let alone international
relations.
Japanese firms would come to Europe, not resentful at being bludgeoned by
charges of unfairness, but flattered at the acknowledgement of their solid
competitive strengths. They would be more ready to comply honestly with
local content rules.
Acceptance that discrimination against states with an inbuilt structural
surplus is legitimate - as Keynes argued in the 1940s when it was the US
which was the obvious target for discrimination . Such discrimination is a
recognition that we live in a world community - just as the universal
practice of progressive taxation which discriminates against the wealthy is
a recognition that the nation is a community.
To be sure, there are problems with these proposals. IIIQRs protect
industries not the existing domestic firms' in an industry. Unfortunately,
it is existing companies which finance pressure group lobbies and political
parties, and often actually believe that the Japanese win by cheating and
not by exercise of the solid Victorian virtues of thrift, diligence,
long-term planning and managerial efficiency.
Reform needs politicians with the Lutheran toughness to resist the lobbies.
Orthodox beliefs are powerful. Free trade orthodoxy rests partly on ideals,
partly on theory. As for ideals, accelerating investment through IIIQRs
shows an even stronger spirit of internationalism. As for trade theory, the
bankruptcy of the comparative advantage paradigm with its assumptions of
competitive markets and 'undistorted' prices is apparent even to some of its
high priests. A world in which one country's export drive can destroy
another country's industry in the space of half a decade is no longer the
world in which Ricardo developed his theory of comparative advantage. The
author is a professor of political science at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a member of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London
School of Economics.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Russia's place at the table
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR AGO it was Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's plea for assistance that closed the
summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries. Rebuffed, Mr Gorbachev
returned home to the August coup, the termination of his career and the
break-up of the Soviet Union. This year it is Mr Boris Yeltsin's turn. But
if he too is rebuffed, the west is likely to lose more than it did by its
denial of Mr Gorbachev. Mr Gorbachev had no vision of economic reform; for
all his faults, Mr Yeltsin does.
G7 leaders must resent Mr Yeltsin's mixture of braggadocio and begging.
Russia, he asserts, should be allowed to sit at the G7's high table. What is
more, as a 'great country', Russia cannot be asked to abide by conditions
imposed on lesser fry.
The G7 should make it clear that membership of this august club is only for
those able to make a positive contribution to the management of the global
market economy. Equally, there can be no question of pouring funds into the
bottomless pit of the Russian military-industrial complex. Nor can Russia be
helped if it refuses to move rapidly towards a private market economy. Mr
Yeltsin should also be reminded that the sufferings of the Russian people,
both past and prospective, cannot be laid at the west's door.
Nevertheless, the west must take account of the way the unscrupulous will
exploit popular discontent. The west may feel that beggars should not be
choosers. But when the beggar is able to blow up the world, he can.
Small carrot
The west's interest remains in helping him make the right choices. The
question is how. The problem is not that the west insists on conditions. It
is that it is concentrating most attention on the wrong conditions and,
still more, that its carrot is too small.
A total of Dollars 24bn is supposed to be on offer. But Dollars 6bn is for a
stabilisation fund that may never be activated and, if activated, is
expected never to be drawn down. A substantial part of the rest is for
relief of debt service obligations that will, in any case, not be met. In
short, the fresh resources that Russia might obtain, even if agreement were
reached, is less than half the Dollars 24bn.
The west should reconsider both its priorities and the scale of assistance
on offer.
The highest priority is rapid privatisation of land and of small and
medium-sized enterprises, as well as creation of a legal framework to ensure
the growth of private enterprise throughout Russia.
Budget constraints
The next priority is the commercialisation of state enterprises, debt
restructuring and the imposition of credible budget constraints. Managers
and workers in state enterprises must also see possibilities for enriching
themselves when they make their enterprises more efficient.
The third priority is a system of payments that sustains commerce in the
former Soviet Union, along with unification and convertibility of the rouble
on current account. A fixed exchange rate is, for now, simply a fantasy.
The fourth priority is a macro-economic stabilisation at least sufficient to
keep inflation under control and, ideally, sufficient to ensure that budget
deficits can be financed without resort to the printing press.
Last and least, is continued debt service. Future historians will be
astounded at the attention paid to sums that cannot be repaid and, in any
case, barely matter against what is at stake.
The west will not obtain all that it seeks. But it must make sure that it
does at least obtain an opening towards a private market economy. Without
that, nothing should be given. Support should be given now without insisting
upon all the other conditions. It should be made clear, however, that the
further Russia goes, the more help it will receive. For really radical
reform, the west should be prepared to offer as much as Dollars 100bn in net
transfers over five years.
As in Europe after the second world war, a durable partnership must now be
established between serious Russian reformers and the west. The west should
overlook Mr Yeltsin's bluster, persist in helping Russian reform and be
prepared to distinguish what is essential from what is desirable.
Mr Yeltsin can, indeed, be irritating. But he offers what may prove to be a
unique chance. It is one that must be taken.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Stormy forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a particularly chastening recession for Britain's economists.
Spotting turning points is the hardest task for economic forecasters, as
well as their raison d'etre. But their recent record has been particularly
bad. Having failed to predict the recession, most economists have been
expecting Britain's recessionary cloud to lift for a year or more. Yet,
defying the forecasts, it just keeps raining all the time.
Mocking economists is a rather cheap, if satisfying, pastime. Many
professions require some ability to read the future; and politicians,
business executives and journalists have all been fooled by the stormy
nature of this cycle. Yet accurate forecasts remain as necessary for
policy-makers and wage-bargainers as for business.
How far-sighted, then, of the Treasury to commission an investigation into
recent forecasting performance. The National Institute for Economic and
Social Research may not be the most independent of auditors or unbiased of
critics. Nor is the main conclusion of its preliminary report particularly
earth-shattering. Extrapolating the past into the immediate future is not
much help when the immediate future is radically different from the
immediate past: this point has surely sunk in by now.
Yet the NIESR report does implicitly criticise the funding policy of the
Economic and Social Research Council. The bulk of the government's Pounds 2m
budget, on top of the funds spent on the Treasury's own model, funds two
other models, at the NIESR and the London Business School. Both are similar
in design to the Treasury model, and all three have made very similar errors
since 1985. Yet more iconoclastic (and recently more successful) forecasting
teams at Cambridge, Liverpool and City universities have all had their
funding withdrawn over the past decade. The public interest would be better
served by a policy that promoted choice and diversity rather than a cosy
cartel of like-minded clones.
The fault, however, lies not with the models themselves, but with those who
use them. Politicians, journalists and economists have treated econometric
models with undue reverence. Forecasts of the economy do, in fact, deserve
to be treated as sceptically as those of British weather.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Arts: Quality in proportion some forty years on - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The devotion of the entire BBC2 schedule on Sunday evening to A Night With
Alan Bennett - with the programmes chosen by him - has been dismissed by
some commentators as merely another way of dressing up a bundle of old
repeats. This seems overly cynical.
In the past 40 years British television has produced some superb material
and it would be absurd if there were no repertory system enabling us either
to see admired programmes again or to catch up on some we have missed.
Though I had already seen the 1973 episode of Whatever Happened To The
Likely Lads and possess a cassette copy of Mike Leigh's exquisitely
embarrassing drama Abigail's Party, I was glad to watch both again and
modify my feelings about them.
The comedy is over-rated and suggests that today's sitcoms may not be as
inferior as we tend to feel (One Foot In The Grave on BBC1 on the same
evening was far funnier than the old Likely Lads episode, though to be fair
Bennett's choice was doubtless limited by what is available in the archive).
The Leigh drama is probably the best he has ever done, though its appeal
seems increasingly clearly to depend upon sheer snobbery. Having never seen
Melvyn Bragg's 1965 Monitor profile of Sir John Barbirolli or Malcolm
Mowbray's bizarre and captivating 1981 drama Days At The Beach, I was
delighted to be given 'another chance to see' both, and cannot understand
why people who happily pay money at the cinema to see Casablanca for the
umpteenth time (yes, yes, of course it is a terrific movie) claim that they
are being cheated if television shows any programme more than once.
As the number of television channels grows it is surely more important than
ever that at least 20 or 30 per cent of material produced by any self
respecting television service ought to be worthy of - indeed demanding - a
repeat.
Perhaps the most interesting aspects of this evening, however, were
Bennett's remarks in introducing his choices. In contrast to Frank Muir's
flippant and almost pointless comments in the Channel 4 series TV Heaven,
Bennett's were thoughtful and pointed.
The odd thing is that, seeing Bennett as such a devotee of the past, so
ready to luxuriate in nostalgia, I found myself reacting against his
pessimism about the present standards of British television, even though his
remarks mainly chimed with the recent tone of this column. Rightly enough,
Bennett criticised our recent governments for doing so much to harm British
television.
But when, like so many others, he sighs for the days of 'Play For Today' and
the period of Cathy Come Home and Edna The Inebriate Woman, praising the
regular stretching of the audience's imagination and giving the impression
that there is no longer anything to compare with those days, somebody should
remind him of GBH and Tumbledown, Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, and even
his own Talking Heads.
At least until fairly recently British television has continued to produce a
remarkable proportion of programmes which, judged against international
standards, are outstanding. But there is that bogy word again: proportion.
However many impressive programmes one can name from the past few years to
challenge the supposed supremacy of sixties television, the rush down-market
which is occurring right now is difficult to deny. What is so worrying for
the future of television is not the feeling that there is nobody left with
the desire or ability to make good programmes, but the feeling that they are
being overtaken by a rapidly growing avalanche of trivia.
The cheap, shallow, sensational and instantly forgettable is on the increase
at the expense of that which is thoughtful, difficult, demanding and
inspiring. Most disheartening is not merely the increase in formula
programmes and the decrease in individual and idiosyncratic material, which
I suspect is a major part of Bennett's complaint, but those rapidly changing
proportions.
Instead of just filling quite a lot of time, trivia is beginning to seem
universally dominant. . . except on BBC2, which is already starting to look
like the last redoubt of the thinking viewer.
Take the big television topic of the week in the tabloid press: BBC1's
Eldorado. As soap operas go, there is not a lot wrong with this one. It
neatly folds in some of the glitz of Dallas with the sort of girls and boys
who swarm in Neighbours, and raises the sex quotient a bit: today's episode
has the faded blonde torch singer, Trish, in bed with her teenage German
toyboy, Dieter. No doubt there will be protests about the nine o'clock
watershed.
The sun, sea and sand make a change from a Manchester terrace or an east
London square; where the existing soaps are Anglo-dismal this one is
Euro-fun. True it is tediously anti-man (the plumber can't plumb, the toyboy
can't toy, a husband cannot even be relied upon to put a prepared chicken in
the oven) but in today's television that is more than trendy, it is de
rigueur.
It would be curmudgeonly to deny viewers the right to bathe their work-weary
minds in lukewarm soapsuds if that is what they want, and apparently
millions do. But is it not a little worrying that BBC1 is using it to fill
six half-hour slots a week (three episodes, each with a repeat)? Since the
same network is already providing 10 doses a week of Neighbours and three of
EastEnders it is a significant increase in soap at the expense of other
material on a channel which seven years ago contained no soap at all.
Of course soap opera is not the only symbol of this rapid and radical
change. On Saturday, Channel 4 launched a current affairs series tellingly
called The Big Picture Show, the sort of title hitherto used for children's
programmes or cinema series. There is nothing wrong with the intention,
which is to deal with some major topic (this week crime) by breaking it down
into its constituents and having an 'expert', or a journalist willing to act
like one, expatiate upon each bit.
The ominous point is that instead of trusting the quality of their
journalism, the producers have felt it necessary to 'sell' the thing by
getting Clement Freud's buxom, bubbly daughter Emma to front it. Thus at
every opportunity the camera comes back to her, so that she can read a bit
of autocue and bounce the key light off her lipstick.
All promotions for the programme - in listings magazines, press releases and
so on - feature sultry photos of La Freud rather than the subject matter or
the expert journalists.
Yet however questionable that may be, it looks like dinner at All Souls when
compared to ITV's new tabloid series at 7.15 on Sundays, The Richard And
Judy Show.
This employs the husband and wife team of Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan,
presenters of ITV's daytime magazine programme This Morning. They sit in a
studio and ask toe-curlingly embarrassing questions. The tone mixes
cosiness, prurience and funk.
Thus Roy Cornes, the man at the centre of the campaign by people in
Birmingham to put the Aids frighteners on heterosexuals, was first handed an
all-purpose Freudian get-out by Madeley, then encouraged to chat about
condoms by Finnigan, but never required even to hear the words 'anal
intercourse' from either.
John and Jan Ward, parents of the young woman who disappeared in Kenya,
presumed murdered, were interviewed about the state of their marriage, and
so on.
It is too soon to be sure that Alan Bennett is right about the decline of
British television drama, but in television generally you can hardly miss
the current leapfrog scramble to get as far down market as possible.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rock in London this summer offers visits from almost the all the People's
Favourites, from Genesis to Michael Jackson, and there is no more
wholehearted Man of the People than Springsteen. Wembley Arena rose as a
single body to hail his appearance.
It is easy to sniff at Springsteen, dismiss his music as unsophisticated and
its subject matter as irredeemably small-town American. Those persistent
topics, that raking over the ashes of dead romances, the importance of
family and home, always suffused with an aching patriotism and more than a
hint of revivalist religious fervour seem so quintessentially American that
one first all doubts their potency beyond its borders, fails to see the
universality behind the songs.
It's the sincerity that does it, I'm sure. There is something heartwarming
about him, a direct honesty in the performance which disarms even the most
persistent cynicism. When Springsteen asks if anyone out there has ever lost
their faith in love and receives back a roar of confirmation, the reflex
grab for the sick bag is temporarily stayed; something hints that the man
means it, that he is offering himself as a prize example of how to win
through, to take all that life can throw at you and come through on the
other side wiser and eventually happier.
For several years it seemed as if the happily ensconced Springsteen - wife,
two children - had settled for that connubial bliss and the occasional
unheralded appearance in other people's low-profile gigs. But a brace of
albums earlier this year kickstarted a world tour, complete with new band
and a rebirth of the Springsteen fervour. Those fans who spent the entire
Wembley concert on their feet, arms outstretched, mouthing every word of
every song, and interspersing them with the ritual calls of
'B-r-o-o-o-c-e]', must have doubted that their time would ever come again.
He is still a magnetic performer. The audience, starved of its hero for so
long, was going to cheer him to the echo anyway, but the energy he expended
and the intensity he created were prodigious. There is only one survivor
from the E-Street Band in the new line-up and the sound seems crisper, more
tailored than before; its neat lines and clean rhythms counterpoint
Springsteen's rasping guitar.
Of course the latest songs do trawl familiar territory. The old material has
been recycled and sorted, retaining enough to satisfy the faithful. But it
does not jar against the new, for they rely still on straightforward
harmonic skeletons and clean-cut structures; the framework has to be robust
enough to take the emotional freight that Springsteen loads upon it.
It misfired very occasionally. The inevitable 'Born in the USA', second in
the running order, was dutiful rather than electric (and surely too slow),
and even that was immediately countered with storming versions of 'Local
Hero' and 'Darkness on the Edge of Town'.
Afterwards he scarcely missed a trick, nor an opportunity to deliver a wise
homily to the audience. The ingredients in his special brew of hard rock,
soul and gospel, were constantly refreshed and mixed anew, and the fans knew
they had seen the rebirth of their hero.

concert in his home town of Vevey on Lake Geneva.
With Cuenod, the years do not seem to count. Here was a spry man of tall,
upright posture, elegant and witty, occasionally extravagant in manner,
keeping his audience amused with a few select stories and songs, and
generously sharing the stage with pupils and friends.
Cuenod is the sole surviving link with a whole era of composers, performers
and teachers who helped shape 20th century musical history. He premiered
works by Honegger and Milhaud in the 1930s, was a regular recital partner of
Clara Haskil and Dinu Lipatti, created the part of Sellem in The Rake's
Progress in 1951 and was a noted interpreter of Schutz, Monteverdi and
baroque composers long before they returned to fashion.
British audiences know him primarily from his Glyndebourne days (more than
400 performances).
His birthday concert, attended by le tout Vevey and televised throughout
Switzerland, was a pot-pourri designed to appeal to the widest possible
audience, and yet it summed up the man and his artistry. On stage, Cuenod
has never pretended to be anything more than a character tenor but his gifts
go much further. A selection of Apollinaire songs by Poulenc, followed by
Babar the elephant, demonstrated undiminished powers of characterisation and
timing.
His unaccompanied rendering of a fragment of Orlando di Lasso found him
still capable of a long vocal line. Like Peter Pears, Cuenod's trademark has
always been his command of style and expression: what appealed was not so
much the timbre of the voice, but what he did with it.
Judging by the rest of the Vevey programme, Cuenod remains young at heart.
There were interludes of soul, jazz and contemporary dance. Michel Dalberto
played Debussy, Nikita Magaloff a Faure Impromptu. Nicolai Gedda offered
Lensky's aria, revealing technique and artistry unimpaired, even if the tone
has lost its bloom.
The other outstanding end-of-season event in western Switzerland was Attila
at the Grand Theatre, Geneva, with Samuel Ramey and Elizabeth Connell (which
was broadcast live on Radio 3). Ramey's prowess in the title role has helped
re-establish this opera on both sides of the Atlantic over the past 10
years. His voice has the agile muscularity to cover up Verdi's fitful
inspiration - the cabaletta to his dramatic first act aria brought the house
down, a rare accolade in Geneva - and he looks so good, with bare breast,
pony-tale and fur cloak, like an amalgam of Noble Savage and Genghis Khan.
But with Ramey, physique and voice are everything: despite his vast
improvement as an actor, he still lacks the animal magnetism of a Raimondi.
Jerome Savary's production, a succession of picturesque early Romantic
landscapes first seen last year in Milan, offered an equally flattering
platform for Miss Connell, who has now unmistakably settled into her prime
in the dramatic soprano repertory.
Her high-voltage Odabella (to be repeated alongside Ramey at Covent Garden
next season) has everything this fearsome role needs - grandezza, confident,
declamatory attack and pearl-like mastery of line and decoration - and she
moves remarkably well on stage.
With strong performances from Paolo Coni as Ezio and Michael Sylvester as
Foresto, and lusty contributions from chorus and orchestra under Gabriele
Ferro, Attila came across as an exciting foretaste of Macbeth and later
operas, laced with the irresistible vitality of youth.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Hydrogen car moves on to the
horizon - John Griffiths finds Mazda pushing ahead with an emission-free
fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mazda, Japan's fourth largest car maker, is shortly to seek Japanese
government approval for an on-highway test programme for hydrogen-powered
cars, whose exhaust 'fumes' consist of non-polluting steam.
The company has concluded that hydrogen-powered cars are technically
achievable more quickly than is commonly believed within the industry.
Over the coming months, it plans to start negotiations with Californian
state authorities on making hydrogen cars acceptable under the strict new
exhaust emissions legislation that California is phasing in from 1997
onwards, and to explore possible systems for refuelling them.
Part of the Californian legislation, which is being considered for adoption
by up to a dozen other states, requires 2 per cent of manufacturers' sales
to be of 'zero emission vehicles' from 1998, rising to 10 per cent by the
early 21st century.
Virtually the entire motor industry has accepted the fact that the
legislation's time scale can only be met with battery-powered cars.
But while Mazda has already developed its own battery cars to meet the
legislation, Michinori Yamanouchi, senior managing director of Mazda Motor
Corporation, says that electric vehicles in general will be far too
expensive and limited in their performance to have anything but a restricted
future as urban runabouts or light commercial vehicles.
According to Mazda, the Wankel rotary petrol engine - which it, alone among
car makers, now produces - can be adapted more easily than conventional
petrol engines to run on hydrogen. Cars fitted with it could reach the
marketplace for a price about 20 per cent higher than a petrol-powered
equivalent - 'in other words for about the cost of air conditioning and
audio equipment', says Yamanouchi.
In contrast, he says, 'we estimate that even if electric vehicle technology
really advanced, their price would be twice that of a gasolene car at
minimum. And that price ratio would be the same even if a manufacturer were
to be making 10,000 units a month'.
Mazda is by no means alone in researching hydrogen-fuelled cars. Mercedes
and BMW of Germany are among those which have produced prototypes.
However, difficulties with combustion in adapted, conventional reciprocating
engines and on-board fuel storage, and scepticism about the ease with which
a hydrogen manufacturing and refuelling infrastructure could be set up have
led most manufacturers to suggest that viable hydrogen cars are still years
off.
According to Mr Yamanouchi, the design of the rotary engine eliminates the
premature combustion problems normally associated with using hydrogen as a
fuel in conventional engines.
Mazda has also launched a collaborative project with Nippon Steel
Corporation, Japan's largest steel maker, to set up a pipeline fuelling
supply system for the test programme, using as the feedstock hydrogen from
one of Nippon Steel's manufacturing plants, where hydrogen is a major but
mostly wasted by-product.
Yamanouchi expects the steel industry to be a future producer and marketer
of hydrogen in its own right.
Chemical plants, which generate hydrogen as a by-product, could be also
harnessed to localised supply networks. In Japan there will be a network of
hydrogen fuelling stations by the early 21st century, he predicts.
Mazda's vision of a fuelling infrastructure for hydrogen is based on it
being in gaseous form. BMW, in contrast, has based its prototype on the use
of hydrogen in liquid form, requiring insulation of both fuelling system and
the vehicle's fuel tank to allow temperatures close to absolute zero.
'If the determination is there, we can set up hydrogen pumps and pipelines
fairly easily in terms of technology and finance,' Yamanouchi says.
He is also relatively dismissive of concerns about the safety aspects of
hydrogen, should it leak into a boot interior, for example. It is
undetectable by sight or smell, but Yamanouchi insists that, being lighter
than air, it would disperse quickly - and it possesses a combustion point
higher than gasolene.
Mazda regards the biggest problem as how to store the hydrogen in sufficient
volumes in the vehicle. Its solution, adopted also for the prototype
Mercedes fleet, is a fuel tank filled with a metallic hydride capable of
soaking up large quantities of gaseous hydrogen and re-releasing it when
heated.
Fitting enough hydrogen into the tank is still a problem, however, as it is
a much less dense fuel than gasolene. Nevertheless, one prototype has
achieved continuous running for 200km at maximum speeds of 150kph.
Yamanouchi's predicts that in 30 years, petrol or diesel-powered cars will
account for just 10 per cent of the world's total car output, having been
supplanted mainly by hydrogen cars but also by a much smaller proportion of
battery powered urban vehicles.
As for California's forthcoming legislation, Mazda believes that the
problems of limited range and performance of battery-powered cars, and even
their refuelling infrastructure, will become much more apparent as its
enactment draws nearer. It believes that California's Air Resources Board
and other legislative bodies involved will face a sea of difficulties in
persuading Californian motorists to buy and use them. 'Already, I have heard
that the ARB is feeling itself as Hamlet in Shakespeare,' says Yamanouchi.
Mazda therefore expects the Californian authorities to welcome the proposals
for a hydrogen alternative.
It is considering talking to other manufacturers that have an interest in
the technology for a co-operative approach to introducing hydrogen cars to
California.
Among those most likely to be interested is Mercedes, which last year
updated its thinking on hydrogen vehicles in the form of the F-100 concept,
shown as Mercedes' 'car of the future' at the Detroit motor show.
Even Mazda, however, acknowledges that production of hydrogen - on the huge
scale required to provide significant substitution for petroleum - is a
large technical challenge.
Hydrogen may be the most abundant element in the universe, and the ninth
most abundant on earth, but making it from water - the most sensible route
on a large scale - involves electrolysis, using a direct external energy
source. Clearly, if the energy to provide this came from fossil fuels, the
whole exercise could be self-defeating from both the emissions and energy
conservation points of view.
For large parts of the transport-using world - not least sunny California -
solar energy could prove the answer. One group highly active in the field,
Texas Instruments, claims already to be generating solar electricity at
close to the domestic tariff rate of Southern California Edison, the
electric utility.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Danes see dawning of era for
biorefining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH PILKINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A biorefinery, designed to use agricultural crops for such non-food purposes
as making paints, glues, plastics and other products normally based on
mineral oil, has begun work in Denmark.
Financed by the EC's Eclair research programme, the project - known as the
Whole Crop Biorefinery Project - involves companies and research institutes
from the UK, Ireland, Germany, Greece and Denmark. The hope is that
biorefining will reduce environmental damage and agricultural surplus, while
creating jobs.
By adopting techniques similar to those used in oil refining, crops can be
broken down into fibres, oils, proteins and starch. The 'raw materials'
derived from purified crops can replace oil in producing paints, plastics,
glues, packaging, fibre-board and chemical and pharmaceutical products.
Scientists claim that manufacturing products based on crop constituents
would not increase CO, sulphur and heavy metal levels in the atmosphere as
much as the production of crude-oil based goods.
Administrative project co-ordinator Christian Kjoller said the concept of
using agricultural crops for non-food purposes had attracted increased
interest during the past decade, but few products had been put to commercial
use: 'The EC's grain surplus is an expensive burden. It stands to reason
that we must study the possibilities of using agricultural products for
other purposes. By means of biorefining, imported raw materials can be
replaced by domestically produced ones and can positively influence the
European balance of payments as well as employment.'
The Ecu9.7m (Pounds 6.8m) project is financed by the Eclair programme, the
Danish government and partners from England, Ireland, Germany, Greece and
Denmark. Headed by the Bioraf Denmark Foundation, the pilot plant in
Aakirkeby, Bornholm will run for three and a half years with the aim of
establishing others.
Kjoller stressed that expertise had been sought from five European countries
and that the project would otherwise have been impossible in Denmark.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Jobs: Making 'fast tracks' more empowering - Why high-fliers
need help to become better delegators, listeners and team players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is a single 'human resources' issue which helps chief executives to
sleep soundly at night, it is the existence of a proven 'fast-track' process
for developing their high potential young people into the leaders of the
future. The maverick Lord Weinstock, head of Britain's GEC, may disagree,
but leadership development and succession is at the very heart of future
corporate prosperity.
Hence the installation of fast-tracks by more and more companies - not just
the original constituency of large multinationals, but also banks, insurance
companies and other organisations. All now feel they must take young
managers in their mid-20s and transform them, over the next 10-15 years of
dizzy 'fast-tracking', into a high-powered elite.
Yet the way that these processes operate, and the values and behaviour
patterns which they promote among today's star middle-managers and
tomorrow's top dogs, are in direct conflict with the popular and potentially
powerful concept of 'empowerment'. Company bosses on both sides of the
Atlantic are now rushing to install it (or at least espouse it), in spite of
centralising pressures created by the recession.
But very few of them are biting the bullet by changing their fast-track
processes to encourage the development of 'empowering' behaviour in the
company's central nervous system: its star managers. Instead, today's
leaders are still cloning themselves.
This is the stark conclusion of unpublished research done over the last
couple of years by Dr Lynda Gratton, of the London Business School. Much of
her hardest data is drawn from a study conducted in 1991 of more than 100
high fliers at a large European multinational. Gratton's results are
impressive because she gathered observations not just from the high-fliers
themselves, but from more than 1,000 subordinates, peers and bosses.
The prime questions she sought to answer were whether the high-fliers were
much good at the various behaviours that can be considered 'empowering', and
especially whether they gave much priority to many (or any) of them. The
answer in the majority of cases was a resounding 'no'.
For anyone who still needs a plain person's definition of empowerment after
the last 18 months of public and internal corporate hype on the subject,
here goes.
As organisations flatten their pyramids in order to cut costs, accelerate
decision-making and become altogether more flexible and competitive, they
can no longer operate in time-honoured hierarchical fashion.
Instead of a series of levels which 'command and control' the one
immediately beneath them, power (and information) on many issues must be
delegated, decentralised and diffused. Trust must be established between
bosses, peers and subordinates (to use conventional language - or
'colleagues', in the new). Individual effort within narrow departmental
boundaries must be replaced by cross-functional teams. Instead of
information being withheld at each successive level in the hierarchy, it
must become shared - or, at least, accessible - through informal
'networking'. All this implies fundamental changes in the way that leaders
behave.
In assessing the 'empowering characteristics' (or otherwise) of the managers
in her study, Dr Gratton asked participants to write down what they saw as
the person's strengths and weaknesses (these were described politely by
Gratton as their 'development needs').
The resulting descriptions were rich and varied: in total about 100
categories of behaviour were used by the participants, of which 20 were ones
that are known to help create empowered organisations.
The top four strengths to emerge were all individual, rather than team,
ones: 'energetic and hard-working' (for 72 per cent of the high-fliers);
'analytically able' (63 per cent); 'action-orientated' (51 per cent); and
'intelligent' (46 per cent). Only then came the top empowering skill,
'ability to build teams' (45 per cent). Most other empowering behaviours,
such as ability to engage in joint problem-solving, were cited as strengths
for under 30 per cent of the high-fliers.
As for people's 'development needs', the 100 individuals as a group were
seen by two or more of the respondents - often including themselves - to be
weak on half of the full 20 categories of empowerment, and not very strong
on any. In particular, 42 per cent were described as expecting too much of,
and being impatient towards, people with different abilities and needs; a
recurrent phrase was: 'does not suffer fools gladly'.
Depending upon the category, between 20 and 30 per cent were described as:
abrasive; failing to share information and to keep communication open;
unable to build teams; and failing to take others' views into account. Many
were also poor listeners.
The only goodish news, apart from most people's perceptions of their own
weaknesses, was that the group was not homogenous. A significant minority
did behave in an empowering manner, as well as possessing strong individual
skills.
Few of the results are surprising, if one considers that high-fliers tend to
manage very much in their boss's image. They are selected to join the
fast-track by their bosses, or their boss's bosses - all of whom will have
prospered mightily by displaying the old command-and-control behaviour. In
any case, the very nature of empowering behaviour is that it is almost all
sideways and downward-focused.
So how can bosses be expected to spot empowering behaviour from their
subordinates at all?
This problem is compounded by the way the fast-track operates, argues
Gratton. High-fliers change jobs every 18 months or two years, seldom having
time for their mistakes to catch up with them, or to establish trusting
relations with people inside teams. They are measured on short-term results.
They are rewarded for this and for 'managing upwards' - a polite phrase for
showing the kind of behaviour which their boss appreciates.
Added to this, they have only one set of role models - their
'command-and-control' bosses.
So what is to be done to end this fundamental mismatch?
If an organisation is really serious about empowerment, says Gratton, it
must revamp systematically its processes for developing leaders:
It must select individuals only after their delegation and team-building
potential has been assessed in action. It should also allow entry to
fast-tracks at several stages in peoples' careers.
It must recognise the importance of what Gratton calls '360-degree feedback
to the individual' - especially from peers and subordinates. Hardly any UK
companies do this (BP and WH Smith are pioneers), and only a few in the US
(including Citibank and IBM);
Similarly, appraisal and evaluation must be done not just by the boss (with
or without the individual's self-appraisal), and not just on short-term
performance.
It must treat managers as mature people who need to understand clearly their
development needs and career options, and are involved closely in decisions
about them. Even at human resource paragons such as IBM, this is not always
the case.
'If companies really want to encourage empowerment, they've got to take some
pretty firm action on things that they hold very dear', concludes Gratton.
'Without that, empowerment will remain a lot of wishful thinking.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bill targets use of tax havens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to prohibit transactions between British organisations and
overseas tax havens will get under way in the Commons this afternoon.
Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover, is to promote a backbencher's bill to
prevent the secrecy of such regimes contributing to financial fraud.
The measure would prevent any trustee, director of a public company or
director of a management company of a collective investment scheme from
carrying out any transactions with organisations based in or controlled from
a tax haven.
Banks and investment companies that had close links with business in a tax
haven would lose their authorisation.
'The whole Maxwell affair and many other financial scandals could have been
prevented if we had laws prohibiting financial transactions with tax havens
such as Liechtenstein, Panama and the British Virgin Islands,' Mr Shaw said
yesterday.
The bill would introduce severe penalties for anyone breaking the
prohibition. If someone had been the cause of people's losing more than
Pounds 1m and that money had not been recovered, the maximum fine would be
Pounds 3m as well as a prison sentence of up to 30 years.
Although the bill is unlikely to be defeated today, it stands no chance of
becoming law, because the government is prepared to block it at the next
stage of its progress.
Ministers argue that the measure amounts to penalising jurisdictions with
low tax rates - not all of which have lax supervisory arrangements. They
also fear that sanctions against tax havens that are UK dependent
territories might damage their offshore finance sectors.
Mr Shaw's bill specifically defines a tax haven in terms not of its tax rate
but of its laws on disclosure of financial information if money is lost, and
on the prospect of recovering such money.
Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, expressed surprise
that Mr Shaw was promoting the measure, but welcomed it as 'something a
Labour government should have done years ago'.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine pushes energy reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK will use its presidency of the European Community to push for urgent
liberalisation of Europe's energy market, Mr Michael Heseltine, president of
the Board of Trade, said yesterday. Speaking at the Financial Times
conference on North Sea Oil and Gas - New Investment Challenges, Mr
Heseltine said the segregated energy market was a 'major anomaly within the
new Europe.'
If the aim of a genuine single European market was to be achieved, he said,
'It is self-evident that nation states cannot simply pick and choose which
single-market measures they are prepared to adopt.'
He said the UK would urge:
The removal of statutory monopolies across Europe, so that other players
could enter the market.
Greater transparency between production, transportation and supply, to
eliminate cross-subsidies and allow new market entrants clearly to assess
the challenges.
Open access to pipeline and transmission infrastructures for new suppliers.
Mr Heseltine warned that the segregated energy market led to significant
disparities between energy prices in member countries. That might harm the
competitiveness of industry in some countries, and that of Europe as a
whole.
He also warned that he expected to meet vigorous opposition from
monopolistic elements in the European electricity and gas industry.
Mr Heseltine said the UK government had struck the right balance between the
risks of operators, and revenue to the exchequer, and the present regime was
sufficiently responsive to changes in oil prices.
Mr Ron Probert, managing director of gas supply and strategy at British Gas,
warned the conference the deregulation of the UK gas market was an
'unprecedented industrial economic experiment on a massive scale', whose
outcome was uncertain.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on tube link to Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALL-PARTY group of MPs voiced its anxiety yesterday that the government
may be close to abandoning the planned extension of the Jubilee underground
rail line to London's Docklands.
Their concern - set out in a Commons early day motion - came as ministers
reacted positively but cautiously to the suggestion that the government
might buy outright one of the buildings at the Canary Wharf development.
The government has told the administrators of Canary Wharf that it is ready
to study a scheme under which it would buy one of office blocks at the
Docklands site.
The money would then be repaid by the administrators to the Treasury as the
private-sector contribution to the Jubilee Line extension, which was agreed
before the development's owners - the Canadian company Olympia &amp; York - went
into administration at the end of May.
It is understood that the administrators have told the government that they
would need to raise Pounds 170m from an outright sale - a figure that
equates to the present-day value of the phased Pounds 400m payment promised
by Olympia &amp; York for the rail link.
Such a deal would have a number of attractions, but some ministers believe
that, on a realistic calculation of property values in the area, the
government would have to secure up to 800,000 sq ft of space to justify
paying Pounds 170m.
That represents twice the amount of space the government would need for its
proposed transfer to Docklands of civil servants from the Department of the
Environment and some other Whitehall departments.
The signatories of yesterday's motion, who include Mr Paul Channon, the
former transport secretary, said that the Jubilee Line extension was
'vitally important to the competitiveness of London' and 'critical' to the
success of Docklands.
London's RiverBus, the Thames passenger service recently given a three-month
reprieve from closure, is to make an additional stop at Greenland Pier in
Surrey Docks on weekdays in response to passenger demand.

speculation over sterling and ERM devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT moved yesterday to quash speculation that a decision to move
sterling into the EC exchange rate mechanism's narrow band might be
accompanied by devaluation. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the
Treasury, said in a parliamentary written answer that sterling would move to
the narrow band 'in due course' at the current central rate of DM2.95.
His reply foreshadowed a detailed defence later this week of sterling's
place in the ERM by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Mr Lamont plans to use
a speech in London on Friday to emphasise that the mechanism offers the
prospect of permanent success in the fight against inflation.
He will argue that any move to devalue the pound or leave the ERM to give a
short-term boost to the economy would wreck that ambition.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet set to reject top pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government appears set to reject the recommendations of an independent
review body that more than 2,000 top public servants should receive a large
one-off pay rise to bring their salaries level with those in the private
sector, Philip Stephens writes.
Senior ministers expect tomorrow's meeting of the cabinet to scale back
significantly the increases for senior civil servants, armed forces officers
and judges suggested by the Top People's Pay Review Body. Mr John Major is
also likely to insist that those pay awards of over 10 per cent which are
accepted by the government should be phased in.
The board is thought to have recommended increases of more than 25 per cent
for some groups of workers to close the gap which has opened up between
comparable positions in the private and public sectors since 1986. One
cabinet minister this week described increases on that scale as 'totally
unacceptable'.
The prime minister, who has consistently criticised large pay awards for
executives in the private sector, will be told by colleagues that there is
no likelihood of an 'exodus' of senior public servants if he rejects large
pay awards.
Mr Major's colleagues, facing one of the toughest public spending rounds in
recent years, will argue that large increases for high-paid public sector
workers would send the wrong signal to other groups of employees. They
expect the prime minister to agree that any increase this year should be
held to 5 per cent.

WHEN Mr Michael Portillo explains to cabinet colleagues how serious he is

his own recent career.
He begins by conceding that for each of them, the loss of a cherished

cause painful political embarrassment.
Then the chief secretary to the Treasury reminds his colleagues that he

against his better judgment and at considerable personal cost - with its
abolition.
The message is clear. Mr Portillo will not be impressed by pleading that the
scrapping of a planned roads scheme or the shelving of a new training
programme would cause his colleagues undue discomfort in the House of
Commons.
So far, no blood has actually been spilt in the negotiating skirmishes,
although there has been the usual trickle of leaks about the Treasury's
prime targets - the defence, unemployment benefit, housing, roads and Home
Office budgets among them.
Looking over his shoulder at an economy still mired in recession and a
borrowing requirement heading for Pounds 35bn, Mr Major will deliver a stern
lecture on the need for prudence when he chairs a decidedly downbeat cabinet
discussion on the economic outlook later this month. The real battles will
then be fought in September and October.
No one is in any doubt that they will be tough. In spite of a pre-election
spree, Whitehall officials acknowledge that on present trends the Treasury
will miss its Pounds 226.6bn spending target for the current 1992-93
financial year.
Some Pounds 450m has already been taken from the Pounds 4bn contingency
reserve to pay for the teachers' pay award, for increased income support for
pensioners and for health-service wage settlements.
That figure does not include the huge cost of higher unemployment. The
number out of work is already more than 300,000 above the 2.4m allowed for
in the present spending plans. It is still rising and, on a conservative
estimate, the higher jobless total will cost an extra Pounds 2bn this year
and Pounds 3bn next.
It will further cloud a bleak medium-term outlook.
In the five years from 1985-86 to 1989-90 the Treasury's planning total  -
the departmental allocations that provide the main instrument of expenditure
control - remained flat in real terms.
For the subsequent five years - from 1990-91 to 1994-95 - the Treasury's
plans already assume an increase after inflation of 20 per cent.
That figure assumes heroically that Mr Portillo will not add a penny to the
targets, but if the Treasury cannot win in the first spending round after a
general election, it never will.
A large part of the prospective increase - perhaps half - can be attributed
to the recession. The rest reflects a conscious loosening of the reins in
the approach to the general election. It will not be easy to re-tighten
them.
Mr Portillo's starting point is a planning total for 1993-94 of Pounds
244.5bn and for 1994-95 of Pounds 258bn. He must also pencil in a figure for
1995-96.
In theory the totals, which include sizeable reserves, allow for ample
growth in Whitehall spending - an average in real terms of 3.5 per cent in
each of the next two years. That follows a planned increase of 5.75 per cent
in the current year.
In practice, most of the additional money will be absorbed by the higher
benefit payments to the unemployed and by the additions to local-authority
budgets needed to smooth the introduction next April of the council tax.
Transitional relief schemes to ease the impact of the council tax in the
recession-hit south-east might well cost Pounds 1.25bn next year. Local
authorities will need another Pounds 1bn to allow even a small real increase
in spending.
So Mr Portillo cannot afford to allow other Whitehall departments any
increase in the 'baseline' figures agreed last year. Some of those budgets -
including for employment, housing, defence, transport, agriculture, and
trade and industry - already point to real cuts in spending. But to meet the
overall target, further reductions will be needed to pay for unavoidable
increases elsewhere.
The Treasury has already earmarked a number of 'soft' targets. It wants
drastic cuts in the Department of Transport's roads programme to pay for
increased financial support for British Rail and London Regional Transport.
It is casting a close eye over the Department of Education's capital
spending and at the Home Office's ambitious prison-building programme.
The Department of the Environment's housing budget - a beneficiary in recent
years of Mr Major's caring Conservatism - is another prime candidate.
Smaller reductions are expected from the DoE's green budget and that for
employment training.
Defence remains a cherished target because it has successfully resisted the
large savings that might have flowed from the collapse of communism. But
even if - as the Treasury expects - the European Fighter Aircraft is never
built, the peace dividend will take some years to materialise.
The Department of Social Security is under pressure to deliver reductions in
other benefits - including unemployment benefit - to help finance income
support and housing benefit payments for the jobless.
The health budget already includes a 2.75 per cent real increase in
spending. The Treasury would like some back to finance the care in the
community programme.
Senior ministers believe substantial cuts across Whitehall are possible. But
the chief secretary is as strong or weak as his prime minister; and to the
chagrin of his predecessor, the author of the Citizen's Charter has so far
proved himself more willing to spend than save.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory stamp duty rebellion subdued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROSPECTIVE rebellion over the re-introduction of stamp duty on house
purchases fizzled out in the Commons last night as Tory backbenchers stopped
short of supporting a Labour amendment to extend the current moratorium
until March 1993.
Not a single Conservative MP voted for the amendment which was defeated by
30 votes (281-311), although one - Mr John Wilkinson (C Ruislip-Northwood) -
indicated he would abstain.
This was in spite of considerable Conservative support for a parliamentary
early day motion tabled last month calling for 'a further extension' of the
relief - which applies to the purchase of houses costing up to Pounds
250,000 - after it runs out in six weeks' time.
For the government, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury,
said the Opposition amendment would more than double the Pounds 400m cost of
the moratorium to date.
It was more important to pursue policies designed to reduce interest rates
and 'get a real grip on public expenditure.' The government should not try
to 'rekindle' confidence by 'fiscal and other measures that have the effect
of inflating house prices further.'
Sir Malcolm Thornton, the Tory MP for Crosby who tabled last month's early
day motion, said that while keeping the moratorium would help the building
and construction sector, he recognised the Treasury had 'enormous
difficulty' in balancing competing claims.
Signing an early day motion was a means of expressing an opinion and not 'a
gesture of rebellion,' he added.
Mr Wilkinson applauded Labour for introducing the amendment and argued that
stamp duty was 'a direct tax on flexibility and mobility in the employment
market.' The real need was for immediate measures to bring interest rates
down by some 2 1/2 per-centage points, he said.
For Labour, Mr John Marek, a front bench Treasury spokesman, called on the
government to support the amendment to show the original moratorium was not
just 'a gimmick for the election.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind urges EFA'rethink'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY was urged to reconsider its decision to withdraw from the consortium
that commissioned the European fighter aircraft (EFA) and back attempts to
'drive down the costs of the existing design' by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
defence secretary, in the Commons yesterday.
He strongly underlined the economic case against embarking on a new project
which he put to Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, in London on
Monday.
Mr Rifkind warned that the acceptance of Germany's view would result in the
taxpayers of all the countries concerned - Spain and Italy are the other
members of the consortium - losing any benefit from the substantial sums
already invested.
Last night, Spain indicated its full support for Britain's determination to
press ahead with the project. A senior defence ministry official said also
that Spain would welcome new partners.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrats' defence spokesman, called for an
assurance that savings would not be made at the expense of the aircraft's
'inherent capability'.
Mr Rifkind said 'substantial cost savings' had already been identified, and
emphasised that Britain wished to continue, as part of an effective
partnership, towards the production phase of the project.
Embarking on a smaller version of the EFA as proposed by Mr Ruhe would
involve redesign of the airframe and engine, delaying the aircraft's entry
into service by up to eight years.
While not disputing the legal right of Germany to withdraw from the
production phase, he pointed out that it was committed to investing a
further Pounds 1bn in the development phase.
Mr Martin O'Neill, the shadow defence secretary, underlined the extent to
which the future of Britain's aerospace industry was dependent on the
revenue raised from the EFA project.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Lilley greets pension ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday won valuable time to reorganise the provision of
social security benefits when the European Court decided against calling for
an immediate change to the British system under which men are required to
pay contributions for a longer period than women.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the ruling was 'good news'
and would allow the UK to get on with its task of reorganising
social-security provision to eliminate variations between men's and women's
benefits.
The Department of Social Security is considering several options to equalise
the age at which men and women may retire. Present rules allow women to
retire on a full state pension at 60 after 39 years of contributions, while
men must wait until 65 and pay 44 years of contributions to receive the same
benefits.
Mr Paul Greenwood of Mercer Fraser, consulting actuaries, said that had the
judgment gone against the UK, the government could have been forced to spend
billions to end differential contributions and make retrospective payments
to men going back to 1984.
In its ruling yesterday, the court said European Community legislation
intended 'to maintain temporarily the advantages accorded to women with
respect to retirement' to allow member states to modify their pension
systems progressively.
Only four European states have so far fully equalised benefits for men and
women and one, Germany, has yet to equalise contributions.
Of those that plan equalisation, most are considering a retirement age of 65
but Ireland plans on 66 and Denmark 67.
The case was brought by the Equal Opportunities Commission, which argued
that UK social security rules on contributions are discriminatory.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Merit pay may hit women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWTH of per-formance-related pay may widen the gap between male and
female earnings, the Equal Opportunities Commission said yesterday.
The EOC says merit pay tends to reward men more than women because employers
use it to adjust earnings to the market rate. Women's earnings are less
likely to contain a merit element, and the subjective and general nature of
many appraisal processes allows managers to make sexist judgments.
However its investigation into why women's earnings have stayed at about two
thirds of men's found evidence of a gradual move of women into higher-paid
posts previously filled by men.

FT  08 JUL 92 / BCCI report by Bank set to back tighter regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is expected to respond today to the criticisms of a
Commons select committee and back stronger banking supervision laws after
the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Extra powers to act against banks whose opaque or internationally spread
structure makes regulation difficult are expected to be proposed by the Bank
in its formal response to the cross-party Treasury select committee
investigation into the affair.
However, the Bank is expected to wait until the publication of Lord Justice
Bingham's official inquiry into BCCI before it gives its detailed response
to specific criticisms of the closure of the bank more than a year ago.
The Bank has already rebuffed the MPs' general assertion that action could
have been taken against BCCI earlier than last summer's closure.
To the anger of Labour MPs, the Treasury is expected today to say it will
not publish its response to the Treasury select committee until after the
Bingham report - probably not until after MPs rise for the summer recess
next week.
Mr Giles Radice, Labour member of the treasury committee in the last
parliament, said: 'If a select committee acts quickly, like we did, and
tries to come up with something sensible about regulation of a dodgy bank
you would have thought that the government would at least have the courtesy
of responding quickly. The delay is becoming a major scandal.'
The Bank is understood to have compiled a 30-page response to the Treasury
committee's investigation into international and national banking
supervision laws and to have accepted a number of the MPs' recommendations.
Bank officials came in for most criticism in the report, with ministers
escaping blame.
The committee said troubles in BCCI's structure were recognised but its
'complicated international network' was tolerated.
An attempt by BCCI creditors to postpone a planned challenge to the High
Court's approval of a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 883m) compensation package
failed in the Court of Appeal yesterday, Raymond Hughes writes.
After the decision of the BCCI UK creditors' committee not to appeal against
last month's High Court ruling sanctioning the deal negotiated between
liquidators Touche Ross and the bank's Abu Dhabi majority shareholders, a
number of individuals want to take over the appeal.
Their application to be substituted as appellants is due to be heard next
Monday but yesterday their counsel, Mr David Hunt QC, asked for an
adjournment until July 20.

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is encouraging the AEEU engineering and electrical union to
provide know-how to the nascent free trade unions of Romania, Michael Smith
writes.
The Foreign Office's 'know-how fund' has paid the expenses of Mr Nigel
Harris, an AEEU executive councillor, for a visit to the former communist
country. It has also agreed in principle to a two-week visit by eight union
officials. The Foreign Office's know-how fund was set up to provide
technical assistance for east European countries to adapt to market
economies.
Although the money for the AEEU will have only a limited impact on the
fund's annual budget of Pounds 46m, its use may raise the eyebrows of some
Tory MPs. The AEEU is a moderate union but led the successful campaign for a
37-hour week for engineering workers.
The AEEU's engineering section last year incurred a deficit of Pounds
949,714, according to accounts published yesterday.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Lenders threaten rise in mortgage rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF Britain's biggest mortgage lenders accused the government yesterday
of unfair competition in attracting savings and warned that they might be
forced to raise mortgage rates unless there was a cut in bank base rates.
The protests came after yesterday's launch of a new National Savings
product, the First Option Bond, which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had
promised in the Budget.
First Option Bond pays an interest rate of 7.75 per cent net (equivalent to
10.34 per cent gross) guaranteed for one year on a minimum of Pounds 1,000.
A comparable savings product from a building society would be expected to
yield less than 10 per cent gross.
Banks and building societies argue that the government has an unfair
advantage over them in setting rates on its savings products in that it does
not have to be profitable.
'National Savings are offering totally unrealistic rates which are not
pitched to market rates,' one of the biggest UK building societies said
yesterday. 'We cannot afford to be seen by our savers to be giving
uncompetitive rates. If there is no cut in base rates, we will have to
consider increasing mortgage rates.'
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said
National Savings was trying to raise Pounds 6bn at the expense of the
building societies. He said he did not welcome the competition because 'it
is not on proper terms'.
Building societies have had a bad year in attracting funds. Net receipts for
the year to May were Pounds 657m compared with Pounds 1.53bn of net receipts
into National Savings.
A high street bank said yesterday that if there was not a base rate cut and
if it lost too much business to the new product, it might be forced to raise
mortgage rates although it was not in its interests to do so.
The bank argued that it was 'owed' a drop in base rates because the
government had cut base rates by a 0.5 percentage point against a 0.85-point
drop by the bank.
'The government wants us to cut mortgage rates to get the housing market
moving, but National Savings is not helping us at all in attracting savers
and funds,' it said.
National Savings cut the rate on its certificates from 8.5 per cent to 8 per
cent this year, but it raised the limit for individual holdings of its
variable rate Income Bonds from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 50,000.
The vast majority of young adults still want to own their own homes in spite
of falling house prices and record repossessions, according to a survey
conducted for Woolwich Building Society.

OLD MASTER drawings continued to have mixed fortunes yesterday. A spirited
chalk, ink and wash drawing of a cloud-borne winged deity and other figures
by GB Tiepolo, which sold at Pounds 30,800, was one of a number of Italian
works at Christie's to sell at the lower end of the estimate.
It came from the collection of Duke Roberto Ferretti, as did a delicate
black chalk angel by Fra Bartolommeo which exceeded expectations by selling
for Pounds 24,200.
The careful panoramic view, not of Venice but of Borgo di Valsugana in the
valley of the Trenta, by Francesco Guardi was bought in at Pounds 100,000
but sold after the auction for the same price. The morning session totalled
Pounds 339,955. Some 65 per cent by lot was sold, 59 per cent by value.
Christie's offered another diverse group of drawings from the collection of
the late Ian Woodner. The top price of Pounds 26,400 was for a fragment of a
cartoon for a ceiling fresco of a concert by Niccolo dell'Abbate. The group
realised Pounds 531,157, with 82.64 per cent sold by value and 87.5 per cent
by lot.
At Phillips' paintings sale, a somewhat worn half-length canvas of Lucretia,
given to the studio of Guido Reni and estimated at Pounds 10,000-Pounds
15,000, was thought by some to be the work of the Bolognese master himself.
It went to an overseas telephone bidder for Pounds 110,000.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Fears raised on reliability of equipment: Defence white
paper analyses lessons from Gulf war Women may move closer to front line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIABILITY of army land vehicles during the Gulf war was criticised
yesterday in the annual defence white paper.
It says unreliability had considerable implications for operations and was
overcome only by a disproportionate application of maintenance and spares.
Equipment and spares had to be borrowed or purchased from allied and
friendly countries.
In spite of such handicaps, preliminary lessons from the conflict suggested
that no big changes in British military doctrine and organisation were
required. The white paper says the Gulf campaign exposed a number of
shortcomings, although those should not detract from an outstandingly
successful operation.
It highlights difficulties during the campaign, providing the services with
opportunities to lobby for particular projects such as the the European
Fighter Aircraft and the army's new anti-tank helicopter.
The performance of Challenger 1, the British army's battle tank manufactured
by Vickers, is described merely as 'effective'. The tank's reliability and
fire-control system were limiting factors, the white paper says. Since the
conflict, the Ministry of Defence has put in an order for about 130
new-generation Challenger 2 tanks.
The white paper says older support and engineering vehicles were unable to
keep up with more modern equipment and had been left behind.
The report also lobbies for a replacement for the Lynx anti-tank helicopter.
It says the aircraft lacked the ability to withstand ground fire which is
required in a dedicated attack helicopter. The army has indicated a strong
preference for the American AH64 Apache. Westland of the UK has reached an
agreement with McDonnell Douglas of the US for a British-assembled version.
The Midge drone, used to provide airborne surveillance, proved unreliable
and unable to provide real-time information. A new remotely piloted vehicle,
called Phoenix, is due to replace the Midge in 1993.
The white paper attempts to explain why the Royal Air Force lost six Tornado
GR1 jets, but says it was not because they were flying low to use the
airfield-denying weapon, JP233. Only one jet was lost on a JP233 mission.
However, four of the aircraft were lost at low level, the only height where
the jet's sensors and weapon systems could be effectively employed. The
report concludes that the conflict demonstrated a need for a more flexible
approach to future RAF training requirements. It also argues that the
campaign showed the importance of achieving air superiority and the value of
an agile
British intelligence organisations are cleared by the white paper of
misreading Saddam Hussein's intentions. Intelligence resources at the time
were focused on the changes in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The whole campaign cost the UK about Pounds 2.5bn, according to the paper.
The Ministry of Defence said yesterday that about Pounds 1.5bn had already
been supplied through burden-sharing and it expected approximately Pounds
500m to be provided before the end of the year.

FT  08 JUL 92 / DPP backs calls on plea bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, yesterday added her
voice to calls for a formal system of plea bargaining in English and Welsh
courts.
She said plea agreements worked out in open court where all parties knew
what was on offer were 'very sensible' and it was time to consider them.
Mrs Mills also said that formalising the system of sentence discounts for
defendants who plead guilty should be studied.
Presenting the Crown Prosecution Service's annual report, Mrs Mills said she
did not see an enhanced role for the CPS in the investigation of crimes as
the answer to miscarriages of justice, but thought there was a case for the
CPS giving more advice to the police before they charged suspects.
Last year 10 per cent of 1.5m cases handled by the CPS were discontinued
because the prosecution service disagreed with the police charges.
In response to the Competing for Quality white paper, published last
November, the CPS is also looking at functions that can be contracted out.
The National Audit Office yesterday called for urgent measures to control
the sharp rise in legal aid expenditure.
Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, says in a report to parliament on legal aid
in England and Wales that expenditure rose 85 per cent - from Pounds 387m to
Pounds 717m - between 1986-87 and 1990-91. In 1991-92 the Lord Chancellor's
Department and the Legal Aid Board expect a 30 per cent overspend - Pounds
210m more than the approved estimate of Pounds 698m.
A review by Touche Ross, chartered accountants, suggested that legal aid
frauds by lawyers could total Pounds 6.4m a year through claims for work not
done.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Era of efficiency and cost-cutting outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN may train to become commandos, the Citizen's Charter is to be enacted
at the Meteorological Office and a 'green minister', Lord Cranborne, has
been appointed at the Ministry of Defence. Those are just three of the ideas
in this year's defence white paper. But the underlying message is little
changed from last year: the 1990s will be a period of efficiency drives and
cost-cutting.
The commitment to developing 'smaller but better forces' following the
two-year-old Options for Change programme of cuts is restated. The
procurement side has been pruned in an effort to keep within the Treasury's
Pounds 24bn-Pounds 25bn target for annual spending until 1995.
One casualty is the Trigat medium-range anti-tank missile programme.
Spending plans now only take it through its development phase and not to
production. That cuts the cost of the project from Pounds 920m to Pounds
125m and follows a similar decision last year on the long-range version of
Trigat.
However, many spending plans do survive. They include the re-equipping of
the First Armoured Division with new tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and
other systems that will increase its combat capabilities by 25 per cent by
1995, and by more than a third by 2000.
The white paper confirms that more plastic-hulled Sandown-class minehunters
will be ordered. That will provide some reassurance to Vosper Thornycroft,
the smallest of the UK's four warship yards, which last January announced
about 350 job losses, partly as the result of a postponement of the Royal
Navy order.
More than 75 per cent of defence contracts in the past year were placed by
competition or priced by reference to to market forces, the white paper
says. The ministry is conducting a feasibility study on the creation of a
European armaments agency with a view to easing cross-border arms
procurement.
Other lessons learnt from civilian privatisation are also working their way
into the military. The introduction last year of a New Management Strategy
has led this year to the analysis of defence resources by budget-holder
rather than by programme.
The biggest budget-holder is UK Land Forces, which covers the armed forces
outside Germany, with Pounds 2bn to spend; followed by the Chief of Fleet
Support, which provides logistical support for the navy, with Pounds 1.6bn.
Those figures exclude equipment procurement.
The strategy, which introduced efficiency targets for planning and resource
allocations, is designed to save 1.5 per cent of the defence budget in its
first year, with a target of 2.5 per cent savings in each of the next three
years. Such measures should save up to Pounds 4bn annually within three
years, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said yesterday.
The ministry has also begun a period of 'simulated trading' with the Defence
Research Agency, which it hopes will lead to the agency, which consists of
four military research establishments, becoming a trading fund from April
next year. Trading-fund status would allow it to retain some of the revenues
it generates.
A total of 11 agencies, such as the Defence Research Agency and the
Meteorological Office, each now has its own chief executive, who is
'personally accountable for the efficient and effective management of the
activities under their control'. The chief executives will also be
responsible for compliance with the Citizen's Charter.
The white paper also outlines plans for the ministry to subsidise personnel
who want to buy property. Several other initiatives including ventures with
housing associations are planned.
The white paper contains precise numbers of equipment for the first time.
For exam-ple, the number of advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles to be
bought for the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier jump jets is 210, with 100 heavy
Spearfish torpedoes. However some figures, such as the number of Sting Ray
lightweight torpedoes, remain classified.
The ministry has set up an environmental task force under Lord Cranborne to
ensure compliance with international protocols on ozone-layer depletion.
Studies are under way into the feasibility of employing women in the
infantry, the Royal Marines commando forces and the Royal Armoured Corps.
But Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, said there was a 'certain
reluctance' about seeing women in the front line.
He said: 'We are looking right across the board and investigating what roles
women should take, but it is unlikely that the recommendation will be that
they can go to the infantry.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / Power bills could be cut by Pounds 300m: Watchdog proposes
new price structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY BILLS in England and Wales may fall after Offer, the electricity
industry watchdog, yesterday made its most significant move since the
industry was privatised two years ago to tighten electricity regulation.
Savings for large industrial consumers might help the government head off
complaints from companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries that high
electricity bills make them uncompetitive overseas.
Offer yesterday proposed a new pricing formula that would result in a
substantial cut in the National Grid Company's charges - which are a
proportion of all electricity bills paid by consumers.
A total of Pounds 300m could be cut from the aggregate bill of all consumers
in England and Wales over the four years for which the new formula would be
set.
The present formula allows National Grid to increase prices with inflation,
but under Offer's proposed formula it would have to keep price rises to 3
percentage points below inflation.
Most domestic consumers will save a few pounds as a result of the change,
Offer said, but very large industrial consumers may save millions of pounds.
The new formula would provide National Grid with 'a tough but realistic
target', said Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer.
Prof Littlechild said National Grid could afford to charge its customers
less by improving efficiency and by cutting costs by 5 per cent, rather than
the 3 per cent the company had proposed. Prof Littlechild said he also
believed that the company's cost of capital was significantly lower than it
claimed.
The new formula would not allow National Grid to increase charges if more
consumers used the network, as it previously could. Breaking the link
between more customers and higher revenues would help promote energy
efficiency by removing the incentive to boost demand, Offer said.
There is no sign yet whether National Grid, which said yesterday it was
considering Offer's statement, will accept the new formula. Some City
analysts believe the proposed formula could wipe Pounds 60m off the
company's profits. National Grid is expected to reply to Offer in about a
week.
If National Grid does not agree to the proposal, the case will be referred
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Shares in the 12 regional electricity companies that jointly own National
Grid rose yesterday, as the City had already discounted Offer's
announcement.
Offer's decision was viewed as a good omen for similar reviews of the
regional electricity companies, due in 1994. Analysts hope Offer, whose
proposed formula restricts National Grid's pricing rather than directly
limiting its profits, will take a similar approach to the regional
companies.
Offer also hinted that it would change the way their charges are linked to
inflation, as it did with National Grid yesterday. Instead of having to
predict inflation when they set their prices, the companies will be able to
use a historic inflation figure. That would make electricity prices more
predictable and stable, Prof Littlechild said.

FT  08 JUL 92 / City investigation brings invisible threats into view:
Robert Peston on a detailed inquiry into the Square Mile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE City of London's international trade in financial services, known as
'invisibles', is being threatened by deficiencies in the 'invisible
infrastructure', according to an exhaustive investigation called the City
Research Project.
The invisible infrastructure is the system of regulating and policing the
City: the regulatory authorities and the legal structure.
Professor Richard Brealey, who led the London Business School team
commissioned by the Corporation of London to write the report, identifies a
number of possible 'invisible' threats to the City. One is the proliferation
of official bodies with an interest in the development of financial markets.
Where 15 years ago the Bank of England and the Stock Exchange had a virtual
monopoly between them over regulation and the business of sponsoring the
City's growth, they now face challenges from the Securities and Investments
Board, the four self-regulatory organisations, the Treasury, the Office of
Fair Trading and the Department of Trade and Industry.
Prof Brealey believes that the lack of a 'single or co-ordinated focus on
London's international competitive position' is an obstacle to collective
action to correct any perceived trouble in the City.
On the other hand, he agrees that the creation of a 'super-authority',
combining all regulatory and sponsoring powers, would not necessarily be the
best solution. Such a body would be huge and unwieldy.
The report, the brainchild of Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, the investment
banker and former chairman of what was then called The Securities
Association, contains an extensive list of potential difficulties for the
City but has an almost total absence of solutions.
A programme of action may in time be drafted. The interim report published
yesterday was the result of six months of interviews with 200 City figures
and the distillation of thousands of pages of statistics. Prof Brealey has
another 2 1/2 years of research ahead of him.
Another invisible threat is the imposition of new regulations on the London
market in the form of European Community directives. In that case, the
EC-wide rules may not be sensitive enough to the particular needs of
Europe's most sophisticated markets in London. For example, the costs of
underwriting equities in London may rise - albeit less than originally
feared - after the agreement last month of a new capital adequacy directive.
Prof Brealey is less pessimistic about London's more visible ills, such as
its ageing and congested transport system. 'There is no clear evidence that
this is having a significant current effect on the City' he says.
Similarly, although City salaries are higher than those in Paris and
Frankfurt, he tentatively suggests they are justified by the apparently
superior productivity of City staff.
Prof Brealey defines an international financial centre as having two
characteristics: a relatively high level of cross-border transactions and a
concentration of offices of foreign financial institutions. On that
definition, London is the world's biggest international financial centre -
as distinct from being the world's biggest financial centre, since the
domestic business carried out in New York and Tokyo far outstrips London's.
The greatest concentration of financial employment in the world is also
found in London, the report says. Department of Employment figures show that
620,000 people worked in finance and business services there in 1989, about
100,000 more than in New York.
London also has the greatest number of foreign banks of any financial
centre. Even in 1991, a year of recession in banking, 31 new banks opened a
London office and 15 banks departed. There was a net loss of US banks from
London, but they were replaced by Japanese and Continental ones.
There may be little sign of banks leaving London, but other centres are
attracting new banks in greater num-bers.
At the same time, London's large share of total international bank lending
is declining slightly, according to figures from the Bank for International
Settlements, the international forum of bank regulators. Nonetheless, if
foreign lending to domestic residents is excluded, London is the largest
international banking centre with a 16 per cent share, compared with 15 per
cent for Tokyo.
One of the report's more surprising conclusions is that London's biggest
business by a wide margin is in foreign-exchange dealing. Prof Brealey has
for the first time tried to compare the gross revenues generated by
different financial services, although his attempts have been hampered by
the paucity of reliable data and the complete absence of statistics on some
newer financial products, such as swaps and derivatives.
Although he admits that his preliminary figures may need revision, he
believes the comparative positions of the 11 financial services shown in the
table are broadly accurate. The gross revenues include commissions, fees and
'spreads' on trading and lending activities - the difference between buying
and selling prices - but take no account of a business's overheads, or
profits and losses made from investments.
Even so, the banking sector's importance to London is demonstrated clearly,
given that foreign-exchange trading and international bank lending are
respectively the top two earners in the City.
International insurance, dominated by the Lloyd's insurance market, comes in
third place, although Prof Brealey's colleague, Ms Jenny Ireland, points out
that earnings from that source have been declining.
Given the relative importance of foreign-exchange trading to London, any
move towards monetary union in the EC would have profound effects for
London. Prof Brealey, however, does not believe the disappearance of trade
in sterling, francs and other European currencies would be too damaging.
For all that, it is clear why the government attaches great importance to
the location of a European central bank or its money-market dealing arm in
London. The rewards for the City of being the dealing centre for a unified
European currency could be huge.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Engineers look behind manufacturing decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNDERQUALIFIED work-force, uneven spending on research and development
and a shortage of strong medium-sized companies are among reasons for a
decline in the UK manufacturing sector, according to a report from the
Institution of Electrical Engineers.
The 63-page report, compiled by Professor Jack Levy, a leading figure in
engineering, is likely to focus new attention on some of the underlying
causes for the decline in manufacturing.
The report claims to demonstrate 'unequivocally' that services could not
replace, manufacturing, which accounts for about 62 per cent of UK exports.
It suggests that a trebling in overseas receipts from service industries
would be needed to replace manufacturing.
On the main indicators of the UK's competitive performance - output,
productivity, share of world trade and import penetration - the findings are
generally negative.
Manufacturing output has grown relatively slowly, while productivity has
improved, but is still below that of western Germany, Japan and the US. The
UK's share of world trade is falling again after stabilising in the 1980s,
and the trade balance is worsening.
The survey is intended to be an overview, an independent assessment and a
'compendium of remedies' from a number of recent high-profile reports on
manufacturing, including studies by the Confederation of British Industry
and the Lords select committee on science and technology.
The report finds that the UK workforce, apart from the top level, is
seriously under-qualified and that just 12 companies account for half of UK
spending on R&amp;D.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Rates cut in Australia to spur recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CANBERRA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA cut official interest rates early today to try to give further
stimulus to its stalling economy recovery.
The Reserve Bank of Australia, the central bank, said it would act in the
money market to cut official cash rates to around 5.75 per cent from 6.5 per
cent.
It also cut its rediscount rate - the rate it pays on treasury notes prior
to maturity - to 6.25 per cent from 7 per cent.
The rate cuts were less than generally expected. A full percentage point
drop had been widely forecast.
The last cut in rates came just two months ago but Australia's hesitant
recovery from recession has underlined the urgency of further measures.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said the country's unemployment
problems showed the need for a spur to economic growth. But he indicated
that the government might lift interest rates again if a pick-up in
inflation made this necessary.
Pressure for a rate cut grew yesterday with the release of the preliminary
budget deficit of ADollars 9.4bn (Pounds 3.66bn) for the year which ended in
June. This is higher than the ADollars 9.3bn revised forecast in May and
double the original ADollars 4.7bn estimated in August last year.
The government attributed the deficit to the slower than expected economic
recovery which had led to further falls in revenue and large increases in
welfare payments.
Outlays rose to ADollars 102.7m from the original estimate of ADollars
101.5m, mainly due to the spending programme introduced in February by the
prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, to stimulate the economy. The programme was
designed to bring unemployment below 10 per cent before the election which
must be held by mid-1993.
The Reserve Bank figures released yesterday showed stagnant lending to
business.
Unemployment figures due tomorrow will bring more bad news for the
government. The June unemployment rate is expected to show little change
from the 10.6 per cent recorded in May.
The run of bad economic news has dented confidence in Mr Keating's
government. Only three months ago, Mr Keating appeared to have polished up
the battered image of the government left by his predecessor, Mr Bob Hawke.
Mr Keating will attempt to regain some ground in a forthcoming 'employment
summit' where he is expected to announce more steps to create jobs,
especially for young people.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Israeli chorus for privatisation sets Labour's agenda: Hugh
Carnegy reports on a stunted programme that could provide much-needed funds
but divide the new government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST sight it looks like a case of the cat being asked to hand over the
cream: Israel's Labour party, in the past a diligent builder of socialist
structures, is facing a near unanimous chorus of advice to speed up
privatisation when it takes over the government next week.
Far from mewling in protest, these days Labour leaders wrinkle their noses
at the notion of state control of industry. In fact, they queue up to voice
the merits of selling-off the great chunks of Israel's productive capacity
that have accumulated in government hands.
'In principle we have to review everything,' says Mr Avraham Shochat, a
senior Labour member of parliament and candidate for the post of finance
minister.
Privatisation has become accepted in Israel as an essential element in
generating sufficient growth and funds to cope with mass immigration from
the former Soviet Union. A report on Israel, published this month by the
Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), says that the government could raise
between Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.6bn) and Dollars 10bn from asset sales over
the next four years.
That would represent a significant part of the Dollars 50bn the Bank of
Israel estimates is required to attract and absorb a target of 1m Jews from
former Soviet territories within five years.
But though the outgoing administration was controlled by the avowedly
free-market Likud party, privatisation steps have been painfully slow since
First Boston of New York produced a plan in 1988 for privatising 24
companies within four years.
Partial stakes in key companies, such as Israel Chemicals and Bezeq, the
telecommunications monopoly, have been successfully floated on the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange. Some small companies, such as Maman, an airport cargo
handling outfit, have been sold. But government control over almost all of
the biggest state companies remains intact.
Labour will also have to tackle the country's big four banks, which control
the vast majority of the local banking system and are big industrial owners.
Since a Dollars 7bn government bail-out in 1983, following a share price
collapse, a majority of the shares in Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Israel
Discount Bank (IDB) and Bank Mizrahi have been held by the state, although
without management control.
Bidding is under way for Bank Mizrahi and Bank Igud, a unit of Bank Leumi.
Minority portions of Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi and IDB are projected for a
stock exchange flotation. But legislation placing the banks under state
control if they are not sold off by next year will need to be amended if
nationalisation of the others is to be avoided.
The government's tendency to use the banks as instruments of policy, and a
long record of bad debts, has raised questions over whether foreign
investors will be willing to come into the market. To date, no foreign banks
operate in Israel, bar a partnership that Barclays of the UK holds in an
offshoot of IDB. Without foreign investors, potential local buyers - such as
the Histadrut trade union federation, which would like to repurchase its
pre-1983 ownership of Bank Hapoalim - will find it hard to raise the
necessary funds.
Mr Pinhas Landau, author of the EIU report, believes that any structural or
ideological impediments to the process of privatisation will soon be swept
aside by a more pressing concern: the fiscal pressures on the new government
imposed by immigration. 'The government,' he says, 'will have to have the
money and that's what will drive them.'
Labour certainly sees privatisation as a vital source of funds for
much-needed infrastructural investment in the economy. But some advocates of
market reforms in Israel continue to doubt Labour's commitment to getting
the government out of decision-making in industry and business.
Mr Shochat himself said there were three categories of company in which
Labour envisaged the government continuing to retain a controlling 26 per
cent shareholding. He described these as 'natural monopolies', companies of
strategic importance to the country, and those which play a vital security
role.
These encompass Bezeq and the Electric Corporation in the first category,
Israel Chemicals in the second and Israel Aircraft Industries in the third.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader, has added El Al to the list. As one of
its last acts, the outgoing government at the weekend ruled that Zim, the
merchant shipping company, should also remain under government control.
'I think Rabin honestly wants to see privatisation pursued,' says Mr Daniel
Doron, head of the Israel Centre for Social and Economic Progress. 'But he
will face formidable interest groups in his party who will interpret
privatisation in a peculiar way. I don't think many of them realise what
private ownership means, what a regime of competition is and why it is
important to the economy.'

FT  08 JUL 92 / S African sackings likely to fuel militancy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LARGE-SCALE sackings of striking workers in South Africa are expected to
fuel shopfloor militancy and bolster the mass action campaign of the African
National Congress and its trade union ally, the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (Cosatu).
The dismissal this week of 6,000 workers at the Toyota assembly plant in
Durban follows the sacking of 7,400 state health workers by the Transvaal
Provincial Administration (TPA). Although both strikes preceded the start of
the mass action campaign, they have assisted Cosatu's efforts to raise the
level of industrial activity culminating in a general strike next month.
A Cosatu official said the dismissals were 'adding fuel to the fire' of
already high levels of industrial action. Andrew Levy and Associates, a
labour research group, estimates that 650,000 working days were lost in the
first half of 1992 compared to 375,000 in the same period in 1991. There is
already evidence that the large-scale dismissals will provoke widespread
solidarity action from other unions.
Meanwhile Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, yesterday held talks with
business leaders about the political impasse in the country. The business
group held similar talks last week with President F W de Klerk and with
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader. Mr Mandela said he was 'very
encouraged' by the talks which had 'narrowed the gaps between us'.
The business delegation conveyed its disapproval of mass action saying 'a
groundswell of opinion is rising that we cannot support actions which will
further damage or destroy the economy or bring more violence or disruption
in its wake.'
Toyota claims that strike activity this year has cost it 45 days of
production or R675m (Pounds 128m) in lost turnover. Last month the Reserve
Bank reported that the economy had contracted at an annualised rate of 2 per
cent during the first quarter.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday offered to
send Mr Cyrus Vance, the US diplomat, on a mission to South Africa and the
Security Council scheduled a debate for next week on the political crisis,
Reuter reports from the UN.
Diplomats said the plan for a goodwill mission had not yet received
agreement from Pretoria or the ANC.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Saudi banker in BCCI case quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHEIKH Khalid bin Mahfouz yesterday resigned as the chief operating officer
of National Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi Arabia's biggest and best-connected
bank, saying he would devote his 'full energies' to fighting fraud charges
brought against him in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)
affair.
Sheikh Khalid's resignation comes less than a week after he and a
London-based associate were indicted in New York on charges that they had
schemed between 1985 and 1991 to defraud depositors, regulators and auditors
of the collapsed BCCI.
The indictment, announced by Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney, alleges that Sheikh Khalid and Mr Haroon Kahlon, an associate,
fraudulently obtained more than Dollars 300m from BCCI depositors and other
customers.
The charges are diplomatically sensitive, because of the prominence of the
bin Mahfouz family in Saudi Arabia, where NCB is considered to have close
ties to the royal family.
Sheikh Khalid reacted angrily, vowing to fight the indictment and calling
the charges 'completely unwarranted'. In New York yesterday, an aide to Mr
Morgenthau noted that NCB had not been indicted in the BCCI affair, but he
said the bank remained under investigation.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Mahfouz, chairman of NCB's management committee and
Sheikh Khalid's brother, said in a statement from the bank's Jeddah head
office he had 'reluctantly accepted' the resignation, which he called 'a
sacrifice he believes is in the best interests of the bank'. Sheikh Mohammed
will take operational control of NCB.
The statement quoted Sheikh Khalid saying 'he cannot allow the continuing
smooth operation of the bank to be interfered with in any way' as a result
of the indictment.
'We are fully confident of Sheikh Khalid's innocence,' the statement said.
'God willing, he will be vindicated.'
Sheikh Khalid's resignation clouds the immediate outlook for NCB, which
holds around a third of Saudi Arabia's total bank deposits, claimed assets
in 1991 of SR82.3bn (Dollars 22bn) and is widely viewed as the Saudi royal
family's bank, but which has produced no full financial figures since 1989.
Capital Intelligence (CI), the Arab world's leading bank rating agency, last
month suspended NCB's rating on the ground that it had produced no accounts
for 1990 and 1991 and said in a circular to clients that the bank's
ownership structure, as an unlimited liability partnership, was
'inappropriate for its size'.
The bank, which prizes the confidentiality afforded by its position as Saudi
Arabia's sole privately-held bank, is majority owned by the bin Mahfouz
family, with the kingdom's wealthy al-Kaaki family holding the remainder.
NCB closed its London branch in May, justifying the move on cost grounds.
However, the Bank of England is widely believed to have been uncomfortable
that the bank, which had a loan book worth some Dollars 1bn in London, had
released no figures since 1989.

THE chairman of the House banking committee yesterday disclosed new
documents which he claimed showed that President George Bush played a direct
role in White House efforts to thwart congressional investigations into US
policy on Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait.
Mr Henry Gonzalez, the committee chairman, also disclosed a secret 1989
report by the CIA to the White House and State Department that indicated
loans from the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)
were being used to fund Iraq's nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
programmes.
The disclosures could embarrass the Bush administration, which is already
facing a possible call by the House judiciary committee to name a special
prosecutor to investigate the BNL affair and US policy on Iraq. Mr Bush's
Iraqi policies are already under fire from Mr Ross Perot, a potential
independent presidential candidate, and congressional Democrats.
The six-page CIA report, 'Iraq-Italy: Repercussions of BNL-Atlanta Scandal',
concluded that a failure to approve a pending Dollars 1bn US loan guarantee
for Iraq would harm US-Iraqi relations.
Mr Gonzalez said the CIA report was sent to the National Security Council
and the State Department on November 6 1989, just two days before a White
House meeting agreed to approve the loan guarantee.
Mr Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, noted in a statement before the House of
Representatives that President Bush had recently denied that US funds helped
to enhance Iraq's weapons capability. Mr Gonzalez claimed the president's
assertion was 'untrue'.
Mr Gonzalez also told Congress he gained access to Treasury Department notes
which revealed that the chief US prosecutor in Atlanta investigating the BNL
affair received a telephone call in 1989 from the White House and got the
impression there was concern about the 'embarrassment level'.
The Atlanta prosecutor was not provided with the November 1989 CIA report
about BNL until August 1990, a full year after the investigation had begun,
Mr Gonzalez claimed.
Mr Gonzalez released documents to buttress his assertion that President Bush
was directly involved in a cover-up of 'embarrassing and potentially
illegal' activities related to US Iraqi policies.
Among these were notes from a White House meeting about how to deal with
congressional investigations that said: 'The president will want to meet
with all cabinet secretaries one-on-one to work it out adequately
internally. Very sensitive ..'
Mr Gonzalez said Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security
adviser, and Mr Robert Gates, the CIA director, also played direct roles in
limiting congressional access to documents relating to US exports to Iraq of
militarily useful technologies.

<TEXT>
VIOLENCE erupted in a mainly Hispanic neighbourhood in northern Manhattan on
Monday night, above, as hundreds of demonstrators burned cars and buildings
and looted shops in a rampage that left one man dead and 15 injured, writes
Alan Friedman in New York.
The rioting, in the Washington Heights section of New York, is an
embarrassment to Mayor David Dinkins less than a week before the city hosts
the Democratic party's national convention. Mr Dinkins has been trying to
smarten up New York's image.
The six hours of violence began when residents marched through the streets
to protest at the shooting by a policeman last Friday of Mr Jose Garcia, a
member of the local Dominican community. Police said Mr Garcia was shot dead
in a struggle to disarm him, but the protesters claimed he was unarmed.
The demonstrators - mainly Dominican teenagers - split into smaller groups
and began hurling rocks and bottles at anti-riot police. Mayor Dinkins
visited the neighbourhood as the violence began, pledging a full
investigation of the circumstances of Mr Garcia's death.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Clinton still to reveal running-mate
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE days before the start of the Democratic party convention in New York,
one name is still missing from the programme: that of Governor Bill
Clinton's vice-presidential running-mate.
Mr Clinton yesterday met Mr Warren Christopher, the Washington lawyer
leading his search committee. The Arkansas governor has succeeded in
wrapping his choice in mystery - although he said last night 'we're getting
very close'.
Several names are circulated, but most tipsters are cautious enough to
include the possibility of a surprise on their short-lists. Even the timing
of Mr Clinton's announcement remains in doubt, with some pundits suggesting
he might wait until the middle of next week's All Star baseball game to
ensure a big TV audience.
Three men are most widely mentioned: Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania,
Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee.
Senator Wofford leapt to the top of the list yesterday when he met Mr
Clinton in Washington. A surprise victor in last year's Pennsylvania senate
by-election, he would confirm an emphasis on domestic issues, especially
health care reform.
Mr Hamilton would bring some of the gravitas and foreign affairs experience
that Mr Clinton is thought to lack. His odds lengthened this weekend when he
distanced himself from Mr Clinton and the centre of the Democratic party on
the issues of abortion and parental leave - although his reservations about
abortion rights are similar to Mr Wofford's.
Mr Gore would bring good credentials on environmental issues, but an
all-southern ticket could be risky: Yankee prejudice is alive and well, as
Mr Clinton himself discovered during the New York Democratic primary
campaign.
Also viewed as potential choices are three other senators: Mr Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, Mr Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Mr Bob Graham of Florida.
Of these six, only Mr Wofford and perhaps Mr Graham have the capacity to
bring Mr Clinton a big state he might otherwise lose.

cars
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN car importers and foreign car manufacturers yesterday attacked as
'boldfaced protectionism' trade legislation to be discussed today which
would force Japan to negotiate a quota of 1.65m imports or face US
retaliation.
The amendment to this year's House trade bill is sponsored by Democratic
Congressman Sander Levin of Michigan and House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt. Despite Bush Administration insistence that the legislation would
be vetoed, opponents say it will be difficult to defeat because the House
Democratic leadership wants to use it as a campaign issue at next week's
Democratic convention.
Opponents are also fighting a requirement that Japanese 'transplants' -
factories in the US - increase their use of American-made parts to 70 per
cent in the next two years. They argue that such restrictions are the type
of barriers to trade and investment the US is seeking to eliminate in the
Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Walter Huizenga, of the American International Automobile Dealers
Association, yesterday said the legislation would have 'a chilling effect'
on investment in the US. About 32,000 US workers are employed by Japanese
'transplants'.
Even as the importers and 'transplants' were sending lobbyists around
Capitol Hill, congressmen have been digesting a recent report, issued by a
joint US-Canada panel, established under the Free Trade Agreement. It says
that unless the North American industry improves its competitiveness,
100,000 jobs could be lost in the next five years.
The report warned that US costs were rising, while Japanese costs had
declined. 'As a result, the Japanese industry appears to possess a major
advantage over its North American rivals in internally generated funds
available for capital investment and to enhance competitiveness.'
Capital requirements are likely to increase during the 1990s - almost
Dollars 600bn (Pounds 314.1bn) will be spent on product development for the
North American market through to 1996. The report called on the US
government to negotiate with Japan several measures to reduce the automotive
trade imbalance, including elimination of formal and informal barriers to
the Japanese market.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Withholding tax deal advances German reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S taxation reform programme has advanced further with agreement on a
scheme for a 30 per cent withholding tax on investment income, to take
effect at the start of next year.
Interbank dealings and investors classed as non-residents for tax purposes
will be exempt from the new charges.
The new levy, 5 percentage points higher than that originally proposed by
the government last November, will be deducted at source from all investment
earnings of more than DM6,000 (Pounds 2,068) a year for individuals and
DM12,000 for couples. Earnings in excess of the tax-free allowances from
bonds and securities traded over the counter will be taxed at 35 per cent.
The new scheme is the successor to an ill-fated 10 per cent flat rate levy,
imposed in 1987 and promptly withdrawn when an estimated DM80bn poured out
of the country.
The deal was worked out on Monday night by a parliamentary arbitration
committee which was asked to mediate when the original proposal was rejected
by the opposition-dominated Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament.
The BVR co-operative savings banks association welcomed the deal, claiming
that the allowances would mean that 80 per cent of savers would pay no tax
on their interest income.
The current system, which is dependent on voluntary declaration, had to be
changed when it was declared unconstitutional by the courts last June.
At present all investment income above DM600 for individuals and DM1,200 for
couples is notionally subject to a 25 per cent charge. However, avoidance is
widespread. The agreement represents the results of a year's efforts to meet
the requirements of the constitutional court, minimise the impact on small
savers, and at the same time prevent capital flight.
The compromise also marks another step in Bonn's efforts to shuffle the
components of the tax system to allow it to divert more funds from the west
into the collapsed east German economy.
The breakthrough came in February when the government manoeuvred through an
increase in value added tax from 14 to 15 per cent, effective next January
1, together with higher thresholds for company property tax and trade
profits tax.
The VAT deal was expected to yield an extra DM33bn for the east over the
next three years. Monday night's compromise will produce an estimated DM12bn
a year, a sum which has also been committed to the five new federal states
for 1993 and 1994.
The German government is considering a wide range of direct and indirect
taxes and levies in its attempt to plug the gaps in its medium-term
financial plans, according to Mr Friedrich Bohl, senior minister in the
chancellor's office.
Ideas under consideration include denying certain tax concessions to
companies which do not invest, special charges for 'non-investing'
high-earners such as lawyers and architects, road tolls for goods traffic
and increased duties on crude oil. The main aims are to supplement the flow
of funds to the east and to finance restructuring of the debt-laden railway
network.

FT  08 JUL 92 / France's siege eases but shortages grow
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a third of the roadblocks which have paralysed France for the past
nine days were lifted by yesterday afternoon, but the economic damage
continued to mount.
Truck drivers slowly rolled back their siege as government officials visited
the blockades to explain the contents of an accord on pay and conditions,
reached by drivers' representatives and the government in the early hours of
the morning.
The most vulnerable industries, cars, petrol, food, tourism and chemicals,
have already had to make temporary lay-offs, especially in Rhone-Alpes and
the south.
Shops were running low on stocks throughout France. The Leclerc chain of
supermarkets said its stocks were half as high as usual in fresh fruit and
staples, such as sugar and flour. There were fears that worse was to come on
the roads as it remained unclear when all the barriers would go, let alone
when truckers would resume deliveries.
The Interior Ministry claimed that 60 blockades, involving 3,200 trucks, out
of the original 160 roadblocks had been dispersed by lunchtime. By evening
the ministry claimed that all main routes except for one section of the A6
north of Lyon. Violent clashes between truckers and police were reported.
The A1 from Paris to Lille, the main route for traffic from northern Europe
and the Channel ports, was fully open in both directions, it said. The A6
from the capital to Beaune in eastern France and the A7 from Lyons towards
the Spanish frontier, were also open, said the ministry. Blockades were
reported to be disappearing in Brittany.
Progress was slow, as some truckers regrouped to form new barriers elsewhere
and others staged operations escargot (go-slows). Business leaders warned
that supply shortages could force some companies to close. It was proving
impossible to compensate adequately by shifting to rail and air, said the
Conseil National de Commerce. Nice airport had only 24 hours' aviation fuel
left.
Renault, the motor group, closed three of its four French assembly plants
yesterday morning, though they reopened in the afternoon after fresh
supplies arrived. The situation was 'literally changing from hour to hour',
said Renault. Peugeot stopped two assembly lines and a kit packaging plant
in eastern France, employing 17,000 people, and warned that more lay-offs
will be needed this morning. Its Citroen subsidiary closed a plant at
Aulnay. Michelin, the tyre maker, warned employees that lay-offs could come
at any time.
Motorway operators said they had lost FFr150m (Pounds 15.4m) on the main
north-south routes alone, while the hoteliers' association estimated that
occupancy was down by between 10 and 50 per cent and warned that some chains
could face serious cashflow problems.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Brendan Hynes was sacked as chairman of Telecom Eireann, the state-run
telecommunications company, at the weekend because he had lost the support
and confidence of its board of directors, Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn, the
Irish minister for transport and telecommunications, said yesterday.
She told parliament that she was left with a choice of either firing Mr
Hynes or facing the resignation 'individually or collectively' of the board.
'The problem was not with the former chairman's thinking. The problem was
with (his) modus operandi . . . the chairman must secure board approval for
his/her proposals,' she said.
The opposition Fine Gael party attacked the government for 'mismanaging'
what is Ireland's most profitable public sector company and a party
spokesman said: 'We are not really any wiser over the reasons for the
differences between Mr Hynes and the board.' Telecom made a IPounds 94m
profit on a IPounds 782m turnover last year. It has 1m customers, 13,500
employees and is estimated to be worth some IPounds 1bn were it to be
privatised.
Mr Hynes was appointed to the post just six months ago, replacing Mr Michael
Smurfit who resigned last September over a controversial deal to build a new
headquarters.
Mr Hynes took a hands-on approach to the non-executive chairmanship,
believing he had been given a mandate from the then telecommunications
minister, Mr Seamus Brennan, to carry out a thorough review of the company
ahead of its possible privatisation. Mr Brennan, however, lost his post to
Ms Geoghegan Quinn, in the cabinet reshuffle following the resignation of Mr
Charles Haughey as prime minister.
Nonetheless, Mr Hynes, whose main business experience has been in the mining
and exploration sector, pressed ahead with his review and in a statement at
the weekend indicated that despite Telecom's good profit levels, problems of
overmanning and heavy capital expenditure plans would have to be addressed
to make the company competitive in the single European market.
Telecom's directors yesterday went on the counter-attack saying that they
'unanimously' reject Mr Hynes' criticisms and that on June 26 they passed a
motion of no confidence in him as chairman.

<TEXT>
ICELAND can expect a sharp decline of 2.8 per cent in its output this year
with a modest 0.5 per cent improvement in 1993, according to the latest
survey of the country's economy published yesterday by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The report blames the poor short-term outlook for the country's fishing
industry which accounts for three quarters of Iceland's exports. The report
also blames world aluminium prices that have forced the postponement of a
multi-national smelter project.
Following optimism last year, the OECD says that as a result of events
beyond the country's control there is going to be further stagnation despite
the relatively low level of inflation for Iceland of 7 per cent.

<TEXT>
POLITICAL TURMOIL in the Balkans worsened last night as the government of
the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia fell - after failing to win
international recognition for its declared independence.
Collapse of the fragile ruling coalition raises serious questions about the
future stability of Macedonia. It casts doubt on the political future of
President Kiro Gligorov, who has gone on futile missions abroad for
diplomatic recognition.
The republic of 2m people - up to 30 per cent of them ethnic Albanians  -
has strained relations with all four neighbours: Greece, Albania, Serbia and
Bulgaria.
Greece in particular has objected to its drive for recognition, fearing the
effects on its own ethnic minorities. The EC and US have been reluctant to
go against Greece's wishes.
As frustration has grown in Macedonia, there has been pressure from the
ultra-nationalist VMRO party for closer ties with Bulgaria, although
Bulgaria yesterday pledged not to interfere in the Balkans.
There is concern, too, that Macedonia might be destabilised if ethnic
Albanians seek closer links with Albania or with ethnic Albanians in
Serbia's Kosovo province.
The coalition government collapsed when the republic's parliament passed a
vote of no confidence in it by an overwhelming majority. Under the
republic's constitution, President Gligorov has 10 days to appoint a new
prime minister.
Mr Slobodan Petrovic, editor of Puls, a Skopje weekly, last night said: 'The
collapse could heighten instability. Mr Gligorov may not be able to appoint
a prime minister within the next 10 days.'
Macedonia is struggling to cope with the effects of fighting in other former
Yugoslav republics, including an influx of 35,000 refugees from Bosnia.
Mr Petrovic said: 'In the air we feel the scent of war. . . but emotions may
cool down and people will realise the fall of the government is a Pyrrhic
victory.'

   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the world's seven biggest industrial democracies yesterday
adopted a political declaration proclaiming a new non-confrontational
partnership between east and west, including the Asia-Pacific region, and
expressing strong support for an enhanced peacekeeping and peace-making role
for the United Nations.
Emphasising that the need for international co-operation had been underlined
by the instability and conflicts provoked by resurgent nationalism and
inter-ethnic tensions, as in Yugoslavia, the declaration also gave a ringing
endorsement of the European Community's Maastricht treaty as 'a historic
step on the way to European union'.
'Its implementation will enhance political stability on the European
continent and open up new opportunities for co-operation,' the declaration
said, in a clear attempt to counter the growing public hostility in several
EC countries about ratifying the treaty, in the wake of its rejection by the
Danish electorate.
Noting that the tasks and responsibilities of the UN had increased
dramatically since last year's G7 summit in London, particularly in the
field of crisis prevention, conflict management and the protection of
minorities, the seven leaders expressed firm support for the efforts of Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to strengthen the world
organisation's role in preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping.
But though the declaration described Mr Boutros Ghali's 'Agenda for peace'
proposals, published last week, as 'a valuable contribution' to the work of
the UN, British officials said G7 governments were still studying his plan
for permanent UN standby forces, ready to intervene in conflicts at 24
hours' notice.
Stressing the importance of improved co-operation between the UN and
regional organisations such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe, the leaders called on the CSCE summit in Helsinki later this week
to establish a special security forum and to strengthen the organisation's
capabilities for conflict prevention, crisis management and peaceful
resolution of disputes.
The declaration stressed the need to curb the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the missiles capable of
delivering them. The leaders expressed their firm conviction that 'the
indefinite extension' of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) when it
comes up for review in 1995 would be an essential contribution to this
process.
Countries not yet party to the NPT were urged to join as soon as possible by
the leaders. In particular, they looked forward to early adherence to the
treaty, as non-nuclear weapons states, by Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus,
as well as the other non-Russian states of the former Soviet Union, and said
they attached the highest importance to the establishment in the former
Soviet Union of effective export controls on nuclear materials and weapons.
Underlining the need for the most effective possible action to safeguard
nuclear materials and to prevent the transfer or the clandestine production
of nuclear weapons, the declaration warned that the offer of nuclear
co-operation by the western industrialised countries would, in future, be
conditional on adherence to the NPT and the adoption of full-scope
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
A separate statement issued by the German chairman of the conference said
the leaders had also adopted positions on the following subjects:
Nagorno-Karabakh: they deplored the continued fighting in this region and
urged the parties to cease hostilities immediately and to participate in
negotiations. 'We emphasise that we shall, on no account, recognise faits
accomplis brought about by force.'
Iraq: the leaders noted that Iraq still refused to comply with all
resolutions of the Security Council without reservation. They said they
would continue to demand elimination of all Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction and release of all prisoners. It was essential for Baghdad to
comply with Security Council resolutions so that food and medical supplies
could be distributed on an equitable basis.
South Africa: the leaders called on all sides to resume negotiations as soon
as possible and to make greater efforts to prevent violence. Sustainable
economic growth was essential for an enduring solution of the country's
problems.

FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Russia 'must gain controlof monetary
expansion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, JUREK MARTIN and Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of the Group of Seven industrialised democracies will today
stress that Russia must gain control over its rapid monetary expansion if it
is to avoid hyperinflation and grave social and political instability.
According to officials, they agreed at their summit meeting yesterday to be
'friendly but frank' and spell out plainly what the G7 can and cannot do
when Russia's President Boris Yeltsin joins the leaders for talks later
today.
Mr Yeltsin, who arrived in Munich last night, will not leave empty handed,
however. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, yesterday underlined that
the G7 would provide 'help for the Russians to help themselves.'
A senior US official said he would take home 'a very substantial package'
comprising Dollars 1bn (Pounds 521m) in credits agreed with the IMF, a
pledge that the G7 will back rescheduling of official debts of Dollars 2.5bn
and a further Dollars 1bn to be released by other financial institutions
such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
A Canadian official said the rescheduling would be a 'normal' arrangement of
the type that the Paris Club of creditor countries provides for nations with
debt problems. It would have a five-year grace period with repayments over
the following 10 years.
Once rescheduling is agreed, the way would be open for G7 countries to
disburse bilateral trade credits to Russia, as part of the Dollars 24bn
financial support package announced in April. Altogether, Russia can expect
Dollars 11bn in bilateral flows from western industrial countries under the
April accord and is thought to have received between Dollars 4bn and Dollars
5bn already. But some promised credits have been held up as a result of
growing arrears on existing debts.
According to Mr David Mulford, the US treasury undersecretary for
international affairs, it is 'possible' that the planned Dollars 6bn rouble
stabilisation fund could be activated by the end of the year.
However, for that to happen President Yeltsin's government will have to
obtain a firm grip on credit growth, inflation and its budget deficit so
that the rouble can acquire stability. Russia will also have to regulate
financial relations with republics staying in the rouble zone to ensure its
monetary policies are not undermined.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, is due to start the G7's talks on
economic matters with Mr Yeltsin today. In addition to underlining the need
for monetary stabilisation, he will stress the importance of structural
reforms including privatisation and land reform and provision of a safety
net to cope with rising unemployment following closure of uneconomic
factories.
Russia was pressed yesterday by both the G7 in Munich and the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe, meeting in Helsinki, to withdraw its
130,000 troops from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, writes our Foreign Staff.
A statement issued for the G7 by Germany said Russia's economic difficulties
did not justify keeping its troops on the territory of unwilling countries.
 A brief CSCE statement called for 'an appropriate bilateral agreement,
including timetables, for the early, orderly and complete withdrawal' of the
troops.
The three Baltic states have demanded that troops should begin withdrawing
immediately and complete an internationally supervised pullout by the end of
next year.
Russia says it has nowhere to house those forces and no money to build
accommodation and wants to extend the withdrawal until 1998.

UNLIKELY as it may sound at such an international circus, world summits are
still about personal contact, personal chemistry, about leaders getting to
know each other.
So body language means something, and the great and good are still not above
a little blatant physical point-scoring.
Take Monday night's reception at the Schloss Nymphenburg given by Mr Helmut
Kohl. It all began with the leaders arriving one by one at the great stone
staircase, solemnly ascending and joining the chancellor on the balcony to
wave at what appeared to be a small crowd of loyal retainers, and a band.
As is his wont, President Francois Mitterrand went to inordinate lengths to
arrive last. He turned up a good five minutes after all his colleagues - or
so he must have thought. But it was not so. He was beaten for the slot by
the scheming Mr Brian Mulroney of Canada, who must have twiddled his thumbs
for ages in his hotel suite to win the race to keep the others waiting.
Perhaps it was a message for Quebec?
Once on the balcony, witness phase two. As if by magic, all the great
leaders somehow managed to squeeze to the front, to wave for the television
cameras. All that is, except a man who has shone in Munich for his unusual
modesty and shyness - Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission. He was left peeping over Mr Mitterrand's shoulder.
Perhaps it was deliberate, for Mr Delors has also been pretty retiring in
the debate inside the summit. In the first main round on the world economy,
he said nothing at all, preferring to let the debate develop. Since then he
has kept well out of the firing line.
The same cannot be said for the one man who managed to wheedle his way into
that front line on the balcony when he should not have been there: Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, Germany's economics minister and vice-chancellor, and the least
important member of Mr Kohl's team.
Just as Mr Delors was spotted on television trying to peer past Mr
Mitterrand, Mr Mollemann could be seen pushing into the picture, just under
Mr Kohl's left shoulder. Those who know the man are not surprised.
Summits are also about meaningful entertainment. Mr Theo Waigel, German
finance minister and leader of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union,
knows all about it.
He began his day yesterday with a massive Bavarian breakfast for the press -
supposedly an intimate occasion with about 200 mostly German journalists.
Pride of place on the menu went to the bulging Bavarian white sausage, a
confection of veal and herbs, served with sauerkraut, sweet mustard, and
even beer, for those feeling strong enough.
Not content with such a sterling start to the day, Mr Waigel turned right
round and entertained his fellow finance ministers to an identical meal at
9am. Indeed, his British counterpart, Mr Norman Lamont, found the fare so
good that he allegedly went back for second helpings of white sausage.
There's no accounting for taste.

FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Major fails to revive trade talks - EC
farm subsidies remain stumbling block

THE high-risk bid by Mr John Major, British prime minister, to revitalise
the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks failed yesterday.
British officials had insisted the prime minister would take up the issue of
the stalled trade talks vigorously in bilateral talks with France's
President Francois Mitterrand yesterday afternoon. In the end, however, Mr
Major said nothing, after the French president made it clear he would not
support any breakthrough during the Munich summit.
Even before he met Mr Mitterrand, Mr Major's proposals to break the deadlock
had been frustrated. UK officials who had appeared optimistic on Monday
evening were visibly downcast 12 hours later. The stumbling block remained
the dispute between the EC and the US on cutting Community subsidies to farm
trade.
Talks early yesterday between US President George Bush and Mr Jacques
Delors, EC Commission president, failed to advance the issue significantly.
'No substantial progress was made,' a Commission spokesman reported. 'If
anyone was expecting a breakthrough this morning, it did not happen.'
The meeting between the two presidents and their senior officials was the
culmination of 36 hours of feverish efforts to push the farm trade talks to
a successful conclusion.
The top-level politicking on trade started on Sunday night at a working
dinner attended by Presidents Bush and Mitterrand - well before the formal
start of the summit. This was at odds with widespread official advice before
the summit that the issue was too complex to unravel while leaders were
meeting under such a powerful spotlight.
The Uruguay Round was raised again at a bilateral meeting on Monday between
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Bush. Hopes rose after the German
government spokesman reported that the two leaders had agreed negotiations
on trade reform should be continued with vigour and that the two sides were
closer than many people thought.
Also on Monday, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary and current chairman
of the EC council of ministers, met Mr Frans Andriessen, the Community's
external affairs commissioner, and Mr James Baker, US secretary of state.
The three agreed there was a need to reach a breakthrough to end the current
blockage.
Mr Hurd's judgment - wrong in the end - was that the US and EC were geared
up to take advantage at once of a 'political push' in the talks. Mr Major's
move was Britain's attempt to provide that push.
Details of Mr Major's proposals remain obscure. It is thought he proposed
extending beyond the six years proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt
secretary-general, the period over which EC farm subsidies should be
substantially reduced. He also suggested less radical cuts in the volume of
the EC's subsidised farm exports than the 24 per cent proposed in the Dunkel
plan.
These ideas - which had been discussed at official level for several weeks
without success - would have involved some easing of positions adopted by
the big industrialised countries represented at the summit, in particular
France and Germany.
The ideas were welcomed by the US but barely acknowledged by France, the
EC's biggest food exporter, which insisted instead that the US should
respond positively to recent reforms of the EC common agricultural policy.
While French opposition effectively buried any hope of a breakthrough, the
UK made clear it would continue to press for progress on the Uruguay Round
and would be seeking strong language in today's final summit communique.
Mr Major's initiative was always risky. Officials from most G7 countries had
warned that Munich was not the place to expect a breakthrough on farm trade,
partly because of the September 20 French referendum on the Maastricht
treaty. The warning signs were clear when, in the middle of last week,
officials abandoned a 10-day push to find a basis for settlement ahead of
the summit.
Nonetheless, Mr Major insisted that trade reform was his 'number one
priority at the summit', driven perhaps by a desire to put an early British
stamp on the EC presidency.
He won some applause for his efforts.
Officials from several delegations suggested that the differences among the
G7 countries were not great. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said
the protagonists were much closer than at last year's summit in London. One
senior EC official said all that was lacking was the political will to reach
a settlement.
British officials were left putting a brave face on the prime minister's
initiative. But they were unable to hide their disappointment that the
Munich summit had failed to make progress on an agreement that could
stimulate world growth and benefit industrialised, developing and former
communist countries alike.
Now leaders face the embarrassing task of drafting a summit communique in
which commitments to agree the Uruguay Round sound credible. Given their
forceful calls both last year and in 1990 for an early settlement of the
Round, this will be an unenviable task.
RESOLUTION FROM LAST YEAR'S SUMMIT
'No issue has more far-reaching implications for the future prospects of the
world economy than the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. . . The
aim of all contracting parties should be to complete the Round before the
end of 1991. We shall remain personally involved in this process, ready to
intervene with one another if differences can only be resolved at the
highest level.' London, July 1991

FT  08 JUL 92 / G7 'would back aid with force': Western leaders condemn
warring factions in former Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

WESTERN leaders warned the warring sides in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday
that they would be prepared to use military force to ensure humanitarian aid
reached Sarajevo, the republic's capital, if the international airlift is
endangered.
In one of the most outspoken statements on the crisis in the former
Yugoslavia by any international forum, the leaders of the Group of Seven
industrialised nations condemned those responsible for the violence. They
said the Serbian leadership and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army bore the
greatest responsibility.
The declaration came as shooting, including tank rounds, broke out in
Sarajevo in the worst fighting since a partial ceasefire was agreed last
month.
After appealing to all parties in Bosnia not to imperil the humanitarian
effort or endanger the lives of those engaged in the relief operation, the
G7 leaders said: 'Should these efforts fail due to an unwillingness of those
concerned to fully co-operate with the United Nations, we believe the
Security Council will have to consider other measures, not excluding
military means, to achieve its humanitarian objectives.'
The special declaration on Yugoslavia made clear the Sarajevo airlift could
only be the beginning of a larger humanitarian effort and the transport of
aid by road to Sarajevo, and other needy parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina, must
also be guaranteed.
Although all subscribed to the declaration, the G7 members differ in their
willingness to contemplate the use of force. France is in the forefront of
those believing a military effort will eventually be required, and President
Francois Mitterrand has been putting forward various ideas on how it could
be organised.
One is that a combined force of troops from the UN and the nine-nation
Western European Union should ensure the safety of aid convoys, operating
under a new mandate of the UN Security Council. An ad hoc group of WEU
officials has been considering contingency plans for operations in the
former Yugoslavia and a special meeting of WEU foreign ministers is due to
discuss the situation in the margin of the summit of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation starting in Helsinki tomorrow.
The US has been much more circumspect. Mr James Baker, US secretary of
state, said it was obvious that humanitarian supplies had to go in by land
as well as air, but stressed it was 'unlikely' the US would send in ground
forces to provide protection for trucks.
While the US has made clear it is prepared to use military aircraft and
naval ships to ensure the safety of the aid airlift and any future land
convoys, it would leave the provision of ground forces to 'other countries',
according to General Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national
security adviser.
Britain has been 'at the cautious end of the spectrum', in the words of Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
But even Mr Hurd, while ruling out the use of British ground troops, was
forced to admit that the humanitarian aid airlift was a 'risky and
dangerous' operation.
However, British officials, like their American counterparts, consider there
are enough other countries which would volunteer to provide ground forces.
The declaration raised the prospect of transforming the European Community's
peace conference chaired by Lord Carrington into a wider international
conference under joint EC-UN auspices.
Lord Carrington will fly to New York this week in line with the G7's desire
that there should be consultations between the EC conference, the UN and the
other parties concerned with the Yugoslav crisis. Mr Hurd, in his role as
president of the EC Council of Ministers, will visit Sarajevo, Belgrade,
Zagreb, Ljubljana, Tirana the Albanian capital, and Skopje, the capital of
Macedonia, next week.
Judy Dempsey in Helsinki adds: Russia is continuing to oppose moves to
exclude the new rump state of Yugoslavia - consisting just of Serbia and
Montenegro - from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.
As leaders of CSCE states start arriving in Helsinki today for a meeting,
they are likely to find themselves in a serious dispute about how to treat
Yugoslavia.
While Russia wants the Serb-dominated Yugoslavia to remain in the CSCE,
several western countries are insisting that it be banned.
