FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: World tyre industry 'poised for recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WORLD tyre industry, with a Dollars 53bn (Pounds 27.7bn) annual
turnover, is poised for recovery after making Dollars 1bn collective losses
in the past two years, a study* by the Economist Intelligence Unit says.
Provided the still-tentative US car market recovery is consolidated, the
industry could earn profits above Dollars 1.5bn next year, the study
concludes.
It forecasts that Bridgestone, Japan's biggest tyre maker, which bought
Firestone of the US for Dollars 2.6bn in 1988, will raise its market share
in Europe and North America, as Japanese vehicle makers continue to expand
their 'transplant' manufacturing operations. Goodyear of the US, already
back in profit, will also gain market share in Europe. Michelin of France,
with potential to gain ground in the US after its Dollars 750m acquisition
of Uniroyal Goodrich in 1990, risks losing share in Europe, where it is
market leader, Mr Philip Wylie, the report's author, says.
The industry's improved financial prospects are seen as largely due to its
success in imposing much-needed price rises on the replacement tyre market.
'But it seems likely the original equipment sector will follow as the
recession lifts, and vehicle makers have more funds at their disposal.'
The industry still has substantial over-capacity. While car production is
expected to rise, raising tyre demand over the next few years, this will be
partly offset by other factors, among them growing environmental concern,
making performance vehicles less attractive and tyre replacement less
frequent.

FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US investors join the east European
goldrush - German links with the Midwest have helped win American investment
in the former communist bloc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE realisation dawns on US companies that the Cold War is truly over,
eastern Europe is drawing some of America's largest investing commitments.
Americans were not immediately interested as eastern Europe was first
developing its bent for capitalism, but, since the break-up of the Soviet
Union, they have 'rushed forward' to become the largest investor in the
former east bloc, says Mr Mark Dixon, editor of East European Investment
Magazine, the New York-based publication that tracks US investment. The
disclosed value of US investments in the area in the last quarter of 1991
and the first quarter of 1992 was more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn), Mr
Dixon adds.
But that does not include US investment in east Germany, where, since the
privatisation agency Treuhand has concentrated efforts on the US, investment
has grown apace. US investment in east Germany stands at over Dollars 1bn,
making the US the third largest investor in terms of the value of
commitments, including 46 transactions with 32 US companies. Some 120 other
companies have set up operations in east Germany through franchises, branch
offices or production facilities on greenfield sites.
Treuhand's New York office, which opened last November and is its largest
outside Germany, has helped more than 200 US companies identify suitable
possible acquisitions and led more than 40 of these into serious
negotiations. About half of those who reach advanced talks are expected to
complete investments.
In competing with east European countries for investment dollars, Mr
Christoph Urban, head of Treuhand's New York office and a 20-year veteran of
Siemens, emphasises Germany's stable social-political environment and strong
currency, that Dollars 100bn is being pumped into east German
infrastructure, and Treuhand's available subsidies. East Germany, Mr Urban
says, is 'a back-door entry' for those who want a foothold in east European
markets.
US companies that have made investments through Treuhand say their
motivation was to capture markets in eastern Europe as well as east Germany.
For example, while having plants in the Netherlands and France,
Minneapolis-based Medtronic, the world's largest maker of heart pace-makers,
acquired the east German pace-maker company Tur, which had supplied the
product to the east bloc.
Yet, while Treuhand is credited generally with fulfilling its promises and
handling negotiations well, US companies say bumps can develop along the
way. An official at Illinois Tool Works said that, while Treuhand responded
quickly to its initial interest, the agency took 'a long time to come up
with a signable agreement'. Only after the company pulled a few political
strings in west Germany did it acquire Treuhand's full attention. But it was
now happy with its deal.
Similarly, Daniel Industries of Houston, a leading maker of metering
equipment for gas and oil, found delays when it came to Treuhand clearing up
ownership of the land on which its desired acquisition sits and clarifying
incentives, particularly regarding training. Other investors have confronted
problems, though none apparently so difficult that they have abandoned
negotiations.
Mr Urban and the others trawling for US investment are especially drawn to
the Midwest, the nation's industrial heartland. Key Midwestern industries
such as car manufacture, with their extensive supply chains and
sophisticated machine tools, are of particular interest to countries seeking
to gain industrial strength.
Treuhand is also attracted to the Midwest because of the region's large
number of German descendants. 'There are strong German links,' Mr Urban
says. 'It is said there are 900 German-rooted companies in the Mid-west.'
A similar association has been vital for Poland's attraction of US
investment. Poland led all its former eastern European allies in attracting
US investment during the last quarter of 1991 and the first quarter of 1992.
While a detailed breakdown of US outflows to Poland is not available,
investment experts believe a sizeable amount comes from Polish Americans,
about 1m of them in the Chicago area.

PENTA Ocean Construction of Japan and the Belgian companies Dredging
International and Jan de Nul have won contracts worth Y3bn (Pounds 12.5m)
and Dollars 80m (Pounds 41m) respectively to develop the southernmost
section of the Suez Canal.
Work will entail the final stage of the Suez Canal Authority's plan to
expand the waterway to allow passage of vessels of up to 56ft draught, and
to accommodate tankers of 180,000-200,000 dwt, against the present limit of
150,000 dwt.
Dr Abdel Hamid Yussef, director of the Canal Authority's Engineering
Department, said Penta Ocean would be involved only in expanding the width
of the Canal from 160 metres to 180 metres, covering a 9km area in the Small
Bitter Lakes zone, over 15 months.
The work to be undertaken by the Belgian companies involves widening and
deepening the waterway.
It will cover a 12km area, expanding the width of the canal from 160 metres
to 205 metres, together with deepening the waterway by five metres from the
present depth of 20 metres.

FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Airlines set to lose Dollars 2bn this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AIRLINE industry is set to lose about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) this year
on international scheduled services because too many aircraft are flying in
a sluggish airline market, latest estimates of the International Air
Transport Association, the Geneva trade organisation grouping over 200
airlines, show.
Traffic is showing signs of recovery, but not as quickly as the industry had
hoped. European traffic appears to have been hit hardest and has failed to
show a strong rebound. Officials said yesterday that without a sharp
turnaround in economic activity in the second half of this year, the
industry would show another big loss.
Mr Gunter Eser, IATA director-general, said airlines had lost a record
Dollars 4.7bn on international services in 1991 after losing Dollars 2.7bn
in 1990. He urged airlines to cut capacity to match real demand and adopt a
more entrepreneurial approach to their business.
'If airlines want to survive in the longer term, they must behave like any
other industry and stop losing money by flying empty seats.'
Airlines are continuing to maintain high-capacity levels to protect their
market shares in the hope of recovery in traffic.
But continuing losses are expected to squeeze even further the financially
weaker carriers.
IATA figures show airline operating revenues last year on international
services totalled Dollars 91.7bn, with expenses at Dollars 92.3bn, resulting
in a Dollars 600m operating loss. Airlines also faced net interest charges
of Dollars 3.4bn last year, swelling the total loss to Dollars 4.7bn in
1991.
'This was the worst result in the history of aviation. The best thing that
can be said about 1991 is that it is over,' said Mr Tom Murphy, IATA
director of traffic and financial services. Airlines would have had to
charge an average Dollars 15 more for each ticket sold, to break even last
year, since they were not able to cut capacity to match demand.
Capacity grew 0.3 per cent last year while traffic fell 3 per cent. It was
the first fall since the jet aircraft was introduced, reflecting the
recession and the fall in air travel caused by the Gulf crisis. This year,
international passenger traffic has risen 8 per cent over 1990 (the year
before the Gulf war slump) but airline capacity was still 12 per cent higher
than in 1990.
The industry lost nearly 50,000 jobs last year with employment falling by
3.4 per cent to 1.45m people in IATA member airlines. Another problem is the
widening gap between low discounted fares and premium business and
first-class fares.

FT  07 JUL 92 / French Transport Dispute: Truckers, hit by hard times, lash
out - William Dawkins explains why many lorry drivers are in a parlous state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH truckers provide a classic example of how it is often those who feel
the most vulnerable that are prone to aggression.
Many truckers are in a parlous economic state likely to be made worse by the
new driving regulation, under which from July 1 a driver is banned once he
has clocked up six penalty points.
Truckers and their employers have seen freight charges decline and salaries
stagnate under the impact of French road transport deregulation in 1986 and
growing competition on foreign routes. The price of vehicles, the main
business cost, has risen sharply thanks to tougher European and national
controls on pollution, noise and safety.
The points system puts truckers under what they see as an intolerable twin
pressure. They can no longer afford to ignore driving regulations because
they risk unemployment, yet they still need to drive at over the speed limit
and for more hours per day than allowed to keep up their incomes. This has
been felt more intensely in France than elsewhere because it has been slower
than others like Britain and Germany to launch a penalty points system, and
because the country and distances within it are larger than its neighbours.
Paris lifted state controls on road freight rates - with the support of the
industry - in 1986. Since then rates have fallen by an estimated 15 per cent
as 10,000 new hauliers joined the market.
Today, France has 35,000 road haulage companies, 85 per cent of which employ
less than 10 people. They employ 190,000 drivers, to which can be added
30,000 one-man outfits, completing the picture of a fragmented, cut-throat
industry.
The surge in competition has boosted the proportion of goods carried by road
in France over the past 10 years from 66 per cent to 75 per cent.
Customers have benefited, but, according to the FNAUT transport users'
federation, a quarter of all truck loads are carried at a loss for the
haulier.
The pressure is reflected in low basic wages, averaging between FFr6,000
(Pounds 615) and FFr6,500 per month, according to union estimates. However,
a hard-working trucker can double his wage by winning productivity and
punctuality bonuses, which is where the pressure to flout driving
regulations comes into play.
By law, French truckers must not spend more than 46 hours per week at the
wheel. Their weekly average is just over 53 hours, according to the national
transport council. Another study by SAPRR, a leading motorway operator,
shows the average truck of 40 tonnes or more travels at 98 kmph, well over
the 80 kmph limit. A truck is involved in 15 per cent of French road deaths,
estimates the SAPRR.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, has offered to suspend the use of
spy-in-the-cab recorders as evidence in traffic offences, as a gesture to
the truckers. Government negotiators believe they are near agreement with
truckers' unions on a move away from productivity bonuses - with their
obvious dangers - towards bigger wages.
The government is also prepared to allow truckers who have lost penalty
points to take unpaid leave to take the tests needed to earn back clean
licences.
These gestures have yet to satisfy the truckers. Their demands continue to
vary between the total abandonment of the points system, to the
establishment of special professional licences, with a higher number of
points. But the government cannot easily climb down.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Walesa may veto deal on coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa yesterday indicated that he would not accept a cabinet
agreed at the weekend by eight parliamentary political parties - in a move
likely to prolong the government's five-week-long crisis.
Buoyed by praise from President George Bush, who visited Warsaw for five
hours on Sunday, Mr Walesa was yesterday preparing to by-pass the coalition
agreement.
The parties had decided to propose Ms Hanna Suchocka, a 46-year-old lawyer
from the liberal, pro-market Democratic Union as the candidate for prime
minister. They also agreed most of the names for the various government
posts.
Ms Suchocka's candidacy marks agreement between nationalist right-wing
parties, the Christian Democrat centre, and free-market liberals who have
Solidarity roots and who, until recently, have all been in conflict with
each other.
Despite the fact that Ms Suchocka would be able to secure a parliamentary
majority, unlike her predecessor Mr Waldemar Pawlak - who offered to resign
as prime minister last week because he was unable to seek a working majority
 -Mr Walesa yesterstart appointing 'interim' ministers. Mr Pawlak, the
32-year-old leader of the PSL, or farmers' party, has been in power for less
than five weeks.
Mr Walesa's moves suggest that the president fears that any stable, strong
parliament could erode his powers.
Indeed, attempts by this broad coalition of eight parliamentary parties to
elect Ms Suchocka would have meant that a government could have been formed
without presidential approval. However, any prime minister has to be
formally nominated by the president. A government based on this coalition,
and with a majority in parliament, would have made it more independent of Mr
Walesa.
Until now, Mr Walesa has exploited feuds among the Solidarity-based parties
to maintain the political initiative and work to dominate the executive arm
of government, leaving parliament a secondary role.
Consumer prices in Poland rose by 1.3 per cent last month compared with May.
Prices are set to stabilise this month as inflation stays within the
predicted 40 per cent growth figure for this year - half of last year's cost
of living increase.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Write-off of Soviet debt urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE west should write off Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.4bn) of the former Soviet
Union's debt, enabling cancellation of Dollars 20bn of debt owed to the
former USSR by some of the world's poorest countries, a senior UN economist
has urged.
Mr Shahen Abrahamian, a specialist on debt issues with the UN Conference on
Trade and Development (Unctad) in Geneva, says Dollars 10bn of the western
debt write-off should be used to free the 10 small former Soviet republics,
including the three Baltic states, from their debt obligations. This would
leave Dollars 10bn available to cut the debt of the other five republics,
including Russia, by about 12 per cent.
The scheme would simplify the complex arrangement for assigning ex-Soviet
debt to the former republics, and the negotiation of reschedulings. The
Baltic states have already repudiated responsibility for this debt.
Russia has proposed taking over the full debt, which Mr Abrahamian puts at
Dollars 85bn-Dollars 90bn, in return for sole ownership of the former Soviet
Union's foreign assets such as gold reserves, stocks of export commodities
including diamonds, property and foreign loans.
But Mr Abrahamian believes his scheme would be more acceptable to the other
republics.
In addition, debt relief would be concentrated on the small republics which,
the Baltic states aside, are mostly poor or affected by strife.
Several countries on the other side of the balance sheet are also poor and
many western and Arab aid donors have forgiven these nations' debts, Mr
Abrahamian points out.

FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Russia puts respect at the top of its
want-list - John Lloyd and Leyla Boulton preview Boris Yeltsin's talks in
Munich tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA needs money, and needs it badly. But top of the list of what it hopes
for from the Munich summit is the non-tangible matter of respect. Russia
wants to be seen to be important, indeed central, to the world.
'We don't expect concrete decisions in Munich,' said Mr Alexander Shokhin,
the deputy premier, in an interview yesterday. 'It's a place not for
concrete decisions but for the display of political support.'
The Russian delegation wants the G7 to demonstrate that making decisions on
the world economic process is impossible without Russia, especially in
relation to those problems which most worry them, such as economic collapse
and debt. At the same time, the success of economic reform in Russia depends
on the world economic situation.
'So the point which will be made by the Russian president,' said Mr Shokhin,
'is not that the G7 should become the G8 - but instead it will be an attempt
to show that Russia is an equal industrial partner with these countries. Not
equal, perhaps, in its economic situation but equal in the sense that it has
the potential to help decide on the main questions facing the world.'
As proof of the contribution Russia can make, he said it would propose three
new sites for oil exploration to be opened to foreign investors. He did not
name them, but they seem likely to be new areas rather than existing sites
like the offshore reserves at Sakhalin.
The 'headline' news of the grant of the first tranche of Dollars 1bn of IMF
funds to Russia is not, formally, a matter for the G7 - though Mr Shokhin
stressed that the agreement reached between Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF
managing director and President Boris Yeltsin, had been concluded under G7
pressure. The agreement goes before the IMF board next month.
However, Mr Shokhin 'does not exclude' the possibility that Mr Yeltsin will
ask for debt forgiveness for a period of at least two years. He himself
would prefer to ask for five years, a figure already mooted by Mr Yegor
Gaidar, acting prime minister, in talks last month with Mr Jaques Delors,
European Commission president.
'What perhaps we might say is that, if it takes us two and a half years to
carry through our reform programme, then we should have debt relief for that
period,' he said.
Among other issues which Mr Shokhin said were on the Russian agenda are:
A programme to convert nuclear power stations of the Chernobyl type to
non-nuclear use. Mr Shokhin said this was a matter which had to be discussed
both within the framework of overall energy policy - 'since this might, for
example, involve us in an increase in gas production' - and as a financial
matter, since Russia might expect compensation to be paid if it agreed to
shut these reactors down.
An end to barriers on trade besetting Russian exporters. Mr Shokhin
specifically mentioned quotas on aluminium and uranium, and suggested that
compensation might also be demanded for Russia's continued observance of
these. In the recent past, Mr Gaidar has asked again for an end to the Cocom
rules which restrict the import of certain types of high technology
equipment into Russia.
The setting up of a permanent co-ordinating centre to deal with foreign
assistance to Russia - especially that channeled through the G7 and the
European Community. There have been complaints that aid has been haphazard
and unco-ordinated.
Even on the assumption that some, at least, of this would be forthcoming, Mr
Shokhin phlegmatically admitted that the growing ranks of the Russian
opposition were unlikely to credit the government with much success. The
figure of Dollars 1bn would be seen as too little, and the 'anti-popular'
measures taken too harsh.
However, he underlined the government's determination not to be seen to
kowtow to the IMF. 'We must insist on this: that the programme is ours and
the measures taken are those we think are best. The talks with the IMF have
been designed to fit our programme to the offer of assistance from the IMF
and the foreign governments.'
This will not placate the critics. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, speaker of the
Russian parliament and a permanent and vocal detractor of the IMF process,
said yesterday that the fund's promises of support were 'mere rhetoric'. The
G7 governments, he said, had pushed Russia down the path of market reform
and 'now it is time for them to foot the bill'.
Nothing that the Munich summiteers, constrained by problems at home, can do
will foot such an open-ended bill as Mr Khasbulatov has in mind. Mr
Yeltsin's domestic struggles are not likely to be eased after his session
with his fellow leaders tomorrow.
Leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States meeting yesterday in
Moscow agreed to create a peacekeeping force modelled on the UN 'blue
berets', write John Lloyd and Dmitri Volkov. They are also to establish a
'rouble zone' of countries using the former Soviet currency, now issued by
the Russian central bank. No details were given, except that the zone is
designed to protect its members from the effects of the introduction of
separate currencies by those states refusing to stay in the zone.
The new peacekeeping force will be sent first to Moldova to attempt to
separate the two warring sides in the conflict between the Moldovan military
and the various forces fighting on the side of the self-proclaimed republic
of Trans Dnestr.
President Boris Yeltsin said CIS ministers would meet soon to work out the
mechanisms for the force.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (17): It's not as much fun as it should be -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMBASSIES in Rome and their consular posts throughout the country are now
gearing up for the busy season. July and August will produce a sharp
increase in the number of 'distressed citizens' whose Italian holidays have
been spoiled by the theft of passports, tickets, money and belongings.
Unwary tourists are easy prey for the pickpockets, bag snatchers, muggers
and other delinquents who plague the large cities. The notoriety of the
route 64 buses from the capital's Termini railway station to St Peter's is
such that the transport authority has posted signs to warn travellers to be
on their guard. Rome's 'A' underground line is another high risk route.
Travelling under one's own steam does not, however, guarantee a trouble-free
trip. Owners of cars with foreign plates often become neurotic in Italy, a
condition that lifts only when safely across the border and heading home.
The car break-in - often by smashing a window  - is an inconvenience that
many foreign visitors have suffered.
But the tourist is not only an easy victim for petty criminals. The
traveller in Italy is a soft target for legitimate businesses like hotels,
restaurants and taxis. Over recent years tourists have learnt that Italy has
become a high cost destination.
Figures from the Bank of Italy reveal a significant drop in the
competitiveness of tourist services. For foreign tourists, the index of
Italian competitiveness fell steadily during the 1980s, and was about 20 per
cent lower last year than in 1982. During the mid and late-1980s the
situation was even worse for Italian tourists with the competitiveness of
home destinations declining by about 30 points, though there was an
improvement between 1989 and 1990.
Higher prices and tariff increases this year seem likely to weaken Italy's
competitive position even more. The setting of hotel room-rates was freed
from official control last year, and this has led to rises of more than 10
per cent on 1991's rates.
It is argued that Italy has a unique cultural and historic heritage, thus
enjoying a monopoly position that gives the tourist business considerable
licence in pricing. Visitors to Venice, Florence and, to a lesser extent,
Rome, experience this in hotel rates and restaurant bills that are generally
high and sometimes exorbitant.
How much more can the tourist be squeezed? Probably not much. Venice and
Florence are increasingly destinations for day-trippers who stay in cheaper
accommodation away from the cities and then travel in by car, coach or
train.
But this mass movement of tourists has made the experience of visiting these
historic cities less agreeable for those who pay high prices to stay in
them. The fact that crowds are a problem has been highlighted by proposals
to limit access to both Venice and Florence.
If visitors to Italy's centres of art and culture return home with a sense
of disappointment from an experience that has not lived up to expectations,
there are several factors to blame.
It is not only the high cost. Tourists often have an overall impression that
Italy is not really organised for them. The absence of public conveniences
near major attractions is one shortcoming. Another is the inadequacy of
reliable information. Fortunately, individual Italians display considerable
warmth, hospitality and readiness to assist visitors that helps to
compensate for structural and institutional weaknesses.
But such kindnesses do not always make up for the closed doors that
frequently confront expectant visitors to museums and galleries. A recent
report by Touring Club Italiano says that nearly one half of Italy's museums
are closed.
The report also notes that more than 300,000 works of art and 18,000
archaeological pieces have been stolen from museums, churches and
collections in the past 20 years. That this sacking of Italy's artistic
fabric has not caused a furore says much about public and political
indifference to the country's heritage. Maintaining this, Italy's unique
tourist attraction, does not seem to rank high in the country's priorities.
Last month's report that Rome's Colosseum was in danger of collapsing, an
eventuality that should be kept at bay by financial help from Banca di Roma,
led to revelations of a nationwide situation that is far from encouraging.
That Venice is in peril has been widely known for years. In the surrounding
Veneto region most of the historic villas need urgent attention. Further
south the problems of Pisa's leaning tower are just a symbol of a much wider
damage and decay that also affects the walls Lucca, Urbino and Pesaro, the
towers in San Gimignano, Etruscan tombs in Tarquinia, Apulia's baroque
masterpieces, baroque and Grecian treasures in Sicily and many other items
in the heritage inventory.
Indifferent to its artistic heritage, Italy also seems to care little for
its wildlife and scenic resources. Few ornithologists would choose Italy for
a holiday. Indiscriminate hunting, ineffectually opposed by the authorities,
has radically cut the numbers of many protected species.
Legislation was approved at the end of last year for the establishment of
protected areas, but implementation programmes remain paper projects.
Unrestrained development has ruined beautiful stretches of coastline,
particularly in the south.
What about the beaches? The comments from Touring Club Italiano are not
reassuring. Last year Italian resorts won 55 European 'blue flags' for
cleanliness, safety and overall service. Only 29 beaches are flying the flag
this summer.
Nevertheless, seaside resorts may enjoy higher numbers of visitors, both
Italian and foreign. The Yugoslav civil war is diverting tourist trade to
the benefit of Italy's Adriatic coast. This ought to give a welcome boost to
the invisible trade account. Revenues turned down last year for the first
time since 1986. But an even steeper fall in Italian travellers' spending
abroad allowed the account to close with a larger surplus than in 1990,
thereby halted a declining sequence that started in 1986.
Are Italy's authorities becoming interested in tourism? A television
campaign this summer is encouraging Italians to welcome tourists by being
less noisy, less aggressive on the roads and by not littering the cities
with refuse. Perhaps a much-needed clean-up will get under way, for there is
plenty to do.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (15): A message from the Mafia - Robert
Graham on the official approach to organised crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPACT of the assassination of Mr Giovanni Falcone, Italy's leading
anti-Mafia magistrate, will take a long time to erase.
Mr Falcone was killed along with his wife and three bodyguards on May 24
when a ton of high explosive was detonated under their three-car convoy as
it travelled at high speed along a motorway near Palermo airport. The
indiscriminate means employed were more reminiscent of the Lebanese militias
or the Colombian drugs barons, but this horrendous crime has been
unequivocally attributed to the Sicilian Mafia.
The target was, sadly, well-chosen. As a campaigning magistrate, Mr
Falcone's investigations led to a series of 'maxi-trials' of the Sicilian
Mafia in the 1980s. He made extensive use for the first time of pentiti
(informers who have plea-bargained, equivalent to a 'super-grass') and he
was able to demonstrate that the Mafia was not a casual group of criminals
but a complex organisation with a hierarchy of command linking the various
families and their businesses.
For this, he was a marked man. Mr Falcone had already been the subject of a
failed assassination attempt in 1989 and was one of the most heavily guarded
people in the country. At least 60 people were assigned to his full-time
protection and his movements were kept deeply confidential. The killing was
a deliberate challenge to the state, similar to the assassination in 1982 of
General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and his wife days after he had taken up
the post of prefect of Palermo.
Just as the Dalla Chiesa killing prodded the government of the day to react
with a series of police and judicial measures to aid the fight against the
Mafia, so did the Falcone murder. The procedures for bail of suspected Mafia
members were tightened, magistrates were given greater freedom to pursue
investigations and new mechanisms were introduced for better co-ordination
of police work.
This reactive approach has characterised government action towards organised
crime ever since the Second World War. For instance, last September when Mr
Libero Grassi, a Palermo businessman, was murdered for publicly refusing to
pay Mafia extortion demands, the authorities amid much breast-beating agreed
to introduce new anti-extortion measures. These included special 'hot-lines'
to denounce racketeers and financial assistance to those suffering losses as
a result of extortion demands (insurance coverage for fire damage, etc). The
measures became operative in June almost nine months after approved in
cabinet.
Police action tends to tackle the effects of organised crime, not its
causes. Too often, new measures are simply added to existing ones, creating
confusion. Last year, as a more generalised response to the spread of
organised crime, the Andreotti government decided to create a special
structure within the magistrature to deal exclusively with investigations
into the Mafia.
This consists of a 'super-magistrate' and 26 assistants countrywide.
However, the lines of authority still remain unclear. The magistrates are
wary of the new body because it smacks of direct government control  - a
wrangle which has delayed the introduction of the new structure. Indeed,
before Mr Falcone's death, his candidature to be the first head of this body
was being blocked for fear that his appointment was too political. At the
same time, the Anti-Mafia Commissariat which had previously co-ordinated
such investigations is being wound up.
Organised crime has traditionally been a 'southern' phenomenon, associated
with three groups, each distinguished by clear geographical and historical
characteristics - Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian Mafia; the Camorra, based round
Naples and the 'ndrangheta of Calabria. The Mafia, though retaining its
strong Sicilian roots, has spread to Rome and the main cities of northern
Italy. It has the biggest international connections through drugs dealing,
arms trafficking and money laundering; the Camorra, heavily into contraband,
has spread into central and parts of northern Italy and latterly has
developed ties with Colombia as well moving into eastern Europe. The
'ndrangheta has remained the most local, and continues to specialise in
kidnaps.
In the 1980s the international spread of drugs (cocaine from Latin America,
heroin from Turkey, central Asia and the south-east Asia), advances in
telecommunications, liberalisation of banking, freer trade and the opening
of eastern Europe provided an enormous stimulus to the growth of Italian
organised crime. More recently, civil conflict in the Balkans has created
fresh opportunities; while within Italy criminal activity is increasing well
above the European average.
A third of all homicides is attributed to organised crime in Italy. Between
1985 and 1990, the number of murders doubled while in Britain and Germany
the rate declined. Indeed, organised crime has become so entrenched that not
only is it going to be increasingly hard to eradicate; but it is becoming
ever more difficult to distinguish between licit and illicit funds.
A report released earlier this year by Censis, the social research
institute, said the annual turnover of organised crimes' illicit and 'licit'
activities was L19,389bn. Other guestimates have put the figure at over
L35,000bn. The Censis report estimated 19 per cent of earnings came from
'licit' activities - the control of public contracts. In Sicily over 75 per
cent of public contracts do not even go out to tender and virtually all the
latter are considered to be controlled by the Mafia.
The main source of income, equivalent to 20 per cent of all earnings, comes
from drugs dealing; theft generates a further 18 per cent, followed by
extortion (11 per cent), illegal gaming and lotteries (7 per cent and
especially important round Naples) and contraband (4 per cent).
Take just one detail - highway robbery. In 1990, criminals hijacked 6,899
trucks and articulated lorries, over 90 per cent of all such crimes
committed in Europe. The favourite loads were clothing and electronic
equipment which were sold in friendly stores or in clandestine supermarkets
in southern Italy.
The value of the average load was estimated at a minimum of L100m and only
3,581 trucks were ever recovered. The takings for these criminal gangs were
estimated at over L1,300bn. One gang arrested last year was charged with
1,600 such thefts over five years.
Hijacking of cargoes has become such a problem that insurance is difficult
to find in southern Italy.
The Italian state has the resources to combat such crime. There are some
250,000 carabinieri, police and financial police, the highest number per
capita of population in Europe. But they remain poorly co-ordinated and
eternal rivals. The organisation of political parties in the south, and the
entire economic structure dominated by state funding, encourages and permits
a fecund parternship of crime and politics. Until this changes, the
criminals will thrive.
Beyond this, the legal system is so unwieldy that criminals easily escape
prosecution either through procedural devices or through the complex demands
of proof - the security forces have detailed lists of the Mafia families. In
the final resort the criminals still have the power to bribe and intimidate
the judiciary. The murder of Mr Falcone was one such message; and now the
government has been obliged to seek special 'volunteers' to pursue the
investigation into his killing.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (16): Hope for crumbling treasures - Arts
and Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIFER GREGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECTION of the ancient walls of Urbino collapsed last month. Urbino is one
of the finest examples of a renaissance city, an outstanding jewel even in
Italy's riches and the unspoilt birthplace of Raphael.
Only two months before, an international conference had been held to discuss
the problems faced in the preservation of Europe's walled cities. All agreed
that urgent action was essential to save Urbino. Nothing was done.
This is only the latest of a series of disasters to befall Italy's heritage
of monuments and artistic treasures: some, like the disintegration of the
Torre Civica in Pavia a few years ago and the tower of Pisa (closed to
visitors since last year, when it began to lean even more alarmingly) are
well publicised. Others, less well-known, like San Severino nelle Marche,
crumble away quietly. Important restorations in Rome, such as the Temple of
Vesta and Constantine's arch, close to the Colosseum, have been left
half-done for lack of funds.
Government funding of general maintenance has been more than halved since
the mid-1980s. Six weeks ago, for instance, cleaning work started on a
section of the interior of the Pantheon, described by William Thomas in his
1549 History of Rome as 'the perfectest of all the antiquities', and the
pinks, greens and pale ochre of the antique marble, taken from all over the
Roman Empire as they emerge from the accumulated dirt of centuries are truly
astonishing.
The work is being done by Edilrestauri of Vicenza, but the two young
restorers, Paola Fanesi and Monica Gheoin and their assistants are working
in the hope rather than the certainty that the funds promised (L300m under
the Roma Capitale law) will be forthcoming. The cost of cleaning the whole
interior is likely to be L40bn, and a sponsor is urgently needed.
Five years ago, the director-general at the Ministry forCultural Heritage
published a report, entitled Memorabilia, identifying the 1,000 monuments
most at risk. He claimed that L2,250bn was the minimum required. Little has
been done since then, apart from a haphazard series of interventi
straordinari, when total collapse threatens. Rather than being a careful
guardian, with a long-term strategy and some sense of priority, the ministry
has recently resembled a demented housewife tearing around in a frantic
attempt to cover the worst eyesores - leaving the rest to rot.
Until the founding of the ministry in 1974, fine arts were a small
department in the Ministry of Education. Today its funding represents 0.7
per cent of the state budget, roughly 0.3 per cent of GDP. This is similar
to the amount Britain spends, but on a far smaller artistic patrimony.
Ministers have not always been sufficiently qualified in the field. A great
many experts, and foremost among them the outspoken Professor Federico Zeri,
feel things were a great deal better before the ministry existed. 'Until the
1970s, good excavations were being done and museums were open at reasonable
hours,' he says.
This is confirmed by Georgina Masson's 1965 Companion Guide to Rome. She
describes visiting the Galleria Borghese by moonlight: Canova's rendering of
Pauline Bonaparte as Venus must have looked splendid. (The picture gallery
of this delightful, small museum has been closed since 1984, after a crack
appeared in the ceiling and was found to have been caused by subsiding
foundations. But it is possible to visit the ground floor rooms between 9am
and 2pm.)
'Now', says Prof Zeri, 'the political situation is stagnant, and union power
is enormous. There is too much knuckling under to their demands, the Brera
in Milan (the city's main museum) has become a battlefield, and is now
almost entirely closed.' He complains of a clumsy bureaucracy, little
autonomy for museum directors, and no adequate cataloguing of Italy's
immense riches. He is convinced that the necessary public money could be
found to support the artistic heritage, but that the political will is
lacking. He also argues that Venice should be taken out of Italian
jurisdiction altogether, and given to the EC.
Prof Giulio Carlo Argan, art historian and ex-mayor of Rome, agrees the
problem is lack of political interest. He wants a commission, with a roving
brief, to tour the country and report regularly on the monuments most at
risk.
But if Italian art treasures are to be saved, it will be thanks to private
investors. An exhibition conference, Art and Sponsors, held in May this year
at Castel St Angelo in Rome, with the laudable aim of bringing together
owners, the state and would-be investors, showed that Italy leads Europe in
terms of sponsorship. In 1989, Italians invested L1,550bn, compared with the
Germans' L900bn, France's L750bn and the UK's L630bn. Last year, total
Italian sponsorship increased to L1,600bn. This includes sport, which in
Italy and Germany is about 66 per cent of the total invested.
In 1992, private sponsorship is expected to rise by 12 per cent. This was
made possible by law 512, passed in 1982, which made investment in culture
and restoration of art works tax-deductible; and also made it possible for
art works to be given in lieu of inheritance tax. In 1984, the law was
slightly amended, sponsors' attention being directed to a list of needy art
works from which would-be-investors could choose. This, it was hoped, would
give the state some control; and direct the funds where they were most
needed.
Of the big corporate sponsors, Fiat tends to concentrate on yearly major
exhibitions at the Fiat Arts Centre on the restored Palazzo Grassi in the
Grand Canal in Venice; the most exciting of which remains Pontus Hulten's
1986 exploration of Futurism. In Turin an ex-Fiat factory, the Lingotto, was
converted by the architect Renzo Piano, and that, too, has become an arts
centre. Fiat did, however, join with the Cassa di Risparmio of Turin to
restore Juvarra's glorious ex-royal hunting lodge at Stupinigi, just outside
the city.
State companies are generous with their investment in art; Alenia, the
starte aerospace group, has provided funds for the restoration of the tiny
church of St Maria della Pace, near Piazza Navona in Rome; but has been
criticised by art historians for using an ugly railing to protect it from
the attentions of tramps. Ilva, the state steel group,provided the steel
supports for the Archangel Michael on the top of Castel St Angelo, and has
now made the steel bands to support the base of the leaning tower of Pisa.
Olivetti is an active and eclectic sponsor, financing exhibitions such as
the recent Mantegna show at the Royal Academy in London (now in New York).
Its particular interest is in fresco restoration: the Brancaccio chapel of
the Carmine church in Florence was unveiled last year. Apart from the
glowing beauty of the colours after cleaning, there was a lot of extra press
attention due to the newly revealed nakedness of the banished Adam and Eve.
Olivetti says that the recession will not interfere with its long-term
projects, such as the difficult restoration work on Leonardo's Last Supper
in Milan. It may, however, be less ready to undertake new projects.
Banks also often play a large part in their home bases. Banca di Toscana is
behind the splendid restoration of the Benozzo Gozzoli frescoes in Palazzo
Medici Ricciardi in Florence (timed for the celebrations of the 500th
anniversary of Lorenzo de Medici's death). Banca Popolare dell'Etruria e del
Lazio is funding a consortium for the restoration of two works by Piero
della Francesca (commemorating the 500th anniversary of Piero's death this
year) as well as the fountain in Piazza del Pantheon in Rome.
Finally, in an unusual launch of a new corporate identity in August, Banca
di Roma, a merger between the Banco di Roma and the Banco di Santo Spirito,
will sponsor L40bn worth of essential repairs to the one of the most
familiar landmarks of Rome, the Colosseum.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (12):: Differences that still run deep - The
North-South Divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Salvatore Ligresti, one of the richest men in Italy and a leading force
in property, insurance and building, recalls his arrival as a young man in
the northern city of Padua from his native Sicily one cold winter's morning
in the early 1950s.
Barely out of the railway station, he walked to a waiting taxi with his
heavy bags to take him to his lodgings. 'Commandi' - at your command - said
the driver, using a familiar local expression.
Mr Ligresti was astounded. Here he was, a humble Sicilian student, in the
heart of the rich north, about which he had heard so much, being asked for
orders. Plucking up courage, he gave the address of his destination. Only
later would he learn that 'commandi' was a commonplace local politeness
towards customers.
Late to nationhood, Italy after 1945 has been guided by the constant thread
of ironing out regional differences and creating a unitary state. While
billions of lire have been pumped into the Mezzogiorno to stimulate economic
development and reduce the dependence on agriculture, the tendency in the
north has been for differences to decline, partly because of the huge inflow
of southerners like Mr Ligresti since the late 1950s.
But in an economy going through its most difficult phase since the early
1980s, that philosophy is being increasingly called into doubt today.
Reinforced by the biggest changes to the political system since 1945 and the
recent focus on morality in politics after a string of urban corruption
scandals, one of the most basic principles of Italian life is now under
scrutiny.
The political mould has cracked further with the rise in support for
regional autonomist parties, chiefly the Milan-based Lombard League. Part of
a north Italian political grouping, which goes under the collective title of
the Lega Nord, the Lombard League has turned into a potent political force,
capturing up to 25 per cent of the vote in some big Lombard cities.
Overall, the Lega Nord performed spectacularly at the April 5 general
election, beating the Christian Democrats into second place in Lombardy,
Italy's richest region, and capturing 8.7 per cent of the vote nationwide.
The League now has 55 deputies in the lower house of parliament.
Greater autonomy for northern Italy - even outright separatism, according to
some extremists - was a central plank of the league's election programme.
Angered at northern taxes being 'squandered' on worthless subsidies to the
south, the league has made much of its 'closer to Europe and further from
Rome' slogan.
Such developments have raised doubts as to whether the assumptions on which
such decisions as phasing out regional dialects in schools are still valid.
Is the entire post-war effort based on creating an increasingly uniform
Italy now going into reverse?
One prominent parliamentarian from the Lombard League last month threatened
the organisation would be 'oiling the Kalashnikovs' should the new
government not take steps to meet the league's demands for greater autonomy.
The remark was deliberately inflammatory. However, it indicated the
expectations which have now been raised, and gave a taste  - if exaggerated
 -of the anger that could emerge if Mr Amato does not make at least some
gesture towards greater regional rights.
Yet for all the efforts of s u c c e s s i v e governments to narrow the
north-south divide, regional differences remain vast. Take the yawning gap
between the wealthy, German-speaking Alto Adige on the border with Austria,
where adherents of the local Sudtiroler Volks Partei (SVP) assert their
Teutonic roots, and life in the squalid apartment blocks on the fringes of
Palermo.
For many northerners, the s o u t h is terra incognita, ravaged by the Mafia
in Sicily, and its sister organisations in Campania and Calabria. The recent
revelations about organised political corruption in Milan and other big
northern cities have done little to level many northerners' sense of moral
superiority over their southern counterparts.
Even within the south, differences are great. Away from the preened golf
courses of the C o s t a S m e r a l d a, Sardinia remains a harsh island
with a strong local culture and language, where kidnapping, as a recent
example shows, remains a way of life for some.
By contrast, a new economic boom has been under way on the agricultural
plain of Apulia, where the Appenine mountains finally run out before
reaching the sea. The upsurge has been based not just on farming, but also
industrial activities. However, the companies that have started are not the
state-funded 'cathedrals in the desert', established more for political than
economic reasons, but small and medium-sized businesses, some of which will
fail, but many of which are set to thrive.
A plethora of data shows how divided Italy remains. Average unemployment in
the south is running at 19.3 per cent, against 6.2 per cent in the centre
and north of the country. Most of those looking for jobs in the Mezzogiorno
are between the ages of 14 and 29, and many face the serious prospect of
reaching middle age without ever having worked, noted Mr Antonio Fazio, the
Bank of Italy's chief economist, in a speech last December.
Economically, the south remains well behind the north, in spite of the
immense amounts of cash dispensed. Per capita income in the Mezzogiorno is
58 per cent of that in the rest of Italy, while differences between the
richest provinces of the north and the poorest of the south are even more
acute.
Many companies have opted for the south because of generous investment
grants, rather than market forces. A substantial proportion of the
investment in Fiat's new car and engine plants in southern Italy will be met
from the public purse. Meanwhile, many state-owned groups have had their
arms twisted to locate new factories in the south for political reasons.
With tighter controls on public spending as a result of the ballooning
deficit, less cash will be available to the south in future. Yet the Bank of
Italy's Mr Fazio recognises that 'external diseconomies' such as lower
educational standards, poor training and inadequate public services are
prominent factors in explaining the south's lower productivity. Even in
terms of transportation, the infrastructure of road and rail links is only
around 80 per cent of the level of that in central and northern Italy, he
argued.
To some extent, Italy's north-south divide is inevitable. As a long, thin
peninsula, it is not surprising that a northern city like Milan lies closer
to some of Europe's main business centres than it does to Naples, let alone
Catania.
Italy's shape accentuates the differences between its two halves. The
development of a motorway network in the 1960s helped to narrow the gap, but
distances remain substantial. The rise of domestic air travel has also
improved contacts between the two parts of the country, but high prices make
frequent flying prohibitive for most Italians, especially from the south.
Some experts have pinned their hopes on the development of a high-speed rail
network to reduce journey times while keeping ticket costs affordable. But
under the present scheme, Italy's high-speed network, shaped like a letter
'T' with Milan at its tip, will run no further south than Naples, leaving
Calabria - let alone Sicily - marooned.
Some economists doubt whether pushing the new line even as far south as
Naples is justifiable. Even employees of the state railways admit that,
while seats on the existing fast 'Pendolino' service between Milan and Rome
are regularly full at peak commuting times, services south of the capital
run largely empty and owe their existence more to political than economic
considerations.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (14): Shorter courses, more graduates -
Education, a shake-up is under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIFER GREGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISTS HAVE complained for years about the inadequate supply of
graduates in science and technology provided by the Italian system. But only
very recently has the idea that education really matters filtered through to
politicians.
The idea that productivity depends on the quality of the human effort behind
it was being promoted in 1987 by Professor Romano Prodi, then president of
IRI. Together with Mr Giancarlo Lombardi, the Confindustria counsellor for
schools, he initiated Project 'Iter' to encourage schools to aim not just
for mass education but 'mass quality'  - raising everyone'sights and
improving the general level of culture.
The experiment involved a mix of traditional grammar school teaching (licei
classici e scientifici) and that provided by technical colleges, trying to
break down the conventional barrier between the humanities and science. It
took place in the Medici del Vascello school in Rome, and proved enormously
successful, despite a deeply suspicious attitude on the teachers' part in
the early stages.
At a conference in March this year to evaluate this and other experimental
syllabuses in schools in the north, the experiment appears to have given the
teachers more of a shake-up than any retraining could have done; the
students are more alert, interested and self-aware, and the close
relationship with industry has been fruitful.
'Now all we need is a political decision, that of giving more autonomy to
individual schools,' he says. But as Mr Giancarlo Lombardi points out in the
joint report, School and Industry (written with representatives from the
Ministry of Education and the university), the schools cannot do it alone:
the close relationship with industry must be maintained.
The outgoing government contained two ministries responsible for education,
a larger one for schools, and a smaller, more stream-lined one dealing with
research and the universities.
The school system is almost entirely state-run, with the exception of
religious schools (mainly Jesuit and Salesian) and a handful of private
institutions. It works surprisingly well in extremely scruffy conditions -
entirely due to the dedication of a hard core of skilled and devoted
teachers. This is particularly true of the upper schools, licei, which are
next in line for a much-needed modernisation of the syllabus.
The minister's main headache is how to resolve the huge surplus of highly
unionised teachers. There are 950,000 teachers for approximately 10m
students - one of the lowest student-to-teacher ratios in Europe. The
ministry can do little about improving school buildings as 98 per cent of
its annual L45,000bn budget goes on salaries.
But the proportion of all children who actually go to school in Italy is
only 79.2 per cent (only Portugal and Luxembourg do worse than this in the
EC). Things are worse in the poorer south, where the back-up from social
services is non-existent. In Sicily, 50 per cent either avoid school
altogether, or by age 10 or 11 have been seduced by the more exciting and
remunerative life offered by petty crime. The official school-leaving age is
still an astonishingly low 14.
It is expected that a law raising it to 16 will be passed this year,
bringing Italy into line with the rest of Europe. This was something first
mooted by Mr Riccardo Misasi, the outgoing education minister, when he held
the same post 21 years ago.
Another matter of major concern continues to be the tiny percentage of GDP
devoted to research and development. Italy spends only 1.45 per cent of its
income on research (the European average is 2.5 per cent), thus putting
itself No 17 among industrialised nations. Last month, Prof Antonio Ruberti,
then minister for research and the universities, sounded the alarm in the
first-ever ministerial report on the state of research in Italy.
He announced a three-year plan, providing for the government to increase
annual investment from the present L15,000bn to L18,400bn - essential merely
to maintain the present Italian supremacy in certain sectors (such as
particle physics). He reckons, however that it will take 10 years for Italy
to gain the position it deserves in research and industrial technology. The
relatively low number of patents registered each year is also cause for
concern.
Big changes are also due in the universities from November, with the
introduction of a series of mini-degrees (courses lasting two or three
years). Ten or so will start this year, some in existing university centres
and some in new sites, in subjects ranging from law, economics and civil
engineering to natural sciences and literature.
This is not before time, according to Mr Antonio Polimene of Ifap/IRI, the
outfit which provides management training for recruits to the state holding,
as the shortage of science graduates is acute, and they are forced to take
graduates from the Third World.
He points out, though, that it will be the university which decides the
contents of the new shorter degree courses, and there is still some
reluctance to take advice from industry. He also complains that the
universities tend not to take account of the numbers of graduates required
in each discipline; nor is there any career advice given to students when
starting their courses.
Prof Ruberti announced last year that he would do something about the
congestion in Italy's state universities. The country's only private
universities are business-oriented: the Boccone in Milan (economics), and
the Luiss in Rome, which offers economics, law and political sciences. The
universities in Milan, Naples and Rome have nearly four times as many
students as they should, while the provincial universities function
efficiently and peacefully.
Rome University has 180,000 students, only 30 per cent of whom actually get
a degree. The university is free (apart from yearly taxes equivalent to
Pounds 400) - a school diploma (the equivalent of 'A' level) is all that is
required.
In spite of severe overcrowding and the extremely shabby state of many of
the buildings, Prof Giorgio Tecce, recently elected for a second four-year
period as Rector of Rome University, is still against placing any limit on
enrolment. 'Every country has its own students,' he says, 'ours are
particularly lively, vociferous and belligerent.' They have to be; anyone
fighting his way through one of the more popular faculties has to be very
good indeed.
He also fears that selection boards would be subjected to intolerable
pressures in a country not noted for fair selection procedures. The flood of
new graduates in medicine meant they had to limit the numbers enrolling
there two years ago, but that should be an exception, he feels.
Students do get weeded out by natural selection, many not being able to take
the strain of working their way through the university (there are no
scholarships) and many joining the large band of students who are fuori
corso - who instead of taking their 16 or so exams within the prescribed
four years, are allowed to take as much as 20 years to cover the same
course; providing they do not allow more than seven years to pass without
taking an exam.
Prof Tecce does, however, agree with Umberto Eco, the writer and university
professor at Bologna, that a strict selection procedure should take place at
the end of the second year. Students would thus be forced to keep within the
correct exam time-table for the first two years; those who did not would
have to leave. This would allow even those who have not shone at school to
blossom later.
There should also, he feels, be generous and plentiful scholarships for
deserving cases - and taxes should be doubled. Each successful student costs
the state L100m, and the numbers holding degrees are well below the EC
average. Out of 1,000 youngsters aged between 22 and 24 years, only 72 in
Italy have degrees, compared with 158 in France and 148 in the UK.
Prof Tecce agrees with Prof Eco's strictures, claiming also that there is a
need to free the university from political interference in the choice of
candidates for university chairs. He is proud of his record in bowing to
no-one.
The venerable University of Bologna (Italy's oldest) has, he said, 'sold its
soul' in handing out laurea honoris causae to politicians and
industrialists. 'We have only ever awarded one, and that was to Andrei
Sakharov, the dissident Russian scientist.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (13): The brakes are kept on - Transport
projects are taking too long
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ROME was not built in a day; even the project for rebuilding the capital's
underground railway has taken some time. Indeed, for several years
passengers have been able to observe the leisurely pace at which work is
progressing to improve the stations and lines. Commuters will probably be
seeing lightly-manned work-sites for many more years as, little by little,
the project is brought to completion.
Travellers using Rome's 'Grande Raccordo Anulare' have been fretting with
similar experiences; first as the ring road was upgraded to
dual-carriageway, and more recently during the construction of a third lane.
The sight of contractors' equipment lying idle for extensive periods is
commonplace in this highway project which, like many others, seems to lack a
sense of urgency.
Even before sites are opened, delays are affecting a much-needed doubling of
the trans-Apennine Bologna to Florence a u t o s t r a d a t o r e l i e v e
saturation on the existing road. Though the engineering for the 59-kilometre
section has been completed, the construction go-ahead has been awaited since
early this year. It seems unlikely that work will get under way before 1993.
This year's hold-ups have been attributed to environmental impact studies
for the project. But other factors have put a brake on it, not least
politics and public sector finances.
Indeed, political problems were present from the start, with the regional
authorities of Emilia Romagna and Tuscany initially failing to agree about
the project. Recent delays owe something to political problems at national
level; the paralysis towards the end of the Andreotti government and during
the difficult formation of a new government after April's parliamentary
elections put major decisions on hold.
The Milan kickback scandal that broke this spring, with revelations of
widespread corruption in subway, railway and airport projects that involved
politicians and civil engineering contractors, is reported to have held up
the award of many contracts.
Apart from the caution induced by the Milan scandal, difficulties in public
sector finances, which have become acute over the past year, are also
delaying projects. Lack of finance helps explain the slow progress of work
on transport schemes, which are often sub-divided into small jobs for which
funds can be more easily be disbursed.
Railway projects as well as roads have been affected by adverse political,
financial and administrative factors. For example, though most of the track
of the new fast line between Rome and Florence is now in use, after two
decades the p r o j e c t is still not completed.
With the start on the Bologna to Florence autostrada project put back, there
are concerns for the high-speed rail link between the two cities, whose
construction is planned at about the same time and over the same terrain.
The rail line is part of TAV (treno ad alta velocita - high-speed train)
network that was announced last year. This will have five new lines
totalling 950 kilometres that will connect Turin to Milan, Milan to Bologna,
Milan to Venice, Bologna to Florence and Rome to Naples.
A novel feature of the TAV, a project that will require total investment of
about L30,000bn, is its attempt to marry public and private sectors in a
joint venture framework. But, so far, backing has come essentially from
public sector banks, and foreign interest, deterred by the state of public
sector finances, has been negligible.
Another feature of the TAV is the designation of general contractors who
will bear responsibility for ensuring that works are completed on time and
to budget, with penalties and premiums for late and early completion. Two
state holding corporations, IRI and ENI, and private sector Fiat have signed
up as contractors.
The TAV is still a long way from being transformed from a paper project into
concrete reality, and it is hard to see it keeping on track. When the
project was announced, there was talk of moving the first earth in spring.
Meanwhile, talk of carrying the first passengers on the Rome to Naples line
in 1996 looks even more a flight of fantasy now than it did last year.
But, at least, the project represents a recognition of the great need to
modernise Italy's railway system. However, the railway corporation must also
make major improvements to goods transport.
Austria and Switzerland are both upgrading their railways. They have been
restricting the p a s s a g e of Italian trucks for some time, and Italian
industrialists are worried that environmental considerations will lead to
further curbs on trans-Alpine goods transport by road. A recent report from
Confindustria, the industrialrisk seeing our goods marginalised from the EC,
to which most exports are sent.'
Only 10 per cent of Italy's international freight traffic at present travels
by train and 16 per cent by sea, while 58 per cent goes by road.
It is a index of poor efficiency in the country's port facilities that, when
they despatch goods overseas, Italian exporters often find it more
convenient to transport by truck for shipment from ports outside Italy. The
stevedores' pickets in Genoa at the end of June were symptomatic of the
difficulties in this part of the transport sector.
Notwithstanding Italy's lengthy c o a s t l i n e and its numerous ports,
domestic transport of goods by sea is negligible. Confindustria's research
indicates that only one tenth of 1 per cent of this traffic is carried by
ship. And while railway use is higher, at under 5 per cent the figure is
still low.
Cost and convenience have forced Italian business to prefer to transport
goods by road. Confindustria says that 94 per cent of Italy's total internal
goods traffic is moved in trucks. The 1986 national transport plan forecast
annual growth of 3.5 per cent in goods traffic in the period to the end of
the century. With the forecast for the year 2000 already reached last year,
it is not surprising that the autostrade arteries are clogging up.
Clogged up or choking are also apt descriptions for Italy's major c i t i e
s where the authorities have been forced to ban private cars on several
occasions during the past year, as exhaust emissions hit dangerous levels.
The urban transport problem seems to be intractable, particularly in the
capital. Serious shortcomings encourage the use of the private car, thereby
worsening the congestion and causing still more people to abandon the buses.
Industrial disputes are also a discouragement to passenger loyalty.
There is little to relieve a desolate transport scene. Urban passenger
systems and road, rail and sea transportation for freight have fallen behind
the modernisation levels of other EC countries.
How has air transport measured up to the challenges? Here, too, not enough
has been done, argues Mr Gastone Nardoni, deputy chairman of Ibar, the
foreign airlines association.
A big complaint concerns airport and air traffic services and costs.
'Services fall short of appropriate standards and costs are high and opaque.
They are over-manned and inefficient, and the user has to foot the bill,'
says Mr Nardoni. He adds that the foreign airlines' complaints have been
referred to the anti-trust authority.
There is a widespread belief that Italy's monopoly, state-owned flag-carrier
Alitalia enjoys preferential treatment. 'Why are national costs so
different? What criteria are used in the calculations?' asks Mr Nardoni.
Conditions are not easy for Ibar's members, who also have to contend with a
Levantine bureaucracy, strikes at short notice and technical backwardness
which not infrequently leads to major airports being fogbound.
The gloomy reality that characterises the Italian transport sector, road,
rail, sea and air, is of great concern to business. Referring to
infrastructural shortcomings and the low level of public services,
Confindustria notes: 'Transport represents for industry an essential means
for getting to the market in the right way and at the right time.'

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (11): Uncertainties on the doorstep -
Foreign and defence policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE traffic lights of a busy junction on the outskirts of Rome, a child
begs with a large grubby placard. Crudely written are the words: 'Sarajevo.
Homeless. Father dead.'
The civil war in the republics of former Yugoslavia is impossible to ignore
in neighbouring Italy - even if the question of refugees has not acquired
the proportions once feared or the scale of the shocking exodus from Albania
last summer. This seemingly unstoppable conflict has added a dramatic and
highly unpredictable element to Italy's security concerns.
Unrest in the Balkans has not been the sole area of concern over the past 12
months. Events in Algeria and Libya have highlighted the potential
vulnerability of Italy's dependence on these two North African states for
oil and gas requirements. The past year has seen a military coup in Algeria
to forestall the installation of an Islamic government and the threat of
United Nations trade embargo against Libya.
Such uncertainties on Italy's doorstep coincide with two broader
international developments - the reassessment of Nato's role in the light of
the collapse of communism and the prospects of both a broadening and
deepening of the European Community. The Danish referendum rejection of last
December's Treaty of Maastricht has raised the spectre of a looser structure
for European integration.
This is directly contrary to the entire thrust of policy conducted by the
Andreotti government, which hoped to place Italy as an important broker in
an increasingly federal Europe powered by France and Germany. In this sense,
Italy was anchored securely to northern Europe. Any weakening of this
process - and any weakening of Italy's ability to comply with the terms of
closer integration - risks loosening this linkage with northern Europe.
The new government's approach towards Europe will also colour the debate on
defence. Until now, Italy has remained a strong supporter of Nato. Italy has
also insisted that Franco-German plans to enhance the Western European Union
and make it the centrepiece of future European defence co-operation must not
be at Nato's expense. The outgoing government found on this it made common
cause with the British.
American pressure to continue to back Nato remains strong and also helps
explain Italy's willingness to support new concepts of 'out-of-area' action
by the organisation. But even without such pressure, the experience of the
Gulf War and the break-up of the former Soviet Union have brought home the
need for a more flexible and rapid defence policy.
The concept of a flexible rapid response against multi-directional threats
was the essence of proposals last November to carry out a major
reorganisation of Italy's armed forces. The 'new model of defence',
announced by Mr Virginio Rognoni, the defence minister, envisaged a sharp
cut in the size of the armed forces and the first serious attempt to
professionalise them.
The aim is to cut some 90,000 civilian and military personnel from the
payroll by the end of the decade. The cuts proposed would be equivalent to
23 per cent of the combined strength of the armed forces in 1990. However,
the cuts would be unevenly spread - 28 per cent in the army, 20 per cent
among civilian employees, 13 per cent in the air force and 12 per cent in
the navy. This reflects the fact that the size of the army is swollen by
conscription and it is the part of the military that is least
professionalised and modernised.
The army, with a new rapid intervention role accorded by Nato for the
alliance's southern flank, would be remodelled around 15 brigades, instead
of the current 25 brigades. Of these, five would contain frontline troops
trained for rapid deployment, including out-of-area actions. Conscription
would be reduced and more emphasis would be placed on attracting short-term
volunteers.
The navy, for its part, would have less of an ocean-going role and would
concentrate more on coastal policing and tasks within the Mediterranean. The
air force would lose six squadrons and the number of operational air bases
would be cut from 24 to 20.
The counter-balance to these cuts would be substantial investment in
equipment, of which some 45 per cent will be out of date by the end of the
century. Overall, the net additional cost to the defence budget could be
L40,000bn. However, there would be an important shift in the nature of
expenditure - away from personnel costs and onto materiel.
The proposals have been greeted with alarm by some of the top ranks, and one
senior general has resigned in protest. The complaints centre on plans to
break up traditional units and establish new command structures
co-ordinating the three (rival) services. There are also fears about lost
jobs, an unacceptably high ratio of southerners (perhaps 80 per cent) in the
armed forces ranks as volunteers and complaints that pay is unlikely to
improve. All these problems will be an important item on the agenda of the
new government.
More immediate is the situation in former Yugoslavia which could result in
Italy receiving a large number of refugees or being dragged into the
fighting. Italy made ready for up to 50,000 refugees from fighting in
Croatia and Slovenia late last year, but fewer than 5,000 sought formal
assistance.
As fighting spread to Bosnia this year, the Italian authorities adopted a
new policy of seeking where possible to channel assistance so that Bosnian
refugees were assisted in Slovenia and Croatia. This policy of keeping the
refugees at arm's length appears to have been successful so far.
Italy learned its lessons with refugees over Albania. The authorities were
wholly unprepared for the 18,000 Albanians who last August packed in boats
and sought to enter the port of Bari. This invasion was chaotically handled
at the outset and Italy's international image was badly dented by scenes of
starving Albanians being attacked by the police. Nevertheless, the Andreotti
government saw that if they were given asylum as economic refugees, then the
exodus from Albania would merely increase. All but some 1,500 who managed to
escape from Bari were forcibly repatriated.
In a little publicised follow-up policy, the government decided on a major
increase in direct aid to Albania. By improving conditions inside the
country - and tightening sea patrols - it was hoped Albanians would be
dissuaded from a further exodus. In October Italy despatched some 750
military personnel to operate relief inside Albania, distributing by
Christmas some L120bn of foodstuffs, medicines and building materials.
The troops were to have returned around the new year, but their mandate has
been renewed indefinitely and Italy has established itself, perforce, as the
outside power controlling the affairs of Albania. Until the country's
primitive economy begins to revive and the political situation stabilises
after the March elections, the Italians will have to keep a close eye on
Albania.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (10): The unions in a new environment -
Robert Graham reports on the changing face of industrial relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the major economies, Italy has been the slowest to adapt its
industrial relations to changing international conditions.
The powerful trade union movement which emerged after the Second World War
has won exceptionally favourable conditions for its members on the back of a
fast-growing economy and a political establishment afraid of worker unrest.
Job security, wage indexation, a short working week, long holidays and
generous pensions have become part of a package taken for granted until very
recently.
But increased international competition, combined with a domestic recession
and continually deteriorating public finances, are forcing change. Companies
in both the public and private sectors are being obliged to improve
productivity, curb wage costs and introduce more flexible employment
policies.
The trade unions themselves recognise the need to adapt to the new
environment. Indeed, the traditional confrontational reflexes are
disappearing and both sides, whether management or labour, accept that
dialogue and consensus are more constructive.
Last year the number of hours lost through disputes dropped 70 per cent to
one of its lowest levels ever. However, the divisions between the two sides
are as wide as ever, and it is far from clear how they will react to
controversial issues now on the table such as job cuts and ending wage
indexation.
The long-standing system of wage indexation, known as the scala mobile, has
come to symbolise the Italian way of doing things - beneficial to employees
but inflationary to the economy and costly to the employers (who then try to
offset the costs by avoiding taxes). Since the Craxi government of the
mid-1980s, the extent of indexation has gradually been reduced and at the
end of last year the decree to renew the scala mobile was allowed to lapse.
By this time the payment had dropped to a 40 per cent top up of that
percentage which inflation had risen above its level envisaged in the wage
settlement.
Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, interpreted the lapsing of
the law as a clear government move to abandon indexed wages as known under
the scala mobile. On this basis Confindustria agreed to resume a fresh set
of broad-ranging talks on wage and labour costs. CGIL, the largest of the
three big union confederations, challenged this view immediately, arguing
that a number of wage settlements concluded last year had written in
provision for payments of the scala mobile increase due in May.
When May arrived, both the government and Confindustria flatly refused to
pay this increase which would mean an extra payment averaging L28,000 a
month. In a full year Confindustria maintains it would add some 2 per cent
to the projected 1992 average wage increase of 5.6 per cent.
The CGIL reacted by taking the matter to the courts and its metal-workers'
union began at the end of May a series of rolling protest strikes. This was
primarily intended to make the point, in the absence of a government, that
an alternative had to be found to the scala mobile and that the issue of
contracts with the scala mobile payment written in could not be ignored.
The unions are willing to be more flexible - especially those in CISL and
UIL, the two smaller confederations. However, as they see the centre of
power shift towards the employers, they are reluctant to make concessions
without a fight. Unless the matter is resolved, the climate of labour
relations could sour in the autumn.
The unions are divided among themselves on the type of 'protective
mechanism' needed to shelter wages from inflation. But they seem to be
moving towards a proposal whereby loss of purchasing power through inflation
should be made up to those on the lowest wages. This approach has been
favoured by Mr Franco Marini, the outgoing labour minister. Certainly, some
sop will be necessary to keep the trade unions happy if the new government
implements a tough austerity package.
Confindustria, on the other hand, maintains that labour can no longer
presume to enjoy the luxury of its purchasing power either permanently
increasing above inflation or being protected at inflation levels -
especially if wages are anyway rising above Italy's main competitors. The
confederation is taking a tough stand, not least because this issue is
providing the baptism for Mr Luigi Abete, the Rome entrepreneur who took
over the leadership of Confindustria last month.
The unions may prefer to opt for job security rather than wage compensation.
Already, industrial companies are having to slim down to survive. Olivetti
was the first of the big companies to propose cuts; and this has been
followed up by Fiat which last month decided to close its Chiavasso auto
plant which employs 4,200. Fiat is pledged to find alternative employment,
but this may be easier said than done. Meanwhile, smaller companies lack the
resources and diversity of Fiat; nor do they have its political muscle -
thus the knock-on effect of the industrial downturn in the north will be
keenly felt.
A significant pointer has been the number of requests by companies to be
included in this year's quota for government-aided early retirement. Even
though the government insisted that only the most pressing cases would be
considered of those companies seeking to restructure in advanced and
strategic sectors, over 42,000 requests were submitted.
The cost of this scheme is shared jointly by the government and companies
and allows people to retire five years early. In most cases, it is merely
people who previously would have been covered by temporary lay-off payments
until proper retirement age onto pensions - so the net extra cost is
limited, officials claim.
Another issue that the unions will need to confront is wage differentials.
The unions fought hard for the principle of equal wages for the same job
throughout Italy. However, this has become an impediment to investment in
the south. Employers are reluctant to invest when wages are the same but
productivity is 30 per cent less than in the north.
The question of wage differentials in turn opens up the whole structure of
trade union negotiations. Until now, this has been done on a highly
centralised basis with the main confederations laying down the guidelines
for their demands in each sector - eg transport, chemicals, engineering,
etc.
Already, specialised groups such as train drivers and airline flight
attendants have formed themselves into unofficial unions, the so-called
Cobas. The latter have recognised that they can exploit their special
bargaining power, holding to ransom users of strategic facilities; and in
this way they can obtain better deals than those negotiated in their names
by the large unions.
Although the three main confederations deny the Cobas have affected them and
their membership, they have undoubtedly had an important disruptive effect.
In general, the unions have to respond to a trend of declining membership.
This may not be so marked as in France and the UK, but it cannot be ignored.
The CGIL has seen active members fall from 3.39m to 2.72m in the 10 years to
1991 while the number of pensioners has doubled to 2.45m. In part, this
reflects the declining role of ideology in the movement, the CGIL always
having been Marxist-oriented while the CISL was Catholic, backed by the
Christian Democrats and the UIL was Social Democrat.
Indeed, the rationale behind the maintenance of these three confederations
is increasingly hard to justify. Last October, the CGIL in its 12th congress
formerly buried its long-held credo in the class struggle, although a
minority of hard-line communists took their distance. This had made a merger
more politically feasible; but the two smaller confederations are afraid
they will be swallowed up by the CGIL.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (7): Privatisation encounters barriers -
Haig Simonian reports on a subject high on the new prime minister's list of
priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUT MORE than 100 leading Italian public sector bankers and industrialists
on a royal yacht, sprinkle a few dozen UK corporate financiers and add a
pinch of sunshine for a day's cruise, and you could have the perfect recipe
to kick-start a privatisation programme.
That, at least, was the thinking behind a marketing wheeze last month to
sell Italians the merits of the UK's financial services industry, especially
as far as privatisation was concerned.
But, as everyone on board the Britannia already knew, privatisation in Italy
involves more than just a chat and a cup of tea. Selling state enterprises
can go a long way to cut the budget deficit, while increasing competition
and improving services. Yet significant sales remain conspicuous by their
absence.
The role of the public sector in the economy is hard to miss. State-owned
concerns account for almost half Italy's 50 biggest companies in terms of
turnover. IRI, largest of the state holding companies, accounts for around 5
per cent of gross national product. ENI, the second largest, has a
stranglehold on the energy market and is a major force in chemicals. Efim,
smallest of the big three in terms of sales, leads by a furlong when it
comes to losses.
Together, they account for huge tracts of Italian business. IRI, organised
in sub-holdings which in turn control hundreds of separate operating
companies, dominates telecommunications through its Stet holding,
engineering and aerospace via Finmeccanica, food through SME, and steel via
Ilva. Its businesses embrace activities as diverse as air traffic control
radar (Selenia) and ice-lollies (Italgel).
The public sector is also present in less obvious guises, notably finance
and insurance. Italy's biggest bank, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino,
is a charitable foundation largely under public sector control. The main
shareholder in Banca di Roma, the country's second biggest financial
institution, is a foundation dominated by the city of Rome. Meanwhile,
Milan-based Cariplo, is the biggest example of the hundreds of
municipally-owned savings institutions that dot the country.
Selling just a few could raise huge amounts of cash and help cover the
roaring budget deficit. But even with the arrival as prime minister of Mr
Giuliano Amato, who has put privatisation high on his priority list, backers
of state sell-offs are still likely to encounter substantial political
barriers.
Opposition to sales is sometimes ideological, and based on complex - often
jejune - arguments about the connotations of the word 'public' in Italian.
Italy, owing to its late industrialisation and sharp north-south divide, is
not like other west European countries, it is reasoned. Hence public
ownership is not necessarily seen as a bad thing, while the state investment
has been a vital social and economic tool in developing the
economically-depressed south.
Others focus on the structural barriers to privatisation. Italy's pint-sized
stock market makes Thatcherite concepts of popular share ownership
impractical. Encouraging private investors to take shares in state-owned
companies could be counter-productive, as it may reduce their tendency to
buy government bonds - a key part of funding the deficit. And, opponents
argue, how would competition be served if state-owned assets end up in the
hands of some of Italy's big private sector groups?
Such warnings often strike a chord among electors. But the most common
motive behind political hostility to state sell-offs remains the fear of
losing patronage, and, possibly, funds. Italy's state-owned companies are
rife with political placemen, rewarded for their services with plumb public
sector jobs. Even the promise of a steady job in a state-owned company can
be a potent political instrument to win votes and gain popular support.
But political opposition to sell-offs has been under pressure as state
finances have deteriorated. Even critics of privatisation have been forced
to accept the principle of asset sales, albeit while fighting a rearguard
action on the details.
The result is that privatisation has been a piecemeal process. This year's
budget target of L15,000bn in disposals has its foundation in two big
transactions: the sale of Crediop, a Treasury controlled long-term lending
bank, to San Paolo, which has raised around L2,100bn; and the planned
transfer of an opening stake in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI) to Cariplo
for a sum estimated to be almost as large, with more on the way should other
savings banks also join in. The remainder of the budgeted income will come
from a mixed bag of disposals, largely of surplus state property.
However, other big potential transactions have been stalled by the failure
of the political parties to agree on priorities or practicalities. Progress
so far has been limited to the technical level of altering the legal status
of some public sector entities to that of joint stock companies (SpAs).
Even the debate on conversion has unleashed political dogfights. Though
uncontroversial in principle, the change of status for bodies like Enel, the
state electricity generating concern, or ENI, has been fought tooth and nail
by politicians who see it as the thin end of the wedge. Accordingly, the
number of agreed changes has so far been limited to ENI and the state
railways. Of those which have made progress, some, like the railways, would
be unsellable anyway.
But while politicians have been arguing the finer legal points of
transformations into joint stock companies, a 'privatisation' of sorts has
been at work independently.
IRI, in particular, has had to look for new sources of funds to meet its
ambitious investment plans at a time of crumbling profitability. Its 1991
results showed a L315bn loss, compared with net profits of L1,108bn the
previous year.
But while earnings have tumbled, the financial appetites of its subsidiaries
remain voracious. So, lacking clear political signals from the government
and facing a growing squeeze owing to the shortage of state finance, IRI has
had to accept that asset sales are virtually the only way to tackle its
problems.
So far, big disposals have been limited by political factors. IRI's biggest
sell-off has been the L480bn sale in February of its 52 per cent stake in
Cementir, a quoted subsidiary and the third biggest cement producer in
Italy.
However, it has been highly active in whittling down holdings in its huge
stable of subsidiaries, which appears to be much less controversial
politically. Last July, IRI raised around Dollars 275m by reducing its stake
in Stet savings shares. In October, it sold around L200bn worth of savings
shares and warrants in Credito Italiano, one of two big banks it owns. As a
result, IRI's stake in Credito Italiano's savings shares has fallen to 17
per cent from 57 per cent before.
This year, IRI's management has been bolder. Last month, it took the first
step in a multi-stage transaction, raising up to L1,750bn by launching the
secondary sale of shares in Stet. Meanwhile, in late summer, Finmeccanica
should raise around L2,450bn through a partial flotation.
IRI's subsidiaries have also been selling assets in their own right. In
February, Stet started thinning down its holding of savings shares in Sip,
Italy's main telephone operating utility, through a L400bn convertible
Eurobond. Should all the linked warrants be exercised, Stet's stake in Sip's
savings stock will drop to 33 per cent from nearly 53 per cent before.
ENI also expects to raise money this year by reducing its shares in some of
its subsidiaries. First off the mark could be its Immobiliare Metanopoli
property arm, which is already quoted. And some analysts believe ENI could
raise around L2,000bn this year from the flotation of stakes in Agip and
Snam, its petroleum and gas transmission operations.
None of the flotations or secondary placements so far has threatened the
state's ultimate control, as no equity sales have gone beyond the 49 per
cent barrier. And when that ceiling has been breached, only non-voting
savings stock has been on offer.
However, even IRI has a finite number of assets in its portfolio. In some
cases, its share sales have already reduced its control within reach of the
decisive 50 per cent mark. In the case of Stet, IRI's latest transaction
will take its holding of ordinary shares down to just 53 per cent and to a
mere 1 per cent of the savings stock. At such levels, speculative interest
could flourish as the next step would have to be a 'true' privatisation.
With little sign of an improvement in IRI's earnings this year, that may no
longer be so far off. The group is clearly keen to offload minority stakes
in subsidiaries wherever possible, and the main barrier so far appears to be
choosiness in the market, rather than its own reluctance to sell.
Bankers would be much more enthusiastic if IRI, or any of the state groups,
were to offer more than 49 per cent of a company's stock. But that decision
will require political, rather than management, will, based on a clear
privatisation policy. Even with Mr Amato on board, there is no sign of it so
far.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (8): Anti-trust watchdog shows its teeth -
Competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE CAN bite as well as bark,' claims Mr Alberto Pera, general secretary of
the Autorita Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, Italy's anti-trust
authority. Established in October 1990, the authority has just reported on
its first full year of activity.
The record shows that the authority examined 104 cases of concentration,
involving a total of 238 companies, in 1991. Among these was the ENI state
hydrocarbons holding's purchase of Montedison's shareholding in the Enichem
chemicals company.
This operation drew the authority's wrath and a L500m penalty against the
state holding corporation for its failure to report the share purchase.
Another big state company, the Sip telephone monopoly, also earned an
adverse ruling last year when the authority decided that it was abusing its
dominant position.
During the first quarter this year the authority examined nearly 100 cases
of concentration, gave opinions on operations in the banking and publishing
sectors (where the Bank of Italy and the media authority have anti-trust
responsibilities) and investigated 15 agreements between firms.
More recent decisions have included pecuniary penalties against two cement
companies. Italy's anti-trust watchdog seems to be getting its teeth into
the task, as well as making itself heard. But not before time.
Rome was late in legislating against competition distortions and the law
limits the authority to strictly domestic matters that are not covered by
rules set in Brussels. Indeed, Italy's anti-trust law mirrors the principles
framed in EC market legislation, regulating agreements between companies,
abuse of dominant position and takeovers.
The authority must be notified in takeovers where the aggregate turnover of
the companies involved exceeds L500bn in Italy, or where the Italian
turnover of the comapny being taken over is more than L50bn. The authority
must complete its investigation within 45 days. Mr Pera says that simple
cases are dealt with rapidly, usually within a few days.
While most of the authority's work involves takeovers, it is handling an
increasing number of cases of abuse of dominant position. 'These generally
arise from complaints to the authority,' says Mr Pera. 'With only 60 staff
we have not been able to search for abuse of dominant position. But we
recognise the need for being active as well as reactive,' he adds.
The legislation that established Italy's anti-trust authority gave it full
autonomy of operation and independence in its decision-making. It is headed
by a chairman, currently Mr Francesco Saja, and four members, all five being
appointed by the speakers of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate for
non-renewable, seven-year terms.
Has the authority been able to assert the independence it enjoys on paper,
and avoid the powerful party political tentacles that grip Italy's public
administration? 'So far we have encountered no political obstacles or been
subjected to interference,' claims Mr Pera. He says the ruling in the Sip
case should show the political placemen in state corporations that the
authority means business.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (9): A workplace solution - What
industrialists want
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'DEVALUATION does not offer a solution to the fall in Italian industry's
competitiveness,' says Mr Stefano Micossi, head of the research department
at Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation.
There has been speculation over the lira's parity in the ERM and
expectations of a downward realignment. However, Mr Micossi says such a move
would provide only temporary relief by stimulating exports and slowing
imports, before being quickly followed by a sharp spurt in inflation.
The trade figures reflect the difficulties of Italy's manufacturers in
producing goods that are competitive in world markets. Since 1989 export
volumes of intermediates and investment goods have been on a downward trend,
while imports have continued to rise. The volume of exports of consumer
goods stopped growing in 1990.
Increasing globalisation has led to a higher propensity both to export and
import. However, during the last decade import penetration has grown
significantly more rapidly than the exports/production ratio. Moreover,
growth in import penetration appears to be structural and independent of the
economic cycle.
Price competitiveness of Italian manufactured goods has fallen about 6
percentage points against EC trading partners since the beginning of 1988.
This worsening position makes it increasingly difficult to compensate for
import penetration by raising exports.
Mr Micossi emphasises, however, that the solution must be found in the
workplace rather than through exchange rate adjustments. These would, in any
case, be subject to political constraints because of the lira's adhesion to
the ERM's narrow band. Tackling costs, particularly the payroll, is the
central issue.
Last year industrial wages recorded a 9.1 per cent increase, against
inflation of 6.4 per cent. The gap created by wages moving significantly
ahead of inflation is a constant feature. Even when Italy's retail price
index bottomed at 4.7 per cent in 1987, industrial wages rose by 8.6 per
cent.
There is a marked contrast, however, between the increase in the cost of
labour per unit of output in the period 1986 to 1988 and the last three
years. From an average of 2.8 per cent it has risen to 6.6 per cent. The
productivity improvements that were won by the restructuring in Italian
manufacturing in the early and mid-1980s had been fully exploited by the end
of the decade.
'Tight control over wage increases is a necessity,' says Mr Micossi. He
believes fundamental changes are required in wage structures and bargaining
procedures. 'All forms of automatic adjustment and indexation must be
abandoned.'
At present, wage negotiations take place at national, industry and plant
level. Mr Micossi says this is too complicated and contributes to runaway
payroll costs.
Italy's industrialists would prefer to negotiate national agreements on
wages every two years, with non-wage aspects of labour contracts being
decided every six years. Industries would need to be better defined than the
present broad categories. There would be no place for plant bargaining under
such a framework.
Industrialists regard the expiry at the end of last year of the scala mobile
 -the moving staircase system that indexed part of the pay packet - as a
step in the right direction. Notwithstanding the nostalgia expressed by some
trade unionists, it seems unlikely that the scala mobile will be revived.
Confindustria believes overhauling wage bargaining procedures is not enough,
and that Italian industrial relations needs more profound change. According
to Mr Micossi, the conflictual ideology - at best an uneasy coexistence -
that has guided relations between employers and employees over the past 40
years, must be changed. 'We must abandon the lines of trench warfare and
co-operate,' he says.
Competitiveness would benefit from an industrial relations system which does
not place obstacles in the way of part-time working, job mobility and other
forms of flexibility.
Italy has not benefited from the working practices that other more
competitive industrial countries, particularly Japan, have adopted. It often
seems closed to outside ideas. 'It is a cultural matter. There are few
businessmen who genuinely want more investment in Italy by foreign firms,'
explains Mr Micossi.
Italian competitiveness is also damaged by the excessive costs imposed by
the inefficient infrastructure of services and public administration.
'National and local utilities, the banking system, distribution, government
offices and local authorities provide services with a poor quality-cost
ratio. Yet these are non-tradables that are not subject to exchange rate
discipline,' says Mr Micossi.
The industrialists' complaints enjoy authoritative support. Addressing the
Bank of Italy's annual meeting at the end of May, the governor repeated
observations that he had made on previous occasions about unsatisfactory
productivity and price growth in the tertiary sector. 'Promotion of
competition in national and local markets is needed in order to compensate
for the absence of international competition,' said the governor, Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi.
Mr Ciampi and the captains of Italian industry are fortunate in being spared
the inconveniences and disservices suffered by normal members of the public
at the hands of local and central authorities, the post office, the
telephone corporation, the railway and urban transport systems, banks and
much of the tertiary sector.
The Italian man-in-the-street would certainly not disagree with Mr Micossi's
claim that there is room for efficiency improvements. 'Italy's public
infrastructure and service sector need the kind of radical restructuring
undergone by industry between 1982 and 1985,' Mr Micossi says. That would
definitely give Italian manufacturing industry a huge competitive boost.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (5): Protest vote may spur action -
Institutional Reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL TOO often, Italian politicians' ability to talk about problems has been
the direct opposite of their capacity to solve them. On no issue has this
been so evident as that of institutional reform.
The process of electing governments and governing Italy has progressively
become more unworkable. Every party has suggested remedies; but nothing has
been done. Any such reforms attack the heart of the system of privilege and
power which has been consolidated under Christian Democrat hegemony since
the Second World War.
The issue is finally being forced onto the political agenda from two
opposite directions. One set of pressures is coming from an ever-more
disillusioned electorate whose large protest vote in April demonstrated that
the existing system of proportional representation had reached the limits of
its viability. No fewer than 16 parties are represented in the new
parliament of which 12 each gained less than 7 per cent of the vote, and
only one (the Christian Democrats) more than 20 per cent.
From another direction comes the impact of the cross-party referendum
movement. This is an odd alliance of politicians, backed by the public's
referendum signatures, who see parliament incapable of reforming the state
and therefore are resorting to referendums to do the job instead.
Significantly, it is led by a dissident Christian Democrat, Mr Mario Segni.
Next year Italy could face up to 10 referendums on a variety of topics whose
combined effect would alter radically the formal functioning of the state.
Already the movement has managed, via a referendum in June 1991, to abolish
the system of multi-preference votes which was much abused in the corrupt
constituencies of southern Italy.
Institutional reform is short-hand for a shake-up of a wide range of aspects
of government and governance. It spans altering the system of proportional
representation for parliamentary elections, the possibility of direct
elections to the presidency, more autonomy for the regions and the
introduction of direct elections for mayors.
The most urgent concerns reforming proportional representation so that
Italians possess a process which produces more stable governments. In this
way Italians would vote for governments with clear programmes instead of the
present vote for a party, an uncertain alliance and an ill-prepared
programme.
The existing system provides excessive guarantees to minority groups which
in turn permits the political scene to be over-fragmented and obliges
governments to be formed from coalitions. The country is divided up into 32
electoral colleges which provide the 630 deputies and 315 senators.
Seats are awarded in the following way. The total votes in each college is
first added and then divided by the total number of seats plus two - an
equation which gives the electoral 'quotient'. This quotient represents the
number of votes each party must obtain to win a seat.
Usually, it is impossible to allocate all seats in this manner (between 16
and 20 remain). To fill these seats, the remaining votes in excess of each
party's quotient - or the entire vote if a party has failed to reach the
requisite quotient - are transferred to a national electoral college where a
new quotient is worked out. Thus small parties may gain no seat in the
regional electoral colleges but with their votes carried forward into the
national college they stand a good chance; because at this stage the number
of their votes is usually greater than the larger parties.
The Christian Democrats have proposed to retain this system for 555 seats
(88 per cent) in the chamber of deputies. The remainder would be awarded as
a 'majority premium' to the party, or the pre-electoral coalition, with the
highest number of votes. The aim of the 'majority premium' would be to give
the main party or coalition a stable majority. The coalition would have to
be clearly defined in advance.
Their Socialist allies approach the problem of unstable governments from a
different angle by introducing a minimum threshold vote of 5 per cent in at
least half the electoral colleges. This would encourage the smaller parties
to form coalitions; but it discriminates against regional parties. If
applied on the April results, this formula would have excluded seven parties
who won a total of 100 seats in the chamber of deputies. In addition, the
Lombard League, which became the second largest party in northern Italy and
obtained 9 per cent of the national vote, would have been excluded because
its vote was unevenly spread.
The former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) has favoured a
procedure whereby deputies who failed to obtain a majority vote on the first
round must go to a second round. Others have talked more of a
first-past-the-post system as in the UK. One of the referendums currently
being considered by the courts is a move to introduce a first-past-the-post
system for two-thirds of the senate.
Virtually all the parties are agreed on the need to redefine the respective
roles of the chamber and senate. The two have been assigned similar but not
complementary roles and this merely impedes the legislative process. More
authority would be vested in the chamber.
Another reform concerns the system of electing the president. He is elected
by parliament, the successful candidate being the product of back-stage
deals between the parties. He is thus dependent upon the goodwill of the
parties, rather than the nation as a whole. The party bosses recognise that
a quicker system needs to be introduced - last month's election of President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was on the 16th attempt (the record is 23). Others want
to see the president directly elected, accountable to the voters, not the
parties, with more real presidential authority and a cut in the seven-year
term.
At present the president's principal powers are to nominate a prime minister
and dissolve parliament. But these functions have been in effect controlled
by the main parties, as has the composition of the cabinet. For a more
efficient government, the prime minister also has to feel free to choose his
own team and then be answerable to parliament for his programme.
This margin of manoeuvre is being conceded for the first time to Professor
Giuliano Amato. If it lasts, it could be an important element in the parties
being pushed away from the affairs of state.
The great barrier to institutional reform is the way the political parties
have become entwined in the apparatus of state. The activities of party and
government are often indistinguishable, and the situation has deteriorated
as party bureaucracies have swollen. This has been made appallingly clear by
the Milan municipal corruption scandal.
A pattern of illegal party funding has emerged on the basis of bribes from
rigged public contracts. This was encouraged by the nature of local
government which has under its sway a large number of state and para-state
bodies handling big contracts such as the local health organisations, the
local public transport companies and the airport authorities. The boards of
these bodies have been stacked with the party faithful.
On one guestimate, over 100,000 people depend directly on political parties.
The PDS, which now has only 16 per cent of the vote, employs over 1,750
full-time staff - by comparison the UK Labour party employs only 50. After
the Milan corruption scandal, the parties may well feel obliged to withdraw
their members from the boards of these local bodies to demonstrate they are
cleaning up their act.
Tighter control of state spending and greater transparency automatically
would expose party free-loading and the soto governo (under-the-table
government). But such measures would in themselves require a new approach to
local government. At present, local government expenditures are agreed
annually in the national budget; but with both the local authorities and the
government knowing perfectly well the figures are understated.
The local authorities are merely spending agencies with virtually no
autonomy to raise their own funds and with no penalties for overspending, as
invariably happens. If local government were to be reformed by permitting
greater autonomy, with direct elections for the mayors and penalties for
overspending, as proposed by the new government, this would go some way to
correct existing abuses.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (6): A difficult knot to untangle - Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION REFORM has been promised so often that it is hard to take any
proposal seriously. Yet the pressure to reform Italy's exceptionally
generous state pensions scheme - and in parallel also open up the system to
private pension funds - is unrelenting. Social welfare spending, principally
pensions, has become one of the main causes of the country's expanding
public sector deficit.
Last year, pension payments increased 11.3 per cent, a real rise of 5 per
cent and faster than the overall level of social welfare spending. Pensions
accounted for 83 per cent of the L184,000bn social spending budget. Indeed,
pensions distort it, reducing the state's ability to spend on other items,
notably health care, where Italy's outlays are below the European average.
Payments to the country's 14.2m pensioners are now equivalent to 14 per cent
of GDP. With the increasing longevity of the population and a stable - if
not declining - active workforce, the difficulties of funding the existing
scheme are growing exponentially. Within 30 years, if the current system is
unchanged, it will require something close to a 50 per cent contribution
from labour force salaries to balance contributions and payments.
Alternatively, pension outlays would account for nearly all the current
budget.
The latest Bank of Italy annual report, released at the end of May,
commented bluntly: 'If the increase in spending is not controlled, it will
be necessary to resort to higher contribution rates or charge more to the
state budget. In the first scenario company profitability is likely to
suffer. In the second instance, it would be necessary to carry out either
tough fiscal measures or spending cuts elsewhere in compensation.'
It is not just this generosity that needs remedying. The system is open to
considerable abuse and political manipulation. Nowhere else in Europe does
such a high proportion of people claim early retirement on disability
pensions. No fewer than 4.2m people, one-third of all pensioners, receive
disability pensions. A high proportion of the latter are in the south where
it is a widespread practice to ask local politicians to ensure that the
relevant medical certificates are granted to guarantee a minimal disability.
Equally, state employment and its exceptionally generous terms for early
retirement have been gravely abused. A state employee has the right to take
early retirement after only 20 years' service if male, and as little as 15
years if a woman (childbirth and childcare time is included). This compares
to 35 years' minimum service for an old-age pension in the private sector.
According to a recent report by Censis, the social research institute, 87
per cent of all male state employees have benefited from some form of early
retirement scheme. State employees also have their pensions calculated in a
more advantageous manner so that they can expect to receive up to 94 per
cent of their final salary inflation-proof. The best that private sector
employees can expect from the state, after contributing the same quota for
pensions from their pay packets, is 80 per cent of the average salary of the
previous five years.
The difference in pension payments between public employees and the rest of
the workforce has been one reason why state employment has proved so
attractive and public sector payrolls so high - with the consequent burden
on the treasury.
The funding of state employee pensions also bears little relation to the
demands of accountability. There is no state pension fund - although private
sector employers are obliged to pay in 18.6 per cent and all employees a
further 7.1 per cent of wages to INPS, the state social welfare institute.
Thus, payments are direct out of the annual budget. By 1990 there were over
1m state employees receiving pensions averaging over L18m a year.
The normal retirement age for women in Italy is fixed at 55 years, five
years below the European average. The male retirement age of 60 is also
lower than the EC norm of 65.
The pensions scheme is thus generous in almost every aspect. This has been
the product of two mutually reinforcing elements. First, a powerful trade
union movement in the early post-war period fought hard to ensure basic
pension rights. These were gradually consolidated, often with the help of
sympathetic judges who gave benign pensioner-biased judgments in a series of
court cases where the regulations were tested - and frequently expanded.
This was especially the case with inflation-related adjustments to existing
pensions.
Second, both the political parties and the employers were prepared to
concede advantageous pensions to employees as a means of buying peace on the
shop floor. Good pensions represented guaranteed social cohesion. And it is
precisely this aspect which makes reform such a sensitive issue.
For at least 10 years, parties across the political spectrum have accepted
the need for reform. No government has had the courage to take action. Since
1984 there have been four separate sets of proposals to change the system.
The latest in August last year, put forward by Mr Franco Marini, then labour
minister, represented a modest step towards reducing pension benefits and
saving the treasury some money. But the Marini proposals were shelved
towards the end of 1991 as general elections approached and no party wished
to court unpopularity by cutting pensions.
The new government now has two alternatives: adopt the Marini reforms or go
back to the drawing board. Given the need for action, the Marini proposals
represent a reasonable point of departure. In addition, they are merely a
tightening of the three previous plans produced in 1984, 1989 and 1990. All,
for instance, propose the raising of both male and female retiring ages to
65. Mr Marini planned to phase this in for men by 2005 and for women by
2015, saving by the year 2010 some L18,000bn (10 per cent of the budget
deficit).
They all proposed stiffening the qualifications for early retirement by
raising the minimum number of yearly contributions. In the case of the
Marini scheme this is 35 years all round, including state employees. He
further proposed that pensions should be calculated on the basis of the
previous 10 years' pay with a maximum ceiling of 80 per cent. There are
other provisions regarding the form in which pensions will be indexed to
inflation.
Pension reform also has to take into account moves to privatise and the
resistance of state employees to privatisation. Beyond this, the government
will need to examine a reform of the public administration. Too many people
are poorly paid, and because of that, they are encouraged to retire early
and seek another job while drawing their pension.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (2): Extent of problems starts to sink in -
The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM OPTIMISM this time last year that it might escape the economic downturn
already affecting most of its industrialised partners, the mood has swung to
pessimism that Italy may find it harder than most to emerge now that
recession has finally struck.
The full effects of the downturn were felt in the final quarter of last
year. In spite of signs of a pick-up in industrial production recently, it
is still unclear whether recovery will come before the end of 1992. As a
result, the chances of the economy meeting even the revised target of a 1.8
per cent rise in real gross domestic product look negligible. Last
September, the government was still forecasting real GDP growth of 2.5 per
cent for 1992.
Economic policy in Italy remains complicated by the need for tough action on
the budget deficit, which continues to swell beyond control. After rising
steadily ahead of the April general elections following a flood of new
spending measures, the delays in choosing a president and forming a new
government after the poll exacerbated matters.
Last month, the effects of the drift became dramatic. After remaining
isolated from the crisis of confidence that had already hit the stock market
earlier this year, both the lira and the government bond market came under
severe pressure under the impact of the Danish 'No' vote on the Maastricht
treaty.
The Danish decision raised uncertainties about achieving greater economic
and monetary convergence in Europe. With the Maastricht process at risk,
Italy's own commitment to EC policy on convergence was immediately put under
scrutiny. The results were traumatic.
Only repeated interventions by the Bank of Italy and a two-stage rise in
interest rates by commercial banks quelled speculation against the lira,
which was further weakened by sharp outflows on the back of devaluation
fears. Although the situation has calmed, the markets remain edgy.
In a discussion paper released a fortnight ago, Mr Giuliano Amato, Italy's
new prime minister, put action to curb the ballooning deficit at the top of
his agenda. Mr Amato called for reduced welfare spending, tougher control of
public sector pay and greater accountability at local authority level to
limit the drain on state finances. And he pressed for further action to curb
tax dodging.
But Mr Amato's was just one of many warning voices in recent months.
European Community finance ministers issued the first jolt in May, when they
made an unusually strong call for Italy to take 'drastic and immediate'
action to get the budget back on track. Failing remedial action, the deficit
is now expected to reach L165,000bn this year against L152,000bn in 1991 and
an original 1992 target of L128,000bn.
Days later, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy,
demanded a rigorous austerity package to tackle the deficit and help Italy
meet the targets for convergence with other EC countries as laid down at the
Maastricht summit.
In what was seen as his b l e a k e s t statement since taking office 10
years ago, Mr Ciampi called for a major fiscal package to cut the projected
1992 deficit by an amount equivalent to 4 per cent of GDP on an annual basis
during the second half of this year. Only such harsh measures would help the
economy get back on the right path to meet the EC's convergence c r i t e r
i a for economic and monetary union. As matters stand, Italy passes just one
of the five criteria.
Moody's, the US debt rating agency, fired a further shot across the
government's bows last month. Having already downgraded Italy f r o m its
top-notch AAA borrowing status - the only G7 country to have been relegated
 -Moody's warned that the country's AA1 debt ranking was now itself under
review on account of insufficient progress in reducing the deficit and and
obstacles in the way of increasing fiscal receipts.
Fiscal packages introduced in 1991 have managed only to keep the public
sector deficit at 10.7 per cent of gross domestic product - the same level
as in 1990 - warned Moody's.
Meanwhile, current income and spending patterns suggest that f u t u r e
deficits will continue to rise in proportion to GDP. The deficit looks set
to exceed the 11 per cent level this year, while overall debt now totals 103
per cent of GDP.
It will be up to Mr Amato to convince the markets that the political will to
address the country's glaring economic problems is now in place.
Privatisation and pensions reform remain stalled, while state aid to
industry and to the economically-depressed south are still highly
contentious issues.
To some extent, he is starting at a disadvantage. The rise in interest rates
to protect the lira has pushed up the government's own debt charges, adding
a further twist to the d e f i c i t s p i r a l. Meanwhile, higher rates,
reaching just above 20 per cent for some smaller corporate customers, will
exacerbate the economic slowdown and postpone recovery.
Most observers doubt that GDP growth will exceed 1.6 per cent this year.
Neither have other economic indicators given much g r o u n d s for
optimism. May consumer prices climbed by 5.7 per cent on the year - a
welcome fall from the 6.7 per cent level in the same month last year. But
after having dropped to 5.6 per cent in the two previous months running,
thanks partly to stable or declining oil and raw material prices, inflation
now seems to be picking up again, casting doubts on official year-end
forecasts of a 4.5 per cent.
Labour costs, even if now growing more slowly than before, remain the major
source of concern. Unaffected by the employers' decision to block interim
payments due in May under the now-frozen scala mobile indexation system,
wage rises continue to outpace the increase in the cost of living.
After Mr Ciampi argued that incomes policy should be one of the priorities
for the new government, the Confindustria employers' federation wasted no
time in picking up his call, stressing the need to lower the number of
factors which influence the growth in wage costs. Among its proposals were
that indexation should be retained for only the lowest paid, and that wage
growth should be brought into line with European countries where inflation
is lowest.
Tripartite negotiations between the government, unions and employers on
reforming wage bargaining, which began this time last year only to be
suspended within weeks, are being resumed. However, it remains to be seen
whether the talks will be any more fruitful the second time around.
Meanwhile, Italy's trade balance has deteriorated sharply this year as
imports have outpaced exports. The development has been clouded in nominal
terms, but, adjusted for inflation, exports have been broadly static while
imports have continued to rise.
The worsening of the non- energy trade balance has been particularly
worrying, as it implies that domestic demand has been growing ahead of the
EC average - which may not be surprising in view of Italy's delayed economic
slowdown c o m p a r e d with many EC partners - and suggests a clampdown
may eventually be necessary. Meanwhile, the current account deficit climbed
to L26,200bn l a s t y e a r, equivalent to around 1.8 per cent of GDP,
against L17,600bn in 1990.
The overall economic outlook is hardly rosy. But among the few bright points
are steps being taken to improve at least the technical side of the
government's economic policy management. Following the 'divorce' of the
central bank and the Treasury earlier this year, the Treasury has taken
steps to build up its skills in economic policy forecasting and management
as part of its first big reorganisation in almost a century.
The changes include the appointment of outsiders to two of the Treasury's
five most senior bureaucratic positions. Bringing in academics and lawyers
to beef up the ministry will not solve Italy's economic problems overnight.
But it should at least give the new government a clearer idea of how serious
its difficulties now are.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (3): A sea-change in politics - Robert
Graham on the parties' prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STATE of the political parties in Italy has never been so confused and
fragmented as in the wake of the April 5 general elections.
These were the first elections since the breach of the Berlin Wall and the
subsequent collapse of communism. In Italian terms this had a particular
relevance because the behaviour of the main parties of government and
opposition had been heavily conditioned by Cold War considerations.
The ruling Christian Democrats in the last resort always relied on an
anti-communist platform, and, in the eyes of the influential Catholic
Church, this was the raison d'etre to call out the faithful in support.
The Communist Party (PCI) was the largest in western Europe and played the
role of the alternative in opposition, delicately juggling independence from
Moscow and deference to Marxist ideals.
Thus the rationale for these two dominant parties has been pulled from under
their feet. Stripped of their ideology, the Christian Democrats have proved
to be no more than a divided party united by a crude desire to enjoy the
fruits of power.
The PCI has disappeared, with most of its members transforming themselves
into a social democrat movement, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The
nostalgic rump split to form Reconstituted Communism. Torn between being an
opposition in reduced circumstances or joining government as a junior
partner, the PDS is directionless.
The effect of this sea-change can be gauged from the fact that in the 1976
elections these two parties accounted for 73 per cent of the vote. They
offered genuine alternatives of government and opposition. In the April
elections their combined vote shrank to 45 per cent and the choice had
ceased to be between two dominant parties.
These elections for Italy's 11th post-war legislature were fought virtually
without reference to programmes of government. Instead, the campaign boiled
down to a poorly co-ordinated claim by the outgoing coalition of Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals that they should be
allowed to continue governing. Ranged against them were some 14 parties. In
no formal sense were these an opposition because they were not organised as
such.
Nevertheless, for different motives they all wanted to prevent the coalition
from continuing.
Given that the outgoing Christian Democrat-led coalition was profoundly
discredited, the large protest vote was not surprising. Indeed, it was only
a surprise to the Christian Democrats because they were so out of touch with
reality, never imagining their vote could fall below 30 per cent.
The most spectacular instance of the protest vote was the success of the
populist movement, the Lombard League, which emerged as the second largest
party in northern Italy.
However, the league is not a transient phenomenon: rather, it reflects a
deeply-felt need, especially in the rich industrial north, for a political
party with a new moral ethos capable of making government work and devolving
power to the regions. Other parties did well, such as the newly-formed
Sicily-based la Rete (the Network), and the Greens for similar reasons.
The two long-running government partners, the Christian Democrats and
Socialists, more or less retained their vote in Rome and to the south; but
lost heavily in the north.
There is now a huge 15-point gap between the Christian Democrat vote of 24
per cent in the north and its 39 per cent in the south. In the south, the
corrupt client system of politics, fed by party-controlled state investment,
still has no rivals. There is a clear risk of the country being divided into
two political halves - a reformed north and a corrupt south.
The league's influence extends to Tuscany and Emilia Romagna and is
essentially a phenomenon of northern nationalism. The old communist
heartland of Emilia Romagna and Tuscany has switched its loyalties to the
PDS. This belt across north-central Italy remains politically sui generis
with its efficient small industries and legacy of competent local
administration by the left.
But the PDS, which cast itself as a new reformist party with a strong
commitment to clean up government, failed to convince the voters and lost
support to the league (which also adds to the difficulty of putting an
ideological tag on the movement).
If the outgoing four-party coalition stays together and there are no
dissidents, it can muster 331 votes - a majority of 16 in the Chamber.
However, given internal divisions and the April 5 protest vote against the
abysmal record of the previous government, the new Amato administration has
to seek broader cross-party backing.
Christian Democrats. Although their vote fell to 29 per cent, with 206
deputies (234 in 1987), the Christian Democrats remain the largest party.
has encouraged internal divisions and weakened the authority of key historic
figures such as Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister and Mr
Arnaldo Forlani. The latter's candidature for the presidency failed to gain
full internal backing, forcing him to resign as party secretary.
Squabbles over this post and the party's direction have paralysed decisions.
A broad division exists between those who favour institutional reform and
those who fear such reform will weaken the party's profitable grip on the
state apparatus.
The party also has to decide on its attitude to Mr Mario Segni, leader of
the referendum movement, whose reformist activities make him an increasingly
uncomfortable Christian Democrat.
Socialists (PSI). The Milan corruption scandal has profoundly damaged the
party's image and that of Mr Bettino Craxi, its leader. Developments in the
scandal could further compromise the party and encourage the anti-Craxi
faction. Poor election results with 13.6 per cent of the vote (14.3 per
cent) and 92 deputies have weakened the party's position as a coalition
partner. It remains socialist only in name and appears unable to establish a
dialogue with the PDS.
Liberals (PLI). The party's vote rose from 2.1 to 2.8 per cent against 1987
elections, with 17 deputies. Votes were won from Republican supporters and
its prestige enhanced. However, it remains a minor player in the four-party
coalition and its position is vulnerable under electoral reform.
Social Democrats (PSDI). Elections marked a further stage in the progressive
decline of the party, with the vote falling to 2.7 per cent (3 per cent) and
16 deputies. It survives by hanging onto the coat-tails of the Socialists
and Christian Democrats.
PDS. The party is going through an uneasy self-analysis, rocked by the
unresolved tensions of the metamorphosis from communism to ill-defined
social democracy. Also unresolved is whether the party should regard itself
as the natural focus of opposition, uniting the left. The position of Mr
Achille Occhetto as leader has been undermined by the 16 per cent vote in
April, returning 107 deputies. In contrast, the break-away grouping,
Reconstituted Communism, held the hard-core former PCI vote with 5.6 per
cent and 35 deputies. Whether this schism is temporary or permanent is still
unclear.
Italian Social Movement (MSI). These neo-fascist nostalgics no longer
benefit from the communist menace as a vote-catcher. Inability to adapt to
changing circumstances has added to the party's marginalisation, despite the
asset of its glamorous new deputy, Ms Alessandra Mussolini (grand-daughter
of Il Duce and niece of Sophia Loren). But with 5.4 per cent of the vote
(5.9 per cent) and 34 deputies, the MSI can be an important ally of the
government.
Lombard League. Under the fiery leadership of Mr Umberto Bossi, the league
is the main novelty in parliament with 55 deputies and 8.7 per cent of the
vote. Lack of experience is counter-balanced by a strong mandate from league
supporters to reform government. Although a federal movement with strong
local roots in each region of the north, electoral success has provided
cohesion.
Mr Bossi has promised constructive opposition but he also pledged to found a
'republic of the north' if Rome fails to address the league's grievances.
The Republicans (PRI). Under Mr Giorgio La Malfa this traditional party of
the intelligentsia can play a key balancing role in government. But the
party failed to gather the support it hoped for in the elections, the vote
rising from 3.7 to only 4.4 per cent with 27 deputies. This has weakened Mr
La Malfa's bargaining position and to retain credibility he may find it more
convenient to be in opposition to the government.
The Greens. The party continues to pick up a small share of the protest vote
 -2.8 per cent against 2.5 per cent in 1987. With 16 deputies and
credibility as environmentalists, the government is likely to court their
overt support. Similar considerations apply to La Rete. This party, formed
to fight regional elections in Sicily last year by Mr Leoluca Orlando, has
aspirations to a national following. It picked up 1.9 per cent of the vote
and 12 deputies.
Slightly more quixotic, but also potentially important in a narrow
parliamentary majority is the support of Mr Marco Panella's Radical
grouping. This veteran polemicist obtained 1.2 per cent of the vote and 7
deputies, and was influential in securing the candidacy of Mr Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro for the presidency.

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (1): Amato faces awesome task - The April
general elections, in which an unprecedented fragmentation of the political
parties complicated the formation of a new government, highlight the need
for political reform.  Without it, the main economic issues will be hard to
address
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON PRESENT form, Italy would find it hard to comply with even the most
benign interpretation of the demands for closer integrations laid down by
the Treaty of Maastricht.
The budget deficit has deteriorated during the course of the past six months
at an alarming speed. By the end of the year, it could be 11 per cent of
GDP, more than double that of its main EC partners. The deficit continues to
be financed by state borrowing and total debt is equivalent to 103 per cent
of GDP, more than 40 percentage points above the maximum permitted by
Maastricht.
Unless the treaty conditions are watered down, Italy has little more than
two years to achieve major corrections in its budget deficit and the overall
level of debt (roughly one third of all European debt). This is the awesome
task now facing the country's 51st post-war government as it struggles to
establish itself under Professor Giuliano Amato, the Socialist Party deputy
leader.
The government is based on the same four-party coalition of Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals as the previous one.
However, in the April general elections the coalition was badly bruised by a
large protest vote and its majority has shrunk to 16 in the 630-seat chamber
of deputies.
The new prime minister is an astute politician with a formidable intellect.
He is thoroughly familiar with the country's plight and his programme says
all the right things about tackling Italy's problems. He has singled out
four priorities - correcting the budget deficit, fighting organised crime,
introducing institutional reform and cleaning up public administration.
But the precarious nature of Mr Amato's majority, combined with the
increasing internal divisions among the parties, especially the Christian
Democrats and his own Socialists, will oblige him to fight for every
measure. Fresh elections are likely next year - if nothing else to
consolidate political and economic reforms which are being promised.
In the meantime, a weak coalition government must court unpopularity by
cutting public spending on pensions and welfare benefits, while freezing
public sector pay and transfers to local authorities. The politicians' track
record has been one of indecision, sleight-of-hand or simply moving the
goal-posts to preserve their privileges. Sceptics argue the prospect of
genuine reform is more remote in the wake of the general elections because
the parties are so much more fragmented and weakened by internal divisions.
However, the reverse side of this coin is that the very weakness and
divisions of the parties permit the government more room for manoeuvre.
Furthermore, pressure for change is now stronger, precisely because so many
of the country's political and economic structures have failed to adapt and
now lag behind the rest of Europe. The April elections demonstrated
conclusively that Italy's proportional representation system encourages
unstable coalition governments: 16 parties were returned to parliament, 12
of whom had less than 6 per cent of the vote and only one more than 20 per
cent.
Whether it be the political system, the law or public services such as
hospitals, the post and airports, Italy is at the bottom of the European
league. Businesses complain ever more loudly that Italy is losing
competitiveness because of the high cost and inadequacy of these services.
Ordinary Italians are simply fed up having to cope with a malfunctioning
state.
This sense of frustration is evident in widespread support for the
referendum movement - a movement that sees parliament as incapable of
legislating for reform and thus seeks to impose legislation through
referendums. As many as 10 referendums could be staged next year covering
changes in proportional representation to tightening environmental controls.
Disaffection with the system translated into a protest vote at the general
elections. As a result, the long-running hegemony of the Christian Democrats
has been seriously eroded and the political landscape redrawn by the
emergence of the populist Lombard League which has become the second largest
party in northern Italy.
The league is campaigning for devolution of power to the regions and a
complete overhaul of the 'partitocracy' - the incestuous relationship
between political parties and the state apparatus which has grown up over
the past four decades. The extent to which the parties have become entwined
with the state has been highlighted by the five-month-old Milan municipal
corruption scandal. Headed by the Socialists, the parties running the
municipal administration have illicitly financed themselves on bribes from
rigged contracts for a decade.
The affair has involved Italy's leading construction companies as well as
prominent politicians and continues to gather momentum with inquiries
spreading out from Milan to embrace much of northern Italy. Such corruption
has long been suspected and the real test of changing morality will be
whether the clean-up extends to Rome and further south where political
patronage buys votes and provides a safe umbrella behind which organised
crime prospers.
The will to act against organised crime has at last been stiffened by a
combination of the sheer scale of Mafia activities and the brazen challenge
to the state in the assassination in May of Mr Giovanni Falcone, the leading
anti-Mafia magistrate whose motor convoy was destroyed by a tonne of
explosives outside Palermo.
The Falcone killing accelerated the election of a successor to Mr Francesco
Cossiga as president. Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, an independent-minded
Christian Democrat lawyer, was not the obvious choice but was elected on a
broad cross-party alliance because he symbolised the public need for
political honesty and independence. Though a conservative, he is emerging as
a statesman determined to use his limited powers as head of state to the
full to promote reform of the country's ossified institutions.
The new government itself represents a transition between old and new
formulas. The stalwarts of government like Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times
prime minister and present in every administration for over four decades,
are no longer there. Of the slimmed down 24-strong cabinet, 13 are first
time ministers and six are 'technicians'.
External events and pressures have played an important part in forcing
change on Italy. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe has removed the
fundamental Cold War divide in Italian politics between a Christian
Democrat-led anti-communist majority and a Communist opposition. The
Christian Democrats have to find a new raison d'etre; while the powerful
Communists (PCI), deprived of their ideological prop, last year split
between a mainstream social democrat grouping, the Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS) and a nostalgic Marxist rump. Issues have overtaken ideology,
weakening the consistency of opposition in parliament and creating space for
new players.
Of equal importance, the demands of Brussels on Italy to conform with
Community norms have begun to have an effect. The Italian habit of approving
EC directives and then totally ignoring them is no longer so easy. Italy,
for instance, has been caught out overproducing milk and risks being
excluded from some of the benefits of agricultural reform. Subsidies to
industry are more difficult to conceal, transfers to the south are smaller
and deregulation is slowly coming onto the horizon in a number of services.
At a technical level, Brussels is providing the much-needed framework within
which economic and fiscal policy can be planned. The dictates of Maastricht
regarding inflation rates, levels of debt and budget deficit are still taken
seriously despite the uncertain impact of the Danish referendum. And where
the technicians operate in the management of the exchange rate the
commitment to the narrow band of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism is
fully observed - even at high cost to the reserves. Between April 1991 and
May 1992 defence of the lira has cost some L27,000bn.
The lira is near its floor of 765 against the D-mark and since April
short-term interest rates have moved to 15 per cent, a rise of nearly 3
percentage points since the elections. With inflation of 5.5 per cent, real
interest rates are almost 10 per cent and the situation becomes like the dog
chasing its tail: the debt stock increases as rates are raised to defend the
lira and pay for the deficit.
The present financial situation is clearly unsustainable and this in the end
should serve to concentrate the politicians' minds.

FT  06 JUL 92 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Nissan faces a hard
slog to lift profitability - The Japanese car manufacturer's change in
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 7th July 1992) appended to this article.
Nissan Motor's recently-inaugurated assembly plant in Japan's southern
Kyushu island, is, as the company likes to say, an engineer's dream - from
the flexible robots that can weld four different body models in succession,
to the computer controlled final assembly line, where vehicle chassis stop
precisely to allow robot installation of everything from engines to seats.
It is a vision of efficiency and competitiveness which, unfortunately, is
very much a goal for Nissan as a whole to achieve, rather than something to
sit back and enjoy. Nissan late last month installed a new board of
directors that will have to steer Japan's second largest car maker, fourth
largest in the world, through one of the most difficult periods in its
history.
Sales are sluggish, profits are plunging - down 71.8 per cent at the
operating level last year - and Nissan's debt is soaring, up to Y3,568bn
(Dollars 28.63), or 147 per cent of equity. The parent company operating
profit margin slipped to 0.08 per cent, and it was forced to sell securities
for a net gain of Y38.8bn to boost pre-tax profits.
As a result, Nissan is short of cash needed to fund investments for a badly
needed lift in productivity and, with its debt rating having been recently
lowered by Moody's, it will have to pay more for money it does raise in the
market.
Mr Tadashi Kume, who became chairman, made a hurculean effort to turn Nissan
round during his seven-year tenure as president. Nissan had been in decline
for years, with its 30 per cent share of the Japanese market gradually
slipping away to about 23 per cent. The company was often behind in both
style and technology and hampered by a difficult union relationships.
Mr Kume, however, managed to stop the rot. The settlement with the union
came mainly before he became president, but under his leadership Nissan
launched a design revolution in the Japanese car industry with a series of
cars that caught the public imagination.
'It is often said that Nissan is very bureaucratic, but I think we changed
this culture so that it it is more customer oriented and more open,' he
recently told the FT.
Nissan's domestic market share stabilised as a result, allowing the company
to participate fully in the rapid growth in the Japanese market at the end
of the past decade, although it failed to regain lost market share. The
company also never regained momentum in the US, where its product offerings
could not match the mass-market appeal of the Honda Accord or the Toyota
Camry, and sales there have been falling.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Mr Kume's successor, takes over at a difficult time
because the expensive effort to renew Nissan was only half complete when the
car industry slipped into recession last year.
Mr Kume spent money to develop new models, and while Nissan models on the
market grew from 39 in 1985 to 60 in 1991, average sales per model fell from
26,771 to 22,364.
It was late in the decade that Nissan began to renew production facilities,
and Nissan's capital spending tripled in three years until it reached
Y318.6bn in fiscal 1990. Nissan has opened three new assembly plants in the
past year - in Kyushu, in the US and the UK.
This surge in spending weighed heavily on Nissan's accounts last year in the
form of increased depreciation charges, which were Y134.4bn and expected to
rise this year.
In the middle of this difficult financial outlook, Mr Kume has been leading
a campaign to shift company strategy away from an all-out effort to increase
sales, to a renewed effort to improve profitability.
He says: 'In order to get higher profitability we have to place more
emphasis on features of the car or the qualities of the car, or good
service. In other words, the total management is more important and not just
the volume of sales.'
Mr Kume also believes Nissan needs to improve the quality of the sales
force, and, perhaps most important, reduce costs. 'We are not number one in
terms of labour productivity,' he admits.
Indeed, Mr Stephen Usher, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, calculates that
labour accounts for 8 per cent of operating costs at Nissan, compared with 5
per cent at Toyota. Closing the gap would bring Nissan huge financial gains.
Mr Tsuji, an engineer with extensive experience on the production side of
the business, will focus his efforts on squeezing costs on the factory
floor.
He said last Friday: 'We intend to thoroughly reduce the number of
components (used in a car) and also vigorously promote common use of parts
among different models. We intend to focus even greater emphasis on design
for manufacturability.'
With prospects for significant gains in the domestic market not encouraging,
Nissan is placing a lot of hopes overseas. Better performance mainly in
Europe last year helped boost Nissan consolidated pre-tax profits by 18.4
per cent to Y85.7bn.
Its Primera model, made in the UK, was a hit in continental Europe. Sales in
the UK should recover as the dealer network is re-established following the
break with its distributor last year.
Last month, the company began production of its Altima saloon in Tennessee.
Prospects for the car would be brighter if competition from established
models in the same sector by other makers were not so stiff.
Mr Tsuji is taking the reins of a company that is in far better shape than
it was for his predecessor. But between Nissan's huge debt, its low
profitability, and weak prospects for growth, the next year or two will be a
hard slog at best.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Turkish economy shows signs of growing malaise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN Istanbul district court in an unprecedented ruling recently granted
alimony to the wife of a well-known businessman in US dollars.
Loss of public confidence in the Turkish lira is the latest symptom of the
growing malaise afflicting Turkey's economy, as Mr Suleyman Demirel's
government fights to reduce inflation and contain the public deficit.
This week, the government faces the first test of its commitment to fiscal
austerity when it sets civil servants' salaries. The budget allows for a 13
per cent increase. But Mr Erdal Inonu, deputy premier, said the six-month
rise should be in line with inflation, running, on an annual basis, at about
70 per cent.
Over the next few weeks, farm-support prices will be announced and wage
negotiations start with the big public-sector unions. However, the outlook
is not altogether gloomy. First-quarter economic growth was over 6 per cent,
against under 1 per cent in 1991. Average public debt maturities on
government paper have increased from eight months to 19 months, easing the
government's interest burden.
But money supply has shown a worrying rise, with the treasury resorting to
short-term central bank credits. If a bill awaiting presidential signature
becomes law, the government will be able to borrow beyond the legal ceiling
of 15 per cent of the budget. Ms Tansu Ciller, chief economics minister, has
repeated her pledge to cut inflation to 42 per cent by year-end. But many
economists believe triple-digit inflation is possible, unless the government
brings in a major stabilisation strategy. Interest rates are holding up
obstinately, and corporate borrowers are paying over 100 per cent for
working capital.
Turkey's foreign exchange position should improve this summer, with
remittances from abroad and tourism. But with unions set for a new wage
round, and farmers seeking generous subsidies, monetary growth is likely to
renew pressure on the lira.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Michael Prowse On America: Time to rethink US federalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a recent trip to Oregon and California, I was prompted to think anew
about a principle that seems to exercise many minds in Europe. In
integrating the European Community, it is widely argued, political leaders
should try not to violate the principle of subsidiarity. What this means in
English is that decisions should be devolved to the lowest level of
government capable of handling them. To what extent does the US honour this
principle? And can Europe learn any lessons from the way the US divides
responsibilities between Washington and the states?
Historically, the US had a small federal government which mostly restricted
itself to functions which could not be performed by individual states - such
as national defence and foreign policy. It played little or no role in
social policy. As recently as 1929, federal expenditure was less than 3 per
cent of gross domestic product, or less than a third of state and local
spending.
In the past half century, two forces have disturbed this equilibrium. First,
state governments were overwhelmed by the economic distress caused by the
Great Depression. Led by Franklin Roosevelt, the federal government assumed
an array of new duties including sole responsibility for social security
(pensions) and joint responsibility for welfare and unemployment benefits.
A second phase of federal expansion occurred in the 1960s partly out of a
growing conviction that state governments were incompetent and unresponsive
to social needs. Led by Lyndon Johnson, the federal government took sole
responsibility for health care for the elderly, set up Medicaid, a joint
federal/state health scheme for the indigent, and unleashed a flood of
programmes to combat poverty, widen educational opportunities and enforce
civil rights.
Most of these interventions made sense at the time. But the justification
for Washington's continuing role in so many spheres now seems doubtful. For
one thing, the quality of state government has improved enormously. On my
travels I was repeatedly struck by the competence and dedication of state
officials. In Salem, Oregon, for example, Ms Jean Thorne, the articulate
head of the Medicaid programme, is chaffing at the arbitrary rules and
restrictions imposed from Washington. Under federal 'mandates' certain
categories of the poor, such as families with young children, are entitled
to the most expensive high-tech medicine while others, such as childless
single women, qualify for nothing.
A few blocks away, I found Mr Duncan Wyse sitting at a computer screen
planning the state's economic development. Sporting an MBA from Stanford
University, his role is to use business principles to improve the
effectiveness of public policy. As director of the Oregon Progress Board, he
has developed a series of precise economic and social targets known as
'benchmarks'. These are designed to provide concrete measures of the state's
progress towards its longer-term strategic goals. If Governor Bill Clinton
of Arkansas were to win the presidential race, something akin to Oregon's
benchmarks would probably be introduced on a national scale.
The renaissance of state governments suggests a rethinking of their role is
now overdue. (The Nixon and Reagan administrations made half-hearted
attempts to transfer duties to the states but achieved relatively little.)
One of the few analysts to come up with concrete proposals is Ms Alice
Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In 'Reviving the
American Dream', published last month, she argues that America's poor
performance in many fields reflects the blurring of state and federal
responsibilities.
She believes the states should assume full responsibility for what she calls
the US's 'productivity agenda'. By this she means all the policies - from
education, skills training, childcare, social services, industrial policy
and the modernisation of infrastructure - that have a bearing on
microeconomic productivity. The federal government should remain responsible
for macroeconomic policy (where the priority is to raise national savings by
cutting the deficit), pensions, and expand its role in health care.
The notion that the states must take the lead in enhancing US productivity
seems inherently plausible. The nation is so diverse that Washington-based
officials inevitably lack the necessary detailed knowledge of local economic
and social conditions. Ms Rivlin is also right to point out that states will
need more robust sources of revenue if they are to undertake new
responsibilities. Taking the fiscal arrangements of German Lander as a
model, she argues for new national taxes shared on a per capita basis among
the states.
Translated into Eurospeak, the message is clear: in the past 50 years the US
federal government ignored the importance of subsidiarity and took on many
duties that might have been better left to individual states. If Ms Rivlin's
programme were adopted, dozens of federal programmes could be profitably
axed. She may, indeed, be too cautious: many states or consortia of states
could quite easily assume full responsibility for managing health care.
Whether Congress and the White House will ever agree to hand back functions
(and revenue) to the states is, of course, doubtful.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Ian Davidson On Eurpoe: An American row in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The papers say there is a big chill in Franco-American relations. The
centre-piece in the story is a visit to Washington by Mr Roland Dumas, the
French foreign minister. The story says Mr Dumas had a difficult
confrontation with Mr James Baker, US secretary of state; they disagreed
about French ambitions for a European defence policy; to the point where
Baker asked Dumas point-blank: 'Are you for us or against us?'
It turns out this is an old story; but it keeps reappearing. The incident in
question took place nearly two months ago, and was duly reported at the
time. Other accounts followed sporadically. The same story was carried at
length in the New York Times again last week, freshened with up-to-date
embellishments. Some people in Washington must really want the world to know
that they are displeased with the French.
This disagreement has a long history. Friction over the defence of Europe
was a constant feature of the Cold war: the US insisted on an integrated
Nato alliance, President de Gaulle insisted on French independence.
But it seems extraordinary that it should still be going on today. The Cold
war is over, the Warsaw Pact has been disbanded, the Soviet Union has
disintegrated, and Nato has joint meetings with its former enemies. There
must be something irrational in constantly resuscitating these out-dated
quarrels.
Americans may think the French are doing their best to bring the old quarrel
right up to date. Nato is trying to make sense of a slimmed-down role, with
fewer forces and no enemy; but the French are making the job harder by
pushing ahead with a rival European Corps, in league with their German
friends.
In reality, of course, the Franco-German Corps is only a military symbol for
a political conflict, which is about the American role in Europe.
If defence becomes a lower priority, Nato becomes less central to
transatlantic relations, and America loses leverage. But if the Europeans
start to get together on defence, in the Western European Union, in the
Franco-German Corps, or under the Maastricht treaty, that is much worse for
the Americans who fear they will be marginalised. Who is to blame? The
French, of course, because they have always been unsound on Nato.
The US response so far has been to adopt the tactics of an old scold. They
have shrieked with indignation whenever the Europeans showed interest in a
purely European defence policy; and have demanded that Nato be pumped up
with important new tasks to sustain its central role.
This is not very clever. The Atlantic Alliance was first created, and then
held together for 40 years, solely by the overwhelming threat of attack by
the Soviet Union. That purpose was written into Nato's treaty, and there is
no consensus, nor even majority support, for re-writing the treaty to give
Nato new military missions.
The US has persuaded its allies that Nato can in future provide logistical
support for humanitarian tasks not written into the Treaty. But that is just
about as far as they will be able to go, and it does not give Nato a new
raison d'etre.
Sooner or later, it will be necessary to throw off these nostalgic regrets,
and analyse the transatlantic problem in terms of today's realities.
These realities can be simplified in three propositions. First, unless a
belligerent Russia rises from the ashes of the defunct Soviet Union, the new
security risks facing Europe and America will be different in kind from the
old, and need different responses.
Second, Europe and the US will have to co-operate in facing these new risks;
so they need a new frame of co-operation; but it must be a co-operation
between equals.
Third, the specific challenge in such co-operation is to find ways of
mobilising Germany as a full participant in the new security arrangements.
The terrible disorders in ex-Yugoslavia and various parts of the ex-Soviet
Union give some hints of the new security risks. Military force is not
necessarily the central response; yet it may be an element in a larger
strategy.
Nato cannot be the forum for a Euro-American strategy, because Europe will
not give it that task. The 12 EC members are committed to work on a common
foreign policy; they will not subordinate it to US domination in Nato.
Germany's size and position make it pivotal to any security arrangements in
central Europe; but history and the constitution constrain the exercise of
its new-found sovereignty. German participation is likely to be fullest, and
most constructive, if it takes place in a larger frame, and one which is not
essentially military; not Nato, therefore, but the European Community.
In other words, the US may be able to resolve the conundrum of its role in
Europe, only if it accepts the full implications of Nato's irreversible
decline, of Germany's sovereignty, and of the Community's ambitions for an
independent future.
This would mean a broad-based treaty of co-operation of equal partners,
between the US and the European Community. It may not be Washington's
preferred solution; but it must be better than having childish rows with the
French.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Economics Notebook: A blueprint for policymakers in a world
of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the leaders of the Group of Seven countries gather for their 18th world
economic summit in Munich today, it is a sobering thought that after 17 such
gatherings since 1975 the world economy seems as difficult to manage as
ever.
We are now a quarter of the way through the 1990s and the decade has so far
failed to live up to earlier expectations that it would be a period of good
economic performance. World growth has been feeble. Unemployment in the 24
industrialised nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development has jumped from less than 25m two years ago to around 30m today.
It remains to be seen whether last week's cut in the US discount rate to a
29-year low of 3 per cent can banish fears of a 'triple-dip' US recession.
The persistent failure of the UK economy to resume steady growth is
politically uncomfortable for Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr
Norman Lamont his chancellor, and promises to make this year's public
spending round extremely difficult. While the Bundesbank has suggested that
Germany, the summit host, may achieve growth of around 2.5 per cent this
year, there are fears in some G7 capitals that Japan's present economic
slowdown could turn into a recession.
In these circumstances, a recent book* on economic policies for the 1990s,
edited by two senior OECD officials, offers governments little comfort.
'While bad policy almost always results in bad performance - witness the
performance of central planning in the eastern European economies - good
policy can generally only permit, or at most encourage, good performance,'
they say.
Mr John Llewellyn, who now heads the private office of the OECD secretary
general, and Mr Stephen Potter, director of the organisation's important
country studies department, are in a strong position to make such judgments.
They have held senior posts at the OECD for 15 and 20 years respectively and
so lived and worked through all the changes of fashion in economic
policymaking over the past two decades.
Perhaps the most daunting lesson that they draw from their own research and
that of the book's other contributors is that supply side shocks should be
regarded by economic policymakers as a rule rather than an exception. In
their view, the relatively calm years of the 1950s and 1960s were an
aberration from the long-term norm and not a state to which the world
economy can easily return.
This means that policymakers, managers and employees must be prepared to
adapt constantly to unforeseen circumstances. Moreover, macro-economic and
micro-economic policies cannot be viewed in isolation.
To some extent, these lessons have already been taken on board. Policymakers
over the past decade have realised that structural policies which modernise
economies through deregulation and the elimination of rigidities are of
vital importance.
But it does no harm to remind policymakers that they have to be more
imaginative. Unemployment, for example, has become much more of a structural
phenomenon as old industries die and new activities emerge. In response,
governments should adopt (and some have adopted) so-called 'active' labour
market policies, which focus on increasing the incentives for the unemployed
to seek jobs or improving training rather than simply providing income
support. Although Mr Llewellyn and Mr Potter do not elaborate, the corollary
for displaced managers and employees is that they must be more willing than
before to 'get on their bikes' in search of work.
It may seem tough luck that so soon after the collapse of communism and the
discrediting of such doctrines as Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution,
the winners of the ideological battle should be condemned to a life of
permanent adaptation. But capitalism has always demanded such a price for
the rewards that it distributes. The difference today is that international
competition is so intense that the pain is felt sooner.
Accommodating that pain in the political structures of the industrialised
democracies is no easy task, however. The stalled Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks shows how difficult it is for governments to translate
good intentions into action when powerful vested interests are involved.
Another point underlined by Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD's secretary
general, in the foreword to the book, is that the market economy must offer
sufficient economic justice. 'Each must firmly believe that the
opportunities open to him and her are not unduly limited and efforts are
fairly rewarded.'
But what should governments do to secure better economic performance? The
book's editors have drawn up a checklist of five guiding principles for
policy.
Market forces have a key role to play. 'Although market failure can occur,
it is generally appropriate to start from the presumption that market-based
policies will lead to a stronger economy.'
Policies need to be sustainable so that people and businesses can base their
decisions on reliable and credible signals and be spared disruption caused
by changing policies in response to crisis.
Economies must be able to adjust to shocks.
Governments should aim for a balanced mix of policies. In a passage of some
relevance to the UK, they say: 'When objectives are numerous it makes no
sense to jettison any proven instruments, let alone place overwhelming
reliance on a single one.'
International co-operation is useful - the guidelines are easier to follow
if other countries follow them too.
Messrs Llewellyn and Potter admit that the list may seem uncontroversial.
The principles are already being followed to a considerable extent, they
admit. 'But there are numerous examples in recent history where economic
performance would have been better had they been accorded greater weight,'
they say.

Potter, published by Blackwell at Pounds 50.

FT  06 JUL 92 / S African leaders consider new offer on peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMONWEALTH offer to send a team of experts to help monitor violence and
facilitate the peace process is being considered by South Africa's political
leaders.
The initiative comes amid growing tension over the weekend as Mr Nelson
Mandela, the African National Congress president, again angrily rejected
President FW de Klerk's offer of a meeting. Further details also emerged of
ANC plans for 'mass action' designed to make the government capitulate to
demands for majority rule.
The Commonwealth initiative was set in train during the visit to South
Africa last week by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary-general,
in the course of talks with Mr de Klerk, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader
of the Inkatha Freedom party, and Mr Mandela.
It envisages a group of eminent Commonwealth figures, backed by a small
number of senior military and police advisers, helping to reinforce the
country's existing National Peace Accord, assist in any new measures
designed to curb violence, while also having a potential role as
intermediaries.
The NPA, signed last September by 29 organisations including the government,
ANC and Inkatha, already offers a framework for the resolution of political
violence - provided it is backed by the political will, hitherto lacking.
Among other measures, it provides for a network of regional and local
'dispute resolution committees' with which a Commonwealth team could liaise.
Chief Anyaoku has been in contact with the NPA secretary, Mr John Hall.
The initiative also seizes on an apparent opening contained in Mr de Klerk's
memorandum to Mr Mandela last Thursday, a reponse to the ANC leader's own
document explaining why constitutional talks had been suspended. Mr de Klerk
suggested a meeting at which the agenda would include 'the advisability of a
joint monitoring body through which the three parties could act to defuse
and solve problems that could give rise to violence'.
In what is seen by western diplomats as a key sentence, the memorandum went
on: 'The role of the international community in an observer capacity could
be considered, especially in relation to this item.'
South Africa's leaders are now studying a document outlining the
Commonwealth proposal, which Chief Anyaoku discussed with Commonwealth
ambassadors on Friday.
Diplomats who attended the briefing confirmed that a Commonwealth effort to
break South Africa's political deadlock was under way, but were cautious
about prospects for success.
Chief Anyaoku said on his departure for Nairobi from Johannesburg yesterday
that 'stalled negotiations need to be reactivated in an appropriate way and
the stumbling blocks addressed quickly by all concerned', but did not
elaborate.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Japanese employees find it pays to stop smoking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies have found the perfect way to persuade workers to stop
smoking - pay them.
Even though Japanese are among the heaviest smokers in the industrialised
world, some companies have found their employees are ready to stop the habit
in return for a little extra cash in their pay packets.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare is so impressed with the results that it
has published a report praising the companies' efforts and encouraging
others to follow suit.
The ministry's star performer is Yoshioka Kogyo, a machine tool company,
which started its no-smoking campaign in 1968 after the chairman fell
seriously ill and decided to stop smoking himself. None of the 44 staff now
smokes at work or anywhere else. They receive bonuses of between Y7,000
(Dollars 56) and Y40,000 (Dollars 320) a month.
The payments increase with seniority, perhaps because older workers are
considered to be under greater pressure than younger colleagues. The company
says four or five people went back to smoking about six years ago. But their
co-workers persuaded them to stop.
Nabitasu, an engineering company with 124 employees, found that monthly
bonuses of Y3,000 a head were not enough. So last December it introduced a
Y100,000 one-off payment to any smoker who signed a pledge to give up
cigarettes. Half the 50 smokers immediately put away their Mild Sevens,
Japan's most popular brand. Only one went back on his word and had to return
the money.
Chuetsu Tekko, a building company, introduced its bonus last year. It
offered to pay Y10m towards any project chosen by the 60 employees if they
gave up smoking. All but eight stopped and Chuetsu is now building a company
holiday house.
Companies say they benefit from the schemes as much as their workers. Nihon
Densan, a maker of electrical machines, obliges employees who have signed
the pledge to wear 'no-smoker' badges once they give up. It says that as
well as improving the health of its staff, the no-smoking campaign has cut
the risk of fires and boosted the company's image.
So-called 'image-up' measures are important to Japanese companies,
particularly small businesses and others which find recruitment difficult. A
no-smoking campaign may be just enough to catch the eye of a potential
recruit.
Some 36 per cent of adult Japanese smoke, but the Japanese are
health-conscious and anti-smoking campaigns are slowly gathering force.
Last month ministers gave up smoking during cabinet meetings for a week to
mark a World No-Smoking Day organised by the World Health Organisation.
However, they were not paid for their self-discipline.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Maxwell pension claims backed: Lord Goodman calls on
government to assume 'full responsibility'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, ANDREW JACK and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is being urged by Lord Goodman, the prominent solicitor, to
assume full legal responsibility for pursuing claims on behalf of Maxwell
pensioners.
Under Lord Goodman's proposals, the government would undertake to meet the
pension entitlements of the Maxwell pensioners. In return the pensioners
would assign to the government their rights over any of the missing pension
fund assets.
In a letter to Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, Lord Goodman
says his proposal is 'the most economical and only just solution'. The final
cost to the government would be limited to the value of any assets it was
unable to recover.
Although the letter was written in a private capacity, it follows an earlier
private submission to the minister by Lord Goodman and follows extensive
consultation with interested parties, including pensioners, at a time of
continuing public pressure on the government over the Maxwell affair.
Lord Goodman comments on the considerable differences between the positions
of the members of the different funds, and between the resources of their
employers 'so that the various administrators are having to spend inordinate
time and money in sorting out the respective claims and liabilities.'
Lord Goodman also urgently calls on the government to allow the pensioners
to see the full Investment Management Regulatory Organisation and Securities
and Investments Board reports, because 'without this they are surely denied
the proper oppor-tunity to prove their case at law'.
Lord Goodman suggests that the new government trust headed by Sir John
Cuckney to solicit contributions on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners could
have its powers expanded to enable it to take on, on behalf of the
government, the management of the pensioners' rights of legal action.
A report by the SIB confirms that the board had considered scrapping Imro
because of the way it regulated the fund management companies at the centre
of the Maxwell pensions fraud involving more than Pounds 400m, but had
decided against. Instead, it recommends 'appropriate strengthening.'
The SIB said yesterday that a date had yet to be fixed for the publication
of Imro's self-critical report into the Maxwell affair.
The Treasury meanwhile was still seeking 'clarification' of certain aspects
of the report.
Mr Neil Cooper, of accountants Robson Rhodes, liquidator of Bishopsgate
Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds,
yesterday called on the government to make the full SIB and Imro reports
available to both liquidators and the trustees of the pension funds.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Prescriptions for world prosperity: Structural approach -
Leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialised states meet in Munich
this week. Four senior economic ministers set out their contrasting views on
the micro-economic and structural challenges facing the former states of the
Soviet Union, eastern Europe and the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KOZO WATANABE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the first international economic summit in 1975, the event has
functioned as the dais from which the leading western industrialised
countries demonstrated their unity in the face of the communist threat.
However, the end of the Cold war has begun to transform the summit into a
forum where economic matters of the whole world including the former
communist bloc are discussed.
In this post-Cold war era, the discussions on the ways in which the G7 will
support structural economic reform in the former Soviet Union and eastern
Europe will, along with the talks on how to handle our own economic affairs,
be an important issue. In both cases, I wish to emphasise the importance of
a structural approach.
In order for the former communist countries to put forward economic reform
based on self-help, it is essential to develop an economic structure which
will enable their private sector to realise its potential through policies
in micro-economic fields such as the introduction of competition, the
conversion of military production facilities to civilian use, the
development of private companies and expansion of trade and investment.
Without developing such structures, whatever funds we dedicate will not
bring true economic reform. We will merely be forced to dedicate more and
more resources.
It is better to help someone achieve the ability to self-help than merely to
provide charity. To quote an old Asian saying: 'Teaching how to catch fish
is better than giving fish.'
The importance of structural economic reform - removing impediments to the
functioning of the free market and raising industrial productive capacity
and competition - is applicable not only to support for the former communist
bloc. The industrialised countries also have various problems of their own
that must be overcome in realising a more efficient and open economy.
To achieve strong and balanced growth the summit members must not only adopt
growth-oriented fiscal and monetary policies but also proceed aggressively
with structural reform.
To facilitate structural economic reform a strengthening of the
international institutional framework is essential. At the ministerial-level
meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in
May, I proposed 'multilateral structural reform talks' and emphasised the
importance of tackling our structural problems together. Furthermore,
efforts by each country to improve its competitiveness are essential to the
realisation of ever higher levels of competition.
Business groups should also develop international co-operation and work
together to develop new technologies and industries. Japan is promoting
various trade and industry-related co-operation measures with European
countries in search of the best balance between competition and harmony.
In recent years, there has been an increased awareness that structural,
micro-economic policies, together with macro-economic strategies, are
important in achieving sustained growth of the world economy. I hope that at
this summit the importance of structural reform in both areas - economic
policies of G7 states and the economic reform of the former communist bloc -
will be reconfirmed and a consensus be reached on the direction of future
economic policies.

When Isle of Man accountant Geoffrey Brew - a prosecution witness in a
forgery case - was challenged by defence counsel as to why he had opened a
Swiss bank account when there are so many banks near his home in the Isle of

The run-up to this month's Olympics is proving to be just as tricky for
athletic footwear makers as for the athletes they are sponsoring.
It will need some fancy footwork if the sneaker advertisers' heavy
investment in great names who stumbled in the race to Barcelona is going to
be protected.
The collapse of Reebok's Dan-and-Dave advertising battle to find the world's
greatest athlete - Dan O'Brien flunked his pole vault trial - has been the
most dramatic upset. But there are plenty of other advertisers who don't
seem to be getting value for money.
Sports shoe maker Nike can be forgiven for feeling let down by German
sprinter Katrin Krabbe and her colleagues. Having loyally stood behind them
during accusations that they fiddled their drug tests, Nike now finds Krabbe
et al have decided to skip the Olympics despite being cleared.
Meanwhile, Japanese running shoe maker Mizuno has had to scale back its Carl
Lewis advertising campaign, after the superstar failed to make it into the
US sprint team.
With prices of some sports shoes being slashed by up to 40 per cent,
vulnerable European companies like Adidas and Hi-Tec must be hoping that
bigger rivals, like Nike and Reebok, will start dumping some of their
expensive advertising stars, rather than just their surplus stock.
If they don't watch out Nike and Reebok may soon be entered into the
Marketing Hall of Shame along with some other famous losers.

Britain's 14-year-olds will soon be facing compulsory examinations on
Shakespeare. But how many will ever reach the proficiency shown by the
unknown Portuguese official who drafted the traditional valedictory telegram
to the UK government on its assumption of the presidency of the European
Community last week?
'The unique experience of a first presidency can be described in many ways,'
it said.
'Some may believe it is like a tempest, others that it is much ado about
nothing. We refrained from applying measure for measure and sought to
prevent EPC (European Political Co-operation) from ever looking like a
comedy of errors. When we began our presidency in January the next six
months seemed like a winter's tale and July was a distant midsummer's night
dream.
But today we can truly say that all's well that ends well and hope we did it
as you like it.'
Admittedly, no mention of Hamlet, or something being 'rotten in the state of
Denmark'. But perhaps Downing Street can make up for that when it pens its
own note to the Danes, when it is their turn to take over the presidency
next January.

Hello, good morning and welcome back. It was rather surprising to read two
long and flattering centre page features about the same media star, David
Frost, the day after each other in The Independent on Saturday and The
Independent on Sunday.
The kind interpretation is that the clash demonstrates the robust editorial
independence of the supposedly integrated stable-mates. Even so, it tends to
make some investors nervous when one side of the business is not telling the

The bust-up at BP, following hard on the heels of the Cadbury report on
corporate governance, has turned the spotlight on the increasingly slim
number of big companies which still combine the job of chairman and chief
executive.
It's a practice that some of the UK's largest institutional shareholders
have been railing against for years. Indeed, among the most outspoken is
none other than Postel, the Pounds 20bn pension scheme of the Post Office
and British Telecom, Britain's biggest company.
Slightly odd then that the PO and BT both have chairmen - Sir Bryan
Nicholson and Iain Vallance - who combine the roles. Postel's official
position is that it doesn't like to see a single charismatic individual
holding down both roles.
So, what does this judgment tell us about Mr Vallance and Sir Bryan?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Provided President Heseltine coughs up Pounds 100,000 or so, we may soon see
a practical test of the Law of Economists' Equilibrium. It states that for
every economist holding any given view, there'll be another holding
precisely the opposite.
The project originates with Paul Ormerod, economics chief at the Henley
Centre research group. He plans to get Britain's foremost dismal-scientists
to spell out their personal rules for making forecasts, then stick all the
formulae into a capacious computer.
He hopes the resulting omelette of economic egg-heads will produce
predictions that are appreciably more reliable than the cock-ups apt to
result when individual economists peer into the future.
A trial of the in-put stage has already been held with the aid of the London
Business School's amiable chief forecaster Geoffrey Dicks. The reason he was
chosen is apparently that his mind works in a way that is easy for a
computer to understand - besides which it nary matters that London Business
School has been among the least accurate of forecasters lately.
Other luminaries who've shown interest include Treasury chief economist Alan
Budd. So, given funding from Michael Heseltine's trade and industry
department, the project should go ahead.
If it does, and the equilibrium law holds good, the net result will of
course be nothing whatever.

In the '30 glorious years' which followed the end of the second world war,
the world enjoyed a period of almost uninterrupted growth. Then came the oil
crises of the early and late 1970s, with their attendant disruption: massive
unemployment, inflation and budgetary deficits and a currency war. Relative
stability was replaced by uncontrolled change.
Towards the end of the 1970s, the perplexity of the professional economists
was matched by the inability of the governments of the developed countries
to produce a co-ordinated response to the world's economic difficulties. In
the absence of a solution, they came up with a declaration of intent: only
market forces could cleanse the sins of a world which was too
interventionist, over-regulated and burdened with too much debt.
Fortunately, the governments involved, including those whose public
pronouncements were coloured by ideology, demonstrated a high degree of
realism and pragmatism.
So it was that, throughout the 1980s, the seven leading industrialised
nations tirelessly devoted their energies to bringing order to the chaos in
exchange rates and financial markets. The Plaza and Louvre agreements of
1985 and 1987, which stabilised the exchange rates between the world's
strongest currencies, the third-world debt crisis which has been brought
under control but not resolved, and the rapid and effective response to the
1987 stock market crash will all leave their mark on history. The risk of
having a 'casino economy' running totally out of control was averted, thanks
to an active policy of international co-operation.
Can we stop there? Clearly the answer is 'no'. The list of challenges facing
the world economy is daunting. Many politicians, businessmen and trade
unionists in Germany, Japan, Great Britain and France believe that the
priorities have changed. The 1990s will be the decade of enterprise, of
micro-economics and the production system; in other words, it will be
largely dominated by industry, in contrast to the pre-eminence of finance in
the previous decade.
Technological progress, protection of the environment, the changing face of
labour relations, work sharing in the rich countries and wealth sharing
between rich and poor countries, the safety of nuclear power stations and
the flow of investment into the countries of eastern Europe will be the most
important issues in the years ahead. There is only one possible approach to
these problems: international economic co-operation must be extended to
cover all these areas.
It may surprise some people to learn that so many of us, from such different
ideological backgrounds, share the conviction that it is absolutely vital to
regulate the 'real' economy. But should we not be paying as much attention
to environmental matters, strategic manufacturing, unemployment or economic
reform in eastern Europe, as to the topic which dominated discussion in the
past: exchange rates?
No one is foolish enough to believe that agreement on the problems will
produce agreement on the solutions. The content of the co-operation package,
even more than its form, will emerge from a confrontation of viewpoints
which will sometimes be divergent, if only because national interests do not
always coincide. But whatever the difficulties presented by industrial
co-operation, we know it can be achieved. National experience offers a
wealth of examples - the Keiretsu industrial groups and co-operative
agreements maintained under the aegis of Japan's ministry of trade and
industry, links between industry and the banks in Germany, military and
space programmes in the US.
The progress of the economies of Europe, the US and Japan is at stake.
Today, industrial co-operation is more necessary than ever, throughout the
world, to ensure the development of sectors which are essential to world
growth and which will not be nurtured by market forces alone.

The discussions which will attract most attention in Munich will be those
about the integration of Russia, and/or the rest of the former Soviet Union
and eastern Europe, into the political and economic structures of the west.
The debate will be concerned with the macroeconomic policies to be applied
in Russia, the financial assistance which can be supplied by the west and
the role of international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund.
But that is not the whole story. The Russian economy will never recover
unless its industry is restructured to respond to market needs and to
produce the goods which consumers at home and abroad want to buy when they
want to buy them. Equally, western markets need to be open to those goods
which Russia can produce and sell competitively.
In fact, open markets are vital to all our economies. As president of the UK
Board of Trade, it is my priority to do whatever I can to help British
industry win business all over the world. But when it comes to trade,
Britain's national interest is one and the same as that of any other
country. We all have a common interest in trade liberalisation, in ensuring
open markets in which everyone can compete. Without competition, we
stagnate; we all lose.
Open trade and competition are not simply philosophical or political
subjects for sterile debate. Their benefits are experienced by all of us
every day. In the high street, consumers have the choice to buy the goods
and services they want. They get better quality and value for money. And
providers of goods and services benefit from the opportunities of one large
free market.
That is what the single European market is all about. More than 90 per cent
of the measures originally identified as necessary for its completion have
been agreed. During the UK presidency of the European Community, we shall
ensure the process is completed. And when it is completed, it must be made
to work. There must be no wall around Europe that would deny us the benefits
of competition throughout the world's markets.
Some people say the only countries that really benefit from trade are the
industrialised nations of western Europe, North America and Japan - the rich
north; it does not help the developing nations of the south. This is not so.
Of course, no one can deny the ever growing need for aid on humanitarian
grounds; such needs cannot be in dispute. But that is a separate issue. The
real key to growth and development in the poorer countries is for them to be
able to sell their products in a sympathetic trading climate.
That brings me to the Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiations. A successful
conclusion to the round, through its impact on world trade, will do more for
the developing countries than the whole of the EC's overseas aid budget. A
GATT round deal is within easy reach; we must not let it slip from our
grasp.
The same principle applies to the development and stabilisation of eastern
and central Europe. Certainly we must provide economic and technical help.
But ultimately, democracy and efficient market economies will flourish only
as part of an international market free of barriers to trade, where healthy
competition is the engine of efficiency, innovation, quality and choice.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Arts: Il viaggio a Reims - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This piece d'occasion was devised by Rossini to celebrate the 1825
coronation of Charles X, allowed to disappear into obscurity immediately
afterwards and then re-discovered after a gap of nearly 160 years.
The first ever Royal Opera production has been mounted to mark several
milestones. One is the composer's own 200th anniversary, which fell on
February 29. (In the opera's finale, originally a hymn to Charles X, the
name of Rossini replaces the king's in Balocchi's libretto and on the
singers' lips, while his bust set atop a circling globe descends from the
flies.) Another is the start of Britain's tenure of the EC presidency. A
third is the launch of the six-month-long, cross-Britain European Arts
Festival linked to the presidency; the festival administration sponsored
Saturday's big screen relay in the Covent Garden piazza.
These are all worthy ventures, significant occasions in their own right, so
it is painful to have to report that three hours and 15 minutes of the most
god-awful tomfoolery are being dished up for their benefit. In brief, the
work is reduced in John Cox's production and Mark Thompson's designs to a
series of bone-achingly tedious farcical sketches; the peculiar beauty,
verve, charm and delicacy of the music are positively scarred by the stage
routines.
The excitement of the Viaggio a Reims re-discovery lay in large part in the
delighted recognition that the cantata scenica was no sample of 'occasional'
artificiality but a fabulous piece of Rossinian compositorial ingenuity and,
furthermore, a light-as-air comic divertissement, set in a spa hotel, with
two substantial linked purposes at its core. These were the celebration of
the coronation via the singing powers of ten of the Italian vocal virtuosos
of his day; and the creation of a vision of human peace, concord and harmony
that makes the work at once historically special and universal.
Covent Garden have undertaken their interpretation of these purposes with
perfect wrongheadedness. The casting of the ten principal roles is, to put
it bluntly, inadequate; and the light-as-air comedy is transmogrified into a
tacky hotel caper firmly rooted in tired musicals and telly spectaculars
equally.
There are two John Coxes. Jekyll-Cox is a civilised and intelligent producer
capable (in the Glyndebourne Capriccio and ENO Cosi) of elegant ensemble
performance. Hyde-Cox is a farceur capable (in the Glyndebourne Cenerentola)
of the most coarse-grained vulgarity.
The Viaggio producer is Hyde-Cox, inventor of a string of much-repeated
sight-gags: the exercising spa-patron gag, the dancing bellhops in yellow
gag, the revolving door gag, the hooped petticoat gag, the hat gag, the
apple gag, the English milord with his Scots flautist (]) gag, the St
Trinian schoolgirls in specs with bowls of flowers gag, the luggage gag, the
can-can gag, the Danish flag gag, and so on and on and on. (There is no
Maastricht gag: some mistake surely . . .)
The idea that the notes and words could serve as the opera's dramatic
vehicle seems not to have entered Cox's head. The costumes are loudly
coloured, extravagantly cut and typescreaming 'Comic Character]' so
frenetically that any effort at wit or vivacity of delivery on the part of
the people inside them is rendered entirely nugatory.
My guess is that people who come to know the opera through this first Covent
Garden staging - rather than through the 1984 DG 'premiere' recording or the
Guildhall School's enchanting 1987 student production - will come to wonder
why the company wasted time, energy and money on tackling it at all. After
the Guildhall performance I wrote that it seemed 'likely to leave (at least)
one London Rossinian with a blissful smile on his face for days afterwards';
that the opposite can confidently be predicted of this Covent Garden
experience is perhaps the greatest outrage of all.
Two of the ten principal singers might be called native Rossinians (though
both seem some way beyond their best singing days): Della Jones as Melibea
and Montserrat Caballe as the hotel patronne. Mme Caballe indulges in an ad
lib relationship with the audience that begins amusingly but soon turns
embarrassing; I feel sorry that this undignified, vocally fragile appearance
may well provide the house with its final memories of one of the century's
great singers.
The rest can be catalogued as follows: one tenor (John Aler) of at least
neat, musicianly vocal style, two sopranos (the gorgeous-toned Renee
Fleming, the gently musical Sylvia McNair) who might in other circumstances
have been guided to less unconvincing Rossini vocal manners, one hugely
promising bass (Alastair Miles) no less ill-served - and a group of
admirable Anglo-Saxon singing-actors entirely out of their Fach.
The fact that there are no Italians in the cast is a general error and a
particular weakness in the case of the buffo roles. The conductor, Carlo
Rizzi, is Italian, and a trimly energetic musician - but also an unloving
one, who rushes the ensembles unmercifully and who finds neither grace nor
gaiety in Rossini phrasing. The Royal Opera have offered a run of
high-quality performances this season. Sad that it should be broken, and the
season concluded, with this absolute turkey.
Sponsored by Friends of Covent Garden; in repertory until July 17.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Arts: A business partnership - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Arts sponsorship is more effective than advertising - we have measured it.'
Geoff Shingles is chairman of Digital, the computer company, and the most
committed corporate sponsor of the arts in the UK. Despite a difficult
trading year, which has led to redundancies, Digital has raised its
sponsorship budget in 1992 by 10 per cent to Pounds 550,000. 'But on top of
that', says Shingles, 'you must spend Pounds 1.50 on promotion and
entertainment to make every Pounds 1 work'.
Digital spends the money other companies invest in corporate advertising on
arts sponsorship. It started in 1986, when it came to the aid of a
beleaguered Sadler's Wells (nothing changes) and chose dance as an
under-exploited arts form with which it could make a big impact.
The focus on dance continues, but Digital has diversified into supporting
the theatre, especially the Royal National, and the visual arts, with a
touring Turner exhibition.
Shingles does not regard Digital's support as altruistic. 'Sponsorship is a
straightforward business decision. When I'm criticised for paying the wages
of dancers while computer staff are losing their jobs I say that by
supporting the dancers I'm saving more jobs at Digital.'
Quite simply Digital has used dance in particular to meet the key personnel
that are influential in buying its systems. It targetted 8,000 of them in
1986 and has now had the opportunity - through sponsorship - to meet over
6000 in agreeable surroundings. 'I reckon it has worked out at around Pounds
1,000 a contact'. Some of those contacts have led to profitable new
business.
Digital UK's success with the arts has been taken up by Digital companies in
Europe. Next month 140 young musicians gather in Luxembourg to rehearse for
the summer tour of the European Community Youth Orchestra. This year the
ECYO is in over-drive, visiting eleven countries, culminating on New Year's
Eve at London's Barbican for a special concert to mark the opening of the
Single Market.
The ECYO is backed by the European Commission, and member countries, but its
main cash lifeline is Digital, which has increased direct backing from
Pounds 70,000 in 1987 to Pounds 700,000 for this tour. By the end of 1993
the company will have invested Pounds 2.5m in the orchestra, plus an even
larger sum devoted to support services.
The aim is the same - entertainment opportunities. Last December, Digital
guided the ECYO to Russia, to help it meet the right people as it
established offices in Moscow and St Petersburg. 'Music is a common
currency. Its image is universal', says Shingles, something which cannot
always be said of advertising.
Of course there is also a promotional spin off. The company's name has
become better known through the sponsorship and it feels that by backing a
range of dance, including contemporary, rather than a safer arts form, its
image is seen as livelier than that of the competition.
In the last ten years Digital has doubled its market share. Shingles is not
soft hearted about sponsorship. 'Things run their course. I tell the arts
companies 'this is not philanthropy; not charity, but a business
proposition'.' So the time will come when Digital explores other avenues.
Indeed, it is having a brain-storming session to drum up new ideas this
month. But in the UK it is committed to the end of 1994 and it would be
surprising if Digital abandoned its reputation as a partner of the arts.
British Telecom must be the most cultivated sponsor in the country:
cultivated by worthy causes that is. It is a dull arts outfit, to say
nothing of sports club, charity, hospital, etc., that does not want to lay
its hands on a little of the company's Pounds 3bn annual profit.
BT devotes half of one per cent of this, around Pounds 15m, to good causes.
The arts has just gained another chunk through a Pounds 1m, over three
years, sponsorship of the National Touring Exhibitions, organised by the
South Bank Centre on behalf of the Arts Council.
The touring exhibitions, which bring great art to small towns, started
during the second world war in an effort to raise morale. Currently on the
road, in Jarrow, is 'Ready, Steady, Go', paintings of the 1960s. Forthcoming
attractions include 'Flora Photographica', a show of flower photographs.
The BT money will help to promote over 60 touring exhibitions in the next
three years, with the aim of raising awareness - and audiences. It is BT's
largest arts sponsorship and sits alongside its much criticised 'New
Contemporaries' shows.
As well as national penetration, educational projects retain their appeal to
sponsors. RTZ Corporation has just announced one of the largest schemes,
embracing five institutions - Guildhall School of Music, Royal College of
Art, the Royal Academy of Arts, Lilian Baylis Youth Dance Company, and the
Centre for Young Musicians - and extending over three years. Each group will
receive Pounds 60,000. The money will be mainly devoted to scholarships and
masterclasses and, in the case of Lilian Baylis, the creation of a new youth
dance company.
In addition, the five will pool their talents in October for a week long
arts festival at St James's Piccadilly to showcase their work. This will
cost a further Pounds 70,000, of which Pounds 40,000 comes from the Business
Sponsorship Incentive Scheme.
BMW is one company planning to increase its sponsorship budget - currently
around Pounds 50,000 - next year. Its aim is to cover the country with
prestige events that its distributors can use for entertaining clients.
The next will be at the King's Theatre Edinburgh in September. BMW is
putting up the Pounds 10,000 needed to make viable the Royal National
Theatre's week-long visit with The Madness of George III, starring the award
winning Nigel Hawthorne.
McDonald's is putting up Pounds 45,000 to sponsor Dick Whittington, the
Christmas panto at the Nottingham Playhouse. It is believed to be largest
ever sponsorship of a pantomime.
The Playhouse is also boosted with Pounds 100,000 from Home Brewery to
support its next two seasons. This follows on from the Pounds 50,000 that
the local Home Brewery gave the Playhouse in 1991.

successor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAVOURITE: David Newlands
The 45-year-old Scottish finance director fills the shoes of Sir Kenneth
Bond, Lord Weinstock's right-hand man during the the 1960s. He is being
groomed for the top. He used to work for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising
agency, and became closely acquainted with GEC as the accountant at Touche
Ross handling its accounts. Mr Newlands has taken an increasingly high
profile at budget meetings. Institutional shareholders like him.
THE DEPUTY: Malcolm Bates
He works in the adjoining office to Lord Weinstock, often negotiating the
detail of contracts and acquisitions. The stockily built 58-year-old became
Lord Weinstock's deputy in 1983, but is thought unlikely to succeed him. He
was managing director of Delta, the British engineering group, before
joining Labour's Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the late 1960s. He
joined GEC in 1976. Studied at Harvard and Warwick University before going
into industry.
THE CENTRI
Ron Artus
The 60-year-old former group chief investment manager of the Prudential,
GEC's largest shareholder, joined the board in 1990. He will play a pivotal
role in deciding the succession, liaising between the board and
shareholders. Analytical and independent, he shares Lord Weinstock's
interest in classical music, collects English watercolours and is a lifelong
cricket fan.
THE SCION: Simon Weinstock
Lord Weinstock's 40-year-old son looks more like his father the older he

FT  06 JUL 92 / Management (GEC At The Crossroads): Preparing for life after
Lord Weinstock - Part one, The board is lining up to take one of the biggest
decisions in the company's history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A CORPORATE timebomb is quietly ticking away on the desk of Lord Prior, the
chairman of General Electric Company. It will be his job to make sure it
does not explode.
The explosive issue is the succession to the man who has been the driving
force behind the company for more than 30 years, its architect, creator and
managing director, Lord Weinstock.
Finding a successor to Lord Weinstock, who will be 68 next month, will be
the one of the most significant decisions in GEC's history.
He is the linchpin of the company's senior management. He has occupied the
seat of power at GEC as the chairmen and managing directors of other
companies have come and gone. His reign has lent GEC a stability unrivalled
in British industry.
Yet behind the scenes there are sharp divisions between GEC's management and
some of its directors, and between the executives and institutional
shareholders over how the company should develop and how the succession
should be decided.
It is Lord Prior's job to prevent the search for a successor turning into a
power struggle that could destabilise the group. The conduct and outcome of
that process will not just affect GEC. The company is a central pillar of
the UK manufacturing establishment; what happens to it matters to the rest
of British industry.
Since the youthful Arnold Weinstock became GEC's managing director in 1961
he has transformed it from an ailing electrical group into one of Britain's
largest manufacturing companies.
It has a stock market capitalisation of about Pounds 6bn, annual sales of
Pounds 9.4bn and pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 829m, generated by 277
subsidiaries which employ about 118,000 people. Only last week GEC unveiled
a 1 per cent rise in profits and a 5 per cent rise in dividends at a time
when rivals are seeing profits vanish.
Its interests stretch from radars and torpedoes to petrol pumps and weighing
machines. It sells power stations in China and frigates to Malaysia. It
makes telephone exchanges in Liverpool and refrigerators in Peterborough.
The group is the custodian of much of Britain's technological heritage: from
Marconi's original work on radar and radio and Whittle's work on jet engines
to most of the UK's expertise in telephone equipment and much of the
post-war British computer industry.
Lord Weinstock led GEC to its dominance of the UK's engineering, electronic
and telecommunications industries through a string of daring takeovers. The
foundation was laid in 1967 with the acquisition of Associated Electrical
Industries, followed a year later by GEC's merger with English Electric.
Since then the company has overshadowed UK heavy electrical engineering.
The profits generated from rationalising the merged group allowed GEC to
finance other acquisitions in the 1980s. These have brought it a similarly
dominant position in British defence electronics and telecommunications
equipment manufacturing. In the past five years, GEC-Marconi has acquired
large parts of Plessey's and Ferranti's defence businesses. The group is
also the leading UK maker of telecommunications equipment through GPT, in
which Siemens of Germany has a 40 per cent stake.
Much of the future of Britain's involvement in the electrical, electronics
and telecommunications industries will hinge on the company's performance.
The task of finding Lord Weinstock's successor would thus be highly
sensitive at the best of times. But it is especially delicate now because
GEC is facing as demanding a set of challenges as at any time since Lord
Weinstock took the helm.
The group's core, the Marconi defence electronics business, has been badly
hit by cuts in defence spending. Even large programmes which it could once
have relied upon, such as the European Fighter Aircraft, are becoming
precarious. Marconi needs to grow by applying its technology to non-defence
markets - but it lacks many of the skills to succeed in the competitive
world of consumer electronics.
UK public sector markets - in which GEC has traditionally prospered,
particularly telecommunications - are being opened up to competition by
privatisation and liberalisation. Also, the world's electrical equipment
industry is still suffering from overcapacity, which has forced GEC to
consolidate its activities into a joint venture with Alsthom of France.
The way that GEC faces these pressures will turn on how it finds a successor
to Lord Weinstock.
The two figures who will be central to the saga of the succession are very
different characters.
Lord Prior, a bluff hearty figure, his cheeks rudely red with good health,
has spent most of his life as a Tory politician, rising to become employment
secretary in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first government before his last
political job as Northern Ireland secretary. He became GEC's chairman in
1984 and is the company's public face.
Lord Weinstock is the private power behind the facade. His influence extends
throughout the group from his dimly lit office on the fifth floor of GEC's
dowdy headquarters in London's Stanhope Gate opposite Hyde Park. All the big
decisions at GEC revolve around him. With his tall frame bent over his desk
in the corner of the office, he is intensely involved in the detail of all
GEC's subsidiaries - from how much they pay their employees to how they set
their prices.
His chief weapons are a razor-sharp mind and his telephone, which is
programmed to put him through to any of his 250 top managers at the press of
a single button.
The two Lords say there is nothing to worry about: the succession will be a
smooth affair. Lord Prior insists Lord Weinstock will not dig his heels in.
The need for change is fully recognised, he says: 'For the past six months,
this is something we have done serious work on, we must talk about it at
least once a month. We have time to get the right answer and we will do that
through agreement.'
Lord Weinstock agrees: 'There is no disagreement over how this issue should
be handled. I will know when my brain is failing. My colleagues will come to
me when they judge it's time for a change.'
Behind the scenes, however, the succession is becoming a highly charged
issue, one which could provoke a tug-of-war between the board and the
company's top managers.
Three groups are jockeying for position:
Lord Weinstock and his closely knit team of Stanhope Gate senior managers
want the succession to be resolved by evolution from within the company.
They are opposed to an outsider being brought in as managing director. They
favour the joint appointment of Mr David Newlands, the finance director, and
Mr Simon Weinstock, Lord Weinstock's son, who is in charge of acquisitions.
Lord Weinstock could become co-chairman, working in a supervisory capacity
alongside Lord Prior, to provide advice and guidance when needed.
A group of dissidents on the board flatly opposes this. The dissidents
believe GEC needs to be shaken up by new management, to push the company
into non-defence markets. These critics believe the board must wrest the
decision from the management's grip. They want to break the Weinstock mould
by bringing in an outsider as managing director. They would like other GEC
executives to take the place of some of the old Stanhope Gate team such as
Mr Malcolm Bates, the deputy managing director, and Mrs Sarah Morrison, the
head of human resources.
The balance of power will be held by a small but powerful group of
centrists, mainly non-executive directors and institutional investors. The
centrists agree with the Stanhope Gate managers that the company needs an
evolution in operating management, through the appointment of an insider as
managing director. But they would combine this with the appointment of a
powerful chairman charged with forging a new strategy for GEC.
The three groups have very different ideas about how the decision should be
made.
In spite of its size GEC is run like a family business. Its board plays only
a limited role even in strategic decisions such as acquisitions. Those
decisions are taken by Lord Weinstock working with a handful of managers who
are intensely loyal to one another. Their main meeting place is in Lord
Weinstock's open and informal office.
The door to the adjoining office is always open. The occupant, Mr Bates, can
often be heard bellowing criticism and encouragement to other executives.
His voice echoes through Lord Weinstock's room as a succession of visitors
pass through for conversation around the managing director's desk.
Messengers will come and go from the outside world. Lord Prior will pop in
to say he is off to see Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary; senior
executives of foreign electronics groups may come through on the telephone
loudspeaker; Mr Newlands and Mrs Morrison are often in attendance. The room
is more like a parlour than an office.
One member of the team describes how they work: 'An idea will come up over
lunch or in discussion, it might come from an outsider, it may come from
inside. Everyone will discuss it, not formally but we will all gather
perhaps several times to go over it. Then one person will take the
responsibility of writing a paper and we will have more informal discussions
before making a final decision.'
Outsiders, even other senior executives and directors of the company, have
walk-on parts. Their advice might be requested. But they play no role in
taking the decision.
That is how the management would like to choose Lord Weinstock's successor.
It would make sure that, through Lord Prior, institutional investors and
non-executive directors were kept abreast of their thinking. Having drawn up
a plan the management would put it to the board. So the final decision would
be the board's but the initiative would have come from the management.
This is how GEC normally works. But the succession is different. The board
and the non-executive directors in particular believe they have the
responsibility of making this decision. Having languished on the margins at
GEC for decades, the directors could suddenly be thrust into a position of
unprecedented power over an issue vital to the company's future.
Traditionally, the chairman's role at GEC has been largely honorific.
According to one board member, not one of those critical of Lord Weinstock:
'GEC has traditionally treated its chairmen very badly indeed. It has taken
the management a long time to accept that the chairman has a real role.'
Lord Prior says it has taken him some time to develop a good working
relationship with the management. Even now he describes the job in equivocal
terms. 'I am not a non-executive chairman but I am not executive either,' he
says. 'I am more and more doing the job that most full-time chairmen do. It
has taken a number of years for Arnold and myself to develop a relationship
which works, but it now works very well and it has great significance for
the company.'
It is extremely rare for Lord Prior to delve into the company's inner
workings, but management accepts that Lord Prior must play a pivotal role in
deciding the succession, acting as liaison between the management,
shareholders and the board.
The GEC board gathers only four times a year. Meetings, which on average
last only about 90 minutes, bring together the Stanhope Gate group and an
eclectic mix of 12 non-executives which includes Lord Rees-Mogg, former
editor of The Times, and Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz. The
non-executives are neither a cohesive nor powerful group. They have only
just started meeting together for dinner the night before board meetings.
One disgruntled executive director describes the meetings: 'Everything is as
clean as a whistle. Apart from the legal documents, there are no papers
circulated in advance, other than a single line on the financial performance
of each of the subsidiaries.
'After the formal legal business has been dealt with, Lord Weinstock goes
through the quarterly results of each of the operating companies. Some
people might challenge him on details, but they simply do not know enough
about the companies to get very far. After that it is any other business.'
A small group of directors - no more than four - believes the time has come
to assert itself over the choice of Lord Weinstock's successor. This group
will not publicly criticise Lord Weinstock's management style. But in
private its members make no bones about their unhappiness.
They allege the Stanhope Gate group will perpetuate its own power if the
decision is left with it. They accuse the current management of holding GEC
back through excessive caution and short-term thinking, restraining its
potential to grow outside its traditional markets.
A non-executive director, well informed about the way GEC works, comments:
'A subcommittee of the chairman and the non-executives should be set up in
the next six months charged with the task of finding a successor, including
an executive search of outsiders. We should look for someone who can inject
new drive into the company, to push it into new markets.'
The critics claim there would be a haemorrhage of management from the
operating units if Mr Simon Weinstock got the top job. They say it would
send a signal that family comes before merit at the top of the group.
Those criticisms provoke an equally forceful response from Lord Weinstock
and his team. They argue the non-executives know virtually nothing about the
company and so could not be in a position to choose a successor on their
own.
Any attempt by the non-executives to set off on a trawl of talent from
outside would spark outright conflict between management and board. Indeed
the Weinstocks might even threaten to sell their shareholdings in GEC - more
than 39m shares, about 1.4 per cent of the group and more than the entire
holdings of the GEC employee savings share scheme - to display their
displeasure.
As one senior executive explains: 'We want to do this through consensus . .
. there is no question of a putsch at GEC.'
That last judgment is almost certainly correct. Although the critics claim a
secret ballot of the board would deliver a slim majority in favour of
change, in reality they are a powerless, underground minority.
The dissidents, however, are not the only problem the executives may have to
deal with. The centrists, backed by GEC's institutional shareholders, could
well exert a powerful influence.
This group recognises the strength of the case for continuity and
acknowledges the current management team's considerable achievements. GEC
has been steered clear of many of the financial and technological black
holes which have claimed its peers and competitors. It is financially as
sound as a bell.
On top of this, the centrists recognise that if an outsider were given the
power that Lord Weinstock has enjoyed, GEC might be ruined by ill-fated
ventures into consumer businesses the company knows little about.
However, they also believe continuity needs to be combined with change. As
far as the company's strategy is concerned, that means investing the profits
from GEC's joint venture with Alsthom to exploit the potential of Marconi's
vast wealth of technology. From the point of view of the succession, it
means combining a managing director from inside the company with a strong
chairman from outside.
The key figure in the centrist camp will be Mr Ron Artus, the former group
chief investment manager at the Prudential, which remains GEC's biggest
shareholder with 7 per cent of the equity. If the Weinstock team can afford
to alienate the dissidents, it cannot afford to alienate Mr Artus, who has
an analytical mind and an independent spirit  - and a seat on the Prudential
board. His appointment as a non-executive was Lord Weinstock's idea. As a
member of the Stanhope Gate group put it: 'Artus did not arrive from heaven.
He was brought in as an independent figure, to make sure the City would see
the succession was being handled properly.'
Central to the succession will be whether Lord Prior, Lord Weinstock and Mr
Artus can agree a plan.
In this Mr Artus will not be a soft touch. He has just completed an
international tour to assess the group's strengths and weaknesses.
Separately the Prudential has recently completed an exhaustive six-month
study of GEC's prospects.
The centrists believe some quite far-reaching changes are needed in the way
GEC operates. As a leading centrist on the board puts it: 'At the moment GEC
looks as if it is becoming a defence electronics business with a few niche
industrial businesses tacked on the end. That is fine but it is not a major
electronics group, which is what GEC should be, playing in major markets.
You do get the impression that there is potential which could be made more
of without risking the financial safety which GEC is famous for.'
The centrists hold two positions which could lead them into direct conflict
with Lord Weinstock.
First they insist there is no question of Mr Simon Weinstock succeeding his
father. It is understood that GEC's main institutional shareholders have
made it clear that although they view the younger Weinstock as a skilled and
hardworking member of the management team, they would oppose his appointment
because they feel that, in a public company, a father should not be
succeeded by his son. They would prefer Mr Newlands as sole chief executive.
Second, the centrists rule out the possibility of Lord Weinstock becoming
chairman, for it is here the institutions see the opportunity for change.
Lord Prior is 63. If he were to retire soon, that would create the space to
bring in a chairman who would play a more assertive role in deciding the
company's strategy.
He would be charged with building an executive team to report to to a
stronger board, with more executive directors from the GEC divisions,
outside Stanhope Gate. The institutions' favourite candidate is Sir
Christopher Hogg, chairman of Courtaulds and Reuters.
A top executive with one of the largest institutional investors sums up
their approach: 'There is no need for dramatic upheaval. We certainly do not
want to bring in a big deal maker who would mis-spend GEC's money.
'We want a chairman who is good at strategy and building a management team
at board level, combined with an operating officer from within the company.
The question should be settled through consensus with Lord Prior consulting
non-executives, shareholders and the management. If they could organise that
kind of orderly succession GEC shares would rise quite sharply.'
So it seems increasingly likely that Lord Weinstock will be faced with a
painful choice. He is used to wielding almost absolute power - but on this
he is likely to have to compromise with outsiders.
To secure continuity and stability at the top of the company, he will have
to satisfy the centrists. To do that he is likely to have to pay a price,
forgoing his own ambitions to become joint chairman and accepting that an
outsider should be brought in armed with a mandate for change.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Lloyd's is attacked over filling top job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of leading agents at Lloyd's is to press for a change in management
style amid concern over the way a new chief executive is being chosen.
The insurance market's senior appointments committee interviewed candidates
from what is understood to be a final shortlist on Friday, scarcely two days
after the approval of radical changes to the market's management and
regulation.
The changes, suggested by a team led by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds
Bank, would alter radically the job of the chief executive. The appointee
would lead a new market board and spearhead efforts to improve efficiency
and profitability at Lloyd's, which last month announced its biggest losses.
Sir Jeremy was appointed to head a re-examination of the issues raised
earlier this year by the Rowland task force's report on the market's
governance. As well as recommending the creation of a market board - to be
elected by representatives of leading businesses at Lloyd's - he proposed
that the role and size of the council, which both regulates and administers
the market, should be reduced. He also said that another new body, led by an
independent chairman, should take over regulation.
But agents argue that Lloyd's is acting too quickly and should implement the
broader package of reforms before it makes any new executive appointments.
'They are taking the thing completely the wrong way around - it is the cart
before the horse,' said the chairman of one of the biggest of the
underwriting agencies, which manage the affairs of Names - the individuals
whose capital backs the market.
Lloyd's confirmed yesterday that candidates for the post had been
interviewed last week and said that an appointment 'may well be made' by the
end of this month. It said it did not believe a final decision had been
taken, but that Lloyd's was keen to press ahead with the appointment as part
of reforms foreshadowed in the Rowland report.
The agents are also critical of the role in the selection process of Mr Alan
Lord, the former chief executive, who attended the selection meeting in an
ex officio capacity. Mr Lord, who retired last month, opposed the suggested
reforms as presented by the Rowland task force.
The critics suggest that a new chairman should be elected before other
changes are made. Mr David Coleridge, now in his second year as chairman, is
expected to retire later this year. His successor is not yet known. Although
a headhunting team has been searching for a new chief executive for more
than six months, critics argue that uncertainty about the market's future
would be off-putting to many potential applicants.
'If I were considering it I wouldn't be prepared to respond to a headhunter
until I'd seen the Morse report,' said one agent. 'The best people have to
be discovered and persuaded. The council has got to be seen to take radical
steps.'
Another senior figure said: 'It seems to me they are in too much of a hurry
to settle this. Lloyd's either acts frighteningly quickly or very slow.'

FT  06 JUL 92 / Grey future for retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY retailers will face a tough challenge this decade adjusting to an
ageing Britain, according to a report.
As the median age of the UK population increases, many retailers that sell
their products mainly to the under-30s will see a sharp drop in the number
of customers in their target age group. The report by Verdict Response, a
retail consultancy, suggests that the number of people aged from 15 to 29
will have fallen by 22 per cent to 7.2m by 2001.
Verdict says that on these estimates Miss Selfridge, the fashion retailer,
will 'lose' 8.3 per cent of its customers by the end of the decade while the
Next fashion chain will see its target market decline by more than 5 per
cent. Other prominent retailers most affected include River Island, Top Man,
Olympus and Body Shop.
However, the 'greying' population base will create more lucrative markets
for retailers that pitch their appeal to older age groups. The number of
people aged 30 to 39 is likely to increase 14 per cent to 9.1m by 2001 while
the number aged from 50 to 59 will rise 22 per cent to 7.3m. In total, the
adult population is expected to grow by 1.5 per cent.
Verdict suggests that retailers including Currys, the Co-op, BhS, Marks and
Spencer, Littlewoods and John Lewis Partnership will see more than 2 per
cent more customers falling into their ideal age ranges. The report points
out, however, that general economic factors - such as trends in home
ownership and interest rates - will affect the spending power of different
age groups in different ways. High-street shops are bearing the brunt of the
recession, with the south-east the worst affected, according to a report
from American Express.
More than 40 per cent of retailers said business revenue was down in the
first three months of 1992 compared with the same period last year. Only 20
per cent of retailers reported a rise in profits in the first half of the
year.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Philanthropy looks to the future: Alan Pike on Business in
the Community, 10 years old this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL hundred business leaders will on Wednesday tour the east end of
London, where Booth founded the Salvation Army and Dr Barnardo his famous
children's charity.
This week's visitors will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of Business in
the Community, which encourages companies to take social responsibilities as
seriously as business ones.
The most passionate advocates of corporate community involvement believe
that a new social movement to rival those of reformers such as Booth and
Barnardo is developing in Britain's boardrooms - a movement in which
business acknowledges that it has responsibilities extending beyond the
creation of wealth and employment.
If this view is proved correct, the next 10 years may also see the business
sector taking a stronger role in social policymaking.
Business philanthropy is not new. There are few Victorian cities without
industrial benefactors to thank for universities, libraries or housing
estates. However, much of that activity disappeared with the development of
the welfare state and the decline in family-owned businesses and regional
head offices, although large companies continued to donate money to charity
and support other activities outside their business interests.
A new wave of corporate social activity began in the early 1980s in response
to the effect of the last recession on industrial areas and youth
employment. Enthusiasts for links between business and the community have
spent their time since then trying to turn an array of piecemeal initiatives
into a new dimension in business life.
Many large companies are abandoning their traditionally ad hoc responses to
charity and are developing more clearly focused, professionally managed
community involvement policies. Mr David Grayson, director of the
organisation's business strategy group, predicts that the next step will be
the integration of community activities with all other aspects of a
company's business.
'If the secondment of staff to voluntary organisations is linked to a
company's broader personnel policy, and support for projects is integrated
with its marketing strategy, it not only makes community affairs into a more
mainstream business activity, it opens up much larger sections of a
company's budget to community involvement policies.'
Wednesday's visits will illustrate the striking variety of social projects
for which the organisation drums up business support. Business leaders will
see the conversion of a former public baths into a centre for people
affected by Aids and HIV; a hostel for the homeless run on lines determined
by the residents; and a range of training and small-business start-up
schemes. These include Circus Space, which trains circus artistes, provides
educational performances and is developing a disused power station in
Hackney into a community centre.
Research by the Charities Aid Foundation shows that 41 companies each gave
more than Pounds 1m-worth of support to the voluntary sector last year. In
most cases the bulk of it was in non-cash assistance such as staff
secondments and equipment.
Mr Grayson believes companies should also start trying to influence policy
developments.
'In the US, companies are using experience gained from years of involvement
in specific educational initiatives to begin speaking knowledgeably about
the education system itself. You now get US companies putting forward
proposals to the federal and state governments about how the education
system should develop and change.' He cites Training and Enterprise Councils
in England and Wales - and City Challenge, the government's urban
regeneration programme - as examples of ways in which UK businesses are
becoming involved in developing policy rather than supporting individual
schemes.
When companies support schemes in isolation, he says, the value of their
contribution is reduced. He sees a need for the government to create
initiatives which enable local authorities, voluntary organisations,
businesses and other agencies to work together in a more co-ordinated
approach to community action.
Some companies, if they support community activities at all, still do so out
of philanthropic motives and shrink from the idea of becoming partners with
public agencies in social programmes. But Mr Grayson, summing up the
organisation's first 10 years, says a growing number of business leaders are
becoming more adventurous and more knowledgeable.
'Ten years ago,' he explains, 'any discussion about education usually
consisted of industrialists blaming the schools because they were unhappy
with the educational achievements of young recruits.
'Now you are far more likely to hear businesspeople, perhaps with experience
of serving on Tec boards or as school governors, appreciating what happens
in schools and arguing detailed policy points. That is an example of
corporate community involvement making progress.'

FT  06 JUL 92 / Enterprise bodies 'fear role change'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL enterprise trusts in Scotland fear that they will lose their
independence and be forced to narrow their activities as Local Enterprise
Companies (Lecs) become more established, according to a study by
Strathclyde University.
It says this will lead to a loss of diversity in support available to
businesses and the possibility that 'unglamorous' businesses without much
growth potential will be denied support.
The report's findings may have implications for Training and Enterprise
Councils (Tecs), the equivalent of Lecs in England and Wales.
Most Scottish trusts were originally contracted to provide a range of
services to their nearest Lec, primarily support for start-ups of small
businesses and for very small established businesses.
They have feared being restricted to this traditional role and therefore
being prevented from becoming involved in areas such as marketing and inward
investment and from continuing to help medium-sized and large businesses.
Many Lecs have said they do not want the trusts to undertake these
activities, and have indicated willingness to use their contractual and
financial powers to prevent it.
The researchers suggest several ways in which relations between the trusts
and Lecs might develop. They say the trusts might gradually be absorbed or,
while remaining independent, might supply services only to the enterprise
companies.
'It is probable that many trusts will effectively become dependent arms of
the Lecs, regardless of their theoretically independent status,' the study
says.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Top executives' pay gap widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executives of big companies are continuing to increase their
differentials over lower-ranked managers, although the rate of pay rises for
UK executives as a whole is slowing, according to the latest pay index
produced by the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries.
The index, calculated quarterly for the Financial Times, includes the value
of benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses. The
figures for the second quarter of the year are based on a survey of 5,438
managers in 426 companies.
Taking all ranks of executives together, the average total pay rose to
Pounds 79,019, an increase of 8.1 per cent on the same quarter last year.
The corresponding increase over the previous 12 months was 13.5 per cent.
Among the different categories of managers, however, the chief executives of
companies with sales turnovers of more than Pounds 600m continued to pull
ahead.
Their average rise over the latest 12 months was 9.1 per cent, the biggest
increase of any of the categories.
Of the overall total pay of Pounds 79,019, the share made up by salary has
risen slightly since last July to 71.6 per cent, while pensions increased
their share from 9.9 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
Bonuses edged down from 5.8 per cent to 5.7 per cent, company cars from 11
per cent to 10.6 per cent and miscellaneous benefits from 1.8 per cent to
1.5 per cent.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Share of EC investment falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S share of total inward investment in European Community countries
last year fell to its lowest level since 1984, reflecting the severity of
the recession.
Although the UK continued in its traditional role of attracting the largest
share of EC inward investment, the proportion fell to 33 per cent from 39
per cent in 1990.
France and Belgium were the next most successful, with 17 per cent and 14
per cent respectively of the EC funding total. Their shares rose from 11 per
cent and 9 per cent in 1990.
The unpublished figures from the Bank for International Settlements, the
central bankers' bank, cover investments in individual EC nations by foreign
companies.
They indicate that Britain's strong record in gaining such finance - which
in recent years has included large sums from Japanese companies - may be
starting to wane.
A central feature of UK government policy in the 1980s was to create the
conditions for large investments by overseas companies. Their spending has
buoyed important sections of UK manufacturing, particularly cars,
electronics and chemicals.
As Britain has moved into a recession which has been significantly worse
than those affecting most other parts of Europe, its power to attract
spending may have decreased.
Another factor may be that some overseas companies started to run down their
investments last year, reflecting their heavy spending in previous years in
areas such as new buildings and tooling.
Britain's 33 per cent - the total dropped to Dollars 64.7bn from Dollars
86.3bn in 1990 - was the lowest since the 4 per cent recorded in 1984. That
figure reflected a statistical quirk - a large transfer by the UK subsidiary
of the Royal Dutch/Shell oil group into an overseas operating arm - which
depressed the overall figure for capital inflows into the UK.
Leaving aside 1984, last year's UK share of EC investment was the lowest
since the 30 per cent recorded in 1978. The figures for the UK (apart from
1984) have not been lower than 30 per cent since the bank started records in
1975.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Sharp squeeze forecast on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES face a sharp profits squeeze because of the faltering economy,
according to the Ernst &amp; Young Item forecasting group.
Item says in projections published today that companies will find little
chance to expand margins over the next two years because of weak demand in
the UK and other developed nations.
Item says gross trading profits for non-oil companies will increase this
year by 7 per cent against last year, a much smaller figure than profits
increases seen in the early 1980s as Britain recovered from the previous
recession.
The group, which bases its calculations on the Treasury's computer model of
the economy, says growth in average annual profits over the next five years
will be about 5 per cent. 'The consensus forecast (among other economists)
is for almost double this rate of growth, which suggests that the current
level of the equity market is overvalued,' it says.
Item envisages a 0.6 per cent decline in UK output this year after a 2.4 per
cent fall last year. It says corporate profits as a share of gross domestic
product this year will be about 13 per cent, increasing to just over 14 per
cent next year, before falling back to just under 13 per cent by 1997.
As the UK recovered from the previous recession, profits climbed from about
12.5 per cent of GDP in 1980 to peak at about 18.5 per cent in 1985.
Item also expects the large debts run up by many consumers in recent years
to constrain any sharp rises in consumer spending, leading to only a weak
recovery. Uncertainty about the economy and stockmarket sentiment depressed
the level of management buy-out activity in the second quarter of the year,
with just Pounds 600m worth of deals completed, according to accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick.

<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence is hold-ing up firmly, with the economy still showing
tentative signs of recovery, according to the Institute of Directors.
The institute's latest bi-monthly survey of business opinion, conducted
among 325 senior company executives, shows the highest level of sustained
optimism about the business outlook for nearly four years.
Half of those questioned said they were more optimistic about prospects in
the months ahead. The service sector is the most confident, although
optimism among manufacturing and distribution companies has continued to
fall.
The survey also shows profits and sales at their highest level since June
1990. For the first time in two years a substantially larger number of
directors report higher, rather than lower, profits.
Employment was the biggest blackspot, with only a quarter of directors
saying they expect to take on more staff. Cashflow, as opposed to weak
demand, remained the principle concern. Ms Janice Buck, the institute's
economic research executive, said: 'Despite difficult trading conditions,
this survey shows that company performance and confidence about the economy
are holding up well.' Companies in the west Midlands will see a 'steady but
extremely slow' recovery later this year, according to the west Midlands
regional group of chambers of commerce.

FT  06 JUL 92 / No credit for lenders on debt advice: Sir George Blunden's
fight to help consumers with money troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FULL-SCALE confrontation between building societies and consumer-debt
advice bodies is looming in the wake of remarks last week by Sir George
Blunden, chairman of the Money Advice Trust.
Sir George, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, pointed the
finger at some well-known high street names for not chipping in with
adequate help for the money advice scheme set up last year to help consumers
with serious debt problems.
It is the second time in just over six months that he has publicly
identified building societies for their failure to provide cash for his
project.
When the scheme was established, high-street retailers, banks and building
societies were expected to put up cash. But several lenders, especially the
large building societies, are apparently sceptical about the trust.
It emerged at the time of publication last week of the first annual report
of the Money Advice Trust that private-sector donations towards its debt
counselling operations have lagged far below target. The trust now hints
that it may be forced to push for a statutory levy.
There are seven money advice centres, but the trust wants to double their
number and create a national telephone debt advice service. It also
envisages a regional network of Money Advice Support Units working within
Citizens' Advice Bureaux and a system for training money advice workers
nationally.
All these plans are now being hampered by lack of cash. 'They (the centres)
have not been a roaring success, but they have not been a failure either,'
says Sir George.
Last year, its first in operation, the trust was given Pounds 250,000 by the
private sector, against its target of Pounds 3m. However it has pledges of
Pounds 800,000 to come this year and next.
Donations from the English banks have been good, but Sir George expresses
deep disappointment elsewhere.
The most meagre donors have been the Scottish banks. They have contributed
only Pounds 2,500 between them, a figure which Sir George describes as
bitterly disappointing. The electricity industry has given Pounds 2,500.
Support from retailers has been patchy, though there have been significant
contributions from Kingfisher and GE Capital, one of the main suppliers of
storecard and retail credit.
The unspoken implication is that some institutions are turning their backs
on the debt problem.
Problems with home loans probably cause the most acute difficulties for
families. Building societies, which now have 290,000 mortgage customers who
are more than six months in arrears, are singled out by Sir George.
He says some societies seem to prefer to make donations for money advice
locally rather than nationally. As a result, local authorities may simply
trim their spending on debt counselling.
Many societies prefer to see debt advice carried out in-house by their own
staff. Sir George says that for it to be fully effective, debt counselling
should be done independently in Citizens' Advice Bureaux.
One especial target for criticism is Halifax Building Society, the country's
largest mortgage lender. Halifax claims to be putting Pounds 250,000 into
debt counselling this year, but Sir George says that it is spending the
money in ways which the trust does not want.
Halifax takes a robust line against these criticisms. It claims that if
building society funds were given to money advice centres, the societies
would simply be underwriting the mistakes of less responsible lenders.
It also challenges Sir George's idea that consumers can be helped by debt
counselling head-on.
The society says: 'There is little evidence that the provision of 'money
advice support' actually makes a difference to the practical contribution
that can be offered at a local level or any difference to the ability of
individuals to repay outstanding debts.'
Halifax says it will fight any attempt to impose a statutory levy for money
advice centres - it says the levy would have to be passed on to borrowers.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Laird warning on union influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS are in danger of losing any influence in industry or society because
of their dwindling membership, Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU
engineering and electrical union, warns his members today.
Unless unions start recruiting hard, Mr Laird writes in the union's journal,
'the current merger-mania will amount to little more than rearranging the
deckchairs on the Titanic'.
The AEEU itself - recently formed through a merger between the AEU
engineering union and the EETPU electricians' union - has seen engineering
membership drop by 11 per cent over the past year.
Mr Laird says unions have lost a total of 3.5m members since 1979. 'Unions
in Britain are less effective than even our dwindling numbers would
suggest,' he adds. 'Our 10m members are split into 20 large unions, dozens
of smaller unions and hundreds of staff associations.'
Arguing for further mergers, Mr Laird points to the problems faced by
manufacturing employers who still 'have to deal with three or four manual
unions and two or more staff unions'. Although union membership in Germany
is lower than in Britain, effectiveness is increased by single unions in
each sector, he adds. 'Here in Britain we are still trying to compete
against Germany with a Victorian trade union set-up. Mergers have taken
place in a random and unco-ordinated way,' he writes.
In a barely disguised swipe at some of the poaching activities of his own
electricians' section, Mr Laird says the union should not be 'interested in
petty squabbles with the general unions about a few thousand members here or
there on the periphery of industry', but should be 'reaching out and
recruiting the unorganised'.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Government legal services may be put out to tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL government agen-cies and departments are considering contracting out
their legal services - including sensitive enforcement work - to private law
firms, as part of the drive to contract out Civil-Service functions.
The Health and Safety Executive is expected to be among the first agencies
to place work done by in-house lawyers with the private sector. It is
considering 'market testing' routine enforcement work in health and safety
prosecutions.
The pollution inspectorate, is also thought to be considering the
contracting out of routine prosecution work.
The employment department is looking at placing local advice out to tender
in the regions and the Treasury solicitor's department is considering
contracting out routine property work and litigation.
However, Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, has warned against
over-enthusiasm in contracting out legal work. In a guidance note to
government departments, he suggests that the scope for contracting out legal
services is limited and warns of the need to retain effective in-house legal
capacity.
Sir Nicholas says it would not be appropriate to use the private sector for
'core governmental work' where ministers and legal advisers need to maintain
a close confidential relationship.
Sir Nicholas says that sufficient in-house capacity must be retained within
the government legal service not only to service core work but also to
provide him with legal assistance in his role as the government's chief
legal adviser.
The First Division Association, which represents lawyers in the government
legal service, has expressed concern over the potential loss of jobs that
contracting out could bring.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Hitches fail to halt bid for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES TELEVISION is expected to go ahead tomorrow with a bid for Channel 5
with the full backing of its parent, Thorn EMI, in spite of last-minute
setbacks with potential shareholders.
Channel 5 Holdings, the consortium bidding for the franchise, is not a
fully-funded venture so a large part of its equity would have to be raised
on winning the licence.
Sony Pictures, the Hollywood studio group and one of the main potential
shareholders in the Thames-led consortium, is to decide on the venture after
studying the final bid document.
Canwest, the Winnipeg-based international broadcaster and another potential
shareholder, has submitted a contract insisting on managerial control of the
venture. This would almost certainly have invalidated the bid. Under the
1990 Broadcasting Act, control of the channel has to be held by European
Community companies.
Canadian newspapers yesterday reported that Mr Izzy Asper, the owner of
Canwest, was preparing to pull out of the consortium.
The growing uncertainties over the financial backing for the consortium
increases the chances that the Independent Television Commission will decide
not to award the licence. Channel 5 Holdings appears to be the only
potentially viable applicant for the commercial television channel, which is
capable of reaching 75 per cent of the UK population.
Thames is planning to submit a bid which will tackle the main barrier facing
Channel 5 - the retuning of several million video recorders which are likely
to suffer interference from the signal. The consortium's bid will be
accompanied by a letter from a merchant bank saying the project is capable
of being funded.
While the commission is studying the bid, the consortium hopes to raise a
large enough proportion of the funding to justify the award of the licence.
After a licence is awarded, an operator has 12 weeks to complete the
financing.
If no suitably qualified applicant comes forward, the commission will return
the problem and the spare frequencies to the government.
Apart from the cost of re-tuning, which will probably involve at least
Pounds 50m, any operator of Channel 5 will have to persuade viewers in most
parts of the country to buy a new conventional aerial to receive the
service.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Dish installations decline: FT satellite monitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTALLATIONS of satellite dishes fell to 57,000 last month, according to
the latest FT satellite monitor.
The monthly figure compares with 71,000 in May, and a total of 94,000 in
April. In June last year the figure was 64,000.
The total number of homes with satellite receivers is now just over 2.5m.
However, there has been a significant rise in those saying that they
definitely intend to get a satellite dish, probably as a result of publicity
surrounding the purchase of rights to live Premier League football games by
British Sky Broadcasting. Those who say they will definitely get a dish
increased in June from 67,000 homes to 403,000.
This takes the total size of the satellite market in Britain - those who
have a dish or say they will definitely or probably get one - to more than
5m for the first time.
The FT monitor is produced by Continental Research, and is based on monthly
telephone interviews with more than 4,000 adults. The share of satellite
television viewing in homes equipped for it declined from 33.5 per cent in
March to just over 30 per cent in May, the last month for which figures are
available.
For the first time, however, the audience share of Screensport - owned by a
consortium including French and US companies - has equalled BSkyB's Sky
Sports. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in
BSkyB.

DISCRIMINATION in education and training against young people from
lower-income families has made the UK an 'under-educated and under-trained
nation', the TUC warns today.
It says in a submission to the National Committee on Education, a privately
funded inquiry, that only 5 per cent of 18-year-olds with parents in manual
jobs go on to higher education.
Pupils from professional and managerial backgrounds are more likely to be
accepted for higher education. Black and ethnic-minority students are
under-represented in further and higher education.
However, the belief that too little is invested in training is challenged in
a book published today by the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market
think tank. The book, by Mr Len Shackleton, an economist at Central London
Polytechnic, says Britain could be providing too much training, because
government policy is based on insufficient research and economic analysis.

COMPUTER workers at the Bank of England are to receive redundancy pay-offs
this week of up to six figures but will continue to do the same jobs, Diane
Summers writes.
The Bank has entered a facilities management contract with Hoskyns, a
computer-services company. A total of 41 employees who run the Bank's
mainframe computer system are to be made compulsorily redundant and will
immediately be employed by Hoskyns to carry out the same functions for the
Bank.
The Bank confirmed yesterday that in one or two cases, where there had been
'say, 25 years' service,' the payments would be 2.8 times annual salary and
would run into six figures.
The terms agreed for the computer staff who have been made compulsorily
redundant were in line with voluntary redundancy packages offered to other
staff, said the Bank.
The Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, which represents 37 of the 41
computer workers, said that staff moving to Hoskyns would suffer inferior
terms and conditions.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Major will try to curb EFA costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister will today begin government attempts to curb the costs of
Britain's involvement in the European Fighter Aircraft amid signs that the
project is one of many that the Treasury is targeting in its battle to curb
public spending.
The row over public spending could re-erupt on Thursday when the cabinet
discusses substantial rises, recommended by the Top Salaries Review Body, in
MPs' allowances. Tory backbenchers may rebel if the increases are trimmed.
There is also the prospect of a dispute within the party over pay rises for
senior civil servants, the military and judges.
Labour yesterday joined in the spending row by seizing on reports that
unemployment benefit might be cut. It argued that the government was
attacking the jobless in its attempts to end the recession.
The future of the EFA, following Germany's decision not to give the go-ahead
for production, will be raised by Mr John Major when be meets Professor
Giulano Amato, the Italian prime minister, in Munich today. Italy and Spain
are also partners in the project.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will consider possible alternatives
when he meets Mr Volker Ruhe, his German counterpart, in London. Possible
compromises include varying the specification of the fighter for each
country - allowing Germany, for example, to have cheaper weapon and radar
systems.
The Treasury wants a full review of the EFA's costs but accepts that no
decision can be made until Germany's position is clarified. It accepts that
much of the spending will fall outside this year's public expenditure round.
The MoD believes the EFA can be kept within its original budget.
Mr Major said at the weekend that the government had still not received a
formal communication from Germany. He is anxious Bonn should reconsider
although Downing Street officials are not optimistic.
Cabinet ministers sought to play down speculation of a rift but acknowledged
that the project's future was uncertain.
However, any Treasury attempt to stymie the project would be resisted
furiously by Mr Rifkind and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary.
Mr Major said that he was looking to cut the costs of the EFA but he hoped
the project would go ahead. The UK had decided it needed an aircraft like
the EFA for military reasons.
He said the UK took 'the view that the alternatives to the European fighter
would be more expensive, not less expensive, and would take longer to
produce'.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Smith says Labour split on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Smith, the favourite to win Labour's leadership contest, yesterday
admitted that Labour MPs are likely to be split in a Commons vote on the
Maastricht treaty and he did not rule out a free vote.
Tory MPs opposed to the treaty believe that their chances of success depend
on Labour's response, and Mr Smith said on BBC television that it would be
'impossible' to expect all Labour MPs to vote either for or against it.
His comments came as Mr Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend and a
prominent Euro-sceptic, said that next week Tory activists would set up a
campaign to back a referendum on the treaty.
Mr Smith refused to predict the party's official line when legislation on
the treaty returns to the Commons after the summer recess. He did not know
what would be in the legislation or whether the European Community had a
strategy for overcoming Denmark's referendum rejection of the treaty.
Asked about allowing a free vote, he said: 'We haven't considered that as a
possibility at this stage.' However, he added: 'Always in British political
parties on this issue there are going to be divisions.
'It is just impossible to expect that on a issue of this kind that they will
all vote in the same way and there has to be some respect for differing
options.'
Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, predicted that he would come
second in the deputy leadership contest to Mrs Margaret Beckett and would
pick up votes from Mr Bryan Gould's supporters in a final run-off.

<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE general election successes have become over-dependent on
Labour's failings and the party should try to win the votes of centre party
supporters, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, said yesterday.
The Tories were vulnerable to a total collapse of the third-party vote which
might occur by the next election, Mr Hunt warned a conference of the
left-leaning Tory Reform Group.
Mr Hunt, in effect calling on Mr John Major to modify the agenda of his
predecessor, said the party should move to attract supporters from the
former Social Democratic party who were 'largely motivated by a set of
beliefs wholly at home in the Tory Reform Group'.
He added: 'It is simply not acceptable or realistic for politicians to
disassociate themselves from the notion of society or government's
respon-sibility to stimulate and guide social and economic development.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday stepped up his campaign
to expand 'dialogue and debate' across British political parties while
keeping his party's 'distinct' identity. He urged Liberal Democrat
councillors at a conference in Eastbourne, East Sussex, to work with other
parties 'who might share in our agenda for reform'.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Patten will aim to leave legacy of substance: Hong Kong's
next governor must satisfy the needs of democracy and China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor-designate, arrives to take up his
pro-consular duties on Thursday he will face a set of political problems to
which there are no easy or obvious solutions.
Politics in Hong Kong is currently in a state of flux. Old certainties have
dissolved and new allegiances are in the making. In a political environment
where consensus once determined decision-making, there is now division,
debate and acrimony.
The focal point of this schism is China; its arena the local legislature in
Hong Kong.
Five years from the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong has still not come to
terms with its fate. Among ordinary Chinese, and most ethnic Chinese
politicians, there is a profound sense of ambivalence about the transfer.
They are torn between ties of ethnicity - a belief that they belong to the
great Chinese civilisation and that Hong Kong is a part of China - and
apprehension about being absorbed into a totalitarian state where the rule
of man, not law, will decide their fate.
One of the central elements of this dilemma is the pace of progress towards
democracy in the colony. Some see accommodation with China as the best way
of safeguarding Hong Kong's future; others contend that greater democracy is
the only way to providelasting protection.
The resolution of these emotional and political tensions, or at least their
mitigation, is seen as the main task of Mr Patten's governorship. When he
leaves Hong Kong for good on July 1, 1997, he will have achieved a
considerable political triumph if the people of Hong Kong are confident that
the prosperity they enjoy and the open society in which they live will
survive.
But Mr Patten will find that the instruments of power at his disposal
provide no sure way of achieving this. He will have to use his much-vaunted
political skills to pull it off.
He inherits what many in the colonial government describe as a 'cockeyed'
political structure. On paper, the governor is a powerful person.
He is advised by a 13-member Executive Council, or cabinet - nine of whom
were appointed by his predecessor, Lord Wilson, and four of whom sit by
right of their position in the administration. Behind him is a
180,000-strong civil service.
But, paradoxically, his power is limited. He presents his legislation to an
assembly which has the power to reject or amend it, especially his spending
plans. And, worryingly in this age of partially elective democracy, he is a
government without a party.
The legislature numbers among its 60 members 18 who were popularly elected
and rally to the 'liberal' cause, 21 who were elected to represent mainly
conservative interest groups via functional constituencies, 18 mainly
conservative men and women appointed by Lord Wilson, and three ex officio
members of the administration.
Since the colony's first partially democratic elections last September, the
legislature has further developed into a place which commands the public's
attention for its new-found assertiveness.
But those whom Lord Wilson appointed in the hope of having a legislative
majority - conservative plutocrats who have joined in a loose confederation
known as the Co-operative Resources Centre (CRC) - have, by a recent embrace
of Beijing, shown signs of divided loyalty. This is even more embarrassing
for Mr Patten since four of the CRC appointees to the legislature were also
appointed to the cabinet.
The CRC has found it increasingly difficult to stand with the government. It
wavered in March over the budget and had to be hauled into line. More
recently it broke ranks over the financing of the airport railway - one of
the core projects for the colony's new airport development - in a move which
at best gave aid and comfort to Beijing and which at worst undermined the
negotiating stance of the government.
On the other side of the legislature is the United Democrats led by Mr
Martin Lee. It functions as a disciplined political party. But, because of
the inability of Lord Wilson and Mr Lee to agree terms over the latter's
participation in the cabinet, the Democrats have adopted the role of an
opposition.
One of Mr Patten's early tests will be how he deals with them. An option is
to bring them into the cabinet. But it is by no means certain that switching
from the CRC to the Democrats will provide him with a reliable majority in
the legislature or a cabinet that can agree on policy towards China. Unlike
the CRC, Mr Lee's Democrats continue to argue for more directly elected
seats to the legislature - a policy China steadfastly refuses to
contemplate.
Also, Mr Patten risks an early row with China if he invites Mr Lee to join
the cabinet. Beijing has raised the stakes by implicitly accusing Mr Lee of
being a 'subversive' and publicising its opposition to his, or his
colleagues', cabinet membership.
Not to appoint Democrats, however, risks the accusation of 'kowtowing' to
Beijing, an accusation which dogged his predecessor.
There are, however, more than one means to the end of good government. Mr
Patten is expected to take a much higher profile in winning support for his
policies than his predecessor. In a status-conscious place such as Hong
Kong, a well-timed call from the governor could achieve a lot in building
legislative support for his policies. Some local politicians who now command
the political heights may find a more deft contender for the position.
But what will make Mr Patten's governorship one of substance more than mere
style is the political structure he leaves behind.
To many in the colony the conduct of the 1995 elections goes to the heart of
what Britain, through Mr Patten, can leave Hong Kong.
These people want to retain a robust political structure that can bolster
the colony's free press, its independent judiciary, and Hong Kong's open
environment for business.
Already forces are marshalling to prevent the 1995 elections from being
conducted fairly. The CRC has joined with pro-Beijing legislators to endorse
proposals for the elections designed to reduce the representation of the
Democrats, who swept last September's elections, in favour of themselves.
Britain is unlikely to convince China of the need for more popularly elected
seats in the 1995 elections, in spite of London's commitment to raise the
issue with Beijing. But what many want, at the very least, is elections in
1995 that are conducted fairly.

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S Social Democratic party, one of two army-imposed political
parties, was poised last night to take control of both chambers of a new
National Assembly after the country's first parliamentary elections in
nearly a decade of military rule.
The elections, marred by incidents of fighting at polling booths on
Saturday, mark the penultimate step in the return of black Africa's most
populous country to civilian rule next January.
Final parliamentary election results will indicate which party is likely to
win the critical presidential elections in December. While there are few
policy differences between the army-written manifestos of the two political
parties, the victory of the pro-welfare SDP over its conservative opponent,
the National Republican Convention, is likely to encourage criticism of and
opposition to the government's economic austerity programme.
With almost 90 per cent of the ballot counted for the 593-member House of
Representatives, Nigerian state radio said the SDP had won 287 seats to the
NRC's 221, and was leading in the race for the 91-seat Senate by 43 to 323.
Results suggested a low turnout of about 25 per cent with both parties
drawing support from their tribal and regional political strongholds.
Party election officials said the low turnout was a result of voters'
distaste for the open ballot system in which people had to queue for several
hours in the morning heat behind a poster of their chosen candidate.
Pro-democracy activists in Lagos said the poor turnout was also a sign of
how alienated most Nigerians feel by an artificial and undemocratic
political system which has been dictated by the military regime of Gen
Ibrahim Babangida.
Results from the 30 states of the federation showed the SDP had won a
landslide victory in Lagos, Nigeria's huge commercial capital, and in the
Yoruba speaking states of the southwest like Ogun, Ondo and Oyo.
The SDP was also making a strong showing in so called multi-ethnic 'middle
belt' states such as Plateau and Kwara. The NRC was sweeping the
traditionally conservative and Moslem Hausa-Fulani states in the north and
was marginally ahead in the predominantly Igbo-speaking east and south-east.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Thailand scraps deal to build elevated railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THAI authorities have cancelled an agreement with a consortium led by
SNC-Lavalin of Canada to build a Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.4bn) elevated
railway system known as Skytrain, one of a series of mass transit projects
designed to alleviate traffic congestion in Bangkok.
In Montreal at the weekend, the SNC group confirmed that the Expressway and
Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA) had declared void an agreement
signed in February to build the Skytrain, but it said SNC-Lavalin would
continue negotiations with the ETA in an attempt to reach satisfactory
terms.
The Skytrain is the oldest of three planned elevated railway systems for
Bangkok and the idea dates back 17 years.
Construction for the other two projects - a Dollars 3.2bn combination of
property development, roads and rail lines being undertaken by Hopewell of
Hong Kong, and a Dollars 700m elevated rail system proposed by local
property developer Tanayong - is expected to begin soon, according to the
heads of the two companies.
ETA officials in Bangkok said the SNC-Lavalin consortium had failed to meet
a June 22 deadline for the various proposed Skytrain investors to sign an
agreement on subscriptions to the project's Dollars 400m equity. They also
complained that SNC-Lavalin wanted to renegotiate the February contract to
include new guarantees for the investors.
Members of the SNC-Lavalin consortium in Bangkok declined to comment
directly on the ETA's decision, but one executive suggested that opponents
of Skytrain were claiming that the system would not have enough capacity to
meet demand. 'It's the perception of people on what light rail is and what
heavy rail is,' he said. 'The vehicles are light but the capacity is heavy.'
SNC-Lavalin apparently faces more fundamental problems, however, including
the difficulty of raising loans for the project after the political violence
in Thailand in May, and the reluctance of some members of the consortium to
subscribe to their proposed equity shares.
Thai newspapers said at the weekend that the government of Mr Anand
Panyarachun, the interim prime minister, was likely to make a final decision
on the matter at a cabinet meeting tomorrow . The government could call for
new bids on the Skytrain project.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONALIST Croat leaders in Bosnia-Hercegovina at the weekend proclaimed an
independent Croatian state, in a move which could undermine international
attempts to end the bloodshed in the former Yugoslav republic.
The creation of the state, to be known as Herceg-Bosnia, is in line with a
secret pact between Serbia and Croatia to divide Bosnia. Militant Serb
leaders from Bosnia yesterday welcomed the proclamation, Belgrade Radio
reported.
The proclamation was made by Mr Mate Boban, a leading politician of the
Bosnian Croatian Democratic Union, sister-party of the ruling party in
Croatia. Earlier this year, he took part in secret talks with Serbian
leaders on plans to divide the republic between Croatia and Serbia. Sarajevo
Radio reported the Croatian flag will fly in the territory and the Croatian
dinar be used, but did not detail the exact relationship with Croatia.
Herceg-Bosnia is thought to cover about one-third of Bosnia, from Neum, on
the Adriatic, through Kiseljak to Bosanski Brod, on Bosnia's northern border
with Croatia. It includes territory with concentrations of ethnic Croats,
who make up 17 per cent of Bosnia's 4.35m population. Croat forces, backed
by Zagreb, have launched an offensive in the south of the republic, gaining
control of Mostar, capital-designate of the new Croatian state.
The Croat proclamation follows a similar one on April 7 of a Serbian state
covering 65 per cent of Bosnian territory. Serb forces control over half
Bosnia, and for three months have besieged Sarajevo, trying to partition the
Bosnian capital. Creation of such states would be at the expense of Bosnia's
Moslems, who at 44 per cent of the population are the largest ethnic group.
In Sarajevo, Gen Satish Nambiar, commander of the UN peace-keeping force,
held separate talks with Bosnia's national leaders. Anti-aircraft fire eased
after weekend clashes threatened to imperil an airlift of relief supplies to
the capital. Sixteen more aircraft arrived yesterday, bringing the weekend
total to 28.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Poles back Bush on trip to Warsaw
</HEADLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH came to Warsaw yesterday to bury one long-dead Polish
prime minister and receive the unstinting praise of its current president.
His five-hour foray into Warsaw, en route to the G7 summit in Munich, was
perhaps conceived as much with domestic politics as diplomacy in mind.
There are an estimated 12m Polish Americans. It therefore did Mr Bush no
harm to have President Lech Walesa say, albeit undiplomatically, that if he
were an American he would vote for Mr Bush in November. Mr Walesa is, after
all, probably more revered in the US than he is at present in Poland.
Nor could there be any doubt that the sizeable crowd in Castle Square
appreciated Mr Bush's gesture in personally bringing back home the ashes of
Ignacy Paderewski, the pianist who symbolised the cause of Polish
independence in the dark days at the start of the second world war.
Paderewski's remains had lain in Arlington National Cemetery outside
Washington at the behest of President Franklin Roosevelt 'until Poland would
be free'. That day, Mr Bush proclaimed yesterday, had now come.
There was some substance amid the symbolism of the president's mission. The
US would, he announced, allocate its unused Dollars 200m (Pounds 100m)
contribution to Poland's currency stabilisation fund to other uses 'once
Poland is back on track with the IMF'. This sum might be used, he said, to
help finance Polish exports or the capitalisation of banks to support new
businesses. He promised to press the cause of aid to Poland at the summit.
But mostly his purpose, as outlined in a speech after the Paderewski funeral
mass, was to link Poland with 'the American dream,' past and present.
Traditionally, Polish Americans, in the big cities such as Chicago,
Milwaukee, Cleveland and New York, have been working-class Democrats.
President Ronald Reagan made inroads into this opposition stronghold by
inveighing against the 'evil empire' that was the Soviet Union. Mr Bush
needs to hold on to these gains. So, in bringing home the ashes of a Polish
patriot, he was campaigning as effectively as he would in the union halls
and bars of the mid-west. The applause and chants of his name wafting over
Castle Square yesterday afternoon far exceeded in their warmth and
spontaneity anything he can expect back home.
Mr Bush's visit to Warsaw offered a fleeting break for Poland's politicians,
busy with their long search for a government with a stable parliamentary
majority, Christopher Bobinski adds from Warsaw. At the weekend seven
parties agreed to back Ms Hanna Suchocka, 46, a lawyer from the pro-market
Democratic Union, for prime minister. Mr Walesa has to approve the choice,
which marks the end of efforts by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, head of the PSL
farmers' party, to form a government.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Munich finds G7 summit a heady brew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Horst Kohler, state secretary in Germany's finance ministry, and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's seemingly indefatigable sherpa for the world
economic summit, is adamant it is not all pre-cooked.
It is certainly not for want of trying.
He has spent months frantically shuttling around the capitals of the G7
states, and Moscow, to ensure nothing goes wrong on the day.
His other great aim, on the chancellor's instructions, has been to try to
restore the summit's old style of a cosy fireside chat. He has succeeded in
cancelling a whole plenary session - when all the accompanying retinue of
foreign, finance and trade ministers try to get in on the act - in favour of
four hours' more debate among the great men.
But tell the good citizens of Munich that the whole exercise is about an
intimate and unpredictable conversation, and you get nothing but a hollow
laugh. For the capital of the proud Free State of Bavaria has been thrown
into turmoil for weeks because of the pre-planned razzamatazz, and the
citizens are feeling sore.
There is no sign of slackening in the circus - half security overkill, half
media madness - which traditionally surrounds the event. Only here it has
been compounded by the absolute determination of the Bavarian government to
ensure everyone enjoys it in style.
For a start some 8,600 policemen and women have been drafted in to ensure
security. Don't try to ask them the way. 'I'm sorry, I've just come from
Thuringia,' said a confused young man from the former East Germany. It's a
good sign of the times. If he was a policeman under the old regime, he
probably would not have apologised first.
They've cordoned off most of the city centre for the three-day event,
threatening traffic chaos when shop workers return. And people who live in
apartments overlooking the Residenz palace and Hofgarten where the summit
takes place have been forced to buy passes for DM18 (Pounds 6.20) apiece to
get in and out of their own homes - at least according to Bavarian TV.
There's no doubt the media provide most of the madness. Around the famous
Wittelsbach palace everything is festooned with the electronic wiring and
gadgetry which demonstrates that communication is what it's all about. The
corridors of the palace are filled with assault teams of
bright-pink-blazered ladies from Deutsche Telekom, advertising every
intricacy of Germany's idiosyncratic telephone system, which seems scarcely
compatible with most of the imported US and Japanese equipment. Cursing
correspondents tear their hair.
As for the world leaders' ladies, they get their own programme, which makes
no concessions to equal rights: lunch with Frau Hannelore Kohl in the
appropriately named Englischer Garten, sightseeing, Bizet's Carmen at the
Opera, more sightseeing (the fairy-tale castles of Hohenschwangau and
Neuschwanstein), a fashion show and a porcelain factory. All very feminine.

NATO and the Belgian chief of staff have made highly unusual appeals to the
government over its plans for huge defence cuts which include an end to
conscription, according to a television report, Reuters reports from
Brussels.
Belgium's centre-left government said on Friday it would end military
conscription by 1994, which will roughly halve the 86,000-strong armed
forces. Defence spending would also stay below current levels for at least
five years.
BRT television reported on Saturday that the country's chief of staff,
General Jose Charlier, had written to the government complaining that the
plan was unworkable and that it would be impossible to maintain Nato
commitments.
It also said Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner had asked Belgian Prime
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to reconsider the plans. There was no comment from
Nato.

MR Sixto Duran was set to become the next president of Ecuador, according to
exit polls issued at the close of voting in the presidential election's
second round which was held yesterday.
Mr Duran, 70, who had been a presidential candidate twice previously, was
given 56.4 per cent of the votes by Ecuavisa television compared with 43.6
per cent for his rival and fellow right-winger, Mr Jaime Nebot, a former
state governor. There were more than 5.7m registered voters in the country
of 10m people.
Mr Duran, a former cabinet minister and mayor of Quito, said he would be
leading a government of 'action, progress and unity'.
Economist Mr Alberto Dahik, who will be vice-president, is a free-market
supporter. The new government has promised to pare down the state
bureaucracy and ensure a stronger role for the private sector and foreign
investors.
Mr Duran's and Mr Dahik's parties - the Republican Union and the
Conservative party - have only 17 of the 77 seats in Congress between them.
The president-elect will have to form alliances with other political groups
when he takes over for a four-year term from Mr Rodrigo Borja, a moderate
leftist who was ineligible for re-election, on August 10.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Major hoping for early Gatt deal: Trade likely to be among
the issues figuring in G7 talks starting today in Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MUNICH, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the UK prime minister, said at the weekend that the countries
negotiating the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks were
'sufficiently close to an agreement to make a real effort to get one, and
get one without delay'.
Speaking after Saturday's EC-Japanese summit in London, and in the run-up to
this week's Group of Seven talks in Munich, he said that reaching a
conclusion to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round as soon as
possible was 'an imperative' for political, economic and humanitarian
reasons.
He said there were still difficulties to be overcome. But there was a
collective agreement at Saturday's talks, attended by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the Japanese prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, the EC commission
president, that a satisfactory outcome should be pursued 'as speedily as
possible'.
Mr Major said he expected the problems of the trade round would be discussed
in Munich, where the G7 leaders today open their annual economic summit.
However, he said the issue might be addressed in bilateral meetings rather
than at the main summit of the leading industrial countries.
US President George Bush and French President Francois Mitterrand were
reported to have narrowed differences over agriculture that have stalled
Gatt talks, at a dinner meeting last night. Mr Mitterrand's spokesman said:
'On the key question of agriculture the positions have moved closed together
and the prospect of global balanced accord is quite possible to envisage.'
However, French officials tempered the optimism, saying the EC had made all
the concessions it could on farm exports. The Gatt talks have stumbled over
US demands for cuts in subsidised EC cereal exports.
Efforts were being made yesterday for Mr Delors to meet Mr Bush tomorrow.
Mr Major's assertions raise the danger of seriously embarrassing the G7 if
no headway is made in Munich. G7 leaders have called for urgent settlement
of the Uruguay Round at two previous summits, to no effect.
Mr Major said there was no doubt that a Gatt agreement would be a
'significant stimulus' to world trade at a time when it was flagging,
unemployment was rising in many countries and growth was falling. Britain
also wanted an agreement because it would be of particular help for
developing countries.
The Japanese mission, led by Mr Miyazawa, had visited Washington before
arriving in London to demonstrate close ties with the US.
At the London meeting between leaders from the EC and Japan, Mr Delors
suggested the two should set up an expert group to analyse the cause of
Japan's trade surplus, which has re-emerged as a source of tension since it
rose to a record Dollars 27.4bn (Pounds 14.3bn) in the 1991 fiscal year. Mr
Miyazawa said he wanted to look at details of the proposal further, but
would want such a group to examine discrimination measures targeted at Japan
by some European countries.
Of specific concern were quantitative restraints on a total of 49 Japanese
exports - ranging from cars and motor cycles to pineapples and light bulbs -
imposed by countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece.
Both sides 'recognised the need for further efforts by Japan and the
Community and its member states to increase EC exports to Japan'.
Mr Miyazawa admitted that the Japanese economy was 'slowing down rather
substantially'. But the Japanese government was prepared to inject further
resources if necessary. If the present policy of bringing forward state
spending in this year's budget failed to rally the economy it would consider
'additional fiscal measures' in the form of a supplementary budget in the
autumn.
This would include more public work investments and help for small and
medium-sized businesses, he said.
Mr Major said he had asked the Japanese prime minister whether Japan's 3.5
per cent annual growth target for the next five years was practical. He said
Mr Miyazawa told him he was confident the target could be met over five
years.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Beregovoy faces up to juggernaut: Pressure is growing on
French PM to act against blockades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<TEXT>
THE week-long national road blockade by French truckers is by far the
toughest challenge yet to Mr Pierre Beregovoy in the three months since he
became prime minister.
Yet the protests, against a new law under which drivers lose their licences
if they clock up six penalty points, are only the latest threat to public
order in recent months after the disruption of ports by a dockers' strike
and road blockages mounted by farmers in protest at European agricultural
reforms.
Opposition leaders have accused the Socialist government of losing control
of law and order. The situation is 'intolerable' and risked creating a
'breach of social cohesion', said Mr Charles Millon, parliamentary president
of the centre-right UDF and head of the regional council in Rhone-Alpes, one
of the areas worst hit.
Other opposition leaders called on the government to resume negotiations
with the truckers, which broke down on Friday night.
Mr Beregovoy yesterday took a firm stance. 'There are truck drivers who
think that blocking roads will make the government give way. The government
will not give way,' he told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper. The
government had done its best to negotiate and the new rules, which came into
effect on July 1, would be applied, he said.
All this indicates that the government and the truckers are set for a
head-on collision. Nobody in France is forecasting a clash on the scale of
1968. Yet today's chaos does have two things in common with the student
riots of that time: a surge of anarchy from the grass roots and a breakdown
of communications between the state and ordinary people.
A streak of anarchy, or at least disillusion with the political
establishment, has been developing for some time. It was seen in the large
protest vote in the March regional election.
It can also be seen in the way in which farmers' demonstrations are
organised by a recently formed splinter group, rather than by mainstream
agricultural unions. The farmers are protesting not only against the
government, but against their own establishment as well.
The truckers are the same, in that their action appears to have started as a
spontaneous outburst by disparate groups. Indeed, no union claimed formally
to represent them in the first few days of the blockage. It was only when
the government called truckers' representatives to attend negotiations on
Friday night, that a gaggle of five unions took part in what turned out to
be an indecisive meeting.
It might seem surprising that a fragmented group can mount such an effective
nationwide road block. This might be because a number of truckers are former
farmers and still have support from that sector. Fruit farmers, angered that
they were unable to deliver produce, set uo their own protest over the
weekend, blocking railway lines in the south of France and holding up 10,000
travellers. Some observers have suggested that the extreme right-wing
National Front might be lending a hand, though there is no evidence of this.
Government ineptness has also played a part. As an indication of the
inadequacy of its communications with ordinary people, today's fuss is about
a law which was voted through parliament three years ago. That it has taken
the drivers by surprise also points to the fragmented and poorly organised
nature of the truckers' unions.
Yet the fact remains that many French people are - at least for now - half
on the truckers' side. According to a poll in the Parisien newspaper last
week, 60 per cent of people approve of the protests, even if 62 per cent
also said they thought the penalty point system would improve road safety.
Yet the government jeopardised support for the plan by applying it clumsily.
The new rules came into effect just before millions of French families were
due to leave for their holidays and as France began receiving large numbers
of foreign tourists.
In other ways, today's discontent is unlike 1968. Then, France was in a
period of economic prosperity. Today the economy is growing only slowly.
This suggests that truckers, already hit by declining wages and a fall in
demand, will have few savings to support a long walkout.
Another difference is that events in 1968 were mainly a domestic problem.
France's position at the heart of western Europe, at a time when
cross-border traffic has grown fast, means the truckers today have created
an international headache.
The big question is what the government does now. Mr Beregovoy cannot afford
to let the crisis worsen. The opposition has already started to question the
government's credibility. Moreover, Mr Beregovoy has only just delayed all
contentious legislation in parliament so as to ensure a peaceful public
debate on the Maastricht treaty on European union, due for a referendum on
September 20. Clearly, that strategy has gone badly wrong.
Yet the government cannot be seen to give in. The chances are that it will
wait for public anger against the truckers to build up enough for it to be
able to use force without creating an outcry.
Despite the recent polls, the truckers are on the way to attracting real
anger in France. Four people died in road accidents over the weekend,
provoked to various degrees by the blockages, and some supermarkets say they
are short of fresh food. The pressure for action is building up.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Slovak ire seals Havel's fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE failure of President Vaclav Havel - one of the last advocates of a
unified Czech and Slovak Federation - to be re-elected to the presidency has
put another nail in the coffin of the fragile 74-year-old federation.
In a casual atmosphere, members of the federal parliament took just one hour
on Friday to remove Mr Havel from office. On the Slovak side of the
parliament, a handful of MPs managed to block the re-election of a man whose
popularity and international prestige are the envy of many world statesmen.
Mr Havel's position was compromised by the June 5 elections which brought
Slovak nationalists to power in the smaller Slovak republic.
Mr Vladimir Meciar, the leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and
the current Slovak premier, then pledged to oust the man who called on
voters not to support 'demagoguery', a thinly veiled reference to Mr
Meciar's populist campaign.
In the wake of the collapse of communism, Slovaks slowly began asserting
their identity and increased their calls on the federal authorities in
Prague for greater economic and political autonomy. By removing Mr Havel
from office, Slovak nationalists vented their frustrations at the man who
became the symbol of Prague's inability to respond to their demands.
Mr Havel continued to believe in consensus. A moralist who wanted to remain
above daily politics, he saw his beliefs dashed by the growing antagonism
between Czechs and Slovaks.
Limited by a 1968 constitution which gives little power to the presidency,
he warned well ahead of other politicians of a political development which
he was unable to influence and which today threatens to split his country.
There may be another Czechoslovak president, as the federal parliament will
vote on yet unknown candidates in the next three months.
If he is not replaced by October 5, Mr Havel is due to hand over his powers
to the parliament and the federal government.
But the new federal president, if there is one, might be only a ceremonial
figure with little political impact, unlike Mr Havel, who still enjoys wide
popularity in the Czech republic.

FT  06 JUL 92 / French PM vows firm stand over road blockades

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday vowed to hold firm
against protesting lorry drivers who have brought chaos to French roads, as
fruit farmers in the south added to the disruption by blocking rail lines
from Lyons to the Mediterranean.
The farmers later lifted their blockades after Mr Beregovoy called on the
police to remove them to release the 10,000 passengers, mostly
holidaymakers, stranded in railway stations and on trains in the Rhone-Alpes
region over the weekend.
Fruit farmers were protesting over their inability to deliver produce
because of the lorry drivers' strike, sparked by a proposed system under
which drivers lose points for motoring offences and can be banned if they
lose six.
The government opened talks with drivers' union representatives on Friday,
but these broke down early the following morning and are to start again on
Thursday.
Mr Beregovoy said: 'Like me, the truck drivers have a family who travel on
the roads, children or grandchildren who cross the road to go to school.
They must have the same concerns as I do. I say to them, one does not play
games with life, one does not play with safety.'
He has so far resisted using force against the lorry drivers, who were
maintaining their blockades yesterday afternoon. Reports on the state of
French roads varied over the weekend, the start of summer holidays for
millions of French and foreign families.
The economic cost has already affected the tourist industry at the beginning
of what was to have been a record holiday season for France. The national
hotel federation said 60 per cent of its members' expected customers had
failed to turn up since July 1, and that the situation was 'catastrophic'.
Mr Karel van Miert, European transport commissioner, said: 'This phenomenal
development cannot go on any longer because it has reached the limits of
congestion and of acceptability in public opinion.'
According to the national road information service, traffic was flowing
freely, but slowly, across most of France. It advised drivers to stay away
from the main south-eastern corridor along the Rhone valley, through Lyons
to the Mediterranean. However, the news agency AFP reported continued
hold-ups in Aquitaine, the western Pyrenees, Rhone-Alpes, and Normandy, but
the partial removal of road blocks on the motorway from Paris to Lille and
Calais.
In the Gard area of southern France, farmers emptied three Belgian and Dutch
lorries of their Spanish fruit and set the cases on fire while police
watched.
The roadblocks, the most serious threat to public order since Mr Beregovoy
came to power in April, drew wide international criticism over the weekend
because of the number of foreign motorists who have been delayed. Newspapers
in Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy condemned both the
lorry drivers and government inability to clear the roads, showing a sharper
sense of outrage than the French press.

FT  06 JUL 92 / IMF pledges Dollars 1bn for Russia: Fund chief's Moscow
visit gives boost to Yeltsin ahead of G7 summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund has agreed to give Russia a first Dollars
1bn (Pounds 524m) credit after a weekend visit to Moscow by Mr Michel
Camdessus, the IMF's managing director. The meeting gave President Boris
Yeltsin a political boost ahead of his meeting with leaders of the the Group
of Seven industrialised nations.
After Mr Yeltsin publicly accused the IMF and Mr Camdessus of not knowing
'the limits of the people's patience', the Russian government clinched an
accord with IMF negotiators on a short-term economic stabilisation programme
which is the condition for the release of the money.
Mr Camdessus, who flew into Moscow on Friday to speed up negotiations which
had been dragging on for at least a week, will ask the IMF's executive board
to disburse the funds at the beginning of August.
The agreement on the first tranche of the Dollars 4bn in IMF resources which
Russia is liable to receive this year was concluded after often acrimonious
negotiations in which much was at stake for both Moscow and the IMF on the
eve of the G7 world economic summit in Munich.
Although the terms of the accord were unclear last night, IMF requirements
had included progress by Russia in dealing with more than Rbs1,000bn in
accumulated debts owed by its enterprises to each other, and in
co-ordinating economic policy with other republics which continue to use the
rouble.
Mr Camdessus, who yesterday travelled on to Munich for the summit, which
starts today, has come under considerable political pressure to show the IMF
is sensititive to Russia's difficulties. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian
prime minister who has led market reforms, needs to show some concrete gains
for public opinion from his aggressively 'pro-western' stance.
Before meeting Mr Camdessus on Saturday, Mr Yeltsin expressed exasperation
with the west's hesitation in unblocking a promised Dollars 24bn aid package
until it is satisfied that the money will not be wasted. 'This is a normal
credit and you cannot force us to our knees. Russia is a great country and
it will not permit such a thing,' he said. Mr Yeltsin also said he would not
leave his meeting with the G7 in Munich on Wednesday without obtaining a
grace period of at least two years for repaying the former Soviet Union's
foreign debt.
The G7 leaders in turn have made IMF support a condition for large-scale
financial assistance of their own to Russia. They are considering a debt
rescheduling package for Mr Yeltsin, but there was no mention of this in a
joint communique issued by Mr Camdessus and Mr Gaidar yesterday.
Mr Camdessus is expected to brief the summit about his talks in Moscow. The
expectation was that he would meet the finance ministers of the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada tomorrow, before Wednesday's
meeting between G7 leaders and Mr Yeltsin.
Among the key issues to be discussed are the conditions to be attached to
economic assistance being prepared for Russia and other former Soviet
republics by the industrialised countries. On Saturday, Mr John Major, the
prime minister, warned that conditions should not be so strict as to be
politically unacceptable in Russia.
Mr Major said that conditionality was necessary to ensure that the
assistance was properly used and accelerated the reform process in Russia.
'There is no point in those resources being made available unless the reform
process accelerates,' he said. But he warned that a 'difficult balance' has
to be struck in ensuring that Russia would be able to meet the conditions
set by the west and 'that the terms set are not so severe that they are
politically undeliverable in Russia'.
These were issues to be decided collectively by the industrialised countries
and discussed with Mr Yeltsin in Munich this week.
Reuter adds from Moscow: Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister,
predicted yesterday that Russia would eventually join the G7.
President Bush said last week he was prepared to discuss admitting Russia
and the question would appear on the Munich agenda.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Italy lifts discount rate to stabilise currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK OF ITALY yesterday raised the discount rate by a full percentage
point to 13 per cent to stabilise the lira and fend off devaluation rumours,
which triggered heavy speculative selling of the currency late on Friday.
The decision came just as an emergency cabinet meeting convened by Italy's
new prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, proposed a series of cost-cutting and
revenue-raising measures worth L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) to tackle the huge
budget deficit.
Details of the package, aimed at plugging this year's expected overshoot in
government spending which is likely to send the deficit soaring to at least
L160,000bn, will be finalised on Mr Amato's return from the Group of Seven
summit in Munich later this week.
Central bank and government leaders will be waiting to see whether the steps
are enough to convince foreign exchange and bond dealers that the new
government is determed to maintain the lira's current parity and fight
inflation. Speaking on his arrival in Munich, Mr Amato said 'the measures
are sure to have positive effects and get us back on the track from which we
have strayed.'
Mr Amato's government received a boost on Saturday after surviving a vote of
confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of parliament.
Although failing to draw support from beyond the four parties in the
previous coalition, the vote removed one of the many uncertainties
surrounding the new government.
Among the range of measures proposed by the cabinet yesterday were a freeze
on public sector prices and a plan to limit public sector wage rises. The
government also called for more competition for public sector contracts.
Other moves to be taken after Mr Amato's return from Germany could include a
sharp increase in petrol duties and rises in other indirect taxes.
The Bank of Italy also widened from 1 to 1.5 percentage points the margin
between the discount rate and the rate at which it makes fixed-term advances
to the banking system. The new rate for advances, which was raised from 12.5
to 13 per cent last month as a first step to help the lira, has now been
pushed up to 14.5 per cent.
The decision to raise the discount rate, which was last lifted to 12 per
cent in December, followed heavy speculative attacks on the lira late on
Friday.
The lira and the Italian government bond market, which has proved
increasingly appealing to foreign investors in recent years, first came
under pressure following Denmark's 'no' vote in its referendum on the
Maastricht treaty. The outcome cast the European integration process into
doubt.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Shareholder group calls for changes to stock option plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S largest shareholder group is to call for changes to executive
stock option schemes which could cut their value in many cases by linking
benefits more closely to performance.
The proposals are part of a consultative document being prepared by the
National Association of Pension Funds, whose members have Pounds 300bn under
management. It plans to seek industry views on the document when published.
The NAPF is studying alternatives to the formula used by many companies
which links the granting of stock options to increases in earnings per
share. Alternatives under consideration would link options either to a
lagged share price over the previous year or to a ratio of share price to an
index such as the FTSE-100.
Earnings per share as a measure of corporate performance is increasingly
under attack from the accountancy profession and institutional shareholders,
who argue that the ratio is too easily subject to manipulation by senior
managment.
An NAPF official said it was seeking a new system which would be less open
to manipulation. He said that while such a system would produce more losers
than winners, it could benefit successful managers in troubled industries if
their share price out-performed those of other companies in the same sector.
The NAPF is in talks with the Association of British Insurers (ABI), the
UK's other large shareholder group, in an attempt to reach a common position
before publishing its proposals.
Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, said: 'It
will be very confusing for companies if one group of shareholders urges one
thing while another group says something else.'
The ABI has been urging companies to use an EPS formula since 1984 and sees
little reason to change.
An ABI official said the group saw no better alternative. Linking pay to
stock prices holds executives hostage to events such as war or swings in oil
prices - events which have nothing to do with how well a management has
performed.
Sir Richard Lloyd, a member of the Confederation of British Industry's
Council and the non-executive chairman at Vickers, said non-executives on
remuneration committees had increasingly questioned the link between options
and bonuses and EPS. 'Because executives are quite keen to earn their
bonuses whenever they can, they have been tempted to put restructuring costs
into the 'extraordinary items' line.' The effect of this was to bolster EPS
despite a poor underlying performance.
Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, who has
criticised City analysts' preoccupation with EPS, said it was a poor gauge
of underlying corporate performance.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Monday Interview: Tireless champion of trade - Arthur
Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, talks to David Dodwell and Frances
Williams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Arthur Dunkel was born in Switzerland in 1932, the world was locked in
the Great Depression. Europe was heading for world war. The rise of
protectionism and the collapse of the multilateral trading system had played
a critical trigger role in creating the turbulent world in which he grew up:
'Too many people are still alive who learnt at school the result of
destroying the multilateral system in the 1930s, to see it happen again,' he
says.
This early experience, and an unflinching confidence in the sagesse des
nations, makes Mr Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) since 1980, confident that world leaders gathering
today in Munich for the Group of Seven summit can rise above domestic
economic and political difficulties to rescue the long-stalled Uruguay Round
of talks on world trade liberalisation: 'Surely you did not think the
director-general of Gatt could say the round is dead?' he smiled over a
first Gitanes cigarette.
For the past 18 months, progress in the Uruguay Round has been stalled by a
clash between the EC and the US over liberalisation of farm trade. Since
publishing a draft agreement in December - often referred to as the Dunkel
'final act' - in an effort to concentrate minds towards conclusion of the
round, even Mr Dunkel has been a restive spectator on events: 'It was
difficult to start the Uruguay Round, but it's even more difficult to finish
it,' he reflects, with a rare hint of impatience.
Painstaking negotiation has brought the US and the EC to within inches of a
conclusion - so close that most observers are baffled that agreement remains
so elusive. Deadline after deadline has been missed in spite of the critical
importance of the round and the fact that success is predicted by various
economic models to expand international trade by about Dollars 195bn a year
by the end of the decade. Attention is being diverted by conflict in
Yugoslavia, the problems of ratifying the Treaty on European Union,
referenda in France and Canada, and elections in Japan, the US and Korea.
There is a danger that not only the world trading system, but the
institution of Gatt itself, is being jeopardised by the impasse. Mr Dunkel
has been asked to delay his retirement to March next year because of the
impossibility of finding a successor to an organisation the fate of which is
so unclear.
The ultimate deadline for completing the Uruguay Round - the expiry of the
US administration's fast-track authority, which prevents Congress from
delaying enactment by examining the round paragraph by paragraph, in March
next year - looms close. Even if EC and US leaders can put aside their
differences and reach agreement at or shortly after this week's summit,
negotiations over trade in services, and on market access, need months of
attention. Fierce disputes over shipping, financial services, and even
ostensibly small matters such as trade in bananas, lie in wait.
With a lifetime of negotiating experience behind him, and a perspective that
draws upon memories of grim periods during the early and middle 1980s - such
as the infamous ministerial meeting in 1982 at which trade war was narrowly
averted, and the walkout by Argentina and other farm exporters in Brussels
in 1990 - Mr Dunkel refuses to be overcome by the prevailing gloom.
He feels that success in negotiations over farm trade will provide the
momentum needed to resolve other outstanding differences: 'I still have
great confidence in the wisdom of nations. What we are doing is like
climbing the last few metres of Everest without oxygen: we have to train a
lot to be able to do it and the last 200 to 300 metres are tremendously
difficult.'
Mr Dunkel, slouching over his fourth Gitanes, remains unruffled by talk of
imminent deadlines: 'My ambition is to reach the point where we initial the
text with as few as possible participants saying their hands have been
forced. If we want to achieve this ideal we need time,' he says, adding
'when people are convinced it is the 11th hour', there will be a settlement.
He remains confident that success will eventually come because publication
of the 'final act' took talks 'beyond the point of no return', and because
it provided negotiators for the first time with a concrete picture of what
stood to be gained: 'The round has had more results than we think.'
Throughout the turbulent and often hostile talks since 1982, when a new
trade round was first proposed, 'the reality is that we have moved. A large
number of governments have reformed their policies very much in line with
the (multilateral) objectives of Gatt.'
He believes that the Uruguay Round has been so difficult because it is
'completely different' from previous rounds. Its dauntingly wide-ranging
agenda, covering everything from textiles to telecommunications, touches
upon areas that governments have always regarded as their autonomous
preserve - such as domestic farm subsidies or rules on services and
intellectual property.
Compared with previous negotiating rounds, which he describes as 'a sort of
exercise among small groups of government specialists', he says that in the
current talks 'people in the street see a direct link between the round and
what they are doing.'
Glancing wistfully at a tiny oil painting of Punta del Este, where the
Uruguay Round agenda was set in train in 1986, he rebuts any suggestions
that its aims were unrealistically ambitious: 'If you have no ambition, you
never do anything. Can someone tell me it was wrong to put order into
agriculture? Was it wrong to want to bring textiles into the Gatt - which
were setting a bad example in other areas. Wasn't it right to put services
into the round? Of course it was right. We need a multilateral system in
these areas.'
The result of the pressures to include these areas is that the Uruguay Round
agenda is 'perfectly logical and defendable', now it is an immensely heavy
agenda.
Part of Mr Dunkel's optimism springs from a belief that, for the countries
involved, there is little alternative to agreement. Failure of negotiations
would leave unresolved the problems that forced trading countries to the
negotiating table in the first place. As a result, Mr Dunkel believes that
the round could not be broken off for long. 'If we came to the tragic
situation of missing the fantastic opportunities the round is offering, I
will think it was an accident. I am sure that very soon afterwards
governments will come together and relaunch the round.'
For the moment, Mr Dunkel is faced with the paradox that just as
commentators are talking of the world trading system on the brink of
collapse, the Gatt is being used more extensively than ever before. It is
seeing unprecedented activity in handling disputes, examining regional trade
agreements, reviewing countries' trade policies, not to mention dealing with
a long queue of applications for accession and observer status.
It is also closer than at any time in its history to having a membership
that embraces the entire world. The collapse of the Soviet empire has
brought dozens of countries that historically have been outside the Gatt
system to the organisation's doors. This includes not just eastern European
countries such as the Baltic states and Czechoslovakia, but also Mongolia
and other former Soviet republics, and Vietnam. China and Taiwan are
expected to be full members within a year.
Success in the round would of course put Mr Dunkel into the history books,
but here he is modest: 'Success or failure doesn't depend on one person. It
will be a collective result. If we succeed, lots will want to say they
played a part. If we fail, I suspect there will be people looking for
scapegoats.'
Either way, by this time next year, he is likely to have moved aside. At
present, he is keeping options open for his 'fourth life' - his first three
having been his student days, his service in the Swiss government service,
and most recently his leadership of Gatt. 'Perhaps I could write a book
analysing the negotiating process in the Gatt.' After his experience in
smoke-filled rooms, it would be a long, but no doubt worthwhile, read.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: UK rates stay high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve's decision to cut its discount rate on Thursday
probably means the dollar will remain under severe pressure this week,
writes Emma Tucker.
Another cut could follow. 'The key message to heed is that the Fed has
strongly signalled its concerns about the economy and thus further easing
cannot yet be ruled out,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ
International, the securities wing of the Japanese bank.
The Fed's move was also an uncomfortable reminder to UK markets that
interest rates in Britain remain extremely high and that the government has
lost the flexibility, enjoyed by the US authorities, to cut rates when it
desires.
By the end of last week, the US move had sparked speculation that pressure
would now grow for Germany to cut its rates, allowing other European
countries in the ERM to reduce theirs.
Although the Group of Seven leading industrial nations are likely to try to
redress global trade imbalances by talking up the yen at this week's Munich
summit, they are unlikely to bring about a general cut in European rates.
Indeed, any hopes of a rate cut, amid much speculation at the end of last
week, were dashed when British government officials said they did not expect
there would be any immediate commitments to reduce interest rates arising
from the meeting.
Rumours of a realignment of the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System were also dismissed by UK officials.
'Clearly there is a wish on the part of Germany's partners for there to be
lower German interest rates but it is not being approached in the sense of
saying: 'please, cut them here and now,'' said an official last week.

FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Gilts: Weak economy pulls in the buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE evidence of economic weakness in the UK pushed up demand for gilts, led
by many large institutions anxious to build up their bond portfolios at the
expense of equities.
Speculation about a possible cut in base rates over the next few weeks
helped to force down yields for most classes of gilts.
The general demand for gilts - following the underlying pattern in the gilt
market for much of this year - caused a rise of nearly 2 points at the long
end of the market. Yields slipped by about 20 basis points.
Evidence of the fragility of the UK economy came with news that the savings
ratio - personal savings as a percentage of disposable income - hit 11.5 per
cent in the first quarter. This was up by 1.5 points on the fourth quarter
of last year, to the highest level for nearly a decade.
With the Treasury almost daily receiving more reports of economic weakness,
many commentators are reducing their forecasts for growth this year in the
UK to around zero, after a drop in gross domestic product last year of 2.4
per cent.
While such gloomy scenarios lead to poor prospects for equities, the low
inflationary pressures likely over the next year make gilts a tempting
investment for many institutions. That was underlined by Bank of England
figures last week indicating that such bodies bought Pounds 5.9bn worth of
gilts in April and May.
Further signs, meanwhile, of weak upward pressure on prices throughout the
economy are likely on Friday when the Central Statistical Office is expected
to announce that the retail prices index increased by just 4.1 per cent in
the year to June, after 4.3 per cent in May.
After the cut in US interest rates last week by the Federal Reserve, with a
view to stimulating the lacklustre US economy, technical operations on the
money market by the Bank of England fuelled expectations of an early cut in
UK base rates, now 10 per cent.
But while such a move would go down well with the US - which at this week's
Munich economic summit of the seven richest nations is expected to push for
concerted measures to boost world growth - the pound's weakness in the
exchange rate mechanism probably rules out a base rate cut for the time
being.
All the signs are that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will continue for
some time with his policy of not risking a possible slide in sterling by a
rate cut. That seems at a point when UK short-term rates are only 25 basis
points above the equivalent German rates.
While the gilt market would be quite happy to see a cut in rates of perhaps
a quarter of a percentage point - a move which would boost prices at the
short end - it is equally at home with the prospect of Mr Lamont's policy of
high interest rates squeezing out the last drop of inflationary pressure
from the economy for some months to come.
The Bank announced it will make available from today Pounds 700m of new gilt
issues; Pounds 200m of 10 per cent conversion stock due 1996; Pounds 200m of
9 1/2 Treasury loan stock maturing 1999; Pounds 200m of 9 per cent Treasury
loan due 2008; and Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked Treasury
stock, expiring in 2013.

FT  06 JUL 92 / US Money and Credit: Fast reactions from worried politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRAZY things are supposed to happen in election years. Certainly the
near-instantaneous cut in the US discount rate which accompanied appalling
unemployment figures released last Thursday, smacked of some very worried
politicians.
For the bond market, however, this meant that July 4 fireworks arrived a few
days early. A very sharp rally in bond prices began at 8.30am, as soon as
the Labor Department figures hit the screens. By the end of the day, the
benchmark longbond had gained almost 1 1/2 points, while its yield had
slumped from 7.74 per cent to 7.63 per cent. This was the lowest closing
yield for the issue since late January.
In other parts of the bond market, reaction was even more marked. At the
short end, for example, the rate on three-month Treasury bills slumped to
3.24 per cent, said to be the lowest since the early 1970s.
The point is that no one now expects Thursday's cut to be the last. The
unemployment data were truly awful - showing that employers cut payrolls by
117,000 last month, pushing the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent in May,
from 7.5 per cent in April. Most pundits had been looking for an improvement
in the jobs situation last month; instead, the unemployment rate stands at
an eight-year high.
Worse, this news came on the heels of some other disappointing data,
underlining the widespread weakness in the economy. The June index from the
National Association of Purchasing Managers, for instance, suggested that
although the manufacturing sector grew last month, the rate of increase was
lower than in May.
And, at the beginning of the week, housing statistics showed that new home
sales fell for the fourth month in a row, putting May's levels about 20 per
cent below their January peak.
But at least part of the jobs problem is structural, suggesting that 'a
quick fix' will be tough to achieve. A number of leading industries - from
banking to airlines - are undergoing very significant consolidations at
present, shedding jobs and reducing capacity en route.
Cheap money is unlikely to alter this process. Equally, sizeable cutbacks in
defence spending continue to hurt; only last week, Hughes Aircraft
Corporation announced that it would axe around 15 per cent of its workforce
over the next 18 months - in excess of 9,000 jobs.
So it is highly questionable whether Thursday's cut of 50 basis points in
the discount rate, to 3 per cent, will be enough. Most pundits suggest that
the speed of Thursday's response indicates that the Federal Reserve has now
abandoned its neutral stance towards interest rate policy, even if officials
are still divided.
'The Fed's kneejerk reaction to reduce the discount rate . . . says a great
deal more about the Fed than the state of the US economy,' comment analysts
at Nomura. 'To respond so quickly . . . indicates a state of near-panic
among the Fed governors. It measures the extent of their desire to achieve
economic growth at the expense of other economic objectives.'
Mr Robert Brusca, at Nikko Securities, puts the point more bluntly still.
'Mr Greenspan (Federal Reserve chairman) is in very hot water. The Federal
Reserve he has presided over may have botched recovery on two separate
occasions, and now he must testify before the house and senate banking
committees beginning on July 21. This does not give him much time to act.'
Like virtually every pundit on Wall Street, Mr Brusca suggests that further
easing will follow - the only question being when. It is after all, an
election year.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Italian Bonds: Signs of fatigue as sentiment sours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENTIMENT in the Italian government bond market has turned sour in the past
month, with dealers warning of market fatigue.
International investors have shunned the Italian market due to the political
vacuum left by April's general election and the more recent rejection by
Denmark of the Maastricht treaty which cast doubts on Italy's commitment to
meet the European Community's convergence requirements for Economic and
Monetary Union.
The news sent bond prices plummeting: Italy was the worst performing of 21
leading bond markets, with a fall of 1.26 per cent in June. Although a new
prime minister has been nominated, the bond market has remained extremely
volatile as investors have been forced to re-examine Italy's long-term
economic prospects.
The new government of Mr Giuliano Amato, a former Treasury minister, may
represent a serious attempt to get to grips with the country's immense
structural economic problems.
The market has lost patience with a political process which has been
painfully slow. Should a tough economic package not be announced very soon,
last week's selling could just be the prelude to a more severe crisis in the
market.
The problems have been exacerbated by a devaluation scare, with the Bank of
Italy being forced to intervene on several occasions to support the lira.
Yesterday the Bank of Italy said it would raise the official discount rate
from 12 per cent to 13 per cent with effect from Monday in order to defend
the currency.
Few dealers seriously believe the devaluation rumours which swept the market
in June, triggering heavy speculative pressure on the currency. Most
recognise that altering the exchange rate would only damage the fight
against inflation, which both Mr Amato and the Bank of Italy insist is their
main priority.
Mastering inflation, which fell to 5.5 per cent last month from 5.7 per cent
in May, is the single most important factor in overcoming the immense debt
burden. With by far the bulk of the deficit composed of interest payments,
the emphasis on lower inflation, which would trigger lower interest rates,
is understandable.
At last week's auctions, the cover ratio (the total amount of bids relative
to the amount of bonds on offer) was far lower than a few months ago, with
foreign investors shunning the market.
The auctions point to troubles ahead when the government issues much larger
quantities of debt. The market is waiting to see what the government can
offer to persuade it to meet its needs.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Syndicated Loans: Borrowers search elsewhere for funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the international syndicated loans market plummeted in the first
half of 1992 as borrowers scaled back their bank financing and turned to the
international bond and equity markets instead for funding.
Syndicated lending amounted to Dollars 163.9bn in the first six months,
which is 32 per cent lower than the Dollars 241.6bn in the first half of
1991, and 44 per cent below the Dollars 291.6bn in the second half of 1991,
according to figures supplied by Euromoney Publications. 'This is the
quietest half-year I've ever seen,' said one loans adviser at a European
bank.
Syndicated lending in the US and Canada amounted to Dollars 86.9bn in the
first half, against Dollars 124.2bn and Dollars 165.6bn in the first and
second halves of 1991 respectively.
Lending to western European borrowers also showed a marked decline to
Dollars 30.9bn compared with Dollars 49.2bn and Dollars 60.3bn in the first
and second halves of last year.
Bankers blame the recession in the Anglo-Saxon economies for the drop in
borrowing by US and European companies, as the slowdown in economic growth
has depressed takeover activity and reduced investment in capital equipment.
The increase in the level of pricing over the past three years has also
deterred many companies from arranging large facilities simply for the sake
of it. In the mid to late-1980s many companies set up Multi-Option
Facilities (Mofs), attracted by their cheapness - in some cases the
facilities only cost around 6 to 10 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate (Libor). As these facilities approach maturity, companies seem
reluctant to refinance them at today's high level of pricing.
While demand from borrowers for syndicated loans has clearly fallen, the
banks themselves have come under pressure to lend more prudently and place
more emphasis on credit analysis.
Mr Hans Meissner, executive director at Credit Suisse First Boston, says:
'Lenders have been bruised by loans which have gone wrong - just look at
Maxwell, Canary Wharf, and Heron International.'
While most bankers agree that 1992 has been an abysmal year so far in terms
of lending volumes, a few have suggested that the decline in volume may not
be quite as severe as indicated by the official figures.
Some corporate borrowing is deliberately hidden from the public gaze in the
form of private club deals and bilateral loans, often because the borrower
does not want to be seen paying generously for its credit or risk the public
humiliation of an unsuccessful deal.

FT  06 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Crawling back to the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If we are now watching a replay of the 1930s, as fashionable pessimism has
it - and I find it strangely uncomfortable to be in tune with the fashion -
it is a replay in slow motion. The great bull market is over, but it is a
sag rather than a collapse; unemployment is rising, but it is only a third
of the way up to its peaks 60 years ago; the financial markets are
shrinking, but there are no falling bodies.
The question now is whether a dispirited system will retrace the paths first
hacked out by the survivors of complete demoralisation. These led to
protectionism to preserve jobs; to officially encouraged cartelisation; and
to tight financial regulation, eagerly embraced by an industry desperate to
re-establish its respectability.
The idea that such unfashionable ideas should become official policy may
still seem unthinkable, but the preconditions do not look so implausible.
They are first, that job protection should become the dominant political
issue - as it already is for French lorry-drivers and farmers, and for the
new populists in Germany and Italy.
Second, the pains of competition must seem greater than its rewards, a view
already reflected in stock market valuations. The politicians are still
involved in the agenda of the 1980s, seeking freer markets and lower
inflation, but the voters are making it ever harder to persist.
For the financial markets, the issue is simpler. Once they are seen to be
unable to raise primary capital, as they were in New York after the 1929
crash, reform becomes a necessity. This is already the case in Tokyo, where
the scandals which have frightened outsiders away are still multiplying.
It seems, more puzzlingly, to be happening in London, though on the face of
it more from distrust of present price levels than of the institutions which
set the prices. Across the Channel, and in New York, where the bulls looked
convincing until last week, the picture is not yet nearly so bad.
All the same it is difficult for a Londoner to believe that the drift - call
it the long cycle, if that is the way your mind works - is indeed back
towards the past. The economic situation argues for it: it is hard to
imagine a plausible recovery strong enough to banish disillusion. The state
of the City points the same way.
The parade of scandals might be dismissed as the ugly jetsam which is left
behind by every falling financial tide, were it not for the damage they have
done and continue to do to the prestige of the whole system, and to any
surviving faith in self-regulation.
To start at the top, the Bank of England's dithering over BCCI, the DTI's
attempted evasions over Barlow Clowes, and now the PM's censoring of the
Bingham report look like wise-monkey strategy, not so much a cover-up as a
belief in least said, soonest mended. It leaves the authorities looking weak
and evasive.
The clearing banks look not so much weak as weak-minded after their eager
pursuit of bad loans. City 'experts' can plead that their fatuous optimism
about the outlook for the economy and for profits was officially inspired,
but not for errors like Polly Peck. It is a vista of incompetence, or worse.
There is incompetence and worse in the insurance market. The troubles of
Lloyd's make good popular reading, like a Royal marriage; but the society's
sauve-qui-peut response to the crisis looks like old yuppy greed gone stale.
And now, as new premium demands drop through ordinary letterboxes, people
will realise that you do not have to be a name to suffer from bad
underwriting judgment. The picture presented outside is not of criminality,
as in Tokyo, but of over-paid, under-regulated and gutless foolishness,
which may be even more damaging in the long run.
And we are only at the beginning. The press has turned investigative instead
of fawning. When the true cost of life, household and car insurance is more
widely known, and if savings and pensions are eroded by slow-footed
investment management, the last defences will be down.
Whatever happens to the economy, the City is likely to need a self-defensive
clean-up.

FT  06 JUL 92 / International Bonds: US companies dominate new issues league
table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE amounts raised in the international bond and equity markets reached
record levels in the first six months of 1992.
Eurobond market new issue volume jumped to Dollars 148bn from Dollars 130bn,
according to IFR Securities Data, due to strong growth in a number of
European currency sectors. In the international equities market, companies
raised Dollars 12.9bn through initial public offerings (IPOs), primary and
secondary issues, compared with Dollars 8.98bn in the first half of 1991 and
Dollars 7.4bn in the second half of last year, according to IFR.
US companies dominate the equity league tables, raising Dollars 5.08bn with
113 separate tranches of stock in the first six months. Nearly half of this
was raised by one company - General Motors - which drew Dollars 2.14bn from
investors in May.
Western European companies raised Dollars 2.19bn in international offerings
while Latin American companies issued Dollars 4.2bn of equity, with Mexican
companies accounting for Dollars 2.76bn. However, the recent weakness of the
world's stock markets has prompted the cancellation or postponement of a
number of offerings. GPA, the aircraft leasing group, cancelled its Dollars
800m flotation as investors' concerns about the company meant there was
insufficient demand for the issue.
Last week, Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the third largest soft drink manufacturer in
the US, pulled out of its plan to go public in a Dollars 600m stock issue
due to unfavourable market conditions, while Banacci, the Mexican financial
services group, has postponed indefinitely its Dollars 1.4bn global stock
offering.
Investment bankers warn that volume may dip in the second half of the year,
unless stock market performance improves. In the international bond markets,
the calendar for new issue activity remains heavy. Although investor
appetite for paper is rather subdued, many borrowers are still some way from
meeting their funding needs.
Mr Len Harwood, head of capital markets at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says:
'Borrowers will need to be as flexible as possible to achieve not only price
but volume objectives.' The French and German markets, which have already
grown substantially this year, are likely to expand further. In part, this
expansion will be fuelled by the need to take up the slack in the Ecu bond
market, which has stalled in the aftermath of the Danish referendum on
Maastricht, and is likely to remain rather subdued, at least until the
French referendum in September.
In the first half of the year, volume in the D-Mark sector increased from
Dollars 9bn to Dollars 14.8bn, which helped put Germany's largest bank,
Deutsche Bank, at the top of the bookrunners' league table. The sector is
set to grow further following the Bundesbank's further liberalisation of
rules governing issuance.
Issuance in the French franc sector rose from Dollars 5.5bn last year to
Dollars 12bn, as the market's improving liquidity, boosted by the use of
fungible issues, continued to attract growing international interest.
The growth in the Lira sector - Dollars 7.2bn of new issues so far this
year, compared with Dollars 5bn over the same period in 1991 - may be harder
to sustain, as the Italian bond market has suffered a severe setback in the
wake of the Danish vote.
The dollar sector remained by far the largest, at Dollars 46bn, up from
Dollars 42bn in the first half of 1991, despite the continued shrinkage of
Japanese equity-linked offerings, which once made up the bulk of the market.
In the first half of last year, Japanese corporations relied on bonds with
equity warrants attached for about 50 per cent of their financings. This
year only 18 per cent of their financings have had equity warrants.
The continuing need for Japanese companies to refinance equity-linked bonds
issued in the 1980s will help boost new issue activity. Japanese companies
had assumed that the exercise of the warrants would finance the redemption
of bonds. But many warrants are set to expire without being exercised,
because of the weakness of the stock market.
A number of other large offerings is expected in the next month or so. The
World Bank is preparing a global offering of Dollars 1.5bn five or 10-year
bonds due to be launched early this week; a yen global offering is also
believed to be in the pipeline, and Ontario Hydro is preparing another
global bond offering.
Despite the heavy volume, business has been less profitable than in 1991
when the bullish tone in bond markets boosted trading profits. This year
market swings have left banks and securities firms holding loss-making
positions.

FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: Investors back Hafnia DKr2bn
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAFNIA Holding, the parent of Denmark's second largest insurance group, last
night avoided going into receivership by securing the backing of its
institutional investors and main bankers for a DKr2bn rights issue today.
The institutional investors said they and the banks would guarantee the
issue after auditors worked through the weekend to establish the true state
of the group's finances.
This follows the revelation late on Friday that irregular dealings by a
senior manager have cost Hafnia an estimated DKr350m (Dollars 59.9m). This
means the group has a negative equity capital of DKr450m, according to a
statement on Friday to the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. However the group
asked the exchange to lift the suspension of its share quotation, which took
effect on Wednesday, to enable trading in a new rights share issue to begin
today.
Mr Holger Lavesen, chairman of the supervisory board, had said on Friday
that the issue would only go ahead if investigations into the company's
affairs did not to turn up any new skeletons. Until the investigation was
completed, Mr Lavesen said he could not rule out anything, saying it was
possible the group would have to go into receivership.
The guarantors of the rights issue said they continued to support it, and
the company's leading bankers were also prepared to continue their support
for the time being.
The latest chapter in Hafnia's drama began on Wednesday, when it was
revealed that a deputy general manager, who has been dismissed, had
committed the company, through a put option, to acquire shares in Interbank,
a small Copenhagen niche bank, at DKr288m. Hafnia will incur a loss of
DKr35m to DKr45m on the deal, it said.
But on Friday Mr Lavesen said that further contracts for the purchase of
shares - for later delivery at a price fixed in advance - had been found.
The irregularities found so far could cost the company DKr350m. The
contracts, said Mr Lavesen, who was brought in as chairman on June 2, had
not been properly recorded in Hafnia's books and had not been known to the
board.
Meanwhile strategic investments in shares in Baltica, its domestic rival,
and Skandia, Sweden's biggest insurer, are at the centre of Hafnia's
problems. As the value of these holdings has collapsed, Hafnia Holding's
equity has shrunk from more than DKr6bn to its present negative DKr450m in
little more than a year.
Police are investigating illegal intra-group borrowings to finance the
strategic share investments as well as the irregularities revealed over the
past few days.

FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: Saab chief named to be head of
Adam Opel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HERMAN, who has overseen the start of a revival at Swedish car
maker Saab since it became a joint venture company with General Motors in
1990, has been named as chairman and managing director of Adam Opel, GM's
German car subsidiary.
Mr Herman, a 46-year-old New Yorker who quickly became a widely liked and
respected figure as president and chief executive of Saab Automobile,
succeeds Mr Louis Hughes, 43.
In April Mr Hughes was named to take over as president of Zurich-based
General Motors Europe, the umbrella company for all GM's activities in
Europe.
The shuffle represents the knock-on effects of the abrupt departure in March
of Mr Hughes' predecessor, Mr Robert Eaton, to become chairman-elect of
Chrysler, the third largest of the big three US vehicle makers.
Mr Herman has been leading Saab through a difficult period of
rationalisation, which is expected to cut the company's payroll by a third
over three years. He has also been overseeing an intense new model programme
which will see a succession of wholly new cars being launched, starting next
year.
In May, Saab Automobile announced losses of SKr293m (Dollars 49.8m) for the
first quarter of this year - a 69 per cent improvement on the SKr953m
deficit in the first three months of 1991, although it was a larger loss
than the SKr134m sustained in the fourth quarter of last year.
Sales rose to SKr3.9bn, compared with SKr3.37bn for the year earlier period.
Opel expects a further drop in profits during this year after a 19 per cent
decline in net income last year to DM1.1bn (Dollars 720m), reflecting a
shift in business away from the domestic market, where the post-unification
car sales boom has tailed off, to export markets where margins are lower.

CANADA'S two biggest fish companies have imposed drastic cuts, including
over 2,000 immediate layoffs, in the wake of a two-year shutdown of northern
cod fishery off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador.
Fishery Products International, based in St John's, Newfoundland, said the
ban would cut its total groundfish catch by 35 per cent this year to 72,000
tonnes. This represents a drop in sales of about CDollars 55m (USDollars
45.8m).
The company is immediately laying off 1,340 people at four inshore
processing plants.
National Sea Products, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, is cutting its payroll
by about 20 per cent to just under 3,000 people.
Nonetheless, Mr Henry Demone, National's president, supported the
moratorium, saying it is 'an economic catastrophe for Newfoundland, but it
is in the best interest of the northern cod fishery.'

SAMSUNG has received government approval to become South Korea's sixth

Samsung Heavy Industries, the shipbuilding and heavy equipment subsidiary of
South Korea's largest conglomerate, will begin producing heavy trucks and
construction vehicles in 1994 in technical co-operation with Nissan Diesel
Motor of Japan.
South Korea's other vehicle producers argued that Samsung's entry will
contribute to overcapacity when domestic demand for heavy trucks is falling
due to a construction slowdown. Sales of heavy trucks last year amounted to
27,900 units, including 2,000 that were imported.

<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank is liberalising further the German capital markets by making
it easier for foreign companies to issue commercial paper.
From August 1, foreign companies will be able to make D-Mark commercial
paper issues without having to set up a special German offshoot. Also,
German branches of foreign banks will be able to lead manage issues in
D-Marks.
The Bundesbank said its moves took account of the single European market and
recent developments in international capital markets. The commercial paper
market in Germany has grown rapidly since restrictions were removed last
year.
But the central bank said it still held to its 'anchor principle' under
which the market for D-Mark issues is based in Germany. It intended to
safeguard its minimum reserve requirements in the interests of monetary
policy.
These requirements mean banks have to hold a proportion of their deposits at
the Bundesbank, free of interest. Minimum reserves are obligatory for issues
by banks, domestic and foreign, with a maturity of under two years.
Previously, the Bundesbank said, the two-year minimum maturity rule had not
differentiated between banks and non-banks. Foreign companies will now be
able to issue D-Mark bonds with shorter maturities.
The Bundesbank repeated its opposition to money market funds, which it
believes would subvert its monetary policy.

FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: A mixture of luck and hard
decisions - The reasons behind the resurgence of Dickson Concepts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DICKSON Concepts, the wholesaler and retailer of designer luxury goods which
last year paid Pounds 57m for Harvey Nichols, the fashionable London
department store, appears to be staging a come back after its recent
unfavourable showing on the Hong Kong stock market
After virtually no growth in either sales or profits for 18 months, it
sprang a HKDollars 1bn rights issue on shareholders at the time of the
Harvey Nichols purchase. Both takeover and funding were poorly received.
However, following a strong second half, profits for the year ended March
1992 rose 27 per cent to HKDollars 281.8m on revenues 9 per cent higher at
HKDollars 2.4bn.
The turnround has been a combination of good luck and hard decision making.
First the luck. In Hong Kong rents for retail space have fallen 30 per cent
over the past year and Dickson Concepts, which operates 33 retail outlets in
the colony, has benefited from those market conditions, if not by the full
amount.
Hard decisions have been made in Taiwan and the UK with Harvey Nichols. Both
have paid off and Dickson Concepts now expects both operations to make
significant contributions to profits in the coming years.
A department store in Taiwan - located in an area of Taipei where a mass
transit railway is being built - was sold and the seven boutiques which it
once housed were placed in less congested areas of the city. This occurred
at a time when consumer spending was recovering.
According to Mr Dickson Poon, the chairman of the company and its 51 per
cent controlling shareholder, the combination of relocation of outlets and
the surge in consumer spending resulted 'in a direct reduction in overheads
and a substantial increase in sales.'
In London, the Harvey Nichols store presented a different set of problems. A
three-pronged plan to get a firmer financial control of the property and
develop the store and the brand name has been embarked upon. Mr Poon says
successes have already been achieved and that Harvey Nichols is now showing
a profit after providing for financing charges.
The first decision was to relocate offices to a nearby building. This,
together with a reconfiguration of the lower floor of the store, freed up to
20,000 extra square feet of retail space. This was completed in April and
has begun to make a positive contribution to revenues.
In parallel, management set about regaining control over stocks. When
Dickson Concepts acquired Harvey Nicholls the store's stock/loss ratio was
in excess of 10 per cent.
That has been cut to 3 per cent, and Mr Poon says that when real time
information technology designed to control stock better is introduced, that
ratio should drop to 1.5 per cent or lower. Technology will also bring other
benefits.
'We will get improved efficiencies from the information it will provide,' he
says. 'We will be able immediately to identify which lines are selling
fastest and this will be invaluable for the buyers and merchandisers.'
The third prong of the plan is to develop Harvey Nichols as a reputable
brand name. In September a new line of womens wear will be launched and, at
the same time, a Harvey Nichols boutique will be opened in Hong Kong.
'It is not easy to develop a new brand,' Mr Poon conceded. 'But Harvey
Nichols has an owner which has the information and has the management that
fully understands consumer taste and demands and distribution.'
It remains to be seen whether these skills extend to food retailing -
another leg of the development plans.
Dickson Concepts plans to open a food hall at Harvey Nichols in September or
October, and is considering replicating that in other parts of the UK.
Whatever the success of the food retailing idea, in the short to medium term
analysts and the company expect Harvey Nichols to account for up to 10 per
cent of Dickson Concepts' profits, or Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m a year by 1993.
For more than a year Dickson Concepts has been researching the China market.
Shortly it will announce a joint venture with a mainland partner to develop,
make and market a range of up-market apparel and accessories. The company
has already identified manufacturers throughout China.
According to Crosby Securities, a local broker, there are 4m individuals who
earn more than Yn30,000 a year (compared with an average annual income per
head of around Yn2,000) located mainly in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and
Shanghai.
Mr Poon feels that his company's expertise in marketing, product development
and fashion gives it an edge in developing sophisticated but affordable
products for the Chinese market. He is aiming to offer these consumers a
total head to toe 'lifestyle'.
Whether he can develop China as one of Dickson Concepts core businesses is
open to question, given the difficulties of distribution and the mainland
bureaucracy. But, as one analysts noted: 'Dickson is one for stretching the
bounds of credibility and then proving people wrong.'

Pounds 185m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL NET assets of TR Technology grew by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 185m in the
year ended April 30 1992, but net asset value per share fell to 111.85p,
against 124.25p a year earlier.
Net revenue in the year dropped to Pounds 2.95m (Pounds 3.33m) reflecting
both lower interest rates on cash deposits and a higher average weighting
over the year in the US market where dividends on smaller technology
companies are rare.
Earnings dipped by 36.5 per cent to 2.31p, while the dividend has been
maintained at 1.75p excluding last year's special 0.45p.
The company warned, however, that it might be necessary to reduce the base
level of ordinary dividends. That arose from the board's intention to
continue to add to holdings of lower yielding US technology shares, which
together with the expectation of lower interest rates on liquid balances and
only modest dividend growth in the UK, implied that the company's revenue
account would come under growing pressure.
The company announced that it was making arrangements for the listing of a
'unit' of the shares, comprising 7 Zero dividend, 4 stepped preference and 4
ordinary shares.

FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 2.7m loss at Anglo St James
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE adverse conditions in the property market which led to a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 2.72m in the 18 months ended December 31 1991, Anglo St James
achieved some progress.
Mr Jeffrey Green, chairman, said important points were the merger of the
former company, Anglo-Park, with St James Estates, settlement of a
litigation claim for Pounds 1.75m, plus costs to be assessed, against a firm
of chartered surveyors, and a reduction of borrowings by achieving lettings
and disposals at 'acceptable levels'.
Since the year-end overall net borrowings have been cut by 27 per cent to
about Pounds 5.7m. The group continued to operate well within its bank
facilities, the chairman said.
In the 18 months the group incurred an operating loss of Pounds 1.03m
(profit Pounds 329,000 for the year to June 1990). But exceptional charges
of Pounds 1.56m pushed the pre-tax level to Pounds 2.72m (profit Pounds
404,000).
Trading losses were expected to be reduced significantly in 1992, a year of
consolidation, Mr Green stated. Rental income now exceeded interest payable
and made a substantial contribution towards overheads which had been reduced
significantly since the merger.
The exceptionals included the recovery from the legal action, less charges.
The principal items in those were provisions against investment properties
Pounds 1.62m and against properties held for resale Pounds 945,000.
Losses per share were 23.1p (earnings 4.4p). There is no final dividend to
leave the payment at 0.5p (3p for previous year).

FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Manders scorns Kalon bid as a defensive
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANDERS, the Wolver-hampton-based paint, ink and property group, yesterday
dismissed the hostile Pounds 97m all-share bid by rival Kalon as a defensive
move to eliminate competition. 'They are trying to nip competition in the
bud before we tear them to pieces,' said Mr Roy Akers, chief executive. 'And
it won't work.'
In the defence document, published yesterday, Mr Roy Amos, Manders'
chairman, claimed the offer was 'wholly inadequate' and did not take into
account the significant increase in the value of Manders' investment
property, a shopping centre in Wolverhampton.
He added that the real reason for the bid was his company's acquisition of
the Windeck paint manufacturer, Kalon's main competitor in the own label
business. Windeck 'is now a serious challenge to Kalon,' he said. The
Windeck acquisition would contribute more than Pounds 1m to profits in the
first half, Mr Akers said.
Mr Amos claimed that Kalon's sharp rise in profits last year - a 57 per cent
jump to Pounds 9.2m - was the result of windfall factors. He cited the
general increase in paint prices of about 10 per cent and the decline in raw
material costs.
'The price of Kalon shares which ordinary shareholders are being offered is
inflated by windfall profits and may not be sustained,' he said. 'These
circumstances are unlikely to coincide again.' A takeover would also mean a
16 per cent reduction in dividend, he added. Kalon's 8-for-3 offer made last
month values the target's shares at 262.6p, compared with Friday's close of
259p. Kalon closed at 98 1/2 p.
Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon's managing director, said the defence document had a
'very hollow ring'. He accused Manders of avoiding the questions raised by
the offer document, such as the target's decline in profits. The company
challenged Manders' accusation of windfall profits. 'How come they didn't
benefit from the decrease in raw material prices and increase in paint
prices?' a spokesman asked.

</HEADLINE>

   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREECE FUND, a closed-end investment trust managed by Schroder
Investment Management, has unveiled details of a reorganisation proposal
intended to improve liquidity in the shares.
Last November a group of dissident shareholders in the Greece Fund
unsuccessfully sought an extraordinary general meeting to force Schroders to
take steps to allow them to sell their shares at a price close to net asset
value.
Those shareholders argued that although the underlying investments had
performed very well, they were unable to realise gains because there had
been no marketmaking in the shares. Although the bid was narrowly
unsuccessful, Schroders since then has been studying ways to improve
liquidity.
The measures will include an amendment to the the Greece Fund's articles
allowing shareholders to receive cash for up to 30 per cent of their stakes
by the beginning of 1993 and an additional five per cent per quarter. Those
accepting payments in kind may redeem their entire holdings.
Also, the Greece Fund's depositary warrants will be cancelled at a five per
cent premium to inherent asset value, while the international depositary
receipts will be cancelled in exchange for the underlying shares in
registered form.
It is intended that the central management and control of the company will
be moved to Jersey from the UK and a listing will be sought in Ireland.

In a letter to former shareholders it said no progress had been made by

Even if MSR wins from its bankers an extension of expired letters of credit,

FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome puts its trust in a software
remedy - The corporate plans to combat complications surrounding the Pounds
3bn global share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 8.30 this morning the international tender offer of 330m or so shares in
Wellcome Trust will begin. By the time the offer closes at 5pm on July 24
the success or failure of the largest non-privatisation share sale ever seen
will be known.
Over the following weekend a price will be set according to the level of
demand and the trust will decide exactly how many shares to sell and
allocations will be made.
From a low, black leather and chrome sofa, Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the
Wellcome Trust, will be able to watch the progress of the Pounds 3bn global
sale of about half the charity's shares in the drugs group.
The sofa has been installed in a small, dark room on the third floor of
Robert Fleming's offices in the City of London. The rest of the room is
bursting with computer screens and banks of files, and an illuminated map of
the world has been fixed to one wall.
Should Mr Gibbs find all this too oppressive, a fridge full of cooling
drinks has been brought in. Fleming has thoughtfully provided a bowl full of
variously-shaped wooden blocks for Mr Gibbs to manipulate in moments of
tension.
The room has been built to handle the first global book-building exercise of
the size of the Wellcome sale.
Mr Ian Hannam, who is heading the book-building team, has designed entirely
new software to drive the computers which will not only record and update
bids entered by potential investors, but which will also help allocate the
shares.
He is coy about how much Fleming has spent on the system - if only because
he has already received offers from American banks keen to buy it from him.
Fleming has organised the sale into nine regional syndicates - two for the
UK, institutional and retail, the US, Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland,
Pacific Rim and Rest of the World.
Mr Hannam says that Fleming itself is in every syndicate, so that there are
no surprises for him.
Institutions interested in buying the shares must put in a bid to their
local syndicate. The bids are 'good till cancelled' but can be changed up to
the last day of the tender period.
Bids put in will name the buyer - if the order is for over Pounds 100,000
worth - the amount they want to buy, and a price they are prepared to pay.
The price can be on one of three bases, the strike price - accepting the
price set by the tender - a fixed price in pence, or a price set in terms of
the existing market price of Wellcome's shares. By the end of the tender
period any market price bids will have to be converted into either fixed
price or strike price bids.
Buyers will be categorised not only by size and price of the offer but also
by the quality of the bid and the bidder. This is perhaps the most
controversial aspect of the way the sale is being handled.
But Mr Hannam believes that bidders who are helpful to the sale should be
rewarded. For example, bidders who put in a tender early have a better
chance of getting shares. Although every successful bidder will eventually
pay the same strike price, a bidder which has been more aggressive on price
will be treated more favourably.
And bidders will be categorised as types of investor ranging from 'existing
shareholder' through 'flagship investor' to 'good', 'moderate' and 'other'.
Existing shareholders will get priority. Bidders can buy shares during the
tender period to join the ranks of existing holders, so long as they can
prove they have bought shares.
In the 'other' category will be placed bidders who are not regarded as
likely long-term holders of the shares, or any which play around - for
example by selling shares in advance in an attempt to push down the Wellcome
price and then buy cheaper in the tender.
All bids will be timed, and bidders will keep their place in the queue so
long as the bid is maintained or increased. But says Mr Hannam, the system
is designed to identify anyone who decreases a bid. Such a bid would go to
the bottom of the queue again.
The idea is to encourage people who are conservative at the start but become
more aggressive during the period - the ideal for building a book.
Mr Hannam also says that Fleming is only concerned with getting the best
deal for the trust. Unlike some UK houses it is not worried about repeat
business - it will not 'look after its friends'. Mr Hannam says: 'If he
comes in late he can be the Prudential and he will not get any'.
At the end of each working day the regional syndicate computers will upload
that days bids to the central Fleming computer. And every morning at 11.30
Mr Hannam will head a meeting to discuss how the book building is going.
Mr Hannam can sit and play with the computer allocation model as the book
begins to build. The computer can draw a demand curve, showing how much
interest there is at each price so that Fleming can decide where to set the
price to achieve the best balance between the number of shares sold and
price maximise the money raised.
But the computer can go much further than that. It can also work out how to
allocate shares between different bidders on the various criteria of
earliness, aggressiveness and quality. For instance, a top quality bidder
could be rewarded with 100 per cent of the stock he has put in for, while
bids from 'others' could be cut to a low percentage or excluded all
together.
Fleming can override the computer, for example to look after UK retail
investors. Once the allocations have been set the computer will print them
all out on a regional basis.
It is a far cry from old-fashioned placings, where a stockbroker's sales
team with a list of clients would sell substantial chunks of shares in a
morning. But a deal the size of Wellcome cannot use such simple methods,
when as Fleming can say, 'we have the technology'.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Spanish chemicals group seeks protection
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S largest chemicals company, Ercros, will today file for protection
from its creditors. The company failed last week to renegotiate its Dollars
2.15bn (Pounds 1.12bn) debts with bankers and suppliers or to persuade its
main shareholder, the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), to give it any more
money.
Both the Ercros holding company and its deeply troubled fertiliser divisions
will make protection filings, probably in Barcelona, today. The move will
mark the biggest corporate collapse in Spain since the country became a
democracy in 1977.
It will also be the first time KIO, the Kuwaiti government's international
investment arm, has been so closely associated with a failure to repay
creditors.
A statement by the group said that KIO, which owns at least 39 per cent of
Ercros through Grupo Torras, its Spanish investment arm, was directly
responsible for the decision to seek protection from creditors. It said the
agency had insisted on the filing 'to define its contribution to the final
consolidation of the affected companies and so to confront existing
obligations in framework of co-responsibility'.
That means that KIO has refused to pump in an immediate Dollars 250m to save
Ercros unless it is assisted in some way by the government. Madrid, in turn,
insists it cannot inject any more funds into the group.
Ercros, which employs 10,500 people and lost Dollars 160m last year, owes
more than Dollars 200m to the Spanish state-owned Banco Exterior, and owes
money also to Banco Santander, Banco Central Hispanoamericano and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya. About Dollars 30m in credits from Barclays and Bankinter are
understood to be guaranteed by KIO's wholly-owned Spanish holding company,
Torras.
Some bankers suggested at the weekend that by forcing Ercros into a
suspension of payments, KIO might be placing its international credibility
as a borrower at risk. Torras has a large convertible bond outstanding
which, if the Ercros payments suspension were to trigger any default
clauses, might be threatened. But KIO appears to be safe from default as it
is a shareholder in Ercros and so not directly liable for its debts.

FT  06 JUL 92 / An icy wind chills accountants' offices: How UK firms are
facing the impact of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After more than a decade of rapid growth, Britain's accountancy firms - from
the largest downwards - are having to face up to the realities of recession,
from which they were for so long shielded by their clients.
With two mergers announced within the last month, attention is increasingly
focusing on whether the existing number of medium-sized firms is
sustainable. Their larger competitors are equally under pressure.
The figures in the recently published Financial Times top 25 accountancy
firms table tell a clear story. The rapid expansion of the last decade has
evaporated. The fee income growth of most firms has struggled to keep pace
with inflation this year, while only four managed to achieve growth above 10
per cent.
Four reported a drop in fee income. That included Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
UK's biggest and one of its most aggressive practices, which fell by 0.52
per cent to Pounds 577m. The figures reflect a year of painful change for
the firm.
Mr Brandon Gough, Coopers' senior partner, is telling his colleagues that -
with profits down, 20 fewer partners than the 735 of a year ago, and
professional staff 15 per cent down - there is further cost-cutting to come.
'We were a little bit slow to face up to the realisation that the business
had to shrink,' says Mr Gough. 'We were hoping 12 months ago that the
recession would end. We saddled ourselves with a higher cost base than
necessary.'
The recession could not have hit accountants at a worse time. Just when
costs and expansion plans were running at peak levels, demand for business
shrivelled.
In the past decade, the firms had become huge businesses. Total fee income
from the largest firm in 1984 was just Pounds 74m, and from the top 21 firms
only Pounds 738m. This year the top 21 firms generated Pounds 3.3bn in fees.
Practices have gone through a phase of mergers: Coopers with Deloitte, Ernst
&amp; Whinney with Arthur Young, Peat Marwick with Thomson McLintock. This
saddled firms with extra costs including superfluous staff, redundant
buildings and duplicative systems.
Suddenly, the impact of the economic downturn hit. Corporate finance work
dried up with the dearth of merger and acquisition activity. Companies cut
consultancy budgets, and began tendering for contracts more frequently. The
accountancy firms intensified competition against one another in a scramble
to maintain clients.
At the same time, with unemployment in the financial service sector rising,
fewer employees were willing to leave voluntarily. Staff turnover dropped
sharply as a result, leaving many department managers with the double worry
of excessive head-counts on top of shrinking demand.
Equally, partners have faced demoralising questions over their competence as
auditors in the wake of a series of high-profile corporate collapses.
Attention has turned more than ever to the threat of legal action against
auditors - and its reflection in rising professional indemnity insurance
premiums.
Cost-cutting has become a way of life at many of the big firms. In the
secretive world of the partnerships, none will reveal much about either
costs or profits. But Price Waterhouse said earlier this month that it had
reduced its cost base by nearly Pounds 30m last year. In the same period,
KPMG Peat Marwick closed six of its 53 regional offices. 'We are much more
aware of costs than we used to be,' says Mr Jim Butler, Peat's senior
partner.
In such a people-heavy business, the principal means of cost-cutting is
through job losses. Nearly every firm has had to reduce its workforce, first
by natural wastage but increasingly by redundancy. Although technically
partners can only be dismissed on a full vote of their peers, many have been
'encouraged' to retire early or leave because their aims and those of the
firm are no longer compatible.
The process has caused no little bitterness. Mr Gough says: 'There has been
great sadness at some of the mechanisms required. Redundancy is something
very foreign to all of us. It is a step I regret but it has been necessary.
We have moved away from the certainty of extended employment.'
He believes that the next 12 months will remain very uncertain for the
firms, and expects to continue 'pruning back' costs. But he also points out
that partnerships are fragile structures that depend on team-work, which is
very difficult to maintain under the shadow of job losses.
Conventional wisdom has it that only the counter-cyclical rise in insolvency
income in the last year has saved the firms from a far worse fate, as their
specialist arms have expanded to take on a large number of receiverships,
administrations and financial restructurings.
In fact, while insolvency-related income in most large firms has grown
sharply, even this year it contributed a small proportion of total revenues.
The picture of decline has to be put in perspective. Average growth in the
top 20 firms was 13.83 per cent last year. This year it is still 4.62 per
cent. Hasty expansion has been replaced by more measured increases.
And at Arthur Andersen, revenues rose 23 per cent last year - a figure
which, says Mr Roy Chapman, senior partner, 'surprised us a little bit'. He
has managed to increase staffing, not least aided by a very strong computer
consulting arm.
Overall, the larger accountancy firms have been expanding market share. The
top six firms grew by an average of 8.37 per cent this year, and received
75.7 per cent of the income going to the top 25, against 74.4 per cent last
year and just 51 per cent in 1978.
The figures drop consistently, so that the seven smallest of the top 25 grew
by just 0.43 per cent, and had 2.7 per cent of the market, down from 2.9 per
cent in 1991.
This suggests that some of the smaller practices may not be able to survive
independently for much longer - a point perhaps heralded in the merger of
Stoy Hayward and Finnie last week.
For most firms, the talk now is of quality, professionalism and attention to
clients. Like the companies they serve, they are concentrating on providing
core services. After a decade of acceleration, they are changing gear. As Mr
Butler says: 'I think the double-digit growth of the late 1980s is a thing
of the past.'

FT  06 JUL 92 / DTI Astra report criticises auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 25 individuals and organisations may be criticised in the long-awaited
Department of Trade and Industry investigation into Astra, the collapsed
munitions group, which is due to be published next month.
Two dozen draft letters of criticism are believed to have been sent out by
inspectors to those involved, particularly in the circumstances surrounding
the company's Pounds 36m rights issue in July 1989 and its purchase of
Poudreries Reunies de Belgique (PRB), a Belgian company which made
propellant for the Iraqi supergun.
Among those criticised is Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm which was the
company's auditor. It has received one letter addressed to the firm, and two
individually to partners involved on Astra work - although neither still
works with Stoy.
Former directors have also been criticised, but are understood to be furious
that the inspectors have apparently not examined allegations of the
government's involvement in defence deals which may have played a part in
Astra's downfall.
Stoy Hayward yesterday said it would not comment 'until we have seen the
final report and in particular the inspectors' conclusions in relation to
the directors'. It would call for an inquiry into how details of the
investigation had been leaked to newspapers.
Others under the scrutiny of the inspectors included the directors of Astra,
and the professional advisers to the rights issue: Paine Webber
International, the merchant bank, Hitchens, Harrison &amp; Co, Astra's
stockbrokers, and Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett, its solicitors.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Offerings of bonds and equities reach record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE volume of international bond and equity offerings rose to record levels
in the first half of 1992, boosted by lower interest rates and bullish world
stock markets, but syndicated lending showed a further decline.
The decrease in bank financing reflects the shortage of bank credit, as
banks try to conserve scarce capital. In addition, they have become more
wary of lending to companies which could face financial difficulties,
following a series of well-publicised defaults on bank debt.
Meanwhile, companies have taken advantage of strong stock markets to restore
their balance sheets and widen their shareholder base, while lower interest
rates have encouraged a wave of refinancing in the international bond
markets.
Equity offerings totalling Dollars 13bn (Pounds 6.8bn) were sold to
international investors, compared with Dollars 9bn in the first half of
1991, and international bond volume rose to Dollars 147bn, a 14.5 per cent
increase, according to IFR Securities Data. Meanwhile, syndicated lending
totalled Dollars 164bn in the first six months, marking a 32 per cent drop
from the first half of 1991, according to Euromoney.
The pace of activity in the international bond markets is not expected to
ease in the second half of the year.
However, the recent malaise of many of the world's stock markets has already
caused a number of planned equity offerings to be cancelled or postponed.

FT  06 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: European banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the future of the Maastricht Treaty still a matter of debate, it might
seem premature to speculate on the European financial scene after currency
union. But as the Community moves towards the establishment of a European
central bank in Germany, it is difficult to ignore the implications
altogether. The European banking industry, for example, would be confronted
with a world in which monetary conditions were uniform from Lisbon to Lubeck
regardless of the state of the local economy. In countries where membership
of the system made money excessively tight, as is already the case in the UK
under the ERM, the banking industry would be in for a rough time. Indeed,
the once proud national names of European banking would become vulnerable to
the sort of problems that afflict regional banks in the US.
The national economies of Europe may be less interdependent than the state
economies of the US, where, for example, Massachussetts has grown to rely
heavily on the defence industry. But if the single market produces the
intended rationalisation of European industry, similar concentrations could
appear on this side of the Atlantic. Moreover, the US has at least a
centralised support system both in the form of deposit insurance and through
the Federal Reserve's role as lender of last resort. The European vogue for
subsidiarity may reduce the political appeal of such a centralised approach.
The message for Europe's banks is that they need to spread their activities
more widely around the Community to balance the risks from currency union.
So far, progress has been slow, largely because banking cultures differ so
widely from one member state to another. Indeed, the trend has if anything
been inward looking, with the emphasis on domestic mergers in markets from
the Netherlands to Spain, Italy and - if Lloyds had had its way with Midland
 -the UK. That is fine as long as it is a first step towards a broader
European approach. If not, bigger local banks will simply incur bigger local
risks as the single currency comes into circulation.

The business services group BET raised barely a flicker of City interest
last month when it disclosed a thumping Pounds 477m extraordinary charge
with its 1991-92 results. The reaction was perhaps understandable. The
charge, after all, was a non-cash item which served merely to highlight the
true scale of losses on businesses bought by the previous BET management but
junked by the new team.
Had the company been reporting the same figures in a year's time, they might
have caused a stir. That Pounds 477m - created as a result of last
December's ruling from the Accounting Standards Board requiring goodwill
written off to be included in the calculation of profit or loss on disposal
 -looks innocuous below the line. Come the likely adoption this autumn of
the ASB's exposure draft virtually abolishing extraordinary items, both the
headline pre-tax profit number and published earnings per share would in
such cases be slaughtered.
The effective burying of acquisition accounting should be loudly applauded,
even if there is still room for argument between companies and auditors over
where to allocate goodwill when businesses are disposed of merely in part.
The significance of the BET illustration, though, is in serving as a
reminder of how volatile under the proposed accounting changes the treasured
earnings figure is set to become. The new ruling can be seen as an admission
that the accountancy profession is throwing in the towel after bruising
behind-the-scenes battles over what is extraordinary and what exceptional.
In future analysts and investors - armed with the relevant information -
will have to take up the fight to determine for themselves the underlying
trends.
Getting away from the present obsession with stated earnings per share - and
the idea that the audited figure is somehow objectively reliable - can only
be healthy. But some of the market's most deep-rooted principles of
valuation will be challenged in the process. It is not clear how the
price/earnings ratio can be a satisfactory yardstick when the earnings
figure is shown to be a subjective number. The idea of a market multiple, of
course, becomes more meaningless again.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After another week of dividend cuts from such as British Steel and Lonrho,
UK investors might be forgiven for asking themselves if they are getting
enough say in the matter of their income. The snag is that their position is
weak in theory as well as in practice. One of the more popular arguments is
that cuts are unfair to income funds. This is absurd. Anyone who buys a
high-yielding share is betting against the market on the outlook for the
dividend. There is no room for complaint if the bet does not come off.
On a wider front, harried company directors must occasionally be tempted to
say the unsayable: that when it comes to determining the dividend,
shareholders are simply not qualified to take part in the debate. The
fallacy lies in supposing that dividends are paid out of a residual lump of
distributable earnings. In the real world, dividends are paid out of cash.
All the cash flowing into the business has to be allocated somewhere: to
capital expenditure, to stocks, to wages, to advertising, to earning money
in the bank. The decision on how much to allocate to shareholders is
intelligible only in the context of how else the money might be spent. On
such internal budgeting matters, investors are in the dark. They must simply
trust the directors to make the decision in the long-term interests of
shareholders. If they do not so trust the directors, they should not have
bought the shares in the first place.
It might be argued that shareholders have a legitimate grievance in another
sense. It is common ground among UK companies that dividends should be set
at a sustainable level; that is, enough should be squirrelled away in the
good years to pay for the bad. To cut the dividend is thus to break an
implied promise. But in reality, the promise can only ever be conditional
upon the bad times not turning out worse than could be reasonably expected.
Since that seems to be just the position at present, shareholders must bear
the discomfort along with everybody else.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Prescriptions for world prosperity: Move to the micro -
Leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialised states meet in Munich
this week. Four senior economic ministers set out their contrasting views on
the micro-economic and structural challenges facing the former states of the
Soviet Union, eastern Europe and the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JURGEN MOLLEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The seven leading western industrial countries have largely succeeded in
keeping their economies in good macro-economic order; in the postwar era,
their people have been spared economic crises on a global scale.
At the same time, western states have accumulated structural rigidities and
imbalances in their economies which represent an increasingly serious threat
to continued growth in the world economy. The big global challenges can,
however, be tackled only on the basis of a strong world economy.
One of the great challenges is the transition to democracy and market
economics in the former republics of the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. We
must recognise clearly that the integration of the former socialist world
economy into the single global world economy, the realisation of the
transition to lasting democratic and market-based structures in east Europe,
while simultaneously securing the efficiency of our economies, will be the
crucial issues for this decade.
When tackling these problems, the politician is no longer primarily
concerned with the global steering mechanisms such as interest rates and
exchange rates; instead the politician concentrates far more on the
underlying micro-structures and the efficiency of the steering instruments
(such as tax, labour-market and trade policy).
The issue is one of maintaining or recreating the ability of the markets,
including the labour market, to function; of the political determinants of
private investment decisions; and of the role of state regulation, not least
in the area of trade, environmental and energy policy.
These topics are also increasingly the focus of international policy
co-ordination. The recent earth summit in Rio de Janeiro is proof of this.
At the same time, the political and public awareness of the problems of
structural rigidities and imbalances has been heightened, not least by the
difficulties of economic unification in Germany and the reform processes in
eastern Europe. Certain misguided developments in the structural area, for
example in nuclear energy production, are more dangerous today than mistakes
in exchange rate policy.
Public funds are of only marginal effect in supporting reform processes; the
decisive factor is the development of private-sector initiative under
reliable legal and economic conditions.
This remains important for our own economies, and I sometimes wish western
Germany showed the same willingness for structural change that we must
expect of eastern German industry and our east European partners.
The great competition between the systems of east and west is over, but the
competition between efficient locations, effective policies on trade,
environment, labour market, energy and competition will increase further. We
need to keep sufficiently in step internationally in the micro-economic and
structural area in order to avoid distortions of competition.
Even more important is to make it clear that the wrong micro-economic policy
 -for example, the preservation of old economic structures - will lead to a
fresh separation from the world economy for the countries in question. There
will no longer be any 'world economic social security'. Mistaken
micro-economic and structural policy will inevitably result in the loss of
prosperity and quality of life.
The author is Germany's economics minister.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Problems in the pipeline: The challenges facing British Gas
as it wrestles with regulation and increased competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr Robert Evans, the deal signed last week in Kazakhstan jointly to
exploit one of the world's biggest oil and gas fields marks a Dollars 3bn
step towards his vision of building British Gas into a world-class energy
business. Closer to home, however, he has less cause for contentment.
Mr Evans, the company's chairman and chief executive - although he is
expected to relinquish the second part of his title soon - braved Kazakhstan
in January to help the deal along. He may think that extracting 20 trillion
(million million) cubic feet of gas and 2bn barrels of oil from the vast
Karachaganak field is easier than running his business back home.
The scouse mechanical engineer, who joined British Gas 40 years ago,
believes that Britain's sixth-largest company is being pushed around.
Instead of laying pipelines, too much time is devoted to playing politics.
His critics say he is not playing the game well. The company's latest
advertising campaign, in which the thumbs of actors spontaneously combust as
they proclaim the benefits of 'being in control', draws wry smiles from
those who believe British Gas has lost its way.
Mr Evans, who as a young trainee thought gas works were 'dirty, smelly and
exciting', passionately defends his business and his own record.
He talks animatedly of 'intelligent pigs', the latest in pipeline monitoring
hardware, and about the revolution in gas supplies made possible by plastic
piping.
His task is to run a highly capital-intensive, technically sophisticated
business, while at the same time delivering gas safely to satisfied
customers.
He delights in reporting that his company's 18m customers now rate British
Gas second only to Marks and Spencer for good service. Every complaint is
matched by 20 happy customers - a performance Mr Evans says 'really turns me
on'.
Not everyone, however, is quite so 'turned on' by British Gas. Or by Mr
Evans, who some regard more as a gifted engineer than an inspirational boss.
He has attracted unwelcome publicity over his Pounds 435,222 annual pay
packet and a home crammed with appliances for his family to test.
More seriously, Mr Evans is still entangled in an increasingly personalised
wrangle over gas prices - 'a 15 per cent cut since privatisation, excluding
the latest reduction, is a damn good record for anyone' - with Sir James
McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas.
Sir James is the industry watchdog who bites as well as barks. Mr Evans, who
has been heard bellowing 'Good, bloody morning]' on his way out of Sir
James's office, says the relationship is 'totally and utterly unproductive'.
Sir James's views on his adversary are equally crisp. The atmosphere of
sterile hostility, created in the absence of any established, national
philosophy on utility regulation, now borders on the absurd.
To many British Gas watchers, the future of the company which led former
prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher's crusade for popular capitalism
appears less clear-cut than at any time since it was sold to 4m eager
shareholders in 1986.
The concern may initially be hard to fathom. Profits after tax in 1991
breached Pounds 1bn and the company now supplies nearly half of all
Britain's non-transport energy needs. Last year, the cash-rich business gave
the exchequer more than Pounds 556m in corporation tax.
This year, British Gas will make at least another Pounds 1bn and will invest
nearly Pounds 3bn. With UK gas prices among Europe's lowest, Mr Evans
suggests: 'We are very close to the pinnacle in offering an effective,
efficient, value-for-money supply of gas to nearly everyone who wants it.'
Boosted by the Kazakhstan deal, British Gas shares have outperformed the
FT-A All Share Index by 25 per cent since privatisation.
But many believe that a less 'wonderfuel' future may await British Gas. If
the top team at Rivermill House, the company's Vauxhall Bridge headquarters,
saw privatisation as a passport to commercial freedom, they now know they
were misguided.
British Gas faces a greater degree of intervention in its activities than
ever. Mr Evans complains: 'What we never, ever expected was that the goal
posts were going to be moved all the time.' A senior colleague told a recent
City gathering: 'We can't even locate the playing field.'
Once seen as impervious to external influence, the company now struggles
with the burden of regulation - in June it had to cut domestic gas prices by
3 per cent under threat of legal action from Sir James.
With its industrial and commercial gas businesses being prised open to admit
competitors, British Gas is also reluctantly breaking up an integrated
structure - jealously guarded and preserved intact at privatisation by
hiving off its national pipeline and storage operation for others to use on
an equal footing.
Given that the domestic gas supply monopoly may also end, profits may no
longer pour so easily from pipelines.
Mr Evans has said that the will mean higher prices, lower standards of
service and less reliable supplies. But he has succumbed to the changes,
under threat of a second post-privatisation investigation by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
The Office of Fair Trading has been unhappy with attempts by British Gas to
fight back by promoting to journalists its own strategic view of its
business. Asked to sign an undertaking that it would stop such initiatives,
British Gas refused.
All of which has left the management, faced with a maturing energy market in
the UK, a threat to earnings from regulation and rising competition, seeking
a new game plan.
To Mr Evans, part of the answer lies increasingly outside the UK, where
British Gas profits are quickly rising. But there has been mixed success -
winning control of Canada's largest gas distribution business but seeing its
ambitions dashed in Spain and New Zealand.
One of Britain's most senior exploration men is highly critical: 'Everywhere
you go they are bidding ridiculous amounts of money on exploration and
production. It smacks of diversification at any cost.' British Gas says this
is 'sour grapes' from less fortunate competitors.
In spite of the attempt to broaden its horizons, the company is still
regarded as being caught permanently on the back foot, unable to pre-empt
inevitable changes in its marketplace and not yet convincingly articulating
a vision for the future.
'It's like the retreat from Dunkirk, with the high command agonising over
what has to be left on the beach and what to try and get on the boats,' says
an energy consultant who has had close dealings with British Gas.
Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, claims British Gas
failed to comprehend that the greatest challenge to its future was not other
energy sources but regulation: 'They have failed to think strategically and
are left to knit their brows and wonder why things are happening to them.'
According to a former British Gas middle-manager: 'The management is
politically naive.'
An independent gas company executive suggests: 'British Gas needs someone
deeply unpleasant and detached to turn it over. Bob Evans is far too nice a
man.'
Supporters say he has manfully tackled a series of commercial onslaughts
which would have tested the stamina and skills of any chief executive. A
colleague claims: 'He has a quick grasp of the issues and a broad vision.
What else are we doing in Kazakhstan?'
Some of his closest lieutenants, many of them single-function, lifetime gas
men unused to thinking beyond their core business, have also been criticised
for uninspired leadership.
Two recent executive board appointments, however, involving people whose
careers were not forged in British Gas, have not dispelled the
disenchantment.
As it is, Mr Evans is in the hot seat for another two years - although
handing over the role of chief executive to Mr Cedric Brown, a senior
British Gas board member, is thought to be imminent.
All the criticisms encapsulate a general theme: that British Gas has been
slow to dump its old state monopoly culture and slow to wake up to the
changing world in which it must conduct its business.
Mr Evans is defiant: 'We have not needed to change our culture. We were not
an extension of the civil service before privatisation. We never went cap in
hand for money and have always tried to improve and expand our business.
'We have faced constant intervention ever since the ink dried on the
privatisation documents, with 10 major regulatory changes in five years.'
Such uncertainty, he says, is destructive.
He refuses to apologise if his company ponders on external pronouncements -
'usually heard first on Radio 4' - which may have profound effects on its
business.
According to Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman: 'The government is
trying to create competition artificially instead of regulating the gas
industry effectively. The result is a never-ending series of critical
interferences which have discouraged it from thinking long term.'
Now the company is said to be considering a wholesale break-up of the
business, intended to deflect the regulatory onslaught upon it and to
enhance the value of an investment which shareholders, so far generally
acquiescent, are beginning to question.
British Gas plays down the break-up suggestion, but stresses that any
financial re-engineering would have to be accompanied by a significant
easing of regulatory pressures.
Mr Evans explains, with a note of exasperation: 'Our European counterparts
regard what is happening to us as one big experiment.' No one, he feels,
should mess around with gas unless they know precisely what they are doing.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Letter: Only outstanding question on Sunday trading relates
to competition, not principle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERENCE C STANCLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The comment by Lex about the Shops Act ('UK retailing', June 27),
suggesting that the European Court of Justice is likely to 'fudge' the
verdict if it does not declare the Act incompatible with EC law, seems to
lean hard towards the improbable.
It is something of a mystery how there has come to be a general impression
that the Sunday trading restriction in S47 of the Shops Act 1950 is still at
risk of being declared incompatible with Community law by the ECJ.
The fact is that the ECJ has declared already not once but three times that
the Treaty of Rome leaves member states free to legislate Sunday trading
restrictions, whether that is by prohibiting shops from opening (the Torfaen
case 145/88, decided November 23 1989) or by prohibiting the employment of
staff on Sundays (the later Sidef Conforama case 312/89 and Marchandise case
332/89, March 1991).
The question still left open for an ECJ decision expected later this year is
not this issue of principle but a subsidiary question related to a rather
odd qualifier to the ruling in the original Torfaen case. That left it open
to the UK courts to find that S47 is incompatible with EC law if the actual
Sunday trading restriction implemented in the Shops Act has
disproportionately restrictive effects on Community trade, ie effects which
'exceed the effects intrinsic' to rules prohibiting retailers from opening
their premises on Sundays.
The meanderings of procedure have meant that no UK court has pronounced on
the result of applying this proviso to the actual effects of the Shops Act.
It is fairly hard to see how the Shops Act can possibly have effects that do
'exceed the effects intrinsic to' a prohibition on Sunday trading, since no
other restriction is in issue.
In this context, the High Court judge whose decision was restored last week
by the House of Lords had commented cautiously that the prospects for
eventual success by the council trying to enforce the Shops Act 'cannot be
described as slight'.
The question still before the ECJ is now whether it is still at all
necessary for the UK courts to examine the applicability of the odd proviso
in the Torfaen ruling, bearing in mind the later ECJ decisions on Sunday
employment of staff.
Presumably if the answer is no, then the Shops Act will be upheld. If yes,
then the case would depend on proving that there are disproportionate
restrictive effects on Community trade, in the absence of which, again, the
Sunday trading restriction in the Shops Act would be upheld.
While nothing perhaps in such a protracted legal saga is ever certain, the
UK government seems to be at little risk of financial liability to the
retailers due to the case going the other way.
It might seem on the contrary that the retailers' original 'Euro-defence'
against the simple enforcement of the law has been magnified to generate a
procedural quagmire quite disproportionate to the likelihood of its ultimate
success.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Letter: Inequalities of intelligence tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SHIPMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse's example of new thinking from the US research
establishment ('The genetic threat to capitalism', June 29) is as old as the
think-tank recyclings he rightly dismisses. The argument that stripping away
imposed privilege creates discontent, by making those lower down the
hierarchy feel responsible for their plight, was fully explored by Michael
Young in his 1958 essay, 'The Rise of the Meritocracy'.
The really frightening aspect of stratification by IQ scores is that
measured intelligence relates so loosely to demonstrated ability (though in
Young's classic, merit is a combination of IQ and effort). No one has yet
devised an intelligence test that does not rely on knowledge that is
environmentally determined, therefore unequally available. So, as anyone who
uses banks, word processing software or dispensing machines is aware,
intelligence among the masses remains vital to cope with the technical
limitations of the elite.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Roadblocked society
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1969 Mr Jacques Chaban-Delmas, on taking office as French prime minister,
described the country he was called upon to govern, a year after the
paralysing general strike of May 1968, as 'une societe bloquee'. Since then
many efforts have been made to unblock it, and President Francois Mitterrand
may fairly claim to have done more than most in that direction. It was his
strategy that succeeded in marginalising one of the most formidable
obstacles to change, the Communist party; and since 1983 he has consistently
given priority to European integration, which has had the effect of opening
up France's economy to competition and encouraging, in large parts of the
population, a more flexible and innovative attitude of mind.
The events of the last week show how incomplete that process still is.
France today appears, more literally than ever, a society blocked by the
action, at once defensive and aggressive, of groups with strong vested
interests, threatened by processes of change. The groups in question,
composed largely of self-employed workers used to working on their own and
living independently, are good at organising obstruction but unwilling to
support any permanent leadership capable of proposing or negotiating
constructive solutions. Poujadism is alive and well in its country of
origin.
The changes they are resisting are, on the whole, in the general interest.
That is true of the McSharry reforms in the EC's common agricultural policy,
which should in the long run make food cheaper throughout the Community, at
a lower cost to taxpayers, while ensuring that subsidies benefit those
farmers who most need help. It is even more glaringly true of the system of
penalty points for dangerous driving offences, which has been shown in many
other countries to save lives by providing a more effective deterrent, and
by removing persistent offenders from the wheel altogether.
Intolerable injustice
Yet not only do the protesters consider themselves the victims of
intolerable injustice: much of public opinion apparently sympathises with
them. French opinion leaders almost unanimously accept the assumption that
guaranteed prices are the only way to support farmers, equating big farmers
with small ones, farmers in general with the countryside, and the
countryside with 'la France profonde', supposedly the mental habitat of the
physical city-dwellers who form a substantial majority of the French
population. Similarly, an opinion poll last week showed 60 per cent of
respondents supporting the lorry drivers. Another poll showed the same
percentage supporting the new law, but accepting that lorry drivers should
have special treatment - as though a drunken lorry driver, or one exceeding
the speed limit or driving on the wrong side of the road were somehow less
dangerous than a private motorist doing the same thing.
Failed miserably
The government, whose job is to protect the general interest, is in the
right on the substance of the issues. But it has failed miserably both in
articulating that general interest to the population and in asserting the
authority of the state - something French governments are traditionally
supposed to be good at. The citizen, if he expects anything at all from the
state, expects it to guarantee free movement about the country for himself
and for the provisions which meet his basic needs; and when a country is
geographically in the centre of a region whose economic integration it has
done its best to promote, the state surely incurs the same obligations
towards citizens of neighbouring countries too. Nationals of all EC member
states now have a legal as well as moral right to free passage across French
territory, and France as a state is conspicuously failing to meet its
obligations.
How the government can retrieve the situation, having allowed things to get
this far, is not immediately clear. In 1968 Mr Mitterrand, as leader of the
opposition, fell victim to the tactics of General de Gaulle and his prime
minister, Georges Pompidou, who allowed things to deteriorate until public
opinion was thoroughly alarmed, while quietly preparing behind the scenes
for dramatic action to free key bottlenecks (most notably the petrol supply)
at the right psychological moment. He may well now try some variation on
those tactics to turn the tables on his conservative opponents who, in their
turn, face the dilemma of needing to attack the government without appearing
to be defending the anarchic behaviour of the protesters.
But he cannot afford to wait very long.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR, so good. The plans announced on Friday by Mr Michael Heseltine to
reshape the Department of Trade and Industry are modest and sensible.
British business, which for years has complained that its interests were
never taken into account in the process of government decision making,
should be pleased by a reorganisation which will relate the DTI more closely
to individual sectors of industry. New divisions within the department will
develop specific areas of expertise, will encourage civil servants to
broaden their horizons, and will bring in experts from the private sector to
help develop rigorous analysis and sound business judgments.
Those who fear that Mr Heseltine has a private agenda, aimed at a much
greater degree of government intervention in business, should also be
reassured by this announcement. Far from building a mighty empire, he speaks
demurely about a cut in the department's overall budget. The new sectoral
divisions, he says, will be no soft touch: they will sponsor their
particular industries, but not in an uncritical way. The aim is to improve
communications and understanding, rather than to provide a series of focal
points for Whitehall whingeing.
Mr Heseltine has yet to show his hand on the most important aspects of
industrial policy, especially where it concerns competition, and his critics
still assume that he has something up his sleeve. Has he changed his game,
or is he just being canny?

FT  06 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Directors' pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Cadbury Committee on corporate governance in Britain made its
recommendations in May there was widespread disappointment among
institutional shareholders at the brevity and mildness of the section which
dealt with the controversial subject of directors' pay.
Despite the paucity of these pay guidelines, a study by one of the UK's
leading remuneration consultancies has shown that only seven of the 100
companies in the FT-Stock Exchange index conform with all of them.
More than three-quarters of the companies disclose the existence of a
remuneration committee, but only just over half (a suspiciously low
proportion) declare the existence of performance-related incentive
arrangements. Barely a third explain the criteria for these incentives,
while only a twelfth show separately the performance element in the
remuneration of the chairman or highest-paid director.
As the consultancy argues, much of the criticism over directors' pay would
probably be avoided if boards took proper steps to demonstrate how pay
awards arose, and to show the relationship between incentive payments,
salary increases and company performance.
In any case the Cadbury approach pales sharply alongside a set of tough
disclosure proposals made 10 days ago by the US Securities and Exchange
Commission. Current UK regulations, and the Cadbury proposals, require
anything approaching detailed disclosure to be made only for the chairman
and highest-paid director, which means two people at most. The SEC would
require the five highest-paid executives in a company to be listed, and
their remuneration packages to be broken down into a table of nine separate
components.
These would include stock options - the source of most US controversy, but
virtually ducked by Cadbury - where a range of potential values would be
shown, based on various possible increases in the company's stock price. The
SEC has also made it easier for shareholders to challenge pay packages at
companies' annual general meetings.
In the interest of their own credibility, the boards of Britain's top
companies should not just conform quickly with Cadbury's slim provisions,
but volunteer further information besides.

<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer is correct to argue that Macedonia should be rescued
from its present diplomatic limbo immediately. But the problem does not stop
at the recognition of Macedonia as a state. The Greek government refuses to
recognise the existence of Macedonians as an ethnic minority within Greece,
preferring to denote them as, wait for it, slavophone Hellenes. It also
denies Macedonian refugees from the Greek Civil War the right to return,
even though Greek refugees from that war have long been allowed back. The UK
presidency should attempt to change Greece's attitude so that the EC can
credibly use its good record on individual and minority rights to encourage
such practices in eastern Europe.

Sir, Edward Mortimer ('A Greek tragi-comedy, July 1), whose articles are
generally well written, seems this time to be running in circles on the
Yugoslavian issue and the misuse of the name Macedonia. He has fallen victim
of a classic confusion, in being unable to draw a line between nationalism,
as he describes it, and old fashioned, despicable, communist propaganda.
Tito managed to convince a generation of Slavs in southern Yugoslavia that
they are the descendants of Alexander the Great. That was a great lie, as
any serious university don will tell you.
Surely, in the new Europe, which admits some sincerity among its tribes in
the form of glasnost, open government, accountable government, etc, the word
Macedonia must be allowed to remain a more vaguely defined region across
nation states rather than be adulterated as the name of one nation state and
perpetuate an abusive lie of an old, dictatorial, communist regime.

Sir, It is not just 'litigious MEPs' who will be challenging the UK
government if it maintains frontier controls with other EC states after
January 1 next year ('Europe, the state of the union', July 1).
I suspect that there will also be plenty of regular travellers between
Britain and the continent who have been stopped and abused once too often by
immigration and customs officials. I have had the pages of my diary and my
cheque book stubs scrutinised enough times at Heathrow, Gatwick and Dover
for it to be clear that such action is standard practice, and not a search
based on any grounds of suspicion.
Let's also not overlook that fact that if Britain does maintain controls,
there is quite likely be an increase in the number of frontiers, because
checks will have to be introduced between the Irish Republic and the UK,
where none now exist.
I will travel to England on January 1 1993 carrying, not a passport, but a
copy of the Treaty of Rome, article 8A which states that there will be no
internal frontiers after that date.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Arts: The master of pleasing decay - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Betjeman called him the most intelligent man in England, John Russell
called him an aesthete and a moralist, and at his 80th birthday
retrospective at the Tate Gallery in 1983, Alan Bowness praised him for 'his
enthusiasm, open mindedness, his good sense, his natural modesty and his
excellent taste'.
There is no doubt that John Piper, who has just died aged 88, was much more
than a topographical painter. He was a creator as well as an observer and by
the end of an incredibly full life he had established his own vision of
England. It is a vision that still counts because it interpreted so many
romantic and poetic strands of viewing the essence of English architecture
and landscape.
Piper's own words sum up his mission far better than any words from a mere
critic. 'My aims in painting are to express a personal love of country and
architecture and the humanity that inhabits them, and to increase my own
understanding and nourish my own love of the work of other painters of the
past and the present.'
These aims applied as much to his work as a writer, stage designer and as a
remarkable architectural photographer. Although he was determined to master
as many varieties of artistic media as possible - printing, lithography,
aquatints, pottery, photography, stained glass and engraving - it was all in
the service of recording landscape and architecture. Anyone who has looked
at architecture in England sees it partly through the eyes of John Piper.
This year has been a sad one in the toll of deaths of some key figures in
the English architectural world. Not least was the death earlier this year
of Sir James Richards, the man who, as editor of Architectural Review, was a
friend of John Betjeman, John Piper, Osbert Lancaster and many others who
combined their talents in the pages of that magazine. Sir James Richards was
always known as JMR when he was on 'The Archie'. He gave me my first job in
architectural journalism and remained a quiet friend over the years, always
encouraging and giving thoughtful advice. It was JMR who first introduced
John Piper to John Betjeman and encouraged their collaborations on the Shell
Guides to British counties; he also published the work of both of them in
the Architectural Review.
In the Shell Guides - and also in some of Murray's Architectural Guides - it
is sometimes hard to separate the contributions of Betjeman and Piper; but
John Piper's brilliant architectural photographs are always distinctive.
They shared the same approach to looking at England and it is worth
recording their manifesto:
'We still believe in the virtue of making clear our reactions to buildings
and to towns and villages. We believe that houses and churches do, and
should, inspire love and hate, and that it is worthwhile recording the
reactions of two observers, instead of making a cold catalogue. We are aware
that this puts us in some bad company; and that occasionally our remarks,
made after only one or two visits to places, will very likely offend people
who know those places better and have looked at them longer; but we shall be
content if we succeed in inspiring love for a few buildings which might
otherwise receive neglect, or a cold, impartial revaluation.' Not a bad
creed for any writer, artist or photographer.
It was Piper with his almost unnerving feeling for places who made us look
at English Romanesque sculptures; the austere churches on Romney Marsh; the
English seaside, especially Brighton; the isolation of the Isle of Portland;
and the lush classical beauty of Stowe. I think it was the sombre painting
of Seaton Delaval, that marvellous Vanbrugh house on the Northumberland
coast, that first inspired my affection for Piper's work. His thunder clouds
and lowering skies that lurk over the paintings of Windsor Castle
commissioned by Queen Elizabeth brought forth the comment from King George
VI: 'You didn't have much luck with the weather, Mr Piper.'
Piper created a romantic world that often echoed his own enthusiasm for what
he called 'pleasing decay'. This is a world where buildings are beginning to
go back to nature, where they have that picturesque character that Ruskin
called 'parasitical sublimity'. This is a sublimity caused not by the
inherent character of the building or ruin, but by something external to it.
Piper's views of bomb-damaged buildings in Bath or of uncleaned and
unrestored Oxford buildings both show the romantic nature of decay.
Piper had strong views on restoration and cleaning and I am not sure that he
would have been entirely sympathetic to some of the activities of English
Heritage or the National Trust. He would have seen the point of leaving
Stonehenge to fend for itself and of making houses stable, but not over
restored. But this enthusiasm for the intangible atmosphere of the past
nourished a creativity that made a lot of new works of art. The Eton College
chapel windows are a brave essay in abstraction, while being completely in
tune with the ideas of medieval stained glass. At Coventry Cathedral, the
Baptistry window has a memorable presence that is almost theatrical.
Perhaps it is that Coventry window that seems to burn brightest with John
Piper's extraordinary energy. He never stopped working, looking, talking and
enthusing about the glories of England. There are more than 5,000 of his
beautiful photographs in the archives of the Tate Gallery and any sadness at
his death can be tempered by gratitude for his enduring vision. He did
achieve what Betjeman saw as his mission in the 1940's, 'to weld closer
together his deep, learned and poetic love of England with his clearly
formed principles of what a picture should be'.

If BBC1's new soap opera Eldorado (7.00) can fight its way through to the
audience, and continue to do so for six months or so, it will probably
acquire a big following. The formula is pretty simple and looks effective:
two parts Dallas gloss, two parts teenage interest from Neighbours, two
parts pub life from Coronation Street, with lashings of sun and sex. Episode
1 begins with a girl being flung out of the macho rotter's flat, lock, stock
and lacy knickers.
Of course ITV is mounting a 60-minute special of Coronation Street as a
spoiler (7.00) but then the BBC burned Grace Archer to death on the night
that commercial television began in Britain and where did that get them?
BBC1 follows its new soap with another screening of the overrated Australian
comedy Crocodile Dundee (7.30) and ITV follows 'Coronation Street' with
another screening of the overrated American comedy Three Men And A Baby
(8.00).
A new series of Antenna on BBC2 (8.00) begins with a programme about time
travel. Also on BBC2 is a series genuinely new to Britain, Siskel And Ebert,
in which two American film critics review new releases (11.15).

Sir Trevor Holdsworth, the distinguished industrialist, has agreed to join
the advisory board of UK strategic consultants LEK Partnership.
LEK's board already boasts plenty of eminent names - including Lord
Boardman, the former chairman of National Westminster and Lord Carr of
Hadley, home secretary during part of the Heath government. But to date
there has been no-one who could match Sir Trevor's industrial background.
While Sir Trevor will not be offering the benefit of his wisdom direct to
LEK clients, the consultants reckon that having the 'very serious and
profound knowledge' of the former GKN chairman and CBI president on call
will help counter any charges that strategists are better on theoretical
rather than on practical questions.
Sir Trevor is also chairman of National Power.

sewer on the Isle of Dogs.
The contract, which is believed to be the largest awarded in London
Docklands for two years, has been placed with MILLER CIVIL ENGINEERING and
is worth in excess of Pounds 11m, although overall project costs are in the
order of Pounds 21m.
Construction of the sewer will commence at Prestons Road roundabout on the
Isle of Dogs and will terminate at Thames Water's pumping station at Abbey
Mills. It will be constructed as a tunnel, 2.4 metres in diameter, 2.7
kilometres in length and will be built at an average depth of 14 metres.
The project is due to start in July and work is expected to be completed by
spring 1994.

<TEXT>
Computers which understand spoken English and reply in kind have hitherto
been the stuff of fantasy; now they are fast becoming a reality.
Jeff Fishel is co-founder and managing director of a new UK firm - the
Talking Computer Company - which markets a personal computer designed to
appeal to executives who object to keyboards. Fishel and co-founder Len
Palladino say there is powerful interest in their machine, a personal
computer which accepts commands and gives responses in natural language.
The Pounds 12,500 computer itself is comparatively orthodox,
but a training session is necessary to accustom the computer to the voice of
each individual user.
Fishel (above left) has experience both of telecommunications and computing;
he was country manager in Germany for a French computing services company
and before founding the TCC he ran Intercom, a telecommunications software
company.
Palladino (above right), a US citizen, spent four years as European
vice-president of Alpha Microsystems following senior positions with General
Automation and Northern Telecom.
TCC's director of technology, Kit Smith, is also technical director of
Aptech, which is providing the technology behind TCC's speech recognition
methods.

FT  06 JUL 92 / People: FNFC attracts Ingram back home
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be some who raise their eyebrows at Tim Ingram's decision to
chuck up a good career in a beautiful place like Australia and return to the
UK to take on the job of finance director of loss-making First National
Finance Corporation.
However, Ingram feels he is making the right move. At 45, he says that it is
too late to emigrate. Having joined Grindlays Bank after leaving Cambridge
in 1969, he spent much of his early life running the bank's operations in
outlandish places like Zaire, Greece and Cyprus.
After ANZ Bank bought Grindlays, he moved to Australia and was put in charge
of its ADollars 15bn commercial loan portfolio. But with two children at
school in England he felt the urge to return and was tapped for the job by
Martin Mays-Smith, FNFC's new chairman and a former colleague from Ingram's
early Grindlays' days.
Ingram is not an accountant. But Tom Wrigley, FNFC's 55-year-old chief
executive, sees nothing unusual in having a banker as finance director. 'The
critical part of our operation is on the liability side of the balance
sheet,' says Wrigley, who is hoping that Ingram will provide fresh expertise
in developing new areas of funding such as securitisation of assets.
Keith Dalwood, 59, FNFC's finance director for the past three years, will
continue as a director.

Results Due
ASDA, the highly-indebted Leeds-based grocery chain, will have much to tell
its anxious shareholders when it reports its full-year results today.
Analysts have pencilled in an Pounds 80m profit figure but this could be
severely depressed depending on how much of a financial hit Asda takes on
its redundancy programme and whether it accepts the charge above or below
the line.
The hard-pressed company has also warned that it is likely to take a
substantial write-down on the portfolio of 60 stores it expensively acquired
from Gateway in 1989. This could run into hundreds of millions of pounds.
Shareholders will want to know how Asda plans to tackle its shrinking
volumes and pinched margins. The company's chief executive, Mr Archie
Norman, has been in the hot seat for six months now and investors are
growing restless for some answers.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewer, is likely to report today pre-tax profits
for the year to April only marginally ahead of Pounds 217m a year earlier.
Higher interest charges have eaten up much of the increase in operating
profits.
On Wednesday, the UK's biggest electrical chain, Dixons, will report its
full year results, which should provide a a good insight into whether there
are any flickerings of life on the high street. At the time of its interim
results, chairman, Mr Stanley Kalms was upbeat about the strength of the
recovery, but since then demand is believed to have slackened. Pre-tax
profits are expected to have fallen by some Pounds 10m to Pounds 71m, with
the company's US operations continuing to drag down the overall numbers.
The Rank Organisation is expected to report on Thursday six-month pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 90m and Pounds 94m, slightly down from last year's
Pounds 96m. The fall is likely to come from Rank's share in Rank Xerox and
particularly from Fuji Xerox, hit by the downturn in the Japanese economy.
Rank's own businesses, which include Butlin's camps and Shearing coach
holidays, tend to have a far busier second half than first. The group will
be asked how much progress it has made in disposing of the 22 UK hotels it
has put up for sale, but analysts do not expect much news yet.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Economics: Markets focus on G7 for signs of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets will this week scour reports from the Munich summit for
hints of policies either to encourage growth or bolster specific currencies.
Even if the news from the meeting of the leaders of the Group of Seven
industrial nations fails to contain such nuggets, there will be plenty of
economic data from other sources for the number-crunchers to work on.
In the UK, further indications are expected on Friday of the degree to which
inflationary pressures are being squeezed from the economy by the recession.
Markets are expecting the increase in the year to June in the retail prices
index to come out at 4.1 per cent, down from the 4.3 per cent for the 12
months to May.
Elsewhere, important figures on the state of the labour market in both
eastern and western Germany will provide signals as to the degree to which
its economy is slowing down.
Perversely, many commentators will hope these figures will indicate growing
economic weakness. Assuming demand levels in German economy start to come
down later this year, the way may be clear for the Bundesbank to reduce high
German borrowing rates.
Such a move would give the green light for other European countries to shave
interest rates in a bid to revive their faltering economies.
The following are the highlights of the week ahead. The figures in brackets
are median market projections, supplied by MMS, a financial information
company.
Today: Germany, G7 summit, lasts until Wednesday. UK, G10 committee on
banking regulation unveils new international standards; May credit business
(Pounds 30m repayment). US, June 21-30 car sales. France, 1st quarter GDP.
Canada, April leading indicator.
Tomorrow: Australia, central bank has monthly board meeting. US, May
wholesale trade. Germany, June unemployment (up 20,000 for western Germany,
down 25,000 for eastern Germany), May employment (up 25,000 for western
Germany), June vacancies (down 5,000 for western Germany), May short time
working (down 20,000 for eastern Germany). Sweden, June unemployment rate.
Wednesday: Japan, central bank holds regular press conference, May trade
surplus (Dollars 9.1bn), current account details and May foreign bond
investment. US, May consumer credit.
Thursday: US, initial claims for week ending June 27, money aggregates for
week ending June 29. UK, 2nd quarter house prices survey by Halifax building
society. Australia, June unemployment rate (10.7 per cent) and employment
(flat). Canada, May vehicle sales (down 3.8 per cent) and June housing
starts (up 170,000).
Friday: US, June producer prices index, 1st quarter retailers financial
report. UK, June retail prices index (up 0.2 per cent on month, or 4.1 per
cent on year; excluding mortgages, up 5.1 per cent on year). Norway, June
consumer prices index (up 2.3 per cent on year). Canada, June unemployment
rate and employment growth (11.1 per cent and 0.1 per cent), May unadjusted
department store sales (up 0.5 per cent on year).
During the week: Germany, May industrial production, manufacturing output
and orders (down 0.2 per cent, down 0.2 per cent, up 0.2 per cent), May
trade surplus (DM2.2bn) and current account deficit (DM2bn), May retail
sales (down 1.6 per cent on year). Switzerland, June consumer prices index
(up 4.1 per cent on year), unemployment rate (2.8 per cent). Holland, June
consumer prices index (up 4.2 per cent on year). Denmark, May unemployment
rate (11 per cent), France, June M3 growth (0.4 per cent on month).

FT  06 JUL 92 / Unions urged to recruit harder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS are in danger of losing any influence in industry or society because
of their dwindling membership, Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU
engineering and electrical union, warns his members today.
Unless unions start recruiting hard, Mr Laird writes in the union's journal,
'the current merger-mania will amount to little more than rearranging the
deckchairs on the Titanic'.
The AEEU itself - recently formed through a merger between the AEU
engineering union and the EETPU electricians' union - has seen engineering
membership drop by 11 per cent over the past year.
Mr Laird says unions have lost a total of 3.5m members since 1979 and there
are now just under 10m union members, representing 38 per cent of the
directly employed workforce.
'Unions in Britain are less effective than even our dwindling numbers would
suggest,' he adds. 'Our 10m members are split into 20 large unions, dozens
of smaller unions and hundreds of staff associations.'
Arguing for further mergers, Mr Laird points to the problems faced by
manufacturing employers who still 'have to deal with three or four manual
unions and two or more staff unions'. Although union membership in Germany
is lower than in Britain, effectiveness is increased by single unions in
each sector, he adds.
'Here in Britain we are still trying to compete against Germany with a
Victorian trade union set-up. Mergers have taken place in a random and
unco-ordinated way,' he writes.
In a barely disguised swipe at some of the poaching activities of his own
electricians' section, Mr Laird says the union should not be 'interested in
petty squabbles with the general unions about a few thousand members here or
there on the periphery of industry', but should be 'reaching out and
recruiting the unorganised'.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Ashdown steps up 'dialogue' campaign

<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday stepped up his campaign
to expand 'dialogue and debate' across British political parties while
keeping his party's 'distinct' identity.
He urged Liberal Democrat councillors at a conference in Eastbourne, East
Sussex, to work with other parties 'who might share in our agenda for
reform' on local and national political stages.
He said: 'We must create the forum, not owned or dominated by any party, in
which the exchange of new thinking can take place and in which the battle of
ideas on which our movement will depend can be organised and won.'
Mr Ashdown, reflecting pressure from his party's MPs not to consider deals
with either Labour or the Tories, said the Liberal Democrats had to build on
their identity in local, national and European elections.
The party had to show 'that there is a new sort of politics which can be
built in Britain out of the barren soil of a system which is dominated by
the Conservative party'.

FT  06 JUL 92 / BCCI protest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BCCI plea: Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, with a giant cheque
for more than Pounds 6bn outside the Bank of England yesterday - exactly a
year after Bank of Credit and Commerce International was closed down. The
cheque represents the Pounds 5.9bn owed to creditors and about Pounds 100m
owed to former employees.
Mr Vaz said: 'When the Bank of England closed BCCI . . . they ought to have
realised the hardship, distress and anxiety that they would cause to
hundreds of thousands of depositors and employees all over the world. This
cheque is a symbol of what is required to ease the plight of those who have
suffered.'

FT  06 JUL 92 / Labour pains from working in a more equal world
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR ROSS PEROT has struck a raw nerve. The benefits of free trade in general,
and open borders with Mexico and Canada in particular, may have become an
accepted part of the economic orthodoxy that both Mr George Bush and Mr Bill
Clinton apparently share. But in the minds of many blue-collar Americans,
the North American Free Trade Agreement spells lower wages and fewer jobs.
Little wonder that Mr Perot's barely concealed protectionism finds a ready
constituency.
Few economists or policy-makers doubt that the free trade between Mexico and
the US will generate more jobs and wealth for both countries. The
Washington-based International Institute of Economics calculates that a net
130,000 new jobs will be created. But nor can they ingenuously deny that
there will be winners and losers from removing trade barriers; and the
losers are likely to be unskilled US workers in relatively low wage
occupations. The institute also expects 112,000 US workers to be displaced
as US manufacturers move production south of the border where wages are only
a fifth of US levels.
The experience of the last two decades suggests that the fears of low-wage,
low-skill Americans are well-founded. Their opposition to Nafta may be more
overt because Mexico is so close to home, but low cost competition from east
Asia and Latin America has been eroding the relative wages and employment
prospects of poorly educated Americans for years.
Nor have these economic forces affected the US alone. Research by Mr Steven
Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Business School, shows that
wage inequality has grown across the industrialised world over the past two
decades. The wages of young, inexperienced and poorly educated workers,
particularly men, have fallen relative to better educated, high-skill
workers whose jobs are not threatened by cheap, low technology imports.
Not every developed country has experienced such a large rise in overall
wage inequality. In France, for example, the wages of the bottom 10 per cent
of workers have barely changed relative to average French wages. France has
not escaped these economic forces, however, merely redirected their effects.
The wages of the top 10 per cent of French workers have risen rapidly
relative to the average. But the combination of a relatively high minimum
wage and unemployment benefits has put a floor to wages at the bottom of the
wage distribution. Instead, poorly educated French workers have been
progressively priced out of work, leading to persistently high rates of
unskilled, youth and female unemployment.
Yet on a global scale the consequences of reducing trade barriers are more,
not less, egalitarian. As the demand for low-skill labour shifts towards
developing countries, so unskilled wages in these countries have been slowly
catching up with those in developed countries. Meanwhile, within those
developing countries, the effect of free trade has been to reduce wage
inequality as the growing demand for manual labour raises the wages of the
unskilled workers relative to those of the highly educated elite. The result
is that over time, the degree of national wage inequality between developed
and developing countries has converged towards a common standard, as the
charts show.
While this wage convergence is good for poorly paid Mexicans, it is painful
for their American counterparts. Protectionist sentiments in Europe have
been stifled by the fact that, in most of these countries, the real wages of
the lowest paid have continued to rise. But not in America: US average wages
have barely changed in real terms for two decades while the real wages of
the poorest 10 per cent of US workers have fallen by over 30 per cent since
1970. Little wonder that Mr Perot sees votes to be won through
protectionist, America-first rhetoric.

FT  06 JUL 92 / India orders audit at four foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S central bank has ordered a detailed audit of the treasury operations
of the four foreign banks most heavily involved in the securities trading
that precipitated the Bombay financial scandal.
The Reserve Bank of India is appointing special auditors to look at the
accounts and internal control systems within the treasury departments of
Standard Chartered, ANZ Grindlays, Citibank and Bank of America.
The audits, which come in the wake of a similar scrutiny of Indian
state-owned banks most actively involved in securities dealing, are to be
completed within a month.
The announcement marks the first time that the two large American banks have
been officially linked to the scandal, the dimensions of which continue to
grow as further brokers are arrested and interrogated. Both Standard
Chartered, the British bank, and the Australian-owned ANZ Grindlays have
made heavy provisions for losses as a result of the scandal.
Bank of America says that its own internal audits have revealed no faulty
transactions. Citibank said yesterday: 'We have nothing to hide and nothing
to worry about.'
The fresh inspection came as a surprise to the foreign banks as the Reserve
Bank has already conducted an extensive inquiry into the trading operations
of banks in the securities market. The full report of the committee under Mr
R. Janakiraman, vice governor of the Reserve Bank, is due to to be published
today.
Politicians and commentators have, however, been pressing for a fuller
inquiry into the operations of the four major foreign banks, which derived a
substantial part of their profits from securities trading.
In what could be a growing backlash against the foreign banks, press reports
have suggested that some foreign banks acquired undue influence through
recruiting relatives of politicians or civil servants.
Police inquiries are also believed to have prompted the Reserve Bank to take
a further look at transactions in the interbank securities market where the
activities of brokers have increasingly come under investigation.
The inquiries are focusing on transactions between the foreign banks and the
domestic banks most deeply involved in the scandal, including State Bank of
India, United Commercial Bank of India and Canara Bank.
The Reserve Bank said at the weekend that it was focusing on the treasury
departments of foreign banks the securities trading of which seemed
disproportionately high in recent months.

FT  06 JUL 92 / A piece of the American dream comes to Poland: Levi's plant
was fought over like its jeans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE outskirts of Plotsk, a dreary town of 110,000 people 70 miles
northwest of Warsaw, a brightly painted Levi Strauss plant is bringing a
piece of the American Dream to Poland - at a price equal to a third of the
country's average monthly wage. Yet to judge by the long queues outside
Levi's store in the centre of Warsaw, there is no shortage of customers
ready to pay. Indeed, the store has the biggest sales for its size of any
Levi's outlet in Europe.
Though Levi's products were a scarce commodity under communism, its brand
has long been one of the best known in central Europe. Says Mr Claude
Flauraud, general manager of Levi Strauss Poland: 'The one thing we were
sure of was that we had a willing consumer.'
What Levi's did not know when it decided 18 months ago to manufacture in
Poland was that its plant would be fought over as fiercely as its jeans.
The company wanted to produce locally, both to take advantage of Poland's
low costs and to avoid import duties. When it advertised for a greenfield
site, it drew more than 100 replies. The initial choice was Lodz, a textile
centre west of Warsaw.
Then a group of politicians and municipal officials in Plotsk came up with a
more attractive deal on an empty 10,000 sq m warehouse complex. 'They really
wanted us to go there, while the people in Lodz didn't get their act
together,' says Mr Flauraud.
When Levi's accepted, Lodz hit back with a salvo of angry propaganda, which
grew into a war of words between the two cities during last year's spring
election campaign. 'It was rather embarrassing for the company,' says Mr
Flauraud, a 39-year-old Swiss.
Since then, events have moved at dazzling speed, partly because of the help
of Plotsk authorities in cutting through red tape locally and in Warsaw.
Local contractors took four months to fit out the warehouse, and last
December the machinery started going in. In March the first pair of jeans
rolled off the line.
Recruiting the 230, mostly female, staff was no problem in a city with
rapidly rising unemployment. Each receives up to six months on-the-job
training from locally hired supervisors, who had been trained for several
weeks at a Levi's plant in Hungary. There are five full-time expatriate
managers in Plotsk.
'At first, all the employees were holding their breath to see what would
happen,' says Mr Bill McNee, Levi's operations manager. 'They were very
suspicious that once they reached their production targets, we would raise
the targets or cut their pay.' But only three of the original recruits have
left.
At 2m Zlotys (Pounds 78) a month plus bonuses for a 40-hour week, average
pay is relatively high for Poland, though well below western levels. But
wages account for only about 15 per cent of total costs at the plant, as
highly automated as any in the world. Absenteeism is negligible, and reject
rates are near western levels. 'You could be in a Levi's plant anywhere,'
says Mr McNee.
The biggest problem is importing cloth, supplied to all Levi plants
worldwide from one US textile mill. Mr Flauraud complains bitterly of long
delays and inefficiency at Polish customs, which mean the plant has to carry
twice the normal stock levels.
Production is expected to reach 1.5m pairs of jeans annually by the end of
this year and 3m two years later. But Levi's recognises that, at a retail
price of Dollars 50 (Pounds 26) for a pair of 501s, that is far more than
Poland can absorb. For some time to come, over half of the production will
be exported to the EC, which has already guaranteed access. Exports will
also provide a currency hedge for Levi's total planned investments in Poland
of Dollars 20m over four years.
Compared with setting up production, local distribution has been much more
difficult. Levi's jeans had been sold since the 1970s through state-owned
hard-currency outlets. But their dingy facilities were light years away from
the smart, up-beat environment in which the company likes its products to be
displayed.
The problem has been to find a replacement. After looking in vain for
suitable retail partners, the company decided to distribute through its own
branded stores. Since April, it has opened eight and plans four more by the
end of July.
Poland is the only country where Levi's owns its outlets, which everywhere
else are franchised. Few Poles can afford the Dollars 200,000 needed to set
up a franchised store, though the company recently signed its first
agreement with a franchisee. Even going it alone has been a struggle. Levi
has three staff members permanently hunting for sites, a process which can
take six months.
Mr Flauraud, who is also Levi's business development director for eastern
and central Europe, has travelled widely in the region since 1979. But this
is the first time he has been responsible for setting up a plant and
managing a national business. He reckons the experience will stand him in
good stead when he is called on to spearhead the next stage of Levi's drive
east - the revival of stalled plans to build a plant in the former Soviet
Union.

<TEXT>
THE Turkish government's election pledge to oust President Turgut Ozal has
been given a new boost with publication of an opinion poll yesterday,
suggesting 59 per cent of Turks believe he should be removed from office.
The poll is the latest indication of growing popular discontent with
political interference by the president. It follows Mr Ozal's repeated use
of his veto over legislation and bureaucratic appointments, and a public row
over who should sign the Black Sea Economic Co-operation pact.
The leadership row has been simmering for months since Mr Suleyman Demirel,
prime minister, promised to oust Mr Ozal, who in 1989 used his party's
parliamentary majority to have himself elected president. Both opposition
parties boycotted the vote.
Mr Demirel would need a two-thirds parliamentary majority to change the
constitution, the only legal way, barring impeachment, to force the
president to step down.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Chirac, leader of France's RPR Gaullist opposition party, has
ended weeks of uncertainty by declaring that he will vote for the Maastricht
treaty on European union.
His decision, announced at a party meeting on Saturday, puts Mr Chirac in a
minority in his own party. In an attempt to reduce divisions, Mr Chirac told
RPR members they were free to vote as they liked in the September 20
referendum on Maastricht. 'I do not want an isolated France and a divided
Europe,' he added.
President Francois Mitterrand's decision to call the referendum has split
the RPR between a pro-European leadership and a nationalist majority led by
Mr Charles Pasqua. For a while, Mr Chirac said he was unable to come to a
view and needed time to consider.
Opinion polls suggest a majority will vote for Maastricht, so it would be
unwise to campaign on anti-EC policies. According to a poll in Journal du
Dimanche, 58 per cent will vote to ratify the treaty and 42 per cent
against.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATO and the Belgian chief of staff have made highly unusual appeals to the
government over its plans for huge defence cuts which include an end to
conscription, according to a television report, Reuters reports from
Brussels.
Belgium's centre-left government said on Friday it would end military
conscription by 1994, which will roughly halve the 86,000-strong armed
forces. Defence spending would also stay below current levels for at least
five years.
BRT television reported on Saturday that the country's chief of staff,
General Jose Charlier, had written to the government complaining that the
plan was unworkable and that it would be impossible to maintain Nato
commitments.
It also said Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner had asked Belgian Prime
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to reconsider the plans. No comment was
immediately available from Nato, which has its headquarters on the outskirts
of Brussels.
Mr Dehaene's spokeswoman refused to comment on whether there had been any
appeals but said the government would not reconsider its decisions on
reshaping the military. 'The government's decision is clear,' she said.
Belgium badly needs the savings brought by the 'peace dividend' after the
end of the cold war to cut its crippling budget deficit.
Defence Minister Leo Delcroix told a news conference on Friday Belgium would
not let its Nato partners down or renege on other commitments, such as
taking part in UN missions.
Belgium had some 22,000 troops stationed with other allied forces in western
Germany during the cold war. It plans to bring all but a brigade of 4,000
home by 1995, reflecting similar moves by some other western allies.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Czechs plan private toll motorway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Czech Republic looks set to become one of the first countries in the
former eastern bloc to open a privately financed toll motorway.
It has invited 22 international groups to submit preliminary bids for
building and operating an 83km stretch of the planned east-west motorway
between Prague, the Czech capital, and Nuremberg in Germany.
The 22 were chosen from more than 70 expressing an interest in the project.
Kleinwort Benson, the British merchant bank advising the Czech Republic,
said the list read 'like a who's who of the international contracting
industry'.
Construction of the motorway is expected to cost more than Ecu350m (Pounds
247m). In addition, the winning bidder will be required to fund the project,
so incurring finance costs.
The Czech Republic is only the second former eastern bloc country to plan a
privately-financed toll road. The first was Hungary, which last year
announced plans for two sections of toll road costing an estimated Pounds
100m to build. Hungary, however, has not yet selected a bidder for the
contract.
Like other former eastern bloc countries, Hungary and the Czech Republic
face heavy demands on their road systems because of rising levels of car
ownership and growing east-west trade.
Lacking sufficient funds to build the necessary motorways themselves, they
are turning to the private sector to finance, build and operate them
instead.
The Czech toll motorway will consist of an upgrading of the existing D5 road
between Rozvadov on the Czech-German border and Plzen, roughly half-way
between the border and Prague.
The rest of the D5, which is being upgraded by the state, will remain
toll-free.
Construction of the motorway is due to start next year, with completion in
1996. The private sector will be given a concession to operate the toll road
for a pre-determined period, after which it will revert to the state.
The Czechs planned to offer concessions for a further 400km of private toll
motorway if the initial project succeeds.

FT  06 JUL 92 / Trial of Communist party set to end in compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOW much and yet how little life has changed in Russia is illustrated by the
fact that tomorrow the Communist party which ruled the country for 74 years
will go on trial, while former party chief Mikhail Gorbachev is accusing
President Boris Yeltsin of heading towards dictatorship.
Although the party's fate shows just how much has changed, Mr Gorbachev must
remember the winter of 1990, when he embarked on the conservative U-turn
which ultimately cost him his job and broke up the Soviet Union. In recent
weeks Mr Yeltsin has made similar alliances with conservatives in industry
and the military.
The sense of deja vu was reinforced, when Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister, warned on Tuesday of the danger of an 'anti-democratic
coup', as Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, his Soviet predecessor, had done before
him. Mr Kozyrev even went so far as to warn that Mr Gorbachev's fate could
befall Mr Yeltsin if 'we begin to make concessions to these forces'.
But other Yeltsin supporters say the parallels are superficial. The main
issue now is not whether to proceed with political and economic reforms, as
was the case two years ago, but how to strengthen the government's hand so
it can continue the reforms.
Further, they argue, Mr Yeltsin's direct popular mandate and the fact that
market reforms are already under way put him in a much stronger position
than Mr Gorbachev, an unelected leader who fell back on the traditional
pillars of the party and KGB to stay in power. Then, Mr Gorbachev gave in to
the blackmail of military and industrial hardliners rather than risk
launching fast-track market reforms.
Now, Mr Yeltsin has to deal with industrial managers who have so far refused
to respond to the government's financial austerity measures: instead of
sacking workers, they have continued to trade with each other without
demanding payment. They and the new industrial managers who have joined the
government argue that the country is not ready to absorb large-scale
unemployment, that production cannot be allowed to fall any further, and
that popular discontent could explode overnight if further hardships are
heaped on to the back of price rises.
On Wednesday, Mr Yeltsin, who says a coup is impossible but he needs the
support of industrial managers to achieve reforms, will put the case to G7
leaders in Munich that he also needs western cash to succeed.
Finally, Mr Yeltsin has been seeking the support of military conservatives.
In particular, he needs to keep under control Russian forces in now
independent republics where they risk being sucked into local conflicts and
siding with Russian minorities whom, in the case of Moldova, Mr Kozyrev
described as 'extremists'.
This, at least, is the explanation given by Yeltsin supporters, and some
western diplomats, for his decision to appoint as deputy defence minister a
man like General Boris Gromov. An Afghan war hero, Gen Gromov was deputy to
Mr Boris Pugo, the hardline Soviet interior minister who shot himself after
the failure of the August coup.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court, which tomorrow is to decide on the
legitimacy of Mr Yeltsin's ban of the Communist party, is itself likely to
be a compromise in the name of political stability. Although the
constitutional grounds for it are shaky, it is unlikely that the court will
overturn the ban.
This is because neo-communist groups have been active in fanning nationalist
and anti-reform passions and because the Communist party was indeed a
dangerous machine that needed to be abolished - and not least of course
because a verdict against Mr Yeltsin would cause immense damage to his
authority.
In the absence of a better bet than Mr Yeltsin to continue the reforms, the
world can only take his word for it that he needs all the help he can get.

<TEXT>
FRENCH roads remained chaotic yesterday despite the government's efforts to
end the lorry drivers' dispute. Some roadblocks were cleared in the north
but new ones were erected in the south.
Force Ouvriere, one of the trade unions involved, threatened to step up its
protest because of the government's refusal to abandon plans to introduce a
new penalty system under which driving licences can be forfeited for
motoring offences.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, held an emergency meeting of
ministers in the morning to try to resolve the dispute. The government has
already threatened to suspend lorry drivers' licences unless they abandon
their protest. The transport ministry has been sending regional
representatives to negotiate with the protesters.
Some drivers have already dispersed. By yesterday morning, roadblocks had
been cleared from some sections of the motorways around Paris, Lille and
other parts of northern France. A convoy of 200 Belgian lorries trapped near
Lille was escorted to the border by riot police.
It was a different picture in the south where many roads remained blocked.
In Toulouse, one band of lorry drivers started to dismantle their roadblock,
only to be replaced by another group. Drivers also continued their strategy
of sealing off individual targets such as petrol depots.
The dispute has led to shortages of food, fuel and medical supplies. This
weekend the government is suspending the usual weekend restrictions on heavy
goods vehicles in an attempt to speed up deliveries.
Taxi drivers in Lille reinforced the campaign by staging their own protest
against the new system, driving through the city at a snail's pace.
In London, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, attacked the
'enormous disruption both to business and to people's annual holidays'.
Belgium advised its citizens not to travel in France.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Mayhew says aim is self rule for Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, has said he would like
to devolve wide-ranging powers to a new Northern Ireland administration -
'at least' to the same degree as the Stormont government that was suspended
in 1972.
British government policy for the last two decades has been to help society
in Northern Ireland to develop and, 'enable it once again to become self
governing, to the extent at least that it was when Stormont had
jurisdiction. That is our objective,' Sir Patrick said in an interview with
the Financial Times.
The government is committed to finding agreement with the main
constitutional parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on
new forms of government for the province. But Sir Patrick's comments give
the clearest insight yet into his own thinking since he took over the job
three months ago.
They contrast with the support of some unionists and Conservative MPs for an
'integrationist' policy, in which Northern Ireland would by ruled much like
other parts of the UK.
Unionist and nationalist politicians are due to begin talks on Monday with
the Irish and UK governments on 'strand two' of the nine-week-old
inter-party talks process. This is the point at which the Irish government
enters negotiations to talk about relations between north and south Ireland.
Before the imposition of 'direct rule' of Northern Ireland from Westminster
in the early 1970s, Stormont had responsibility for most policy areas,
including, critically, internal security. Westminster retained control of
national defence, foreign affairs, major taxation items, and customs and
excise.
Sir Patrick has also indicated that he would not oppose a bill of rights for
Northern Ireland - a proposal backed by all the main constitutional parties
in the province during the talks process. There is, however, a dispute
between unionists and nationalists about what such a bill of rights might
contain.
Sir Patrick said he opposed incorporating the European convention on human
rights into English and Welsh law but added: 'It doesn't flow from that that
I would necessarily oppose a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S President Vaclav Havel failed yesterday to win re-election
to the federal presidency, as Slovak parliamentarians blocked his candidacy
in the federal assembly.
The popular playwright-turned-president was eclipsed by a handful of Slovak
members of parliament who failed to give him a majority in the Slovak side
of the federal assembly.
The constitution states a presidential candidate must receive a majority of
votes in both the lower chamber of the federal assembly and in the upper
chamber, where Czech and Slovak parliamentarians vote separately and have
equal weight.
This gave a virtual veto to the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS),
the nationalist group led by Mr Vladimir Meciar, who had pledged to block Mr
Havel's re-election.
Mr Havel will stay in office until October 5 unless another presidential
candidate is elected by then. A second round of voting is planned for July
16 and potential alternative candidates have until then to come forward. In
theory, Mr Havel could run again in subsequent rounds if no other candidate
has yet been elected.
Members of the Civic Democratic party (ODS), the Czech party led by Mr
Vaclav Klaus, the Czech premier, will equally be able to block another
candidate, however. Mr Klaus has said he will not support another candidate
for the federal presidency.
Failure to elect a president will plunge Czechoslovakia deeper into a crisis
which threatens to pull the Czech and Slovak republics apart. A recent
agreement between ODS and HZDS, gives the Czech and Slovak parliaments until
September 30 to decide on the federation's future.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Mandela rejects offer of talks: De Klerk accused of ignoring
ANC demands on violence
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NELSON MANDELA, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday ruled
out an emergency meeting offered by President FW de Klerk, saying he wanted
the government first to meet ANC demands on violence.
'De Klerk has completely evaded all our demands and adopted a very negative
tone which puts us in a worse position than before,' Mr Mandela said in
Abuja, the Nigerian capital, after meeting President Ibrahim Babangida.
'We will only go to an emergency summit meeting if he complies with the
demands we have presented.'
The ANC is seeking an international inquiry into the massacre of 42 people
at Boipatong near Johannesburg last month. It broke off talks in protest
against government intransigence at negotiations and ongoing violence in the
country.
Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Nigerian leader of the Commonwealth, yesterday held
talks in South Africa with political leaders, signalling the prospect of
increased international efforts to help resolve the deadlock.
His visit follows the announcement by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United
Nations secretary general, that the UN was prepared to mediate in South
Africa, and talk of a visit by a troika of European Community foreign
ministers.
Chief Anyaoku met Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom Party following earlier meetings with Mr de Klerk, and with
Mr Mandela, whom he saw in Dakar, the Senegalese capital, during the
Organisation of African Unity summit.
A delegation of business leaders yesterday also met Chief Buthelezi as part
of a programme to visit all the main political leaders to encourage a quick
resolution of the impasse. The South African Chamber of Business has also
announced that businessmen across the country will make themselves available
to monitor police responses to violence.
But Mr De Klerk's strongly-worded attack on the ANC this week, in which he
accused it of being an unreliable negotiating partner, leaves the two main
political players set on a confrontation course. The ANC remains committed
to mass action to try to hasten the transition to democracy, while the
government says it will not tolerate ANC attempts to seize power.
Mr Mandela said yesterday that these allegations were 'utterly false' and
also rejected charges that the ANC stand on township violence was 'hard
line', adding 'people must use mass action and the power they have when
discussions with the authorities have become futile'.
Despite the confrontational tone of government comments, contained in a
letter to Mr Mandela, the path back to the negotiating table has not been
shut off. An appendix to the letter sets out a number of proposed government
concessions.

HAFNIA HOLDING, which controls Denmark's second largest insurance group, S
said it had asked the Copenhagen Bourse to be allowed to launch its
postponed DKr2bn (Dollars 344m) rights issue and lift this week's two-day
suspension of trading in its shares with effect from Monday morning, Reuter
reports from Copenhagen.
Hafnia said investigations would continue over the weekend into irregular
option transactions by a now dismissed senior manager, which sparked this
week's crisis in the company.
Hafnia suspended trading in its shares on the Copenhagen bourse on Thursday
along with postponing the share offering planned to start that day after
discovering irregularities in an options deal.
The deal obliged Hafnia to redeem DKr288m for shares in Interbank, a small
but successful Copenhagen niche bank, owned by Brondby Football Club. Hafnia
said its directors were unaware of the transaction.
Hafnia said investigations would continue throughout the weekend and that if
any further irregularities came to light an announcement would be made to
the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and further action taken.

FT  04 JUL 92 / The fragile truce is broken: Co-operation is giving way to
confrontation in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela this week gave notice that the
battle for post apartheid South Africa is about to begin in earnest.
Amid a welter of often vituperative exchanges between the two leaders and
their lieutenants, the fragile truce established when Mr Mandela walked to
freedom two and a half years ago has finally collapsed. It may yet be
restored if wiser heads prevail, whether within South Africa or from
outside. But unless that happens very soon, industrial strife and bitter
confrontation on township streets and city centres seem inevitable.
President de Klerk's anxiously awaited television appearance last Thursday
evoked memories of an earlier watershed in the country's history. Seven
years ago South Africa and the world watched their screens to see whether Mr
de Klerk's predecessor, Mr P W Botha, would cross the Rubicon and press
ahead with reform. He did not; and his finger-wagging, pugnacious television
performance triggered the worst crisis since Sharpeville. Mr Botha rejected
majority rule and retreated into the political cul-de-sac from which Mr de
Klerk still has to escape.
He has yet to show that his insistence on a power-sharing agreement can be
reconciled with Mr Mandela's demand for majority rule, notwithstanding the
optimistic gloss he placed on the last round of constitutional talks last
May. 'We were very close to reaching an agreement,' Mr de Klerk told his
television audience on Thursday night, 'which would have led to the first
election in which all South Africans would have voted.' Within months, Mr de
Klerk continued, South Africa could have had an interim government and a
transitional constitution ensuring the rights of all, which 'would have
prevented domination and the abuse of power'.
It would be difficult to find a member of the ANC who would agree with this
assessment. Mr de Klerk's unrepentant stance on Thursday night will have
confirmed that little, if anything, has changed to narrow the gap between
the two sides. Far from backing away from his concept of power-sharing, Mr
de Klerk made it clear that he believes it is a viable option.
For a man confronted with the most serious crisis of his career, Mr de Klerk
looked and sounded remarkably confident. It was as if he believed that in
South Africa's hour of need he could play the role of a statesman,
addressing his message over the heads of squabbling political leaders to a
silent majority yearning for reassurance that peace and stability were
within reach.
'I appeal to all South Africans, wherever you may be, whatever community or
party you may belong to, be calm and responsible,' he urged. 'Say 'No' to
those who try to incite anger and hatred. Say 'No' to any act or deed which
will endanger your job or your security.'
For most observers with experience of the mood and circumstances of
Johannesburg's black townships, the 'just say no' appeal seemed risible. Yet
Mr de Klerk has experienced that anger at first hand. Furious residents of
Boipatong, scene of the massacre of 42 residents last month which
precipitated the current crisis, drove the president away when he attempted
to convey his sympathy.
Mr de Klerk, however, had an explanation: it was not a spontaneous response
but a politically organised protest, he told listeners. This may be partly
true, for the ANC had advance warning of his visit. But if Mr de Klerk
believes that he would otherwise have received a sympathetic and
appreciative welcome, he is misreading the township mood.
But while Mr de Klerk was playing statesman on television he was also
preparing for the elections that he believes lie ahead. On the morning of
his address to the nation, he consolidated his own alliance with Chief
Gatsha Buthelezi, leader of the predominantly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party,
whom he met with other conservative black politicians. Later that day, he
sought to drive a wedge through the coalition led by Mr Mandela.
It took the form of a memorandum to the ANC leader, putting the government's
formal reply to the organisation's terms for the resumption of talks at the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). It provided striking
confirmation of Mr de Kerk's political game plan, based on a seemingly
unshakeable belief that - provided the ruling National Party plays its cards
right - it will remain central to the government of South Africa.
Going on the offensive, he angrily accused the ANC of responsibility for
political violence and warned that 'mass mobilisation' could jeopardise
stability. More important, he singled out for attack two of the ANC's most
important allies - the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and
the South African Communist Party - accusing them of seeking to foment an
'insurrection'.
Even during the most cordial period in relations with the ANC, government
ministers have expressed unease about forming a coalition with a party with
such supporters. In his memorandum to Mr Mandela, the South African
president effectively said that, as presently constituted, an ANC'National
Party coalition is ruled out.
Critical to his strategy of appealing to the silent majority over the head
of the ANC, however, is the question of whether Mr de Klerk has read the
mood of the townships and the black community as a whole accurately. Many
observers believe that he may be underestimating the strength and passion of
African nationalism.
Nowhere was this more clearly displayed than earlier in the week when the
ANC-led coalition assembled in Boipatong's football stadium to lead the
mourning for the massacre victims. Old rivalries between the ANC and the
radical Pan Africanist Congress were set aside as speaker after speaker, led
by Cosatu's fiery general secretary, Mr Jay Naidoo, endorsed the call for
'mass action' - a series of strikes, demonstrations and acts of civil
disobedience designed to force Mr de Klerk to capitulate to majority rule.
'Every time when we try to negotiate, they tell us to go to hell,' said Mr
Naidoo. 'We will take them to hell with us,' he declared to roars of
approval.
This apocalyptic vision may be distant. Mr Mandela has to take into account
the fact that many black South Africans, notwithstanding their impatience
for change, will be apprehensive at this prospect. On the other hand, those
to whom it appeals, notably the young, jobless blacks, may conclude that the
veteran, essentially moderate ANC leader should be supplanted by somebody
more radical.
Adding to Mr Mandela's predicament is the fact that aside from mass action
he has few weapons to bring to bear. The ANC's guerrilla army poses no
significant threat, while the prospect of a resumption of trade sanctions is
at best remote. Mr Mandela believes, however, he can veto Mr de Klerk's
strategy by refusing to co-operate with him.
It remains to be seen whether the ANC campaign can be sustained in the face
of high unemployment, and of the security forces that Mr de Klerk has made
clear will be vigorously deployed. Even as the two sides were preparing for
confrontation, influential voices of alarm were starting to be heard. In
Cape Town yesterday, where earlier this week police fired on demonstrators,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu was expressing concern about the wisdom of mass
action. 'I am worried,' he said: 'Having marched, what then? It's impressive
but, in a way, so what? I am not entirely persuaded that the ANC and its
allies would always be able to ensure that these demonstrations are
peaceful.'
Some observers believe that the gap between the government and the ANC over
terms for the resumption of Codesa talks has, despite the furore, been
closing. Mr de Klerk has moved some way towards meeting the ANC demand for
an international commission of inquiry into the Boipatong massacre. Two
legal experts from abroad have joined the Goldstone Commission, currently
inquiring into township violence, while the local police investigation will
receive external evaluation.
Other demands, including an end to alleged covert security force operations
and a ban on dangerous weapons in public, are in principle at least not
resisted by government.
But even observers inclined to a charitable view of the government's role in
township violence acknowledge that Mr de Klerk needs to put principles into
practice. The disclosure that former members of a notorious
counter-insurgency unit are now part of a police unit reinforces speculation
about government involvement in political killings. Nor has the government's
reluctance to disband the 32 Battalion, which has been strongly criticised
by the Goldstone inquiry, inspire confidence.
For most black South Africans and many whites, Mr de Klerk's renewed denial
of government complicity in violence does not carry weight. One senior
western diplomat said that Mr de Klerk's handling of the issue to date
suggested the president was either 'complicit, incompetent or complacent'.
Only Mr de Klerk's fiercest detractors suggest the former, but few people
can now convincingly defend him against the other charges. 'What Boipatong
has shown, above all, is the cost of a police force which nobody trusts,
which cannot prevent its own members from opening fire at the most
disastrous moments, which will not disband its covert units,' wrote one
political commentator.
Western diplomats, once reluctant to advocate external involvement in South
Africa, are coming to the conclusion that the time may have come for a
United Nations, Commonwealth or European Community role. Chief Emeka
Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary general is already in town. Mr Douglas
Hurd, UK foreign secretary, is expected to lead a 'troika' of Community
ministers on a fact-finding visit within the next three to four weeks. And
Mr de Klerk on Thursday said he would consider creating a joint monitoring
body on violence, on which representatives of the international community
might serve in an 'observer capacity'.
Western diplomats take cautious hope from this tentative offer, to which the
ANC has yet to respond. But they remain deeply apprehensive about stepping
into the South African minefield. 'We might be prepared to help monitor a
peace agreement adopted by de Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi,' said one, 'but
they must first make peace.'
Such is the climate of distrust and hostility, however, it is difficult to
see South African politicians managing to reconcile their differences
without the help of outsiders.

FT  04 JUL 92 / British Gas poised for clash with watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS and Ofgas, the industry regulator, last night appeared to be
heading for a confrontation over the rate of return the company should earn
on its gas transportation business.
Under an agreement with the Office of Fair Trading, British Gas is obliged
to hive off its pipeline and storage business into a stand-alone company.
British Gas insists the pipeline business should earn a rate of return of
10.8 per cent on new investment and 6.7 per cent on existing assets.
Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas director-general, has several times made clear
that he believes the current rate of return of 4.5 per cent should be
sufficient for the new business, although Ofgas has not yet set an official
figure.
British Gas retorts that the 4.5 per cent rate was adopted as a short-term
measure to encourage competition when the transportation business was opened
to third party gas suppliers in 1989. When British Gas Transportation is
separate, British Gas argues, it will operate as a unit with no
cross-subsidies so that a higher rate will be necessary.
British Gas yesterday submitted to Ofgas a study by Oxford Economic Research
Associates and J Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank. It said the
necessary rate of return was 6.7 per cent on existing assets, and 10.8 per
cent on new investment.
The study said that the rate was essential to:
Enable British Gas to sustain the gas transmission and storage network.
Ensure the company earns sufficient return on new investment to expand the
network and invest in additional capacity.
Create the incentive for an efficient system which provides gas
transportation at the lowest cost. Establish a fair system for customers and
shareholders with non-discriminatory prices and no cross-subsidies.
Sir James was unavailable for comment yesterday. Ofgas said it had not
reached any conclusions on an appropriate rate of return and would consider
British Gas's submission together with its own research.
Mr Philip Rogerson, managing director of group finance at British Gas, said:
'The key consideration is investment. If the reward were not great enough,
we would not be able to make the investment required.'
Outside analysts have also warned of the potentially damaging effect of
setting too low a rate of return.
However, analysts warn that British Gas's submission was 'unrealistic'
compared with regulated rates of return for other utilities, which range
between 5 per cent and 7 per cent.

The figures show that bottom of the league with just 24 per cent of replies

only marginally worse than the Department of Transport which achieved 26 per
cent.
Star performers with 92 per cent of letters answered on time were the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Midland Airways, the UK's second biggest scheduled air carrier, is
to shed some of its 2,800 staff after a disappointing first half of this
year.
The airline plans to cut costs by 10 per cent by October. It hopes most of
the losses will be achieved through voluntary redundancies and
non-replacement, but compulsory redundancies have not been ruled out.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman, said: 'We need to keep our cost base down and
we are assuming no recovery in the economy until the spring of 1993.'
The company's performance so far this year was 'below plan', he said.
British Midland runs short-haul services in the UK and the rest of Europe,
and saw an increase of 10 per cent to 11 per cent in the number of
passengers it carried over the first half of last year.
This was significantly worse than the performance of its rivals. The 22
members of the Association of European Airlines saw growth of 18 per cent
for the first five months of the year on European flights.

FT  04 JUL 92 / CBI calls for change in audit control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUDITING Practices Board should be moved from the control of the
professional accountancy bodies and placed under the independent umbrella of
the Financial Reporting Council, the Confederation of British Industry has
recommended, Andrew Jack writes.
In a detailed submission to the board, the CBI opposes big changes in the
existing framework of auditing, but says a change in control of the board is
desirable. The submission was first made several weeks ago, but in new
documents in response to the Cadbury report on corporate governance, the CBI
renews its call for a rationalisation of accounting and auditing bodies.
The CBI criticises proposals to rotate audit firms or audit partners and
also attacks the idea that the audit requirement for small companies should
be lifted.
It says auditors could not be put under a duty to detect fraud or other
illegal acts. Auditors could not be expected to act as a public watchdog
without consulting a company's directors and are constrained by evidence,
confidentiality and defamation.
The CBI says auditors should continue to be allowed to offer consulting
services to clients and that proposals for rotation of audit firms would
bring a risk of greater audit failures.
It also criticises suggestions from the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales and from Cadbury that interim and preliminary accounts
should be audited.
Two thirds of accountants believe the existing self-regulation mechanisms
for auditors are inadequate and half support the idea of an independent body
created by the government, a survey by Robert Half, recruitment consultants,
indicated yesterday.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Top public-sector pay has risen above average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAY of some groups covered by the Top Salaries Review Body has risen
faster than the increase in average earnings since 1979, when the first
Thatcher government was elected.
The disclosure comes as the cabinet prepares to discuss the latest report
from the body, which is said to recommend substantial rises for senior civil
servants, military personnel and judges.
New Treasury figures show that the pay of the head of the Civil Service, the
chief of defence staff and of senior circuit judges has risen by 338 per
cent since 1979, compared with an increase of 318 per cent in average
earnings.
Last year the weekly salary of Sir Robin Butler, the head of the Civil
Service, was Pounds 2,006.70 - on a par with Field Marshal Sir Richard
Vincent, chief of defence staff, or some seven times average earnings of
Pounds 284.70 per week.
In 1985, the last time there was a thorough review, the pay of those covered
rose between 7 per cent and 46.3 per cent. The government was able to
command only a 17-vote majority on the issue against its normal majority of
more than 100.
The cabinet decision on whether to accept the review body's recommendations
must be announced to MPs in the next two weeks, before the recess. Senior
Tory backbenchers have made clear their concern that the increments should
not be substantial.
The Treasury information came in a Commons written answer to Mr Michael
Meacher, shadow social security secretary. Mr Meacher said yesterday that
Labour would regard government approval of increases of anything approaching
30 per cent as 'absolutely outrageous'. The party would oppose such a
measure with a three-line whip in any debate. 'At a time of slump it is
provocative for those on the highest pay to take more than the average
increase,' he said.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Minister warns of Scottish 'grievances'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government must frame policies which are not only good for Scotland but
which are acceptable to most Scots if the union is not to lose sympathy and
support, a senior Scottish Office minister said yesterday.
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, minister of state for Scotland, said he believed
Scotland would now 'enter a post-devolution era' after the defeat in the
general election of the Labour party, which had proposed a devolved Scottish
parliament.
The credibility of Labour's devolution proposals was in tatters and the
Scottish party had split into factions ranging from those who wanted to play
down the constitutional issue to those who were crypto-nationalists, Lord
Fraser told Conservatives in Nottingham.
He added that the threat to the union would return 'unless we deal with the
perceived grievances and concerns which caused it to appear in the first
place'. The Conservative's success in the election had given the party 'a
tremendous opportunity to make a new start in Scotland'.
Lord Fraser, who has responsibility for constitutional affairs in Scotland,
gave no indication of any new ideas the government is considering for the
government of Scotland.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has said the government is 'taking stock'
of the issue.
As an illustration of the government's new approach to running Scotland,
Lord Fraser said that the test for membership of health boards and of health
trust boards would be 'real skills, drive and determination to provide
first-class health in the 1990s'.
This was taken as a signal that the government would no longer confine
appointments to health boards to people with Conservative sympathies, as has
happened in the past few years.

FT  04 JUL 92 / First steps of the housing recovery falter: An end to the
sales slump is as far away as ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S deeply depressed housing market looks as far from recovery as
ever. Sales, which had shown promise of picking up earlier in the year, have
faltered in the past six weeks according to housebuilders.
Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, says: 'Sales in May and April were
very poor.' Mr Tony Pidgley, managing director of Berkeley Group, says that
conditions in the housing market are now slightly worse than a year ago.
The group has managed to boost its profits by taking advantage of cheaper
land which, in parts of southern England, has more than halved in price
since the peak in the housing market in 1988.
Other housebuilders, which raised borrowings to buy expensive land at the
end of the 1980s, have been hit as badly as the people who bought the homes.
Sales - and prices of property and land - have fallen sharply.
Mr Robert Sellier, chief executive of loss-making YJ Lovell, which earlier
this year was forced to renegotiate its financing arrangements with banks,
estimates that house prices have fallen by a further 5 per cent since
September.
The failure of the market to respond to lower prices and mortgage interest
rates means that, nearly four years after the market peaked, families are
struggling to sell homes which in southern England are worth on average a
quarter less than the prices paid for them in 1988. It is not unrealistic to
suggest that some people may have to wait until the next century before
getting their money back in nominal terms. In real terms, after adjusting
for inflation, they may never recover their losses.
Concern over the plight of the housing market has prompted some Conservative
MPs to sign a Commons motion calling on the government to extend its
eight-month 'holiday' on stamp duty which is due to end next month.
Housebuilders, while throwing their weight behind the move, fear it will do
little to lift the market out of its slough. One depressed executive says:
'Lets face it, sales should be picking up by now if stamp duty was really
making any difference.'
Prospects for a recovery getting under way this summer are diminishing.
April, May and June, before the school summer holidays start, are usually
big months for house sales. With the holidays almost upon us indications are
that purchases may be even lower than during the corresponding months last
year.
According to the Inland Revenue, the number of house transactions in England
and Wales during the first five months of this year fell by more than 20 per
cent against the first five months of last year - which included the Gulf
war.
A better guide to current trends are building society figures showing that
net new commitments over the same two periods fell by more than 14 per cent.
Building societies usually give a commitment to lend money about 10 weeks
before the loan is made and the sale concluded.
Falls of 21 per cent in net commitments in April and 26 per cent in May,
compared with the same two months last year, bode ill for summer house
sales. Meanwhile prices are still falling according to Nationwide Building
Society, which said they declined on average by a further 0.5 per cent last
month.
Housebuilders, which have been offering substantial discounts and sales
incentives, fear that any increase in prices is unlikely to arise before the
end of next year because sales need to climb substantially before any
recovery in prices can begin.
Assuming that prices after next year rise at an average annual rate of 5 per
cent - which seems reasonable given growth restraints likely from UK
membership of the ERM - it would not be until the year 2000 that average
prices in south-east England returned to their 1988-89 peak. For families
who bought homes in East Anglia, where prices have fallen by an average of
30 per cent since the beginning of 1989, the wait could be even longer.
Some of these people, who took out 100 per cent mortgages, will be trapped
in homes which will be worth less than money borrowed to buy them.
Such fears only undermine confidence further. Halifax, the country's largest
mortgage lender, says that the biggest single factor holding back a recovery
is concern over rising unemployment and the state of the economy. It hopes
there will be some recovery in sales in the second half of this year leading
to a gentle rise in prices next year - but those hopes must now be receding.
THE NUMBER of housebuilding starts fell 4.6 per cent in May compared with
the same month last year, the Department of the Environment announced
yesterday. According to provisional figures, 14,400 dwellings were started
against 15,100 in May 1991. Completions numbered 11,800 compared with
14,500.
In the three months to the end of May, 43,200 dwellings were started, a fall
of 1 per cent on the same period last year. Completions were down 9 per cent
at 39,100.
The seasonally adjusted figures show that in the three months to the end of
May total starts were down 2 per cent compared with the previous three
months, while total completions were down 1 per cent.
Private enterprise starts were down 7 per cent and completions were down 4
per cent.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Easing of Sabbath law comes closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORTHODOX Jews in north London may later this year be able to visit friends
on a Sabbath and not have to leave their homes unlocked.
Barnet Borough Council this week brought closer the establishment of an eruv
 -an area within which aspects of Jewish law are relaxed.
Sabbath laws forbid carrying anything out of doors, which means not just
bags held in the hand but keys carried in the pocket. Pushing prams or
wheelchairs is also prohibited.
Strict adherence to the law can be severely limiting for disabled people and
families with small children, who cannot attend synagogue services or visit
relatives on what is traditionally a family day.
An eruv waives this law, though stricter sections of the community continue
to observe it.
Most Jewish communities around the world already have eruvs, but it is only
now that the United Synagogue has launched a plan for Britain's first eruv.
The area proposed covers 6 1/2 square miles of London around Hampstead
Garden Suburb, Golders Green and Hendon where Jewish communities have
congregated.
Barnet's permission was sought because an eruv must have a clear boundary.
Natural boundaries such as rivers or railways are used where possible, but
in gaps, a thin wire stretched between metal poles indicates the boundary.
The United Synagogue has won clearance for the poles under safety rules, but
must apply for full planning permission.

FT  04 JUL 92 / MPs win spurs on Finance Bill: Labour's new backbenchers
assure Emma Tucker that the party is not a 'busted flush'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S demoralised front bench may have lost its pre-election energy but
this has not stopped a handful of backbenchers engaging in vigorous
opposition.
Over the past 10 days a number of recently elected Labour MPs have made
their debut on the standing committee on the finance bill - the legislation
which implements the Budget.
The sittings yielded little excitement this year. The most interesting
elements of the Budget, such as the new 20p tax band, were dealt with before
the general election. But a Conservative majority of only two on the
34-member committee - reflecting the balance of the House - has given Labour
a sharper edge.
Mr John Hutton, the youthful new MP for Barrow-in-Furness, said: 'The
committee provides us with an opportunity to show the Tories that the Labour
party is not a busted flush and that we are not prepared to lie down and let
them roll over us. We are showing the government that if we choose to, we
can make it very difficult for them.'
Over the two weeks that the committee was sitting the opposition adopted the
usual tactics of demoralisation through exhaustion. Conservative members
were instructed to keep interventions to a minimum, so Labour in effect
dictated the length of the proceedings. During the first week of
discussions, two of the committee's three sittings ran until 4am. This week,
one ended at 7.40am.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour's Treasury spokesman, said the opposition's main role
was to make sure the Budget was properly scrutinised. But he confessed to a
certain amount of 'skirmishing and gamesmanship'.
He said: 'It is only right for us, the opposition, to explore the
possibilities and see if we can persuade any Conservatives to break ranks.'
The proceedings have ended with no upset for the government. The 83-clause,
170-page bill is now scheduled for its final Commons stages next week.
However, if the opposition failed to defeat any clauses or impose
amendments, new MPs did get the opportunity, so rare in the chamber, to
practise their debating skills.
The dozy afternoon sessions were taken up with long speeches that roved
through the rubble of Sheffield's old industrial zones, Dudley's deserted
town centre, the smoky rooms of Barrow's working men's clubs and the steel
sites of Wolverhampton.
Mr John Watts, Conservative MP for Slough, who has sat on the committee
since 1984, said: 'I think the opposition decided the committee was a chance
to give some of the bright new members a bit of a blooding - a chance to
earn their spurs.'
The new Labour terriers include the moustachioed Mr Geoffrey Hoon, MP for
Ashfield, and an eloquent speaker on Europe. He sat next to Mr Peter
Mandelson, Labour's former campaigns director and now MP for Hartlepool,
whose frequent references to the Hartlepool Marina soon found their way to
the newsdesk of a local newspaper.
Mr Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, leapt to his feet at every
opportunity while ginger-haired Mr Ken Purchase, MP for Wolverhampton
North-East, championed the Black Country. Mr Alan Millburn, the dapper MP
for Darlington, spoke often, and at length, about the north-east, while Ms
Barbara Roche, one of the three female members of the committee, wove
together the links between the film industry and her London constituency of
Hornsey and Wood Green.
The Tory members, led by Mr Stephen Dorrell the no-nonsense financial
secretary, had less fun. There was only one new face on their benches - Ms
Judith Chaplin, MP for Newbury - who sat quietly scribbling through most of
the proceedings.
Occasionally the older Conservative hands retaliated over matters such as
inheritance tax or the business expansion scheme. Some, such as Mr Watts,
even introduced amendments. But most of the time they sat glumly opening
piles of letters under the stern gaze of Mr Tim Wood, the government whip.
All 18 Conservative members - picked more for dependability than their urge
to scrutinise the economy - were present at every session and they never did
break ranks.
Perhaps Mr Brown was right when he remarked at the beginning of the first
session: 'Some Conservative members may feel that their contribution to the
committee is confined to nodding and waiting, and that they are wanted more
for their bodies than for their minds.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / Lloyd's 'irritated' by Hain attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S professionals yesterday reacted with surprise to being named in the
Commons in connection with the losses on the reinsurance spiral.
Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, used parliamentary privilege to allege
in an early day motion that two members of the inquiry into the insurance
market, chaired by Securities and Investment Board chairman Sir David
Walker, had 'claimed millions of pounds' on the LMX - London market excess -
spiral.
Lloyd's called Mr Hain's motion 'irritating' and said: 'If nothing else it
demonstrates his complete lack of understanding of the London insurance
market.'
In the motion Mr Hain said that Mr John Lock and Mr Leslie Lucas, both of
whom served on the Walker committee, had claimed money on the spiral  - the
controversial reinsurance system in which syndicates and companies trading
in London reinsure each other's exposures to catastrophe risks.
Mr Hain's motion named other senior Lloyd's figures in the context of LMX
business. It called for a 'full public and independent' inquiry into the
market, 'together with its proper regulation by statute'.
Mr Leslie Lucas, chief executive of Norwich Winterthur Reinsurance, said
that he was 'astonished' to be named in the motion. He added that his
company had claimed - and also paid - millions of pounds in connection with
the spiral.
The text of Mr Hain's motion said that 'the Walker report into the Lloyd's
Insurance market does not reveal the extent to which five members of the
Lloyd's Council, who manage syndicates, used the LMX 'dustbin' syndicates
for their own reinsurance to the tune of Pounds 623.5m, nor that Stephen
Merrett has losses on his syndicate 418 of Pounds 230.8m, which he has
unloaded onto the LMX 'dustbin' syndicates to the extent (of) Pounds 229.8m,
nor that Alan Jackson had a loss of Pounds 93.5m and claimed Pounds 122.5m
from his reinsurers'.
The motion added that the report also had not revealed that 'members of the
Committee of Lloyd's caused and actively encouraged the enormous growth in
LMX business'.
Meanwhile, Lloyd's confirmed that the extraordinary general meeting which is
to be held on July 27 would lead to a postal ballot if at least 50 members
present at the meeting called for one.
Its response followed concern from some disaffected Names - the individuals
whose assets back the market - that Lloyd's was backing down from permitting
a ballot to take place.
Lloyd's governing council faces votes of no confidence at the meeting
following the disclosure of Pounds 2bn losses in 1989.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Delors seething at 'power-mad' jibes: David Buchan meets a
much-misunderstood Commission president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JACQUES Delors puts a brave public face on the burgeoning debate over the
Maastricht treaty's future.
'What is good about the period of ratification is that the Community will be
better built with the informed participation of Europe's citizens than on
indifference,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. 'To build
it on indifference would be to base it on sand.'
Privately, he is still seething about the role of power-grabber into which
he feels some people have cast him. In particular, he contests claims that,
before the Danish vote against Maastricht, he tried to use the admission of
new members into the Community as a pretext to centralise more power in
Brussels, and that he only became interested in 'subsidiarity' after
Denmark's vote.
He is still more thin-skinned to criticism than most major politicians. But
he is also more insistent than most politicians on getting his own facts
right. To back up a point on northern countries' self-interest in giving the
south more money, for instance, he breaks off the interview to go burrowing
through his files for a figure on Iberian imports.
To questions on when/how/if Maastricht might be ratified, Mr Delors
maintains a Trappist silence. Denmark's future in the EC can, he says, 'only
be tackled when the other 11 countries have ratified the treaty'. Britain's
prime minister, John Major, showed 'a margin of prudence', he says, in
remarking that Britain might not ratify the treaty this year.
Mr Delors is confident that his fellow Frenchmen will approve Maastricht,
but is unsure of precisely what role he will play in the September
referendum campaign. The French vote will be crucial, and he turns its
importance against the treaty's opponents. 'There are those in France who
say France will disappear in the construction of Europe. But the fact that
everyone is now looking to France shows this not to be the case.' He
acknowledges that the Community's internal debate about Maastricht may put
off some people in countries which have applied to join the EC. 'They must
run the same risks as us ..at least they are being well-informed about what
is at stake.'
But Mr Delors goes on the offensive on three points:
The EC budget. 'We must have the means to carry out our ambitions,' he says
in support of his plan to raise EC spending by Ecu21bn (Pounds 15bn) a year
by 1997-9 to meet the Community's external commitments, to close the growing
gap between the competitiveness of EC companies and those of Japan, and to
meet the needs of southern EC countries.
Only this last goal requires genuinely new money - about Ecu8bn out of the
Ecu21 bn increase - Mr Delors says. European governments would have to spend
more on helping their companies and neighbouring countries, even if the
Community did not exist, he points out. But the Community exists and goes on
growing. 'You cannot give the same budget to a young man of 18 years as to a
one-year-old baby.'
Economic cohesion and convergence. The link between these two issues should
interest all EC states, says Mr Delors. Giving more cohesion money, or
structural economic aid, to the poorer countries helps them to build their
basic infrastructure, partly by buying equipment from richer EC states.
Having dug out the Iberian imports figures, he says Spain and Portugal
increased purchases from other EC states by 190 per cent in 1985-90.
Subsidiarity. Mr Delors says he has taken the initiative on this 'to show
people that we are not in the process of building an (EC) decision-making
machine that automatically grabs more and more power'. Community laws must
be both necessary and comprehensible. But de-centralisation cannot be pushed
too far.
'If, in the name of de-centralisation, we were to scrap Community controls
on car emissions, we would be taking two serious steps backwards - breaking
up the single market and hurting the cause of reducing trans-frontier
pollution.' Nor, he says, should the citizen be frightened by the complexity
in EC legislation, which is no greater than at the national level. 'After
all, every year millions of Britons fill out tax forms based on an
enormously complicated tax code.'
Subsidiarity has an even stronger role to play in foreign policy. The
Maastricht treaty commits the 12 states to gradually taking more 'common
actions'. But Mr Delors says 'we have 12 foreign policy machines, with
strong traditions and geo-political interests .. and this is not going to
change overnight'. The most striking recent freelance initiative was
President Mitterrand's mercy mission to Sarajevo, straight from last week's
EC summit in Lisbon. Had the French president informed Mr Delors in advance?
'No, when I got back to Brussels, my wife told me she had heard about it on
the radio - but I don't complain.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / US Senate approves aid for Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate on Thursday night approved the Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 570m)
assistance package for Russia and its neighbouring republics, which is the
cornerstone of the international effort to promote market democracies in the
former Soviet Union.
The House of Representatives is expected to consider equivalent legislation
later this month. The convincing margin of the Senate vote makes its
approval more likely.
The US contribution to the international aid package had appeared in doubt
prior to the visit here last month of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, the
high point of which was his powerful speech to a joint session of Congress.
Until then, congressional sentiment had been in favour of first spending
scant resources on US economic needs.
In the event, the Senate passed its bill by 76 to 20, with only a handful of
insignificant amendments tacked on for domestic political purposes.
Simultaneously addressing internal concerns on Thursday, the House passed
its version of the urban aid bill and both chambers approved an extension of
emergency unemployment benefits.
President George Bush had lobbied hard for passage of the Russian aid bill,
which includes authorisation for an additional US contribution to the
International Monetary Fund and for the proposed rouble stabilisation fund.
The Senate action will help the president when he meets Mr Yeltsin at the
end of the G7 summit in Munich next week.
Also on Thursday, the Senate foreign relations committee gave Russia its pat
on the back by approving last year's Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(Start), negotiated with the former Soviet Union and subsequently amended to
take account of new political realities.

FT  04 JUL 92 / MPs angry at delay to Bingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS from the Treasury that the Bingham report on the collapse of BCCI may
not be published until after the Commons summer recess provoked an angry
response from MPs yesterday, Ralph Atkins writes. More than 100 MPs - mostly
from the Labour party - have signed an early day motion calling on Mr John
Major, the prime minister, to ensure that the report is released before the
summer recess which begins on July 16. The motion was also signed by Mr Hugh
Dykes, Conservative MP for Harrow East.
The delay appears to have been caused by the complexity of the affair. When
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced the inquiry under Lord Justice
Bingham last July, he said he hoped the inquiry's conclusions would be
released before the general election. The Treasury, however, has still not
received a copy of the report.
The report's conclusions are likely to be controversial. The government will
publish as much of the report as possible, but will hold back parts which it
considers might prejudice criminal trials or which must remain confidential
under banking law.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Investigators dig deeper into BCCI: Extradition proceedings
continue - High Court backs 'enterprising' compensation scheme / The
continuing probe into the bank, shut down a year ago tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE year on from the day the Bank of England closed the doors on Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, many of those who helped conceal the
fraud continue to evade the efforts of law enforcement agencies in the UK
and the US.
Attempts by the Serious Fraud Office to interview the 18 former BCCI
executives who have been detained in Abu Dhabi since September last year
continue to be rejected. Abu Dhabi is assembling its own case which it wants
to try in the emirate.
In the 12 months since the closure, the SFO has made three arrests and one
of the main targets of its investigation is being held by police in France.
The UK government has started extradition proceedings against Mr Syed
Ziauddin Ali Akbar, the former head of BCCI's treasury operations which lost
Dollars 633m in 1985 when he was in charge.
Investigators in the US are preparing a request for the extradition from
Pakistan of Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, BCCI's founder, who was indicted in the US
on fraud and racketeering charges. Pakistan, however, is unlikely to accede
to such a request. Mr Abedi, who lives in Karachi, has been an invalid since
he underwent a heart transplant four years ago.
Neither is Saudi Arabia likely to welcome any approaches from the US seeking
the arrest of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, head of National Commercial Bank,
and of a banking dynasty which maintains close links with the Saudi royal
family. Through a spokesman he has described the US fraud charges unveiled
earlier this week as 'completely unwarranted and without justification'.
Sheikh Khalid, once the second largest shareholder of BCCI, became the
second of the Arabs with close connections to the bank to face charges in
the US. The first was Mr Ghaith Pharaon, the mercurial Saudi businessman who
is believed to have spent much of his time since the bank's collapse on his
yacht in the Aegean. Mr Pharaon was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Washington last November on racketeering charges connected with the purchase
by BCCI in 1985 of the Independence Bank of Encino, California. He was
indicted again in March in connection with an alleged fraud at CenTrust
Savings Bank, of Miami, Florida.
While Mr Pharaon and Sheikh Khalid remain out of reach of the US
authorities, the UK investigation has secured the co-operation of two other
prominent Arab businessmen connected with BCCI.
The agreement to testify in the UK by Sheikh Kamal Adham and Mr AR Khalil is
regarded as a crucial development for the SFO investigation. Sheikh Kamal
was interviewed voluntarily in the UK by the SFO this year. The SFO has also
collected evidence from Mr Khalil, a distinguished Saudi who runs a museum
of art history in Jeddah.
Both men were former shareholders in BCCI and both were directors with Mr
Akbar of Capcom Financial Services, a UK company closely connected with
BCCI. The US Federal Reserve Board has alleged that they helped to conceal
BCCI's secret ownership of First American Bankshares in Washington.
As a result of the interviews Sheikh Kamal could emerge as a key witness in
the BCCI cases being assembled in the UK. He has not been indicted in the
US, but investigators there say he is still under investigation.
The co-operation of Sheikh Kamal in the UK investigation is not surprising
given his long-standing relationship with the UK and the US, forged when he
was head of the Saudi Arabian Intelligence during the 1970s.
Another active area of investigation by the SFO centres on the role of some
auditors who worked for Price Waterhouse at the time of the audit. Police
raided PW offices in the Cayman Islands last month, and also visited the
homes of two executives, Mr Richard Fear, a former accountant with PW, and
Mr Richard Harris, a partner in PW's Caribbean firm.
One other target figure which the SFO rates as highly as Mr Akbar in
relation to the fraud is Mr Abbas Gokal, head of the shipping family whose
business in Switzerland has been placed into liquidation. Mr Gokal has left
Switzerland and is thought now to be living in Pakistan. Just how much the
Gokals owe BCCI is still not clear.
How much is recoverable from the collapse is difficult to gauge. Touche
Ross, the provisional liquidator, has identified Dollars 10bn of
liabilities. So far Touche has recovered in the region of Dollars 200m from
disposals, but it has been promised Dollars 1.7bn for the pot from Abu Dhabi
if creditors agree to waive their rights to sue the sheikhdom.
Lord Justice Bingham's report into the actions of BCCI's regulators will
study whether the Bank of England acted quickly and effectively enough when
it began to receive information that suggested wrongdoing at BCCI, and
whether it heeded sufficiently the warning signs in preceding years.
While the closure of BCCI sent a shockwave around the financial capitals,
the findings of the Bingham inquiry are likely to have their most serious
repercussions in the City and its creaking framework of financial
regulation.

FT  04 JUL 92 / G7 brush-off for Russia: Britain and Germany cool on 'G8'
suggestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY and Britain yesterday poured cold water on suggestions that Russia
should join the Group of Seven industrial nations, making it a G8.
British officials said it was unlikely that all members of the group would
want to expand the club. In Bonn, Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government
spokesman, said it was too soon for Russia to become a member of the annual
economic summit group.
On Thursday night, President Bush said he was prepared to discuss admitting
Russia at next week's G7 summit in Munich. The president did not commit
himself to supporting the inclusion of Russia, whose president, Mr Boris
Yeltsin, will confer with the Group of Seven leaders on the summit's last
day. But he said: 'I will be prepared to discuss this, making it a G8 if you
will.'
This did not seem, however, to be a considered policy statement. He was
responding to a question at a press conference by a Russian journalist and
answered, off-the-cuff, that the Russian economy was of sufficient size for
the issue at least to be debated.
UK officials said yesterday that Russian entry would be premature, adding
that Japan was likely to oppose such a move. Japan has outstanding
territorial disputes with Russia and the two countries still have not signed
a peace treaty to mark the end of hostilities in the Second World War.
Mr Vogel said: 'Russia has not yet met the economic conditions, and probably
not the political conditions either, quickly to become a member of the G8,
or a member of what has been the G7 up to now.'
The G7 leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada will therefore meet Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime
minister, for three hours of talks on Wednesday on a 'G7 plus one' basis.
The same procedure was adopted last year when the G7 leaders held talks with
President Mikhail Gorbachev of the former Soviet Union.
Next week's G7 summit is likely to give a strong message of support for Mr
Yeltsin and his efforts to push ahead with economic reform in Russia.
It is expected to support a rescheduling of Russia's official debts and the
release of a first tranche of Dollars 1bn of International Monetary Fund
credits for Russia on condition that the government in Moscow puts forward
clear plans for reducing its budget deficit and inflation.
Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrived in Britain yesterday on a
three-day visit ahead of the summit.
Mr Miyazawa, on his first official visit to Britain as premier, will meet
Britain's Prime Minister John Major, European Commission President Jacques
Delors and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney during his stay in London.
In the light of a swelling trade surplus with European Community members, Mr
Miyazawa is expected to explain his plans to spur a flagging economy to
create markets for more foreign goods. He will also seek European support
for Japan's demand that Russia returns four islands off northern Japan
seized in 1945.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Thames group says it will bid for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A CONSORTIUM led by Thames Television will deliver a bid
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
likely to be the minimum of Pounds 1,000 a year - for the Channel 5
franchise to the Independent Television Commission on Tuesday.
It will almost certainly be the only mainstream bid for the commercial
television franchise capable of reaching 75 per cent of the UK population
with conventional transmitters.
The Channel 5 Holdings consortium - which, apart from Thames, includes Sony
Pictures International, the Hollywood studios group, and Canwest Global
Communications, a Canadian international broadcaster - yesterday decided to
go ahead with the project.
The decision was taken even though virtually every other known potential
applicant has pulled out.
'If anyone bids Pounds 3,000 then they're overbidding by Pounds 2,000,' said
Mr Jeremy Fox, chief executive of The Entertainment Channel, a potential
rival for the franchise, which produced a bid application but decided this
week that the risk was too great.
The Channel 5 Holdings bid is being put together by Mr Richard Dunn, chief
executive of Thames, the largest ITV company. Thames lost its ITV franchise
in last year's competitive tenders.
Thames would have a 15 per cent stake in the venture - the maximum allowed
if it is to have the status of an independent producer.
Channel 5 Holdings is not a fully funded venture - so a significant part of
its equity would have to be raised if it won the licence.
There is no guarantee, however, that the commission will award the licence
for what is one of the last opportunities in western Europe for a new
channel using conventional broadcasting technology.
The factor that has helped to frighten off most of the potential bidders is
that the eventual operator will have a legal requirement to pay for the
retuning of several million home video recorders - the Channel 5 signal will
cause some interference.
Sir George Russell, chairman of the commission, has called this obligation a
potential nightmare and made it clear that if he thought the commission
might be overwhelmed by complaints from video owners, he would not award the
licence.
The Thames-led bid will draw on the expertise of the TV rental business of
its parent Thorn-EMI to tackle the retuning, although it is still expected
to cost around Pounds 50m.
Even if the retuning can be dealt with successfully, a Channel 5 operator
will have to pay for its own transmitters and, in most parts of the country,
persuade viewers to buy a new aerial.
Channel 5 will then have to compete with the existing four terrestrial
channels and against the increasing choice offered by satellite television.
The service proposed by Channel 5 Holdings would begin in London and move
gradually to the rest of the country. In addition to a national service each
city would have a segment of local programmes.
One other less conventional bid is possible. Dr Stephen Castell, a
telecommunications specialist, said yesterday that he had not ruled out
making a bid which would exploit digital technology, enabling four or five
channels to be squeezed into the single Channel 5. There would be no
interference problem, but viewers would need decoders to convert the digital
signal.
Dr Castell said yesterday that Channel 5 would be worth a bid of 'tens of
millions of pounds.' and that he would finance the venture by a share
offering to the public. However, it is doubtful whether Dr Castell will be
able to convince the ITC that he can launch a Channel 5 service by the
commission's final deadline of January 1 1995.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Transfer device for deposits is upheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHEME to maximise the compensation payable for money lost when BCCI
collapsed has been held by a High Court judge to be valid.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor - the senior Chancery judge - ruled
yesterday that people to whom BCCI depositors assigned parts of their
deposits qualified for compensation.
He emphasised that his ruling was made on the assumption that the
assignments were genuine and valid transactions and that there had been no
arrangement that an assignee would hold compensation for the benefit of the
original depositor.
He added that the Deposit Protection Board, which administers the
compensation fund, had reserved the right to pursue such matters.
The judge said that, under the 1987 Banking Act, compensation was payable to
depositors on the insolvency of a recognised bank or licensed institution.
The maximum payment was Pounds 15,000: 75 per cent of a deposit of Pounds
20,000.
The judge said that when the Bank of England started winding-up proceedings
against BCCI in July last year, 'an enterprising firm of accountants'
suggested a scheme under which a depositor would assign part of his deposit
to family members or friends 'who can be trusted'. About 50 depositors
assigned several million pounds to more than 200 assignees.
The scheme was stopped by parliament which closed the loophole with the
Banking Act 1987 (Meaning of Deposit) Order 1991, which said that from July
30, 1991, a 'deposit' excluded a sum to which a person became entitled after
presentation of a winding-up petition.
However, Sir Donald said, the BCCI scheme had, as a matter of law, achieved
its purpose in that it entitled assignees to compensation on those deposits
transferred to them.

ECUADOR holds the second round of its presidential elections tomorrow with
opinion polls suggesting a former cabinet minister, Mr Sixto Duran, is the
leading contender.
The polls put Mr Duran, who led in the first round of the election in May,
ahead by at least 10 percentage points over Mr Jaime Nebot of the Social
Christian Party.
Both candidates are rightwingers and would move to a more market-oriented
economy, following much of the rest of Latin America, and further away from
the present government's democratic socialism.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Hong Kong banks cut interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S bankers' association yesterday cut prime lending rates by 0.5
percentage points to 6.5 per cent following a signal from the colony's
Exchange Fund that borrowing should be made cheaper.
The Exchange Fund signalled the cut by lowering its discount rate by 0.5
percentage points earlier in the morning.
The move followed an easing in US monetary policy this week. The Hong Kong
dollar is fixed against the US currency and interest rate movements in the
colony track those in the US.
The interest rate cut is likely to fuel asset price inflation in Hong Kong.
With inflation at 8.8 per cent in the 12 months to May and deposit rates now
at 3.75 per cent for 12 months, the local interest rate structure
disadvantages savers.
The link to the US dollar has been criticised by some economists as
inappropriate to Hong Kong's conditions. Monetary policy in the US is aimed
at stimulating a slow growth, low inflation economy - the opposite of
economic conditions in the colony.
However, the government is unlikely to change the rate at which the local
currency is pegged against the US dollar because it believes the peg confers
financial stability and certainty.
Equally important, the pricing of contracts for the colony's multi-billion
dollar airport development are implicitly based on the maintenance of the
peg.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Anti-whaling nations claim IWC success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GLASGOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANTI-WHALING nations and conservation groups last night claimed success in
preventing the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from approving the
resumption of commercial whaling, which has been banned since 1985.
Although the anti-whaling countries, among which the UK is prominent,
pointed to success in blocking the resumption of commercial whaling under
the auspices of the IWC, whales are less safe than they were a week ago and
the future of the IWC is somewhat less certain.
The meeting, in a Glasgow hotel whose entrance was permanently picketed,
ended in disarray, with both of the whaling members of the Commission -
Norway and Japan - expressing their dissatisfaction with the delays in
progress towards implementation of a scientific model for calculating limits
to future whale catches.
A wrangle over the model dominated the closing session of the conference.
Attempts by Japan and Norway to secure implementation of the method - called
revised management procedure (RMP) - were defeated.
The method would form part of a new system for managing and monitoring
resumed commercial whaling which has been developed over the past seven
years.
However, attempts by Japan and Norway, to secure the actual implementation
of this calculation method as a preliminary stage to introducing the RMP
were defeated by 16 to five, with seven abstentions.
The resolution adopting the new model, or algorithm, was approved by 16 of
the 28 members attending the meeting, with one voting against. However, 11
countries, including the UK, abstained on the grounds that further studies
needed to be made before the calculation formula was adopted.
Mr Jan Arvesen, the Norwegian commissioner, concluded his closing speech by
saying: 'Should Norway continue to be a contracting member of the
International Convention on Whaling?' He did not answer the question.
Mr Kazio Schima, the Japanese commissioner, warned that it would be
increasingly difficult to secure political support in Japan for continued
adherence to the moratorium on whaling.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, announced on Monday in
Oslo that her country would resume commercial whaling next year, a move
which it had hoped would encourage the IWC to implement the RMP. Both Japan
and Norway will, in the meantime, continue limited whaling for scientific
purposes, despite being requested at the IWC meeting to reconsider this
policy.
Pro-whaling organisations from Norway, Iceland and Japan indicated they
believed the battle to resume whaling was gradually being won. They point to
the fact that Iceland this year carried out its threat to leave the IWC,
although it has yet to decide whether to resume whaling.
They also argue that Norway's decision to resume whaling has drawn attention
to the belief of the IWC that there are 114,000 minke whales (the smallest
of the great whales) in the north Atlantic and 760,000 in the Antarctic Sea.
'Conservationists can no longer use the phrase 'the last whale',' said an
Icelandic spokesman at the IWC meeting.
The fact that Japan is to host next year's meeting of the IWC does not
necessarily secure the organisation's future as the regulator of whaling,
which it has done since 1946, some observers believe. Iceland announced its
decision to leave the IWC after a meeting of the Commission in Reykjavik,
even after Icelanders witnessed the strength of anti-whaling protests.
They believe Japan could do the same if it fails to make more progress next
year.
Japan and Norway could form a separate body of anti-whaling countries, a
move which IWC officials concede would seriously damage the IWC's
credibility.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Fighting flares in Sarajevo as peace talks fail: United
Nations launches humanitarian relief operation to feed starving in Bosnian
capital
</HEADLINE>

PROSPECTS for an end to the civil war in Bosnia-Hercegovina looked bleak
last night after Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community's peace
conference on Yugoslavia, said in Sarajevo that he had made no headway in
peace talks, and the fiercest fighting for many days erupted in the city.
Lord Carrington's remarks coincided with the launch by the United Nations of
a massive humanitarian relief operation aimed at feeding the 300,000
starving inhabitants of the Bosnian capital. Serb irregulars and Serbia's
proxy Bosnian army have besieged the city for 89 days.
After talks with Moslem, Serb and Croat representatives, Lord Carrington
said: 'I do not think we have made any progress at all today.'
Late last night, heavy artillery fire was reported in the western suburb of
Dobrinja, while red tracer fire arched across the sky from Serbian positions
in the surrounding hills.
Mr Mirsad Becirovic, an editor of Sarajevo Radio, said Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic had refused to negotiate the territorial division of
Bosnia along ethnic lines, a plan backed by the EC and by Mr Radovan
Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs.
'If the UN has recognised Bosnia as an independent and integral state, there
cannot be ethnic regionalisation,' said Mr Becirovic. 'If Carrington still
wants to meet Karadzic than he must understand what (Mr Karadzic's) Serbian
democratic party has done to Bosnia. Europe has not seen such crimes since
the Nazis in the second world war.'
The Bosnian government has insisted on foreign military intervention as the
only way to stop the war.
Mr Izetbegovic has refused to hold face-to-face talks with Mr Karadzic,
saying the SDS is a terrorist organisation responsible for the bombardment
of Sarajevo and the ethnic cleansing of eastern Bosnia.
Serb forces currently control more than half of Bosnia, in an effort to link
territories with neighbouring Serbia. Witnesses have reported the summary
execution and mass deportation of Moslems to rid the region of non-Serbs.
Meanwhile, in Belgrade, Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister
designate, is due to hold talks on the formation of a new government.
On his arrival in the city last night, Mr Panic, a 62-year-old
California-based businessman, said his first priority was to stop fighting
in the former Yugoslav federation and lift UN sanctions against Belgrade.
Under intense international pressure and faced with a string of defeats by
Croat forces in western Bosnia, Serb forces on Monday handed over the
airport to the UN.
Over 100 tonnes of aid has now been airlifted to the city.
As local charities started distributing the food aid, inhabitants said it
was just a 'drop in the ocean' towards rebuilding their lives.
Humanitarian officials in Sarajevo say some 200 tonnes of food is needed to
feed the 300,000 people trapped in the Bosnian capital.
Mr Pero Butigan, secretary of the Bosnian Red Cross, said 22 tonnes of oil,
flour, tinned food and juices, part of the French relief effort, were now
warehoused in the city awaiting distribution.
'The problems are enormous. Sarajevo has been cut off for three months and
people were either on the verge of hunger or already hungry. When the
roadblocks are lifted the situation will really begin to turn around,' he
explained.
'Meanwhile people are being killed, and expelled from cities in the eastern
Bosnia - Foca, Gorazde and Bjeljina - they are completely cut off from the
outside world even from international humanitarian organisations,' he said.
Relief workers yesterday greeted the trickle of aid with mixed emotions.
'The reopening of the airport is only one step. But it will not end the war
and horror,' said an official of one of the Moslem, Serb and Croat charities
representing Bosnian's three main national groups.
The three charities closely co-ordinate their work with the UN High
Commission for Refugees and together give priority to the hardest hit cases,
refugees and districts which have been completely cut off.

<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S National Privatisation Agency (NPA) distributed nearly 4.3m
ownership certificates in June when the public began to register for their
30 per cent share of state equity, figures published yesterday indicate.
The agency estimates 26 per cent of those eligible have already received the
certificates, issued to Romanian adults on payment of a registration fee of
100 lei (17p).
Mr Mircea Vierosanu, NPA director-general, said public demand for the
certificates - the nearest thing to shares in Romania, which has no stock
exchange - had exceeded expectation and proved privatisation in Romania was
accelerating.
However, he was surprised so many Romanians had already sold their
certificates, and for such widely differing prices. In the Transylvanian
town of Timisoara, a book of five vouchers, one in each of the public
ownership funds, was selling for up to 100,000 lei (Pounds 170) while in the
northern region of Moldova, the same book might fetch only 4,000 lei.
He said a brokerage service would be set up at the Romanian Development Bank
in the next 10 days in an attempt to unify prices. The NPA would also
distribute 10m more leaflets explaining privatisation and urging the public
to wait until the true value of the certificates is established.

THE European Commission got much less than it wanted yesterday in aid
pledges for Yugoslav refugees at a meeting of the G24 group of rich
countries, Reuters reports from Brussels.
The European Community executive had wanted the G24 to double the
Commission's own aid offer of Ecu120m (Pounds 85m) for victims of the
Yugoslav conflict.
But diplomats said new pledges by G24 states totalled only about Dollars 8m
(Pounds 4.1m), and the Commission's own offer was halved by EC member states
in a behind-the-scenes budget row.
A Commission spokesman said after the meeting of G24 officials the executive
could go ahead with about Ecu57.5m in food and other aid.
To find more money for the EC's contribution, he said talks would have to be
held with the other EC institutions - the Council of Ministers representing
member states, and the European Parliament.

THE Serbian authorities under President Slobodan Milosevic have not
abandoned their policy of ethnic cleansing in Croatia or Bosnia-Hercegovina,
and Belgrade continues to militarily support Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia,
a report issued by the International Society for Human Rights yesterday
concluded.
In a grim account of cases occurring in the last five weeks, the ISHR shows
how the Serb irregulars under Mr Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic
have done nothing to stop killings, torture and forced migration of Bosnia's
Moslems, Croats, and those Serbs who refuse to collaborate with the
irregulars.
Ethnic cleansing 'almost invariably entails expelling people from their
homes, either by rounding them up and forcing them to leave, or by driving
them away with a campaign of terror,' it says.
It cites, among many accounts, how on June 12, 22 Moslem men, women and
children were rounded up and killed by a Serbian militia group in the
central Bosnian town of Visegrad.
It describes how Serb irregulars have pulled civilians from their homes in
the Sarajevo suburb of Dobrinja. Some have been killed, some have
disappeared, others have been used as hostages in exchange for Serb snipers
captured by Bosnia's defence units.
The ISHR, in common with other human rights organisations and international
aid agencies, often has to rely on secondary sources because the Serb
irregulars - and in some cases the Croatian authorities - have prevented
agencies from travelling unhindered throughout Bosnia.
Contrary to official statements that the Milosevic regime has distanced
itself from the war in Bosnia, the ISHR cites many examples in which it says
Serbia still supplies weapons to the irregulars in Bosnia.
For example, on June 16, it reported that trucks loaded with ammunition for
army and militia units had arrived from Serbia and Montenegro to Visegrad.
'Before returning, they were filled with goods looted from the houses of
Croats and Moslems.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / Argentina begins foreign debt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Argentine government has begun exploratory talks in an attempt to seek a
'definitive' solution over its debts to foreign creditor governments, a
senior Economy Ministry official said yesterday.
Mr Horacio Liendo, undersecretary for finance, said talks were starting with
officials of creditor governments on a variety of Argentine proposals
regarding its official debt. Argentina was not seeking debt forgiveness, but
he said a rescheduling of the entire debt to the Paris Club of creditor
governments would be a 'good idea'. The Paris Club usually reschedules debts
falling due over a fairly narrow period.
Official bilateral debt accounts for about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.6bn) of an
overall debt burden officials put at Dollars 75bn.
The government last week finalised details of a debt reduction accord with
leading commercial banks, and Argentine officials met banks in London
yesterday to explain the plan to restructure Dollars 23bn of medium-term
debt and Dollars 8bn of interest arrears. It is seeking to close the deal by
the end of this year.
The government hopes the bank deal will fix the bank debt servicing bill at
Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.4bn a year, out of an annual debt servicing bill
of just over Dollars 3bn. It calculates that Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 3.8bn
of funds will be needed to guarantee the concessionary bonds issued under
the accord.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Indian bank chief replaced: Bombay stock market scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered Bank of the UK yesterday replaced Mr Parvesh Nat, chief
executive of its Indian operation, as the first step in what are expected to
be wider management changes at the offshoot following the bank's involvement
in the Bombay stock market and securities scandal.
Mr Nat, who stepped down last week after the bank's Bombay office had been
defrauded of Rs8.9bn (Pounds 164m), will be succeeded by Mr John Docherty,
now chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank Kenya.
At a press conference yesterday to announce the change Mr David Gardiner,
the bank's acting chief executive for India, exonerated Mr Nat, whose wife,
Mrs GK Nat, was charged last week in a special investigative court.
The charge related to her acceptance of a cheque for Rs1m from Mr Hiten
Dalal, Standard Chartered's securities broker, who is one of those arrested
in the scandal. The bank has accepted Mr Nat's explanation that the cheque
'was in settlement of a genuine sale of securities', and regards the
allegations as 'without foundation'. Mr Nat will continue in the employment
of the bank although he will remain on leave.
The bank hopes to complete its internal inquiry into the involvement of some
of its employees next week, when more heads are expected to roll in
connection with the country's largest financial scandal.
Indian government agencies are examining a connection between Mr R. Kannan,
director of the investment banking division, and Fair Growth Financial
Services, which became a part of the scandal when the Reserve Bank, India's
central bank, prohibited three companies of the Fair Growth group from
transacting any fresh business 'in view of certain serious irregularities'
observed in the company's operations.
Mr Kannan - previously with the state-owned Canara Bank, one of the
institutions financially exposed in the scandal - joined Standard Chartered
in early 1990, and was responsible for recruiting a number of officers from
Canara, where he had worked under Mr B. Ratnakar as chairman.
Mr Ratnakar founded the Fair Growth group of companies before he died last
year.
Meanwhile, Mr VP Singh, former Indian prime minister and leader of the
opposition National Front, signalled on a visit to Bombay that the
opposition would ensure the financial scandal figures prominently when
parliament reopens on July 8. Mr Singh accused the government of not doing
enough to expose those involved, and demanded a joint parliamentary
committee be set up to investigate the scandal. Only then, he said, would
the inquiry be free of political interference.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Britain to review role in EFA: Treasury fears German
withdrawal will lift cost of European joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CABINET battle over the European Fighter Aircraft was foreshadowed
yesterday as the government confirmed it was reviewing the Pounds 20bn
project's future following Germany's refusal to give the go-ahead for the
aircraft's production.
Treasury ministers are putting strong pressure on the Ministry of Defence to
reappraise its needs in the light of the extra cost involved if Germany
pulls out.
Downing Street is saying any cabinet decision has to await clarification of
Germany's intentions but the row is already reviving painful echoes of the
1986 cabinet crisis over the Westland helicopter company.
Then the conflict was also over a European versus US project, over Britain's
strategic defence requirements, and over support for British industry. About
40,000 jobs would be at risk if EFA collapsed.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is fighting hard to save the project
and would be backed by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Mr Rifkind will meet Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, on Monday
and reinforce attempts by Mr John Major to persuade Germany to reconsider.
Meetings with the Spanish and Italian governments, also partners in the
project, will follow. Britain argues that Germany's plans for a cheaper
fighter are not feasible.
But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, wants the tightest grip possible on
public spending and would insist on a full review of the EFA project. Other
cabinet ministers who fear spending squeezes may be anxious for the defence
budget to be cut instead.
Mr Heseltine denied a cabinet split. He said: 'The cabinet will come to a
decision on these matters in the light of the advice that we get. We haven't
yet had the advice so it is not possible for us to be divided about it.'
The MoD, which is working on revised cost estimates, concedes that with
three partners instead of four, costs will escalate - mostly because of the
withdrawal of German capital investment in production. But it says the
project should remain within the original budget, helped by savings from
fewer production lines.
Delays in developing EFA have already forced the MoD to postpone a decision
on who should supply a new medium range surface-to-air missile (MSAM) system
worth at least Pounds 500m.
The MoD said the postponement was the result of administrative problems with
EFA and difficulties with the aircraft's flight control systems. It
underlines how much EFA has become part of UK defence strategy: its delay or
cancellation would have a knock-on effect on other defence contracts.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Forte fails to sell catering division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels and restaurants group, last night called off the proposed
sale of its Gardner Merchant contract catering subsidiary after the
potential buyers, Compass Group of the UK and ARA Services of the US,
refused to pay the asking price of more than Pounds 550m.
The proposed deal, which was first announced at the end of May, would have
made Compass the biggest supplier of staff canteen meals in the UK. Compass
was to have paid Pounds 450m for the Forte business, with the remainder
coming from ARA.
The companies reduced their offer, however, after questions arose as to
whether Gardner Merchant clients might use the change of ownership to
renegotiate their contracts.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chief executive, said the approach and the original
price had come from the potential buyers. He said: 'It's rather irritating.
People come along with a certain price and then drop that price.' He said he
still wanted to sell Gardner Merchant and concentrate on the expansion of
the group's hotel and restaurant businesses. But he said: 'It's a premium
business and deserves a premium price'. There had been interest from other
potential purchasers in the UK and elsewhere, he said.
A sale to one of these would have the advantage of not splitting the
business. The split between Compass and ARA had been designed to avoid UK
monopoly problems.
Mr Forte said the proposed breaking up of the business had caused some
unhappiness among Gardner Merchant staff and management. Forte has suspended
Mr Bob Cotton, Gardner Merchant's research director, for writing to a trade
publication criticising the proposed sale.
It is understood that in the course of negotiations Compass and ARA reduced
their offer to Pounds 520m. Although UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Forte's advisers,
said that the hotels group could accept such a price without embarrassment,
there were too many conditions attached to the offer.
These are understood to have included a further renegotiation if Gardner
Merchant contracts were lost. The two companies are then thought to have
increased their offer to Pounds 530m but this too was rejected by Forte.
Compass and ARA expressed disappointment and said the price they had offered
had been fair.

FT  04 JUL 92 / New-look DTI will 'relate to industry'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, yesterday set in
motion plans intended to improve co-operation between government and
industry and to provide him with a high-profile role in helping promote
trade.
The proposals, which Mr Heseltine said would enable the Department of Trade
and Industry to relate more closely to industry, entail no additional
government funding and no increase in staffing.
They met with a qualified welcome from industrialists, who described them as
an encouraging first step, but condemnation from Labour, which said they
were wholly inadequate.
Mr Heseltine's reshaping of the DTI includes the creation of an industrial
competitiveness division which will study the performance of competitor
countries. It will also aim to ensure that government policy-makers consider
the impact of decisions on competitiveness.
But Mr Heseltine said he was not interested in fulfilling a 'shopping list'
of demands - such as lower electricity prices or improved export credit
terms - which industry claims it needs to improve competitiveness.
'Sometimes I will be able to help, sometimes I will not.'
Other proposals include the formation of 15 sectoral divisions to establish
what Mr Heseltine called 'an informed dialogue and constructive partnership'
with their respective industries.
Among the industries warranting special attention are chemicals and
biotechnology, steel, textiles and retailing, electronics, mechanical
engineering, vehicles, aerospace and telecommunications. Others will cover
energy, research and development and information technology.
The DTI will also open the first of what could become a nationwide series of
'one-stop' shops to advise businesses.
Mr Heseltine is understood to be especially keen to see his department help
in assembling trade deals, involving British companies and banks, with
former eastern bloc countries.
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said of the proposals: 'So far so good. Getting the structure right is
important. But industry is more interested in strategy and that must now be
Mr Heseltine's priority.'
Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, said the
IoD wanted to see how the DTI's sectoral units interpreted their sponsorship
role. If they became channels for special pleading and special treatment,
industry would be 'on the slippery slope' to an industrial policy which has
previously failed.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the plans were
'little more than a reshuffling of desks'.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The big scoop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I BEHAVED out of character last weekend. I went to the shops and bought
myself a present, an Italian ice cream machine that, even as we speak, is
churning out pail after pail of ice cream and sorbet (sherbet, to Americans)
 -flaming fudge sundae, chestnut parfait, old-fashioned strawberry,
tutti-frutti. It cost Pounds 250, which is why its purchase was out of
character for a simple soul like me.
To judge from readers' letters, there is a widely-held view that life, for
me, is just a bowl of cherries. That nice things happen to me every day of
the week. Exotic travel. Breakfast with Virginia Bottomley. Visits to racing
stables. Tea with dowagers. Afternoon roulette. Outings to the theatre. The
ear of Jacques Delors. Invitations to join the Committee to Elect Ross
Perot.
But the fruits of the loom are not easily gained. If nice things happen to
me, you can bet there is a reason for it. Nor is my sangfroid exactly what
it seems. I am like a waterfowl: galleonesque above the surface, but
paddling furiously underneath.
For most of the time I live quite quietly. I do not have a choice, for my
life is circumscribed by the terrible scrutiny of my executive assistant,
Miss Lee, a Jaeger-clad nd an elephant's memory who monitors my movements
like a Cold War satellite. I am Miss Lee's thrall and bondman; she treats me
like an insect. (There is a good American expression to cover this sort of
thing, but as it is rudely tinted I had better not employ it).
I have very few possessions: a flat, a car and a television; two pairs of
shoes and two-and-a-half-suits; some books and tennis balls; a porcelain
Dalmatian (I used to have a real one, liver-spotted, who lived to 13 1/2 -
my brain misses him enormously, refuses to accept his absence, still sees
him on the street, or running across the common); a painting by John Bellany
and a camellia in a tub.
To which I have now added an ice cream machine. Its purchase was an act of
rebellion. Last Saturday, Miss Lee relaxed her satellite watch over my
affairs for about 47 minutes, which enabled me to bus to Selfridges and,
down in the basement, to purchase a Gaggia Gelatiera, a splendid machine,
product of the space age, which, starting from scratch, can make perfect ice
cream or sorbet in about 30 minutes.
What a week I have had. Bitter chocolate ice cream. Coconut ice cream.
Zabaglione. Hazelnut and toasted almond ice cream. Prune sorbet. Papaya and
mango sorbet. I have even learned how to translate American measurements
into Imperial ones (my ice cream book is American), though it requires
deftness and concentration. In a further act of defiance, I have bought ice
cream glasses and spoons, and a beautiful silver scoop. As the ozone layer
vanishes and the Earth heats up, I shall retreat deeper and deeper into my
kitchen, into a world of peppermint snowballs and chocolate mousse topping.
The only sticky moment came when I offered Miss Lee a scoop of banana ice
cream. She does not approve of my machine, mainly because it was bought
without her authority. She prodded the offering suspiciously. 'Michael, are
you sure these were fresh bananas? Your banana purchasing is invariably
erratic.'
All this ice cream has had a soothing effect. I have not read the papers
this week. They have been full of the usual squawking. Instead, I have
turned (once again) to the New Yorker essays of E B White. In 1935, White
penned a perfect little essay called 'Technological Progress.' He was
lamenting the loss of a lighthouse-keeper's job because of the invention of
a gas buoy capable of winking a mechanical warning to shipping, thus putting
the keeper and his family profoundly out of business.
'The empty lighthouse,' wrote White, 'seemed a symbol of all that is going
on in the world: new devices putting men and their families out of work . .
. Science, blessing us with gas buoys, is a hard master and perhaps an evil
one, giving us steel for flesh, dole for wages, solving every problem except
the essential one: what to do about the pride of a former lighthouse-keeper,
who doesn't want relief, who wants bread earned by toil, seeing his light
shine afar.'
When Tina Brown telephones me tomorrow to ask how best to edit The New
Yorker, I shall tell her to read a lot of E B White and consume great
quantities of banana ice cream.

FT  04 JUL 92 / A sporting innocent on his way to the Olympic Games:
Nicholas Woodsworth has been in training for Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM not a sports person.
I have not entered a locker room in good faith since 16-year-old, 6 ft 2 in
Mick Shepherd, school tough-guy and offensive lineman, used to threaten me
during pre-game kit-ups. 'I'm going to beat the bejeesus out of you on the
field,' he would say. And he did, regularly. Wham. Crunch. Canadian high
school football left me looking at competitive athletic activity in a less
than kindly light.
Even today the back pages of the newspapers are foreign territory to me.
Recently the strangest place I have been is a vast bar called Champions on
the Riverwalk in San Antonio, Texas, where simultaneously, and to packed
crowds of roaring fans, 16 TV screens show 16 different cable sports
channels. Such places do not offer an entirely rational view of the world,
and leave me anxious for its future.
This may not be the best background from which to gaze out on to the wide
world of sport. None the less, after half-a-lifetime's sports avoidence I
find myself about to enter the greatest sporting competition on earth.
There will be many large teams travelling to Barcelona later this month for
the 1992 Olympics - the Games get more spectacular, the stakes higher, the
competitors more numerous each time they come around. But no competition is
going to be larger or more rigorous than that between the 15,000 journalists
 -more than one for every genuine athlete - who will cram themselves into
each stadium, arena and bar in the city to dish up a two-week media
extravaganza. Apart from the strength and stayinging power necessary, this
leaves me concerned with my pre-game training.
How does one get in shape for such a monstrous contest - more than 160
national teams, 25 different sports, 41 sporting venues, 257 medal events,
400,000 excited observers, hundreds of dramas and stories daily? Jaded old
sports hacks may sit back, chew cigars, and sprint across PC keyboards. But
what about this reporter, a sports dolt who recently had his eight-year-old
son correct him on the rules of checkers? If there were some journalistic
version of steroids, a treatment that would pump me up into a George
Plimpton overnight, I just might be tempted.
But no pain, no gain. In recent weeks I have been building myself up, making
forays, some brief and tentative, others longer and more demanding, into
what until now for me has been the uncharted and baffling world of sport.
I began with reading, piles of it from the local library. For want of any
logical starting point, I began with the book at the top of the stack, a
treatise on archery. The bow, I was told, ranks with fire and the wheel as
vital developments on the road to what humans are today. We make sport of
curious things.
In A Cultural History of Sport I learned that the original Olympian athletes
competed oiled and naked. In Lords of the Rings, I found out that not
everyone admires the International Olympic Committee - its authors have dug
up every piece of dirt imaginable on the perverting of Olympic ideals, and
now face angry IOC libel charges. In the Underground Steroid Handbook (not
available from the local library) I learned how to cook up a batch of
performance-enhancing GHB using nothing more than industrial solvent and
caustic soda.
Feeling somewhat strengthened, I began to make training sorties across the
English countryside to interview athletes. Why is it that most British
Olympic athletes seem to live in northern cities? I met individuals -
Olympians, trainers, and sports academics - who seemed as novel to me as
creatures from another galaxy.
In Sheffield, I met race-walker Les Morton and for the first time saw in a
participant's eyes the power of the Olympic magnet. 'Ooh aye,' he said
slowly of race-walking in Seoul four years ago. 'It were like a dream.'
I watched wrestlers grapple on sweaty mats in Manchester and gymnasts tape
and talcum their hands in Newport. I met a marathon runner in Bridgend who
lives from the proceeds of two races a year. I saw a 51-kilo Chinese
weightlifter snatch-lift 120 kilos over his head in Cardiff and break a
world record. In Amersham a doctor for elite sportsmen explained to me why
black athletes' bodies make them so formidable. In London's Drug Control
Centre I learnt of a new generation of sports-drugs that have no legally
acceptable test. In Birmingham I discussed women's pelvises with a
physiologist.
There are not many things, in fact, that sport is not about. The wham and
the crunch of it, the will to dominate, certainly make sport what it is. But
so do politics, ethics, technology, big business, social history, drugs,
entertainment, medicine, sex, philosophy, and journalism - just about
everything else we grapple with every day. What makes sport so odd and
intriguing is that in the stadium we deliberately arrange all these elements
in competitive order for our entertainment.
Competition - winning or losing in front of the world - is what the Olympics
are all about. Even non-football, non-checkers-playing journalists get fired
up by it. Like Japanese archers, British sprinters, Kenyan runners and the
vast global hack-pack heading to Barcelona, I have got butterflies.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Private View: The past is a dangerous place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISSIDENT is a damaged human being, says Jan Urban. That is why the former
Civic Forum leader did not stay around to pick up a plum job in the new
regime but resigned on the day Czechoslovakia reverted to democracy.
Dissidence was a kind of profession. 'It was extremely demanding and
one-dimensional,' he said. 'You couldn't trust anybody. You had to live on
strict rules and instincts. And I felt this was very unhealthy and I wanted
to become normal again.'
Countries, like individuals, need to convalesce after the trauma of
revolution or war. Strange things happen: the streets are suddenly full of
resistance fighters whom nobody remembers seeing before; the real dissidents
find themselves accused of collaboration.
It had been the same in 1945. Urban talked to his Polish friends. 'They
laughed at me and said we had the same experience too. When I started to dig
deeper I found out that all nations face this problem.'
So Urban has been spending part of his convalescence at Emmanuel College,
Cambridge, researching a book on how countries come to terms - or not - with
their past.
I asked him why dissidents were unpopular, even after a evolution.
'Because we were different, because we were trouble-makers, because - as I
found out - to be once a dissident you're dissident for the rest of your
life.
'It's an addiction. You become irresponsible, you become so used to being
independent that you give loyalty only when you want, on your terms. And I
think this is well illustrated by failures of the dissident politicians in
eastern Europe these days.'
So former dissidents are not fit for government?
'Most of them take politics as a substitute for the old fight; their vision
of the world is as a fight. I don't think they are suitable for normal
politics. Let's put it this way: they are extremely good, or some are, in
destroying things. But as a bricklayer I know well it's not the best
qualification for building.'
Jan Urban is a graduate of Prague University who qualified as a bricklayer
at the age of 35 (he is now 41). He had been sacked from his teaching job
nine years before for refusing to condemn the Charter 77 dissidents. He
became a race-trace attendant, forklift truck driver, crane driver and
building labourer and then wrote for the clandestine newspaper Lidove
Noviny.
He does not exempt his dissident colleague Vaclav Havel, now seeking
re-election as president of a dissolving country, from the charge of
post-revolutionary failure; but he recognises Havel's 'immense moral
authority'. Anyone who spends time in jail, he said, probably needs the same
length of time in which to recuperate. Havel, who served five years, could
not face a camera for six months after becoming president. The prisoners'
rule is never meet your interrogator's eye.
Urban's recuperation means mending things with his wife Elena and daughters
Theresa and Kamila.
Is your wife part of your rehabilitation?
'Oh, definitely, the most important part.' He laughed. 'Because, just to
give you an example, she never knew where I was going because it was safer
for both of us. I had to make clear to the other side (the state security
police) that I could not be blackmailed through my family and that was
tough. We had to learn to live together again as a family and not as a kind
of supporting base for a one-man show.'
The dissident becomes cut off from his fellow citizens and the outside
world. 'The first thing we have to do is just sit down and study, study to
bridge this gap. And not to imagine, which I feel is a legacy of the
Communist thinking, that politics can change everything by backstage
manipulation and putting good people in right places. We have to work on
society as a whole.'
What makes a man an active dissident? Jan Urban was much influenced by the
career of his father, Zdenek, a Communist who resisted the Nazis and rose to
be a member of the party's Central Committee. A reformist, he was purged in
1968 after the Soviet tanks invaded, and was finally reduced to menial jobs.
He died of a heart attack four years ago after a series of interrogations by
the secret police.
'He always told me: 'In 1945 I exchanged my own conscience for the belief
that some party knows better. And this is a moral fault. You have a good
chance not to fall into the trap. And if you are ready to pay the price,
just go on.''
Now the son is following his own peacetime prescription, to study. His book
deals with Germany, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, Britain and
Czechoslovakia after World War II, with Portugal, Spain and Greece in the
1970s, with Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Brazil in the 1980s, and with
eastern Europe since 1989.
What he has found is that in nearly every case the past becomes a weapon in
the hands of the new regime. History is distorted to legitimise the new
leaders and to discredit their political opponents. The reality of life
under dictatorship is obscured; so too are the reasons why the mass of the
people are so ready - indeed willing - to co-operate. It can take decades
for a country to face the truth about itself.
Urban thinks such behaviour is only human.
'I didn't have too many ideals about this: I didn't understand how easily
most of my compatriots were subdued.
'But I understood that to be openly against an immoral regime in a situation
which doesn't give hope for change is absurd, is ridiculous, for men or
women who think about the good of their family, of their career, of those
normal things.
'And I don't have a problem recognising human fear. I went through lots of
it and I just was given the opportunity to learn to live with it - to manage
and not to collapse.
'What I dislike are people who were afraid to do anything but now pretend
that they were brave and ask for revenge. I don't mind people who recognise
yes, they were afraid. I don't even ask them to feel ashamed. What I ask is
that they don't tell lies.'
Unlike, say, Lech Walesa in Poland, Jan Urban has never been accused of
collaboration with the Communists. But it would not be difficult to dig
something out of his file.
In the summer of 1989 he told his chief interrogator, privately, that he had
been tipped off about an underground supply-line of small arms from France.
Having first alerted the French and British embassies, he reported it not
only because he suspected he was being framed, but also because the
dissidents had pledged to have nothing to do with arms or drugs. 'In this
very criminal field I would co-operate with any police in the world.'
The meeting took place in the street. 'I told him the information. I said 'I
won't sign any protocol, I won't mention it again. I don't know whether it
is your provocation or not. In a sense I don't care'. And I went home.
'When I was given the chance to meet them in the pub instead of being taken
away from my working place, of course I would go to pub.'
So it was a life which had its own rules, like a game?
'Oh, definitely.'
And did the other side enjoy it as a game?
'Oh, very much.'
After the revolution, the records of all this activity lie about like
unexploded mines. I asked Urban how they were to be detonated, how the past
was to be disinfected.
His answer is for an independent commission to be set up by the incoming
regime, composed of reputable lawyers, historians, journalists, people from
international human rights agencies and former apparatchiks and policemen
too.
Why do you include them?
'Because they were the people who wrote these documents, who know the
techniques, the meaning it had at the time. They are in a sense the only
people who can tell the meaning. Those files have to be understood as
ordinary historical documents.'
The commission should be given a fixed time to report. Then the files should
be sealed for 30 years. The report should name those guilty of torture and
murder and describe how the regime suppressed dissent. The worst criminals
should be prosecuted. For the others, publicity was often punishment enough.
'When you talk to someone, as I did, who is nearly 80 and who has been
tortured in 1949 or 1951, of course he needs to finish that story. When you
ask what would you like done with that man who tortured you, he replies
'Well, he must be 80 too. What can you do to a senile old man. But I want to
see his name public.''
Czechoslovakia's 'lustration' law, enacted last November, bans Communist
sympathisers from public office for five years. The law was arbitrary - and
a disaster, Urban said.
'I think that we repeated all the mistakes ever done before us and we added
some of our own. Our performance in dealing with the past is very, very
bad.'
Slovak nationalists had seen the law as a way of tarring some of their
leaders. An attempt just before last month's elections to incriminate
without real proof Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's prime minister, had
backfired.
'So I think,' said Jan Urban, 'that poor handling of our past has helped to
split up the country.'
For the country and for the dissident it is the same: if the future is to
work, the past must be given a decent burial.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Blood on their cheque books: Dominic Lawson asks why images
of brutality are not considered pornographic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST weekend I had someone killed for me. I didn't commission the killing
but I have the uneasy feeling that a murder was carried out for my benefit.
If you read the Sunday Times magazine then you, too, have had someone
butchered for your benefit. The cover of last week's issue showed a young
Burmese in the first throes of death. His mouth is opened wide with terror
as another Burmese plunges a knife into his chest. It is said to be the
killing of a government collaborator by a member of the Karen National
Liberation Army.
But this is not an incident of sudden violence snapped hastily by a
photographer hiding out of sight. The man being butchered has had his arms
tied to a tree. Somehow he has wrenched them round in a desperate effort to
staunch the gush of blood as the blade slices through his chest cavity. The
position of the killer is interesting. He is standing to the side of the
victim as he thrusts and twists the knife. This means he cannot plunge the
weapon in straight but it also means that he can give the photographer, one
Bruce Haley, an unimpeded view of the execution.
Inside the magazine, 'the executioner' - that is the only name given to him
by the author of the blurb accompanying the pictures - is seen posing for
the photographer, after carrying out his bespoke killing. Other pictures
show the executioner punching his hog-tied victim in the face. The final
picture in the series sees the executioner wiping his bloody blade over the
all-but-eviscerated body of his victim.
In its way, this is the most revealing photograph of all. The man with the
camera must have been standing almost over the murderer as he finished off
the job, judging from the angle and focus of the snap.
I don't know whether the Sunday Times commissioned Bruce Haley to perform
his part in this choreographed execution. The pictures are also attributed
to an agency called 'Colorific]' which perhaps had sold these gory and
undeniably 'colourific' prints to the highest bidder. Whatever the chain of
events, a lot of people other than 'the executioner' have blood on their
cheque books.
It is a degrading process for all of them. And for all of us, the readers.
For most men, I suspect, such pictures evoke disgust, first at the people
responsible for showing them to us, but then, more awkwardly, at ourselves,
because we are strangely compelled by the sight of acts of extreme violence
and brutality.
Thus, the first question those of us who have never served in the forces
tend to ask those who have tends to be: 'Did you ever kill someone?' And if
the answer is 'yes,' we then go on to demand all the gruesome details. That
is why, I suppose, men like war films so much, although the Sunday Times
pictures are to war films what snuff movies are to soft pornography.
If the Sunday Times had published pornographic pictures as shocking as those
it printed of the staged execution and evisceration of a Burmese teenager,
then it would have been prosecuted for actions 'likely to deprave and
corrupt.' It is trite but true that in Britain the pornography of sex is
deemed unfit for public display, whereas violence has become mandatory
prime-time viewing.
The BBC has started a new series called '999' which, under the pretext of
showing how the emergency services go about their work, offers us the gore
to guarantee high ratings. In the first programme, I am told, there were
featured a woman being filletted by a speed boat and a parachute instructor
being strangled by his cord.
There is, however, a difference between what the BBC is broadcasting and
what the Sunday Times published. The BBC is showing accidents. The Sunday
Times is in the business of deliberate acts of horror.
As a newspaper it has taken the line, in the argument over Andrew Morton's
book on royal marital difficulties, that by not preventing her friends from
talking to the writer, the Princess of Wales has tacitly authorised their
acts. In doing nothing to prevent the murder of a young man, is the Sunday
Times's photographer tacitly authorising that act? Dominic Lawson is editor
of the Spectator.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Pitchford gift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITCHFORD Hall in Shropshire, arguably the most important half-timbered
house in England, has been offered as a gift to the nation. Mr and Mrs
Oliver Colthurst, whose family have owned the house since the 15th century,
will give the Grade I house and 70 acres of park and garden, currently on
the market at Pounds 1.25m, to a heritage body if its important contents can
be kept intact.
The offer was announced yesterday after a stalemate in negotiations to
secure the future of the estate, a victim partly of Lloyd's losses. The
National Trust has had a team of 26 experts looking at Pitchford in the last
few months and is keen to take responsibility if the Government provides
special funds with which to endow the house and purchase its collections.
If no decision is reached by August 1, Christie's will sell the contents,
valued at Pounds 2m, in September.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: The best of Broadway - The New York theatre season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a much better season for musicals than plays on Broadway, but
there were a few bright spots among this season's openings. The best play on
Broadway, according to the Tony Awards and also popular wisdom, is Brian
Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa. The original actors from the Abbey Theatre of
Dublin departed in March, replaced by a mostly American cast, which, word
has it, is doing an excellent job.
Though flawed, August Wilson's Two Trains Running is certainly the best new
American offering on Broadway this year, benefiting from excellent
performances including that of a rising young star Larry Fishburne (Boys in
the 'Hood), who won the production's only Tony, for best featured actor. Two
Trains Running is the latest in Wilson's ongoing series of plays each
devoted to a decade of the African-American experience.
The play records a week in the life of the denizens of a Pittsburgh cafe in
1969. It is not an overtly political play, but Wilson addresses the era's
politics obliquely in the characters' varying methods of coping - or not -
with life in the white man's world. The cafe's owner, Memphis Lee, is
determined to get his fair share from the city's plan to raze the area for
an urban renewal project. His waitress, Risa, (Cynthia Martells) smolders
with angry ideas that she can only communicate through her gait as she
shuffles languorously around the cafe; she ain't speeding up for nobody.
Sterling, (Fishburne), an ex-con, is trying to put his past behind him but
can't find work. Hambone, a disturbed drifter, wants justice in the simplest
way; forever focused on a ham a white man denied him as payment for a job,
he can only say 'I'm gonna get me my ham]' until Sterling teaches him 'Black
is beautiful'.
The interest in Two Trains Running lies in in the elegance of Wilson's
language, his skill in creating memorable characters who reveal themselves
through lengthy monologue and symbolic gesture, and in the excellence of its
artistic team. Wilson and Richards' fruitful collaboration has included the
writer's last five plays; in Two Trains Running the connection between play
and production is seamless. The performers are wonderful. Fishburne and
Martells' chemistry is palpable, and not enough has been said about Al
White's energetic performance as Memphis.
Two Trains Running is short on plot and long on talking, and at three hours
just plain long, but entering Wilson's world was aided by the predominantly
black audience's enthusiastic, vocal response, which created a rare feeling
of community.
The title of Herb Gardner's Conversations with my Father is a misnomer; it
is not about conversations with but rantings by Eddie, a Russian immigrant
who changes the name of his bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side every time
America's cultural wind shifts, all the time denying his family's Jewish
heritage. Gardner is clearly trying to exorcise his father's demons with
this autobiographical play, but Eddie/Papa Gardner ends up dominating
Conversations with my Father in a way that the author seems unable to
control - the world of the play is hopelessly skewed by the father's
perspective.
Conversations starts out in a familiar memory-play structure, with Gardner's
onstage surrogate Charlie (Tony Shalhoub) giving a charming Yiddish-language
lesson directly to the audience, but as soon as Eddie takes stage, Charlie
retreats to the sidelines, watching helplessly as his father bullies his
infant and adolescent selves and everyone else around him. Gardner also
allows Eddie to relegate his wife Gusta to the kitchen, frustrating the
audience who wants to better understand her relationship to the events of
the play, and to enjoy more of Gordana Rashovich's wonderfully quirky
performance. Hirsch, in his too-familiar curmudgeon mode, won the Best Actor
Tony Award for his performance.
Some people go to 12-step recovery programmes to deal with their
dysfunction. Neil Simon writes plays that end up on Broadway. His latest
offering, Jake's Women, is theatre of and for the age of therapy, a
comedy-drama of mostly imagined interactions between a successful novelist
and his deceased first wife, his dissatisfied second wife, his daughter, his
shrink, his sister, and his girlfriend.
This is tinker-toy Pirandello; Simon seems to be just now discovering
theatre's capacity to question and reshape reality and memory that other
playwrights have been investigating, much more effectively, for years.
Simon's best plays, the Brighton Beach Memoirs trilogy and Lost in Yonkers,
are full of the rich humour of real people in ridiculously human situations,
but the characters in Jake's Women are too cliched and the situations too
predictable to be funny, and his gag lines are a poor substitute - they fall
flat. Alda, like Hirsch, plays himself, and audiences are flocking to spend
a few hours with that lovable sweater-clad persona.
Audiences will have to hurry to see the season's biggest star vehicles.
Death and the Maiden's producers are not sure yet if they will keep Mike
Nichols' production running after Glenn Close, Richard Dreyfuss and Gene
Hackman leave in August. Let's hope it closes soon.
More worthy of its hype is Gregory Mosher's revival of Tennessee Williams' A
Streetcar Named Desire, with screen actors Jessica Lange (Frances, Tootsie,
Country) as Blanche Dubois and Alec Baldwin (The Marrying Man, The Hunt for
Red October) as Stanley Kowalski, which is closing in August. It is not a
great production, but serves the play well enough to let Williams' superb
craftsmanship come through. What the production lacks is atmosphere - a good
Streetcar should make you sweat, but nothing, save Alec Baldwin's gutsy
performance, so much as raises the pulse.
Baldwin doesn't banish Brando's memory (and who could?), but his portrayal
is fresh and energetic, bringing a crude nobility to the role. In contrast,
Lange makes her Broadway debut as if she were still playing for the camera;
what she's doing is not all that bad, but is too quiet and too finely
painted. Amy Madigan (Field of Dreams) as Stella is strangely mannered and
her relationship with Stanley too lacking in passion, and Timothy Carhart
(Thelma and Louise's would-be rapist) is far too dashing to play the lumpen
Mitch.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Dazzled by the Magician - The opening work in the new
Almeida Opera season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE several reasons for cheering the arrival of Almeida Opera, the
first collaboration between English National Opera's Contemporary Opera
Studio and the Almeida Theatre Company. What this amounts to is a summer
opera-festival offering two new operas, a double bill containing a third new
opera, and a thematically linked scheme of chamber concerts; and what it
promises is the revival of at least a portion of the contemporary
music-theatre excitements regularly tasted in the small Islington theatre
when the much-missed Almeida Festival was in full spate.
It was launched on Thursday, with the strongest possible form of advocacy
for the venture - a dazzling piece of modern music-drama, dazzlingly
executed. Stephen Oliver's Mario and the Magician was first shown at the
1988 Musica Nel Chiostro Festival at Batignano; it receives here its British
first performances.
Oliver, who died two months ago at the age of 42, was a complete
theatre-man. This adaptation of the 1929 Thomas Mann novella, for which  -
as was the usual Oliver practice - he wrote both words and music, supplies
still another cause to lament his horribly early death. Yet this small,
sharp, vital opera comes at exactly the right moment to provide a perfect
example of his rare gifts, and so celebration is also in order.
Several previous operatic approaches have already been made to Mario und der
Zauberer; last month Andrew Porter reviewed on this page the Toronto
premiere of the most recent - Harry Somers's three-hour version for large
cast and orchestra. Oliver's 75-minute one-acter is expertly planned and
paced, effective in all the good senses of the word; in it he has preserved
Mann's short-story scale, the picaresque atmosphere of the Italian seaside
resort, the hints of growing Mussolini-era intolerance beneath the surface.
He does this as only a real opera-creator can: by means of compression and
juxtaposition of incident, alteration of a few of Mann's narrative details
and excision of many, and above all a gift for making his music expand the
subject matter.
The opera is basically a chamber scherzo with sinister edges and allegorical
undercurrents, shaped in unequal halves separated by a short instrumental
interlude. In brief, accurate scene-setting detail the first 'half' touches
in the holiday sojourn of the German narrator and family (here changed to a
widow and daughter); the second unfolds the conjuring show of the Cavaliere
Cipolla and its violently dramatic conclusion.
Skilfully inflected 'tones of voice' rich in many-layered irony are achieved
in the musical styles that carry the scheme forward: principally a
concentrated, uneasily late-Romantic lyricism (big melodic phrases
underpinned with piano accompaniment directly influenced by Britten's Death
in Venice), a perky burlesque-Stravinsky evoking the magic-show conventions,
and a vein of half-serious chromatic spookery limning Cipolla's hypnotic
tricks.
When Mario and the Magician was first shown at Batignano, the reviewer in
Opera deemed it a 'smart little shocker' and praised Oliver's Puccini-like
confidence in building toward a coup de theatre. The praise deserves
repetition but also amplification: for the experience is more substantial
than the word 'shocker' may suggest, depending for its fullness on a
light-fingered treatment of subject and symbol (Cipolla's unnatural power
compared to Mussolini's), an acute balance of comedy and melodrama.
The opera delights, grips, disturbs; it never hectors or stuns its audience
into submission. Oliver's exactness of aim and achievement has been exactly
mirrored in the playing of Almeida Ensemble under Nicholas Kok, and in Tim
Hopkins's production. A tilted circular ramp (designer: Nigel Lowery) serves
excellently as springboard for the scenic transformations, and for the
intensely physical activities of the 14-strong cast. The economy of the
staging carries its own potent magic, which (of course) is also Oliver's;
the intimacy of the Almeida offers an ideal setting.
Cipolla (baritone) affords Richard Jackson endless opportunities for slimy
smiles and sidling motions, pregnant moments of stillness, myriad vocal and
verbal half-lights. He seizes every one with the unarguable authority of a
virtuoso (and a neat conjuror to boot). The other significant roles in what
is essentially, and outstandingly, a tight-knit ensemble show go to Paul
Nilon, Lynne Davies, Annemarie Sand, Garry Magee and the actor Jonathan
Burrell (in the non-speaking part of the waiter Mario, Cipolla's final
victim).
I predict long queues at the box office for the remaining four performances:
this Mario and the Magician scores a palpable hit.
(Almeida Opera until July 19; principal sponsors the Peter Moores
Foundation)

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: A Caribbean Odyssey - Derek Walcott's new play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MONSTERS, we make them ourselves.' So ends The Odyssey at The Other Place,
Stratford: selected stories from Homer over three hours with a cast of 16, a
band and special effects. The text is by the Caribbean poet Derek Walcott,
and direction by Gregory Doran. The result is a play, busy like the
mackerel-crowded seas around Ithaca: attractive and lively fare.
Walcott's Caribbean tribute to Homer, Omeros, was the best long poem of
1990. His text for The Odyssey draws on the visceral language of Omeros.
This, with inventive, energetic and lyrical direction attempts the
impossible task of putting Homer on stage. Epic poetry is not theatre, but
dignified verse and serious actions in narrative form.
The text is not inherently dramatic, for it deals with events that have
already happened. In Homer, Odysseus hears of his own exploits from a poet,
and weeps: 'You sing so finely of the fate of the Greeks, all that they did
and endured and toiled, as if you had been there yourself or heard it from
someone who was.' Epic asks 'what happened then?' Tragedy asks, 'what is
happening now?"
The sandy set fronts a clear plastic screen. The costumes mix Greek and
Caribbean, making the journey home to Ithaca more exotic. There is a
wonderful storm scene before Scheria, a sexy sojourn with Circe, and a
run-in with the Cyclops. The Underworld is a subway station, the Flatbush
Avenue Express roaring past.
True to form, Odysseus (Ron Cook) is wily and Penelope (Amanda Harris)
faithful; their qualities are challenged by an assortment of rejuvenated
Homeric figures around them. Circe (Bella Enahoro) is all sinewy eroticism
and Nausicaa (Sophie Okonedo) all flirty charm: 'just tell your wife you met
me and were swept overboard.' Geoffrey Freshwater finds viciousness in the
Cyclops and David Westhead croaking age in Nestor.
A blind blues poet (Rudolph Walker) keeps the action moving forward, but the
best parts of the evening are the descriptions of offstage events. That is
what Epic means. As Gorgias said in the Helen, 'words tell of the fortune
and misfortune of other lives and other people, the heart feels a feeling of
its own.'
The strengths lie in the language: 'Imagine a blue cave, alabaster and
porphyry, blue waves on its ceiling' or 'Our ribbed bodies long for their
original shore.' The verse itself, in six-pulse lines, needs close
following. Clear, sharp verse-speaking makes concentration easy. The content
varies from the witty: 'I saw the wooden horse blocking the stars - Troy
fell for it'; to the cruel: 'Helen - still miss Troy?"
At the moment, The Odyssey lacks expansiveness and shape. It fails to match
the scope of Walcott's vision: 'the sea speaks the same language around the
world's shores.' Leaving the theatre, one should feel that Odysseus' journey
is still happening somewhere. Walcott closed Omeros with that haunting idea:
'When he left the beach the sea was still going on.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Old Masters are back in fashion - Saleroom / Next
week's important London auctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON WEDNESDAY Sotheby's auction Rembrandt's portrait of the preacher and
theologian Johannes Uyttenbogaert. The canvas, signed and dated 1633, is one
of perhaps 50 paintings by the master in private - but not royal - hands. It
comes with an impeccable pedigree and, more crucial, the blessing of the
famously debunking Rembrandt Research Project. Unlike the Rembrandt which
failed at Christie's in April, it also comes with a reasonable estimate:
Pounds 3m plus. The emphasis is on the plus.
Its fate will be seen by many as a litmus-test of the state of the so far
remarkably resilient Old Master market. It is a sombre, serious picture.
Uyttenbogaert is portrayed after his return from exile and towards the close
of what had been a dramatic and turbulent life. The young Rembrandt focuses
on the careworn face and captures all the sitter's human vulnerability. He
might almost be sheltering behind his crisply painted ruff.
There has been a steady stream of requests for condition reports on the
picture, all from private collectors. Sotheby's is no doubt cheered by the
fact that the 'Daniel and Cyrus before the Idol of Bel' at Christie's had
been bought in for Pounds 6m, a more than respectable amount for the
jewel-like but small canvas.
In a reversal of the current trend, it is Sotheby's that offers the most
interesting paintings sale of the London Old Master season. Of particular
note, too, is Guido Reni's brooding 'David with the head of Goliath',
believed to be the documented second version of the picture painted in 1631.
The subject-matter, with its homo-erotic overtones, is quintessentially
Caravaggesque but the manner in which it is interpreted is Reni's own.
Despite museum interest in the picture, its fate is perhaps harder to judge.
The pre-sale estimate has been dropped to Pounds 1.6m-Pounds 2.5m, the lower
end of the estimate less than the record price the painting fetched after it
was first discovered and sold by Sotheby's in 1985. The National Gallery in
London had hoped to acquire it then, and it has been on loan there - and
much admired - more or less ever since.
Whispers abroad to the effect that the picture is actually by The Divine
Guido's pupil Simone Cantarini would be more convincing if they were based
on a knowledge of the latter's work rather than a desire to use him as an
art historical dustbin. In any event, the quality of the picture speaks for
itself - and against an attribution to Cantarini.
A hitherto unpublished Lucas Cranach the Elder of a female personification
of justice, is another highlight. It is a highly unusual subject and one not
without irony. Cranach's all but naked Justice is a sensual, languid
creature. How striking to have a representation of a virtue that inspires
vice. She comes with an estimate of Pounds 350,000-Pounds 450,000. Again the
estimate compares favourably with the Pounds 506,000 paid for a less
alluring Cranach portrait at Christie's in April.
Procaccini's dangerously smiling Judith with the head of Holofernes, is
another high quality, unpublished piece. It is ludicrously under-valued at
Pounds 25,000-30,000. Both it and the Francesco Cairo 'Agony in the Garden'
(estimate Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000) are reminders of the eccentric
brilliance of the Lombard Baroque at its best.
The strength of Christie's Friday sale is in earlier - and later - works. A
pair of predella panels by Giovanni di Paolo combine narrative innocence
with pictorial austerity. The more entertaining of the two features an
unidentified levitating saint. This is the sale's star lot, estimated at
Pounds 1.2m-Pounds 1.8m. In gentler vein is Garofalo's tender Holy Family
set in a dreamily romantic landscape (Pounds 100,000-150,000).
The gold ground panel of the Annunciation by Arcangelo di Cola da Camerino
has the late-Gothic elegance that one would expect from a contemporary of
Gentile da Fabriano. Will collectors be put off by the fact that it was
sold, for Dollars 1.1m, in New York only two years ago? It now comes with a
temptingly low reserve, and a lower estimate of Pounds 300,000.
Two of a set of four Venetian Canalettos are excellent witness for the case
against museum deaccessioning. The Alte Pinakothek in Munich sold these two
Grand Canal vedute in 1939 as they were then thought to be by Bellotto. No
one now doubts the original attribution, and they are set to do well. There
is every chance that they will exceed their estimate of Pounds
600,000-Pounds 800,000.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Abstracts from the scrap-heap - William Packer reviews
Janet Nathan and other constructivist exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JANET Nathan is an artist who makes reliefs. Is she a sculptor turned
painter, or painter become sculptor? And is what she makes an image or an
object? Has she moved from the imagined and internal pictorial space and the
single point of view that it commands, to the object celebrated for itself
in the physical world, or the other way about? Is her work representational
or abstract?
To ask such questions is only to confirm her contrariness. Her material is
what she finds on the scrap-heap or in the skip, for the most part scrap
wood with occasional bits of metal. Yet this is no absolute dependency, nor
any fixed rule, for she has always been prepared to contrive the particular
element if none comes to hand, or to modify or distress it as need be,
painting or polishing or scraping it down. And nowadays she almost always
uses synthetic resin, most artificial and contrived of all, light and
translucent, by which to fill the amorphous, organic spaces left within the
composition.
As these reliefs have become more worked and contrived, so they have become
at once more dense and physical, and more pictorial. That is not to say that
they are descriptive pieces, in any sense objectively observed, but rather
that the associative and symbolic qualities of abstract image and formal
composition are readily accepted. The ever-present disc, red, blue or
whatever, must stand for sun or moon; the insistent horizontal device soon
becomes itself the true horizon; the repeated serpentine or cursive profile
can suggest the ebb and flow of water.
The landscape connotation, the particular watery landscape of marsh and
estuary, is inescapable. 'Saltfleet', 'Naze', 'Whisper Creek': the titles
tell their own story. And yet abstract they remain, objects hanging on the
wall, confident and authoritative in their presence, and beautifully made.
The contradiction is all.
The same contradiction is nicely pointed in its historic context by the
Non-Objective World at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge. The material in every sense
was to be used only in its proper quality, line as line, colour colour, form
form, stuff stuff, and Miss Nathan's constructivist credentials, through the
romantic, intuitive line of Kurt Schwitters and his collage and merzbild are
sound enough. And yet how delicate and physical, how imaginatively
particular and free, how unschematic these things are, by Mondrian and van
der Leck, Malevich and Kupka, Arp and Hepworth, for all their principles.
The imaginative possibilities come flooding in.
Over these past 20 years or more, Annely Juda's main summer offering at her
London gallery has been a substantial study of this material in one or other
of its aspects. Indeed she set the critical debate at a time when early 20th
century abstraction, and constructivism in particular, was far from
fashionable, and has seen her acuity and judgment confirmed a hundredfold.
London has been spoilt too long, and it is only right that this year the
country at large should benefit by this touring show, which Mrs Juda has
herself selected.
A short walk away, at Jesus College, the present Master, Colin Renfrew, with
the full support of his Fellows, has again brought a selection of
contemporary British sculpture into the college gardens. This has become a
biennial exercise, now celebrated for the third time, and is unique in our
universities. The opportunity is patent, the lack of emulation by other
colleges sadly no surprise, yet Jesus deserves perhaps even more
congratulation in the event than for its splendid initiative. This was from
the first a serious business, the artists carefully chosen and invited to
work to a particular site, even to make the piece within the college. So a
Gormly figure now lurks beneath the great tree in the Fellows' Garden, a
Long slate circle fills a cloister, a Mach assemblage plays music to itself
in its ancient corner. Michael Archer, Richard Bray, Diane Maclean and Nina
Saunders are the other artists. A Flanagan horse was acquired from the first
exhibition, a small totem by William Turnbull from the second. In this
respect too, the intention is to continue.
Janet Nathan - Constructions: The gallery at John Jones, Unit 4, Morris
Place, Finsbury Park N4, until July 25. The Non-Objective World: Kettle's
Yard, Castle Street, Cambridge, until July 19 - then on to Swansea,
Liverpool and Kendal: a South Bank Touring Exhibition sponsored by British
Telecom. Sculpture in the Close: Jesus College, Cambridge, until August 1.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Laying the ghosts of the past - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YES, IT is American Independence Day. But will America ever be independent
of its past? In an intriguing new book by Dr Gertrude B. Atavus called
America And Its Ghosts (Princeton Press), the author suggests that the
closer America comes to the millennium's end - only 7 1/2 years to go - the
further back American culture will continue to reach in order to lay the
ghosts of the country's historical past.
It is fascinating, in this light, to browse through July's movies on video.
Robert Benton's Billy Bathgate performs exorcism rites over the golden age
of gangsterdom with Dustin Hoffman as a barking mad Dutch Schultz in this
intermittently stylish adaptation of EL Doctorow's novel. Mike Figgis's
moody thriller Liebestraum is about a haunted small-town department store
and the spooks of a long-ago sexual scandal and murder. In For The Boys
Bette Midler and James Caan are a song-and-dance team trouping through US
history from the Second World War to the present day. And Sean Penn's
film-making debut The Indian Runner is the powerful tale of a good and a bad
brother (David Morse, Viggo Mortensen) haunted by a past that ranges from
ancestral Indian memories to Vietnam.
Penn's film, the best of the bunch, should silence those who regard him
merely as an ex-Madonna appendage with a talent for delinquency. The Indian
Runner has its share of mumbled dialogue and crumbly structure. But it is
also vividly believable. This is a back-of-beyond town sighing with
recessionary despair and prairie winds: a place where the oldies (Sandy
Dennis and Charles Bronson as the boys' parents) deal out wisdom they do not
believe, while the youngsters seek the point where the new America started
to grow away from the old.
No art has more facility than cinema in dealing with the past. It combines
the expositional fluidity of literature with the emotional immediacy of
music. It presents dream, memory and reality alike as a tactile continuous
present. If you were to devote your viewing month to one film only, it
should be to Andrei Tarkovsky's Nostalgia (Artificial Eye). The writer hero
(Oleg Jankovsky) is a Russian self-exiled in Italy, as Tarkovsky himself was
at the time. Through landscapes brittle with ruin, he wanders, remembers,
dreams; he yearns for his family and homeland; and he performs surreal acts
of faith as in the extraordinary sequence of his walking across an abandoned
hotel spa pool with a guttering candle that must stay alight.
This is a candidate for my favourite scene in modern cinema. You can detect
the actor's own nervousness as Tarkovsky, unseen and unheard, demands that
he enact the impossible. As the minutes tick on, the flickering candle grows
from a single, potentially glib emblem of human faith into a hypnotic
dramatic and symbolic epicentre.
In a Hollywood-dominated age, serious world cinema has too long played
Cinderella to the seven ugly sisters (Columbia, Paramount, 20th Century Fox
and Co). How good, then, to hear that the British Film Institute in
collaboration with Piper-Heidsieck Champagne is about to launch on video a
Classic Film Collection. The aim, they announce, is 'to increase access to
the best of world cinema by creating new prints in pristine condition,
available for authorised screenings.'
Two hundred films are planned for release over four years and the first
three 'seasons' will consist of British Hitchcock, Early Kurosawa and The
Freed Unit (alias the vintage MGM musicals made under music chief Arthur
Freed).
The good news here is not just that these classics will be available - some
are already - but that they will be restored and springcleaned. As all
devout home viewers know, we are prone to the suspicion each time we take
out a video that we are seeing the worst run-off of the worst copy of the
worst print in history. Often this is true, and it is no way to respect the
cinema's past. As Dr Gertrude B. Atavus says in her book, 'The past is not a
mere prefix to the present, dusty and disposable, but a living part of its
syntax, significance and sensory system.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Chaos and Casablanca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN A man reaches 50, he has a decade or so to go before the gold watch and
carpet slippers. When a movie reaches 50 and people still watch it, it has
transcended age and found immortality. New generations will pour into
cinemas to gape at that accident of nature called a Hollywood classic.
Why are such films accidents? Because no single mind designed them.
Casablanca is one of those multi-author lucky strikes, like Gone With The
Wind and The Wizard Of Oz and Singin' In The Rain, which pour scorn on the
long-established and increasingly discreditable Auteur Theory. Who could
possibly be the 'author' of a movie with two directors, one quarrelsome and
capricious producer (Selznick) and umpteen indecisions of casting (Gone With
The Wind)? Or of a film with nine screenwriters and four directors (The
Wizard Of Oz)? Or of a screen musical whose two writers and two directors
were told to string a light comedy plot around a bunch of pre-existing,
never-popular-before songs (Singin' In The Rain)?
But the grandaddy of all Hollywood's accidents of nature must be Casablanca,
which returns to our screens next week in a new print specially struck for
the film's 50th anniversary. I once researched Casablanca for a radio
programme. As if I were not in love with it already I fell in love again on
realising the utter mayhem of its genesis. It confirmed my deeply-held creed
 -I was born and shall die an anti-auteurist - that great popular cinema is
too complex to be devised by any one human agent, only by fate working
through divine mischance.
Poring over Warners Studio files in the University Of Southern California, I
learned that Casablanca originated in an unproduced play; that it was at
first considered quite unfilmable; that its makers had a chronic attack of
political nerves as they wondered whether the film should be nice to the
Nazis (pre-Pearl Harbour) or nasty (after); and that it went through agonies
of casting unrivalled since GWTW.
George Raft was first choice for the Bogart role. Ronald Reagan might have
played Paul Henreid's freedom fighter. (Connoisseurs of prophetic lexical
coincidence will note that Casablanca is Spanish for White House). And Ann
Sheridan came within a coat of nail-varnish of playing the heroine, who was
then called 'Lois' and was a low-life broad who had two-timed Rick back in
Paris. When Bergman moved in, the Swedish actress changed the heroine's
name, history and character. As Ilsa and Laszo, she and Henreid could waft
clouds of dignified Euro-provenance into the film while Bogart growled away
as Our Man in the Casbah.
The blessed accidents multiplied. No one knew how the film would end till
the day came to shoot the last scene; though Henreid later claimed he had it
written in his contract that he would keep the girl. None of the
screenwriters still living remembers who wrote any of the famous lines: the
ones about gin joints, hills of beans and rounding up the usual suspects.
Best of all to the collector of Chaos Theory memorabilia is the revelation
that Dooley Wilson's Sam, of 'Play it again' fame, might have been a
Samantha. Ella Fitzgerald was the early favourite for the role.
Even the song 'As Time Goes By', a good decade old even when the film was
made, was under threat. It was a non-favourite with Warners composer Max
Steiner, who wanted to throw it out and compose something fresh himself. He
knew all about royalties.
In short, chaos. But does anyone still believe that popular American films
are made any other way? Years of burrowing into archives have taught me that
intentionalism has no place in Hollywood cinema. Let me illustrate by a
story each from the films I rank alongside Casablanca as the great celluloid
flukes.
In The Wizard Of Oz Buddy Ebsen would have played the Tin Man if he had not
contracted aluminium poisoning and been rushed to hospital after his first
make-up trial. The role went to Jack Haley. Ebsen, whose gangling dance
style was more individual than Haley's, might have radically changed the
balance of the supporting cast. (Ebsen, though, has had the last laugh: he
is still alive today when everyone who had a major speaking or singing role
in The Wizard film is dead.)
In Gone With The Wind the homosexual director George Cukor, who began the
movie, would have completed it if Clark Gable had not had an attack of
homophobia and referred to the director as 'that fairy.' Exit Cukor: enter
Victor Fleming, who came to GWTW after cutting short his work on a previous
project. Which was? The Wizard Of Oz. In Singin' In The Rain the rainswept
title number, guaranteed to give the performer a cold or 'flu, was performed
by a man who had both already. Gene Kelly was running a temperature of 100
as he danced under an acre of black tarpaulin while the soundstage faucets
spurted on and off at the whim of a water-pressure crisis caused by an LA
dry spell.
There is, of course, a difference between the fundamental anarchy of cast
changes, script changes or director changes and the minor shambles of a
great dancer-singer with the 'flu. But the point is the same: chaos is the
natural state in which a multi-collaborative art like cinema, especially
Hollywood cinema, operates. What guides a popular movie project towards
greatness is not the 'single hand on the tiller' beloved by auteur theorists
but the convergence of happy accidents. Even Kelly's 'flu in Singin' In The
Rain is a felix culpa. It surely helped to define and refine that head-cold
voice which was born to warble under a downpour.
As for Casablanca, the guiding hand was not director Michael Curtiz nor
producer Hal Wallis nor any of the conveyor-belt scenarists rolled in and
out of the studio's famous Writers' Block. It was the snowballing effect of
a runaway kismet. Set a promising story on the right slope, make sure that
on its downhill run it bumps over a good selection of stars, script-lines
and subplots, and you have a chance in a thousand that it will become a
popular perennial. No more precise prescription is possible. The rest is up
to the great mogul in the skies.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: The forgotten Impressionist - The RA is holding the
first major retrospective of Sisley's work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FAITH GLASGOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPRESSIONISTS have basked in popularity in recent years. The
record-breaking attendance of the Royal Academy's Monet in the 90s
exhibition, for instance, saw well over half a million visitors shuffle
through the galleries in the autumn of 1990.
Yet Alfred Sisley has been bypassed. With Monet, Renoir and Pissarro, he
founded the Impressionist movement, and of them all he clung most
unwaveringly to its original principles in his landscapes, but has been
overshadowed by the others.
This month the Royal Academy is mounting the first major retrospective of
his work since his death in 1899, and two books on the artist have been
published to coincide with it. But why has Sisley been relatively overlooked
for so long? Vivienne Couldrey, in her book Alfred Sisley: the English
Impressionist, offers the provocative suggestion that his dual nationality
worked against him. He was born in France and spent his life there, yet his
parents were English; maybe he was looked upon as an English landscapist by
the French, but never became a familiar name in England during his lifetime
because he was so rarely there.
Well, maybe. Although Sisley was described as 'essentially French in his
manners, tastes and ideas' by his contemporary, the art critic Theodore
Duret, overtones of the English landscape tradition - particularly that of
Constable - percolate through his work. Like Constable, Sisley was
interested in exploring and mapping out a location through his paintings,
producing whole series of local views in his search to capture the spirit of
a place.
But no direct reference to Constable has been found, and the curtator of the
exhibition Mary Anne Stevens stresses that 'we have to be tentative in
drawing such inferences.' Delacroix, Millet, Rousseau, Courbet, and - in
Couldrey's view most importantly - Jean-Baptiste Corot were the influences
Sisley himself cited at the end of his life.
However, his relative obscurity probably hinged more on other, less oblique
factors than a crisis of nationality. The whole group suffered years of
implacable hostility from the Paris art establishment; but Monet and Renoir
had come into their own by the 1890s, vigorously cultivating a network of
dealers prepared to show their work. By then, though, Sisley was not there
on the frontline. He became increasingly reclusive through the 1880s and
1890s, settling away from Paris in Moret-sur-Loing and apparently resigning
himself, in Pissarro's sad words of his own similar prospects, to 'remain at
the end of the Impressionist line.'
But it was not simply a case of not being in the right place at the right
time. Unlike the others, he did not stray from the path of pure
Impressionism which they had all trodden together in the 1870s. Sisley,
though, did not deviate. Until the end of his life he continued to produce
landscapes, working directly and almost exclusively from the motif (unlike
Monet, for example, whose paintings show evidence of much subsequent
tinkering in the studio). His finest paintings are sensitive, tranquil,
understated records of local landscape, in which figures take a back seat to
the elements of nature he loved to paint - skies, water, snow scenes.
Attractive, easy on the eye, without doubt; but in Stevens' words, 'not as
aggressive, tough, or visually irresistible' as the work of the other
Impressionists. And Sisley's character, like his art, was not that of a
trail-blazer. 'Sisley's gift was gentleness . . . he was a delightful human
being,' reported Renoir. But his modest and charming nature in itself
probably worked against the recognition he sought, especially as he grew
older and more withdrawn in the face of continued lack of response to his
work. Self-promotion did not come naturally.
Indeed, perhaps the principle reason for Sisley's low profile to date has
been the lack of information on his career or personal life. He left only a
paltry collection of uninformative notes, most being requests for money to
the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who supported him financially for much of
his impoverished existence. He did not keep a diary; nor are there many
illuminating eyewitness accounts of his public life.
He always seemed rather a grey figure in comparison with the others of his
time,' says Mary Anne Stevens, 'so putting the exhibition together has been
a revelationary learning process', involving a great deal of original
research.
The exhibition may well catch the imagination of the public If so, it should
go some way towards putting right the injustice that Monet recognised in his
old age after many years of public and establishment scorn: 'Three of us -
Degas, Renoir and I, have had our revenge. We can say we have had a happy
life. The others died too young. Sisley (was) misunderstood.'
The Royal Academy's exhibition, which will be reviewed by William Packer on
Tuesday, runs July 3-October 16; the accompanying catalogue, published by
Yale University Press, costs Pounds 35 (hardback) or Pounds 18.95 (paper).
Vivienne Couldrey, Alfred Sisley, The English Impressionist, is published by
David &amp; Charles at Pounds 40.

RADIO 4 was wise to bring forward Maxwell: the Last Days as they did, for it
took less a personal than a financial view, and such concerns are now only
too familiar to those involved. Perhaps a more personal approach might have
been better. Alfred Marks sounded right in his few lines as Maxwell (I never
heard the original), and BBC drama company players took little parts as
chauffeur, barber, secretaries and so on. But the programme, written by Mike
Walker with financial information from Caroline Bayler, and narrated by
Valerie Singleton, was not as dramatic as the events themselves.
There were no new disclosures in the account of Maxwell's financial
duplicities in the last years of his life, the directorial chess-playing -
none, at any rate, to anyone who has read the series in these pages leading
up to the account of Maxwell's last days given on Friday of last week. The
account followed posthumous events as far as the will and the later arrests,
and Radio 4 did well to produce the programme as soon as they did. In older
days, the script could have been broadcast live only a few days after it was
written. Can that not be done now, for such commentaries on current affairs?
Surprisingly, I found The Thirty-nine Steps (Radio 4, Monday), less
entertaining than Witchwood last week. The snag is that Buchan's story
clings so closely to Richard Hannay that Peter Buckman's adaptation
suggested too often a reading from the novel. There was a lot of action, but
reported rather than represented. Hannay, in flight from an expected charge
of murder, twice takes an express train, once a small local; he steals a
forty horse-power, thousand-guinea motor-car and crashes it; but we only
know because he tells us.
Impersonated by David Rintoul, he certainly tells us many exciting things,
though he never actually describes how you hood your eyes like a hawk, as
the top German spy used to do. The smaller parts are picturesquely played,
with some Scottish speech that sounded right enough for me, though I've not
been to Galloway for ages. The eponymous steps led up to a seaside villa in
Kent, but perhaps I shouldn't have told you.
Most of the impending changes on Radio 3 announced by Controller Nicholas
Kenyon this week naturally involve music, and they largely deal with
schedules. They will be very unpopular with many listeners - not because
they are wrong, but because changes of any kind are always disliked. It is
too bad that Chris Dunkley's Feedback goes out too late this week to get
into today's notes.
One change already evident is that music announcements are more often
amplified with relative fact or opinion, as if we were using a magazine.
Soon enough we shall have a magazine, the BBC Music Magazine.
The reduction of drama to one play a week has already provoked a bunch of
contemporary playwrights to voice their indignation in The Times. I wonder
if they have noticed how often at least one of the current weekly two is a
repeat of an old production. With the addition of the Season 3 for short
experimental drama it may be that writers are less affected than they think.
The weekly science magazine is to be continued, at any rate.
However much one may disagree, one must reserve one's judgments until after
the changes have begun, and this will chiefly be in September. It is hardly
likely that any flood of public indignation is likely to have any effect
between now and then.

WOMEN make different sorts of wartime heroes from men. Instead of going over
the top waving a flag (although doubtless they could do this if necessary),
they triumph over the subtler terror of life behind the lines. This is the
theme of Christian von Krockow as he records, in the voice of his sister,
Libussa, her hair-raising years in the remote eastern provinces of Germany
as the Third Reich is swept away by the approaching Russian army.
The book does not dwell on horror stories but one paragraph will demonstrate
the background to Libussa's struggle: 'We received more and more grim
tidings. Many people had actually carried out what we had planned to do:
they escaped the brutality of the conquerors by shooting or hanging
themselves. Others took poison, like the surgeon from Stolp - and many other
doctors . . . Many, indeed more than many, people were murdered, and many
were taken away, never to be seen again. Sometimes we could hardly believe
our ears: an elderly couple were chased into the village pond and forced to
stay there until they drowned in the icy water . . . The proprietor of the
Grumbkow estate, Herr von Livonius, had his arms and legs hacked off and was
thrown, still alive, to the pigs.'
The reason that Libussa does not agree to commit suicide as planned for the
family by her mother and her stepfather, Count von Krockow, is that in 1945
she is eight months pregnant. She is prepared to kill herself but not her
baby. Instead she and her remarkable mother, a Pomeranian aristocrat who
takes to stealing wood and chickens with dignity as well as courage, see to
it that the family can eat.
As a blueprint for survival, Libussa's behaviour teaches one powerful
lesson: always take action, never remain passive. Time after time it is her
decisiveness and energy which save her from the enemy. It is not just the
simple physical bravery of, for example, returning day after day to the
guarded ruins of their estate to steal from the garden, but making the
decision to climb out of a shed where she is being held in company with many
others. That night, hidden in the burnt-out remains of a German tank she
listens to the screams of her fellows who did not have the courage to follow
her.
As a history book, The Hour of the Women illustrates only too vividly the
confusion of war which brings violence to those who least deserve it. After
the Russians came the even more hated Poles who were to be the new owners of
the von Krackow land. Nevertheless the message, delivered finally by
Christian in his own words, is that the wartime boundaries must be honoured
by all races. Too much time has passed to retain old hatred. 'If we really
love our children and our grandchildren, we must do everything in our power
to save them from the horrors we once experienced.' It is this spirit of
reconciliation which infuses the book and makes it at heart not a horror
story but a testimony to magnificent human qualities.
It is probably unfair to read Christabel Bielenberg's The Road Ahead
immediately after a book describing life lived at the edges. The first part
of Mrs Bielenberg's autobiography, The Past Is Myself, was itself set in
wartime Germany and told of an Englishwoman's extraordinary experience
married to a German during that terrible period. Rightly, it became a best
seller. This second volume is a quieter affair altogether, as peace unravels
fear and the Bielenbergs plan a new life in Ireland.
Ironic and well written, her book describes their problems as novice farmers
when the enemy no longer comes in Nazi uniform but wears a woolly coat and
has a way of escaping to the far horizon. Gradually her story turns into a
comfortable family saga.

TWO ALONE, TWO TOGETHER: LETTERS BETWEEN INDIRA GANDHI AND JAWAHARLAL NEHRU,
1940-1964 edited by Sonia Gandhi Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 30, 697 pages
UNLIKE most Indians, the Nehrus were great preservers of paper. That such a
large number of the pre-1947 letters have survived is indeed fortunate -
some were lost in police raids on the Nehru household in Allahabad, but the
bulk survived. The present volume is a sequel to Freedom's Daughter,
published in 1989. In both, we get rare insights into deep family bonds and
commitments. Sonia Gandhi has skilfully and lovingly put together a unique
correspondence recording the public and private lives of two remarkable
people.
Nehru wrote elegantly and stylishly. Even when he was being didactic he was
never dull or dreary. Indira Nehru (as she was till 1942) inherited from her
father a profound respect for books. She was exceptionally well read. Like
her father she was a lover of words and phrases, a great stickler for
grammar and syntax. Her style was less introspective but more trenchant. It
evolved over the years and acquired a pace, tone, rhythm and voice all its
own.
At the end of Freedom's Daughter we left Indira ill in a sanatorium in
Switzerland, mostly confined to bed. She had pleurisy, was 22, lonely and
depressed. It was war time. Mail was disrupted; letters took weeks to
arrive. She greatly missed books and asked for some. Nehru, who was then out
of prison, sent her books and observed 'to suffer from lack of books and
papers is something that never struck me. I know well how I would feel if I
had to do without books. I could bear almost anything but that.'
Then we come across an amazingly candid letter from Nehru, who at this time
was in one of his, to borrow Churchill's phrase, 'black dog' moods. On March
11, 1940 he wrote: 'Public and private life act and react on each other, and
this sense of failure has pursued me in almost all I do. With this lack of
faith in myself, how can I advise anyone? What right do I have to interfere
in another's life? I have not made my own a brilliant success and all my
good intentions, or so I imagined they were, have not prevented me often
from making a mess of things . . .' Seven years later he was Prime Minister.
Indira Gandhi recovered and returned to India; Nehru was back in prison.
Their first meeting did not go well and caused Nehru much anguish. The
crisis was obviously serious. Daughter to Father from the Himalayan hill
station, Mussorie: 'I am in the throes of remorse and regret . . . Is it any
use saying forgive me? I can only hope and pray that this will be a lesson
for me to be less stubborn . . . And so the erring child asks for
forgiveness, and asks too that you believe her when she says that she loves
you . . . Tous les jours je t'aime davantage, aujourdhui plus qu'hier et
moins que demain.' Next we have wonderful letters prior to and following
Rajiv Gandhi's birth in 1944. Nehru was again in jail.
Then came Independence in 1947. Inevitably this brought vast changes in the
lives of the family. The rebel and the non-violent revolutionary became the
ruler and the reformer, the agitator the administrator.
These letters bring back the memories and turmoils of a bygone era and a
lost way of life. Their tone is so civilised, the approach to life so daring
at one level, so restrained at the other. And what is so appealing is that
politics does not consume their entire lives.
Literature, poetry, love of beauty and nature, travel, photography, a zest
for life in the most adverse circumstances, mark them out as exceptional
people. These are not dreary, dismal, self-pitying, one-dimensional,
professional politicians, but sensitive and beautiful human beings, who like
to live dangerously.

THE RECKONING by Charles Nicholl Cape Pounds 19.99, 413 pages
CHRISTOPHER Marlowe's end offers an inviting subject for inventive
speculation. Here the author admits candidly that his is 'an attempt to fill
in with probabilities and speculations and sometimes with guesswork. I am
not telling a story but presenting a complex and rather painstaking
argument'.
Painstaking, certainly. An historian of the period can agree that the author
has done his homework well, has pursued the careers of the poet's shady
companions into the underground, and come up with some new facts concerning
them, for what that is worth.
The title of the book refers to the dispute and scuffle at table over 'le
reckoning', according to the coroner's inquest over Marlowe's body. William
Shakespeare knew how he came by his end, and uses the same word in his
reference to it in As You Like It. But was it 'murder', as this enthusiastic
explorer of the background has it in his sub-title - and as he implies all
the way through - 'the killing' of Marlowe, 'the stabbing', as if it were
intended? 'We arrive at a conspiracy', etc. Nobody thought so at the time.
Dr William Urry, who knew more about Marlowe and his Canterbury background
than anybody, went through the jurors at the inquest with a tooth-comb. He
found what a respectable body of citizens they were, perfectly satisfied
with the evidence as to what happened that deplorable day in May 1593 in
Eleanor Bull's house at Deptford. Marlowe and his companions had been there
all day, eating and drinking. At the end of the day there was a dispute over
the reckoning. From lying on a couch Marlowe aimed a blow with his dagger at
Ingrain Friezer, who wrested it out of his hands with a blow which, alas,
killed him.
There was nothing mysterious about it. Many people knew what Marlowe was
like. He had been involved in affrays before, and knifings - in one of which
somebody else was killed. We learn that he was 'given to sudden privy
injuries to men' - quick on the draw, as we would say.
Marlowe was known to be an unstable, questionable personality, not only
devoutly homosexual but - what was more dangerous - aggressively undevout
about religion. He was in every way heterodox, rebellious against
convention. People called him an 'atheist'; actually he was an intellectual
deist, who had no use for conventional religion.
The one thing that remains important to us now is his wonderful genius: dead
at 29, he was the greatest loss our literature ever suffered.

WOULDN'T IT BE NICE? MY OWN STORY by Brian Wilson Bloomsbury Pounds 17.99,
390 pages
WITH SOME rock musicians, you can hear their doom in the music. Janis
Joplin's voice, Keith Moon's drumming, Jimi Hendrix's guitar -
self-destruction provided them with a steady back beat. There is very little
such evidence in Brian Wilson's work although, as his autobiography proves,
the founder and creative force behind the Beach Boys has led a tortured
existence of drug use, schizophrenia and legal tangles that belies his
music's resolute sunniness.
Wilson, born in 1942, was raised in a modest LA suburb, the sort of place
that provided legions of well-scrubbed teenagers for the early years of rock
'n roll. His childhood, however, was anything but sunshine and the girl next
door. His father was a bitter, failed musician who abused Wilson horribly;
not surprisingly, the boy became moody and withdrawn, his only solace coming
from the family piano.
In 1961 he organised his brothers Carl and Dennis, cousin Mike Love and
friend Al Jardine into the band that was to be The Beach Boys. They seemed
to be going nowhere until it was suggested that Brian, who hated the ocean
and did not even have a driver's licence, focus his already prodigious
talents on the teen fads of surfing and hot rodding. His next effort,
written when he was 19, charted. The rest, as they say, is history. A string
of singles like 'Help Me Rhonda' and 'I Get Around' broke all sorts of sales
figures. By the time he was 24, with the Pets Sounds album, the group's
best, Wilson had earned his place as one of the most prodigiously talented
writers and producers of the rock era.
All was not sweetness and light, however, and the patterns of mental illness
and substance abuse that were to plague his later years had already been
established. To make matters worse, rock changed, with psychedelia and R&amp;B
swamping the surfing sound. Wilson tried to keep up, but then went into a
creative and personal slump that saw him at one point spend almost three
years in bed, ballooning up to 340 pounds and suffering from schizophrenia
intensified by massive drug use.
The low point came in 1982 when the rest of The Beach Boys, who had started
out as little more than a backing band for Brian, fired him from the group.
Rock martyrdom was avoided with the intercession of Dr Eugene Landy, an
unorthodox psychologist who bundled Wilson off to a Hawaiian retreat and
took him through a radical cure that has brought him back to life.
Wouldn't It Be Nice? is a morbidly fascinating read, especially the early
sections, with their blend of the American Dream of rock stardom and the
American Nightmare of the fractured family. Where the book proves far less
interesting is in its later chapters, which deal with Wilson's recovery and
the incessant squabbles between The Beach Boys and Dr Landy. Though Wilson
had some mighty battles to fight in order to save his mind and his life, you
cannot help but wish that he would seem more aware that, unlike most
troubled souls, he was able to face his demons at an idyllic Hawaiian
retreat surrounded by a squad of psychologists, nutritionists and personal
trainers with a half-million dollar budget.

THE INTELLECTUALS AND THE MASSES by John Carey Faber Pounds 14.99, 246 pages
WHEN OXFORD'S Merton Professor of English castigates the 'literary
intelligentsia' for being hostile to 'the masses', it is a spectacular case
of a hound running with the hares. John Carey is the Merton Professor in
question, and he has successfully employed a formula used by tabloid
journalists: catch someone famous doing something compromising and publicise
the fact, applying large doses of moral outrage in the process. A number of
20th century intellectual heroes have said snobbish and nasty things about
people in the mass. Carey has caught them at it; his book is devoted to
exposing them.
The intellectuals' sin, according to Carey, is that they not only disdain
mass culture but hate the masses themselves. To protect high culture from
the pollution of popular acceptance intellectuals make their work too
difficult for the masses to understand, thus marginalising and excluding
them.
Carey's thesis is that intellectuals feel threatened by mass culture. The
threat started with increased literacy in the 19th century, and expressed
itself in new popular media like the tabloid press. Population explosion,
rapid growth of cities, tabloid journalism, trivial and vulgar pursuits
indulged en masse (football crowds, packed beaches) filled the
intelligentsia with revulsion, says Carey, and they invented a conceptual
idiom aimed at keeping the mobs at bay, namely Modernism; a family of
difficult, abstract literary and artistic styles.
And some intellectuals did not stop there: they began to hypothesise ways of
limiting or even eliminating the encroaching masses. DH Lawrence wished he
had the use of a 'lethal chamber' as big as the Crystal Palace; Rayner
Heppenstall dreamed of 'total genocide' of the Irish and Arabs at the push
of a button; Nietzsche proclaimed that higher men must declare war on the
'the superfluous' to defend against their engulfing mediocrity. The 20th
century did not have to wait long for a fairy-godfather to grant these
wishes.
By copious quotation Carey offers a depressing picture of elitism and
cultural bigotry. His book will furnish much ammunition to the already large
anti-intellectual majority in the English-speaking world. And that is a
pity, for his argument is too flawed and deeply tendentious to be taken
seriously.
First, it is striking that the cases Carey quotes form a very biased sample.
It is well understood that Lawrence, Pound, Yeats, Leavis, Heppenstall and
several others of Carey's stars held social and political opinions which
make Genghis Khan seem moderate. Carey tells us that, for example,
Heppenstall fulminated against the welfare state, trades unions, coloured
immigrants, new universities and the working class. Practically all
right-wing politicians do the same, relatively few of whom can be described
as intellectuals, so it is hard to see how such views are especially
representative of intellectuals.
Had Carey mentioned others in the intellectual community, like Bertrand
Russell, the Webbs, Keynes, Wilfred Owen and other war poets; and had he
been more discriminating about EM Forster, and more sensitive to the
attitudes of gay and women writers like Auden and Katherine Mansfield, who
knew what it was like to be members of excluded groups, he would find that
his group of star nasties is markedly unrepresentative.
Carey is not over-burdened by a sense of logic, and effects some spectacular
inferences. HG Wells was worried about the population explosion, and
deplored the haphazard pre-war growth of towns into the countryside. Both
are laudable concerns, yet Carey treats them as evidence that Wells hated
the masses. This is quite a jump. Carey seems unable to distinguish two
things: views about what mass culture sometimes does, and views about
individuals threatened with harm by mass culture.
He would have been equipped to do so if he had read Harry Payne's The
Philosophes and the People, which discusses the same question in an
18th-century setting. Payne shows that most thinkers were concerned to
liberate people from the tyrannies of ignorance and cheap sentiment. Modern
writers like Wells and Orwell were similarly worried that some aspects of
mass culture prevent people from thinking for themselves, and attacked it
accordingly. This is not at all the same as disdaining the individuals who
suffer the impoverishing effects of mass culture. Carey simply fails to see
this.
Indeed Carey never once asks whether some of the intellectuals' complaints
are justified. Is it not deplorable that the intellectual staple of many is
an endless diet of television soaps, the Sun newspaper and royal scandals?
Does Carey wish us to think otherwise? If so, that is treason by a clerk
indeed.

THE INTERIOR CASTLE: A LIFE OF GERALD BRENAN by Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 25, 660 pages
THE STORY so far, just in case you have forgotten the details:
Carrington loved Lytton. Lytton, while tolerating Carrington, loved Ralph.
Ralph loved Carrington. In order to remain close to Lytton, Carrington
agreed to marry Ralph without being in love with him. Gerald was Ralph's
greatest friend after Lytton and like Ralph had fought bravely at the Front
in the world war. Ralph, Gerald and Carrington were in a situation similar
to that of Jules et Jim and Jeanne Moreau in the film. Their triangle
exploded and all but ended the friendship between the two men when Ralph
discovered Gerald had been making love to Carrington.
Then Lytton died aged 52 in 1932. Carrington, inconsolable, committed
suicide as she had threatened. Ralph married Frances, and Gerald went to
Yegen in Spain, in the remote then almost inaccessible Alpujarra. He
fathered a child, Miranda, by a 15-year-old Spanish peasant-girl, Juanita.
Then Gerald married Gamel Woolsey, a southern belle with poetic ambitions,
who had settled in England and had become the mistress of Llewelyn Powys.
She now went to Spain with Gerald. Gamel and Gerald brought up Miranda as
their daughter, sent her to boarding school, and then . . .
But hold on. I am starting to anticipate Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy's highly
readable, splendidly complete, marathon life of Gerald Brenan in which these
entanglements, some much written about already, starting with Michael
Holroyd's life of Lytton Strachey, are seen from a fresh, revealing angle -
that of Gerald. From the earlier biographies you might have concluded that
Gerald had played only a minor role in the Lytton/Carrington story, but it
now becomes clearer than ever before just how crucial his part was.
Gerald was formidably equipped with literary gifts that were slow to mature
alongside a combative nature. Throughout his long life he had close
friendships with, and influenced, many clever people of later generations as
well as making, through his books, a significant contribution to British
understanding of Spain. In all Gerald presents a testing challenge to a
biographer, and it is one to which Gathorne-Hardy has risen energetically.
The contrast with Lytton, with whom Gerald is sometimes compared on the
ground that he did for Spanish literature what Lytton had done in England
for French, is extreme. To begin, Gerald lived 40 years longer than Lytton.
He died in 1987, just short of his 93rd birthday. Again, Lytton, a
homosexual Bloomsbury guru, was by temperament a Cambridge intellectual, an
Apostle, a stay-at-home with a Gallic vision - the one occasion when he was
persuaded to venture abroad to visit Gerald, described in Gerald's
masterpiece, South From Granada, was a near-disaster.
By contrast, Gerald managed to combine the life of the mind with a life of
adventure and travel. His military father insisted he took the Sandhurst
entrance examination after Radley. But Gerald avoided going there by making
his first and greatest escape. He left home abruptly one morning aged 18 and
set off on a walk across Europe with a friend, Hope-Johnstone, his earliest
mentor. It was a crazy thing to do, but it set the pattern of his life, one
of defiant exile. Then and later, it was, financially, a precarious
existence subsidised by borrowing and spongeing. Gerald persuaded a rich
aunt to make him a regular allowance on which he lived for many years.
In 1914 he joined the army he had so recently avoided. He became an infantry
officer, an observer on the Somme, and was awarded the Military Cross. It
was the only time Gerald had a regular job. After the first war Gerald's
life divides into long periods of residence in Spain broken by short periods
of return to rural England. Gerald spent most of his life pursuing women
while simultaneously educating himself by reading voraciously in various
literatures. He always wanted to be a poet and continued to write poetry
into old age. He was at the same time full of plans for prose-books, novels,
biographies and cultural histories, some of which took years to mature,
others were half-written and jettisoned.
The fact that he did not publish much till late in life - his reputation as
a writer was only really secure in 1951 after the appearance of The
Literature of the Spanish People - means that Gathorne-Hardy is able to
concentrate on the inner man for long stretches. As his title, The Interior
Castle, implies, Gerald pulled up the drawbridge on his true self even more
firmly than most writers, and Gathorne-Hardy ruthlessly prises it open.
The attachment to women began early in classic public school style with an
infant pass at his Nanny. Gathorne-Hardy published an authoritative history
of the Nanny in 1972 and therefore deserves to be heeded when he claims it
may have been a voyage of discovery in bed with his Nanny that started
Gerald off on a long series of attachments to women of the lower classes.
At any rate, childhood left Gerald with a strong voyeur instinct that he
went to excessive lengths to satisfy in later life, taking a powerful
telescope with him on his country rambles. Confession of sexual longings as
well as of impotence are a feature of the innumerable letters he wrote to
friends like Ralph and Frances Partridge, David Garnett, Sir Victor
Pritchett. Gathorne-Hardy suggests that it may ultimately be as a
letter-writer that Gerald will be best remembered.
Fortunately the marriage to Gamel, both of them writing and translating in
their Spanish home near Malaga, worked well for many years. They were there
when the Civil War started. In an effort to understand what was happening
Gerald then began work on one of his finest books, The Spanish Labyrinth.
Gerald's sexual drive lasted well into old age. He developed a brief -
unfulfilled - incestuous passion for his daughter Miranda. After she was
whisked away and safely married to a French doctor, Gerald suffered another
seismic sexual upheaval through the appearance of a new-generation
Carrington, Joanna, daughter of Carrington's brother Noel.
After she had left, he installed other girl-friends to help him with his
work, to the chagrin of Gamel. Shortly after her horrific death from cancer
we find Gerald, now a chirpy 74, setting up house with Lynda, a pretty woman
in her late twenties, with whom he is writing a biography of St John of the
Cross. She continues to be his companion and minder for the next 16 years,
even after her own marriage. We have here an account of a household
consisting of her, her Swedish artist-husband Lars, her two children and
Gerald, a menage as extraordinary in its way as anything chez Lytton and
Carrington.
We also have some pleasant close-ups during this period of Gerald delighting
his friends in bookish talk, vying with the likes of Cyril Connolly.
Gathorne-Hardy himself enters the picture at this point as a welcome guest
of Gerald and Lynda's. But these occasional personal memories, often
confined to footnotes of which Gathorne-Hardy is obsessionally fond, do not
impair the writer's detachment in this rich portrait of a maddeningly
devious, brilliantly courageous, literary man.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Food: New York calling - Nicholas Lander meets food chat
show host Arthur Schwartz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIDAY NOON. Radio WOR New York. Arthur Schwartz introduces his daily show
'Food Talk' and within 30 seconds all 14 incoming telephone lines are
flashing. On Fridays the programme is devoted to restaurants.
Schwartz begins with two reviews - one laudatory, the other critical - and
then answers callers' questions. Line 5 wants a sushi restaurant at a
reasonable price, line 3 the best French restaurant on the Upper East Side.
Schwartz then deviates to talk about the pleasures and pitfalls of a truly
American phenomenon, all-you-can-eat sushi bars. You must remember, Schwartz
counsels, that you are not allowed to eat the fish without the rice and that
whatever you leave will be charged at the much higher a la carte prices.
Schwartz's personality and experience are two reasons why his programme has
been so successful. Born in Brooklyn, Schwartz ate well and copiously at
home thanks to his Jewish mother. When he saw an advertisement for a food
editor of a suburban magazine he produced outstanding references from his
wife, mother and mother-in-law attesting to the quality of his oysters
Rockefeller, pot roast and chocolate souffle
He got the job, eventually becoming food editor of the New York Daily News,
for which he has been reviewing restaurants for the past 14 years. But
Schwartz is modest enough to admit that if he is the right man for the job,
the timing of his show could not have been better.
One of the biggest misconceptions that still persists about life in America
is that Americans are not really interested in what they eat. In the
mid-west they may still be preoccupied with quantity but there are many
Americans on the east or west coast who can talk as passionately and
authoritatively about food as any native of Lyons or Bologna.
This was brought home to me four years ago sitting in on another radio chat
show, this time hosted by Narsi David in San Francisco. A caller phoned to
discuss the secrets of chicken stock.
Nothing extraordinary - except that the caller was an 83-year-old woman who
had been cooking for the past 60 years and was still trying to perfect her
technique.
The American preoccupation with eating has been chronicled by John Mariani
in an excellent book entitled America Eats Out, William Morrow Dollars 25
(Pounds 13.50).
And Americans do enjoy eating out. Figures from the American National
Restaurant Association confirm that. The average size of the bill may be
small but the spread of tastes is enormous - the biggest growth areas are in
pizza, Mexican and Asian restaurants - with much reduced demand for new
hamburger restaurants.
Behind these figures there is a development which is adding to the
popularity of Schwartz's radio programme.
Americans are becoming increasingly concerned and confused about what they
can and cannot eat and which foods are good for them.
It used to be simple. Now, every week brings conflicting reports about the
safety of the meat, the quality of the vegetables and the purity of the
waters around the American coasts from which the one food item that was
thought to be beyond reproach - fresh fish - is caught.
Although Schwartz has not lacked callers since his programme went on air the
most frenetic day he and his assistant, Mary Ann, ever had was when the
studio guest was neither a top chef nor a restaurateur but a food storage
and safety expert from Cornell University.
In addition to phone calls, Schwartz receives 40 to 50 letters a day from
listeners seeking advice and help. It is only the thought of having to reply
to all this correspondence which temporarily wipes the permanent smile from
his face.
But the final ingredient in the success of Schwartz's programme is the
enthusiasm of his regular callers: Louis from Westchester who came third in
the Great American Meatloaf cook-offs; Mark with a mania for hygiene; and
Greg, who collects Japanese cooking knives at Dollars 450 each. Confronted
by them, Schwartz knows he has found listeners almost as passionate about
food as he is.

are ever going to experience the true, and delightfully simple, pleasures of
wine? Probably a handful at most unless there is a complete rotation of US
mind-set on wine.
Wine that sells in north America is either very cheap, very expensive, or
regarded as a medicine. At the bottom end, a shrinking proportion of the
mass market buys basic commercial blends, with their persuasive sugar
levels, and swigs them for refreshment as an alternative to a cola.
At the top end of the market, a much smaller, static number of consumers,
probably 0.1 per cent at most, are interested - and I mean passionately
interested - in nothing but the very, very best and will pay any price to
secure it.
So well-heeled Americans gobble up all the most sought-after wines, helping
to drive up their price, even importing British merchants' allocations
across the Atlantic. But most Americans, are uninterested in the bread and
butter of the wine world, the exciting variety of good-value bottles that
can be enjoyed every day. Okay, some will buy mid-range California wines in
restaurants, but only because they resent paying restaurant mark-ups on the
top wines they have in their cellars.
They all agree which are the top wines because they all read The Wine
Advocate newsletter and The Wine Spectator magazine which dispense, per
wine, easily comprehensible scores out of 100; pocket calculators have
replaced palates in the American wine trade. One New York restaurant, Zoe,
even prints Spectator scores on its wine list, with special sections for the
'heavy hitters' (those scoring over 90).
A dangerously high proportion of wine in America is filling cellars rather
than glasses. Wine connoisseurship has enjoyed a period of unparalleled
status in the US. A cellarful of 90-pointers has been seen as an essential
accoutrement of success. The cellar will be specially constructed, its
temperature and humidity carefully controlled, but its design is often
predicated on its function as spectacle rather than store-cupboard. The
bottles are for ogling rather than opening.
Bottles are sometimes opened, en masse, at grand, well-publicised tasting
marathons at which perhaps 100 wines, each individually capable of
sustaining a memorable dinner, are compared, and expectorated. But the
proportion of great wine that is served as it is meant to be, a bottle or
two at a time to maximise pleasure around a table, seems absurdly low from
the European side of the Atlantic. American for someone who takes an
interest in wine is, significantly, not connoisseur or enthusiast but
'collector'.
There are those, however, who think the only way wine will survive the
activism of those labelled neo-Prohibitionists is by becoming even more
elitist. For years now, all wine bottles, even the grandest, have had to
carry labels warning pregnant women, and those in charge of machinery,
against drink. Increasing controls and some crazy litigation have wrought
striking changes in US attitudes.
A French wine merchant dining alone in a Boston steakhouse tried to sample a
rival's brand, available only by the bottle. He was flabbergasted to have
his order refused by a waitress who told him that a bottle was too much for
one person and that she risked being held legally responsible for his
actions if he consumed it.
If the French wine trade were not in such dire straits, with Japan's second
coming to wine looking increasingly mirage-like, one feels the French might
give up on the US market altogether.
Ever since Prohibition, selling any alcohol in the US has been complicated,
with different rules for each state, but the hurdles between producer and US
consumer seem to double each year. Perhaps symptomatic of wine's place in
American society is that wine's chief regulatory body is the fiercely
literal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
The BATF must have been as shocked as the wine trade, if in a very different
way, by the extraordinary television broadcast in November on CBS's '60
Minutes'. Morley Safer, a sort of Wogan-Dimbleby hybrid, told 30m Americans
of the research that suggests that one of the factors that keeps the French
heart disease rate 40 per cent lower than in the US may be France's more
robust consumption of red wine.
Who could have predicted such a boon for the wine trade from this unexpected
quarter? Little old ladies teetered into liquor stores the very next morning
asking for a bottle of that stuff that wards off heart attacks. My
practically teetotal but cholesterol-fixated Californian friend manfully
starting washing down his lunch with premier cru burgundy. Gallo, the
world's largest winery, has had to put all of its reds, even its
much-maligned jugs of 'Hearty Burgundy', on allocation only. Red wine sales
immediately increased by more than 40 per cent.
But the US wine trade is trying desperately not to get too excited. Oat
bran, sold a few years ago along much the same lines, proved more of a fling
than a sustained love affair for the American public. It will not be in our
lifetimes that Americans fall for the sort of relaxed life enhancement that
regular consumption of good-value wine can offer.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Food: The Robin Hoods of the ice cream world - Ben and
Jerry's unusual recipe for success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICANS owe a debt of gratitude to Ben and Jerry, makers of Vermont's
Finest All-Natural Ice Cream, for this singular feat: they have made eating
ice cream virtuous.
In this year BJ 14 - the company was founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen, now chief
executive of Ben and Jerry's, and Jerry Greenfield, vice-chairman  -
Americans cannot help but know that, when they pick up a pint of Ben and
Jerry's Fresh Georgia Peach, Chunky Monkey, or Cherry Garcia (named for
Grateful Dead lead singer Jerry Garcia) they are buying a lot more than ice
cream. They are buying an ethos. They are buying political correctness.
As their success has grown - they sold Dollars 97m (Pounds 52.4m) worth of
ice cream last year and are second only to Haagen Dazs in the US
super-premium ice cream market - Ben and Jerry have graduated from America's
corporate class clowns to national role models for corporate responsibility.
Their company's goal: to make first-rate products while toeing a 'two-part
bottom line,' as Ben puts it: 'How much do we benefit the community and how
much money do we make?'
The brownies in Chocolate Fudge Brownie are made at Greystone Bakery in
Yonkers, New York, which reinvests profits in jobs and training for the
homeless. The company buys the berries for Wild Maine Blueberry from the
Passamaquoddy Indians to support traditional elements of their economy. The
profit from the nut brickle candy in Rainforest Crunch go to rainforest and
environmental preservation. Next year Ben and Jerry's will open a 'scoop
shop' (ice cream parlour) in Harlem, New York, employing homeless people and
residents of shelters.
Feeling righteous yet? Try this: last year when cuts in federal support
programs to dairy farmers caused milk prices to fall 25 per cent, Ben and
Jerry's continued to pay premium prices to its supplier, St Alban's
Cooperative Creamery, taking Dollars 500,000 'out of the company's profits,
where it doesn't belong, and into farmers' pockets, where it does belong,'
said Ben. 'We refuse to prop up our bottom line with bankrupt family farms.'
Ben and Jerry met at school - they were the two fattest boys in gym class.
Ben, a college drop out, and Jerry, twice rejected from medical school, only
enrolled in a Dollars 5 correspondence course in ice cream-making when they
could not afford the equipment to make their other favourite food - bagels.
They set up shop in a converted garage in Burlington, Vermont, on Dollars
12,000, most of it borrowed, and started delivering throughout the state in
a Volkswagen van. By 1981 Time magazine was calling Ben and Jerry's the best
ice cream in the world, and the strain of success was starting to show.
Jerry quit for three years, saying he would never return and, in 1984, Ben,
'having the horrible feeling . . . that I had become a businessman', almost
sold up. He decided to keep Ben and Jerry's 'in trust for the community'.
A whopping 7.5 per cent of the company's pre-tax profits goes to charity
(compared to the average of less than 1 per cent for most US companies)
through Ben and Jerry's Foundation. Their ice cream novelty, Peace Pops (ice
cream bars dipped in chocolate and nuts), raises money and awareness for the
'1 per cent for Peace' organisation, which seeks to redirect 1 per cent of
the US defence budget to programmes that promote understanding between
nations.
Ben and Jerry's is a groovy place to work, too. Dads get paid paternity
leave and there are baby changing tables in the men's rooms.
The most publicised - and problematic - element of Ben and Jerry's
employment policy is their limit on executive salaries: the highest-paid
employee can only make seven times the lowest wage, which last year meant
that the highest wage possible, including benefits, was about Dollars
130,000.
While Ben and Jerry argue that the salary cap ensures executives join the
company for the 'right' reasons, the policy is unpopular among higher-ups.
It has been difficult to keep executives in place - early this year three
top-level positions were available.
Ben and Jerry's owns up to its mistakes almost to a fault - its 1991 annual
report reads like a confessional. The introduction of Ben and Jerry's Light
Ice Cream was a 'disaster' - it sold poorly and the company was nailed by
the Food and Drug Administration for abusing the term 'light'; the line has
been dropped. The report also admits that factory discharge caused severe
waste water problems in one town. Two of America's leading business
magazines, Fortune and Forbes, have criticised the inconsistency (as they
see it) of Ben and Jerry's self-proclaimed social awareness while selling
expensive ice cream: 'Inner city residents would have to take out a bridge
loan to take home a pint', says Forbes.
Ben and Jerry's certainly is expensive - pints cost Dollars 2.50 or more,
and cones start at Dollars 1.75 - but then Ben and Jerry have never claimed
theirs is an equal-opportunity ice cream. They seem content to be
contemporary Robin Hoods, selling pricey products to yuppies and
redistributing the proceeds to the less fortunate.
Forbes is also responsible for the rumour that Ben's six-month sabbatical
this year is a front - he is really quitting the company to live on a rice
and beans in solidarity with the Third World, it says.
The company says Ben will return in September, in time for the introduction
of the newest flavour - Wavy Gravy - and that it will be business as usual
at Ben and Jerry's.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Food: English-made Caesar salad - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE not yet been to America in the flesh, only in spirit. You may think
me medieval for this.
Most of my culinary impressions have been gleaned from films, television and
novels. In the Hollywood version, GIs, when not chewing gum, are tucking
into or craving Hershey bars, fudge brownies, cheesecake, and Mom's apple
pie.
In the deep south they seem to survive on curiously named confections like
Mississippi mud, jambalaya, hominy grits, johnny cake and hush puppies - not
forgetting Kentucky fried chicken, of course.
Many American meat dishes sound curiously unappetising: meatloaf, corned
beef and hamburgers to name but three. Fish offers more glamour and allure:
Grand Central Station clam chowder, New England crab cakes, oysters
Rockefeller and lobster Newberg.
This last, devised by Delmonico's restaurant in Manhattan, was, so the story
goes, originally named after a patron called Wenberg. The letters were
transcribed at a later date after an exchange of sharp words between patron
and restaurateur.
It has been said that two things make American meals stand out from those of
other countries. A family dinner customarily begins with a salad, and it is
not considered complete without a very serious dessert.
The American tooth seems even sweeter than the British one, which is saying
a lot. Their salads often include as much fruit as vegetables, and sometimes
the fruit is set in jelly like a nursery pudding of the nastiest sort.
Waldorf salad, on the other hand, is pleasing with its happy marriage of
celery, apple and walnuts, while fruitless Caesar salad is particularly
appetising.
I confess, though, that rather than serve Caesar salad in its traditional
role as a first course, I prefer it as a lunch dish. It makes a good choice
for a warm summer's day, needing little more than a bowl of, say, fresh ripe
cherries and tawny apricots to follow it.
CAESAR SALAD (serves 4 for lunch or 6-8 as a first course)
In spite of the Roman implications of the name, this is a north American
recipe, created in the early 1920s by Caesar Cardini in his restaurant in
Tijuana, Mexico. Many versions of the salad are now in circulation, some
quite elaborate, but it began life as a simple affair and that is how I like
it, the charm of it lying in its combination of a few very fresh, top
quality ingredients: Cos, the best lettuce there is, anointed with an
egg-enriched dressing, a savoury grating of genuine Parmegiano-Reggiano and
the crunch of good bread fried in good olive oil.
Some cooks add snipped anchovy fillets, a splash of Worcester sauce and
other extra flavourings. I find them quite unnecessary. Many use one-minute
boiled eggs in the dressing. I have never quite understood why. Such brief
immersion in boiling liquid does not cook an egg in the accepted sense; it
barely sets a thin outer film of egg white, leaving the rest of the white
and the yolk raw and barely warmed. Is it really worth effort of getting out
an egg boiling pan and setting a pinger timer for this?
A raw egg seems to me as suitable as a semi-raw one for the twin purposes of
increasing the food value of the salad and mollifying the lemoniness of the
dressing. (Those fearful of salmonella may prefer to omit the egg altogether
and up the oil content of the dressing accordingly.)
1 1/2 lb or more Cos lettuce leaves (I use the best inner leaves of 2 large
Cos and save the outer parts for making soup or cooking with peas); 5-6 oz
good quality slightly stale bread (ciabatta for preference); 1 oz or more
freshly grated Parmesan cheese; 2 garlic cloves; 8 tablespoons extra virgin
olive oil; 1 egg, at room temperature; 3-4 teaspoons lemon juice.
Wash and dry the Cos and cut or break the leaves into bite size pieces. Dice
the bread. Grate the cheese. Slice the garlic thinly.
Put the garlic into a large frying pan together with 4 tablespoons olive oil
and place over very low heat. When the oil is very hot and aromatic, remove
the frazzled fragments of garlic. Add the diced bread to the pan and turn up
the heat a little. Fry, stirring and turning the bread as necessary, until
golden and crisp.
Set the pan of croutons to one side while you quickly break the raw egg into
a salad bowl. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil, the lemon juice,
a good scrunch of sea salt and a generous grinding of black pepper. Mix well
with a fork.
Add the leaves to the dressing and toss to coat them. Sprinkle on the cheese
and mix again lightly. Adjust seasoning to taste. Add the croutons of garlic
fried bread, toss briefly and serve straight away.

LALIQUE is one of the greatest of names in the litany of fine French
companies that cluster together near the Madeleine in the poshest part of
Paris. It was Rene Lalique who lifted the company out of the ranks of mere
producers of glass into starry status of world-famous designers of
sought-after crystal. However, Rene Lalique actually began in a smaller way
 -with jewellery.
Marie-Claude Lalique, his grand-daughter, has now gone back to where her
grandfather started and has produced a summery, colourful collection of
crystal jewellery, photographed right. The Cabochon collection comes in 14
colourways, including bracelets and ear-rings, brooches, pendants, pins, tie
clips and cufflinks. Prices range from Pounds 345 for the bracelet and
Pounds 125 for the ear-rings to Pounds 75 for the pendant. The collection is
stocked at the Lalique shop at 162 New Bond Street, London W1Y 9PA, at
Selfridges of Oxford Street, London W1, at Mappin &amp; Webb in Regent Street
and from Mulberry Hall, Stonegate, York.
Some lovely new wallpapers from Osborne &amp; Little have been brought out.
Scaglia is a striking paper rendering of Italian marbling which comes in 20
different colourways, ranging from a rich terracotta to a heavenly pale
blue, from palest apricot to a country green. Stronger and more striking
than its forerunner, Sienna, it is an easy, almost instant way of conjuring
up some of the latest paint effects.
If Scaglia is too strong for your tastes then take a look at Pietra, also
new to the range, which imitates very soft Italianate stone effects. There
are some 20 different colours: gentle stones, beiges, greens, blues, pinks.
Both papers come in rolls of 10 m long by 52 cm wide and both sell at Pounds
17.15 per roll (inclusive of VAT) from Osborne &amp; Little's own shops at
304-308 King's Road, London SW3 5UH and 39 Queen Street, Edinburgh, and from
good interior decorators and designers.
What does a well-dressed chap wear on his feet when he is relaxing around
the house during the summer? Docksiders, that's what. Once the only shoe the
yachting crowd would contemplate, it has now become the THE snob shoe for
fashionable landlubbers as well.
The pukka original version was a soft, comfortable moccasin, treated with
oil to make it waterproof and with rubber soles to keep the wearer steady on
deck. The most noticeable trademark, though, are the eyelets and lacing at
the sides. Versions abound in almost every high street shoe shop, but
anybody who is not near a good shoe shop might like to buy the Sebago
version direct by mail from Shipton &amp; Heneage, 117 Queenstown Road,
Battersea, London SW8 (tel: 071-738-8484).
Prices are Pounds 55 for the women's shoe, Pounds 60 for men. Colours are
plain tan, two-tone tan, suede, navy and white, navy and tan. And remember -
NO socks.

IF THE gloom and doom in the last few months has got you down, if you feel
in need of a treat, there are now a few places available on the very last
Weekend FT safari to Zimbabwe.
Last year's safari - led by John Stevens and Gavin Ford, whom I consider two
of the finest guides in Africa - was such a success that we set up a second
one, with the same two fine guides, for this September (from the 12th to the
28th). A few readers have, for personal reasons, had to cancel, so anybody
longing to get away and with Pounds 3,028 to spend on the safari of a
lifetime now has a chance.
Remember that the price is inclusive of almost everything, including
canoeing down the Zambezi, tented camps in the bush and beside the river and
a three-day walking excursion in the middle. You will be happy to hear that
in the Zambezi valley, where this safari is based, the rains have been
normal - it is Southern Zimbabwe that is suffering so terribly. More details
either from this office (071-873-3000) or Primrose Stobbs at Abercrombie &amp;
Kent (071-730-9600).

IT IS NOT often that many of us get the chance to see just what splendid
work is being done in art schools and colleges up and down the country.
We hear word from abroad of how much admired our British schools are, how
inventive and creative the young are, but on the whole, unless we take time
and trouble to visit the degree shows of the colleges close to where we
live, we have, by and large, to take it all on trust.
In recent years there have been two important attempts to bring together
under one roof the best work of the best students. Zeev Aram, as a labour of
love, because he has spent his whole life in the design world, traipses up
and down the country every summer, scouring some 40 of Britain's best art
schools.
At his own expense he then brings the pieces that pass his particularly
scrupulous aesthetic and functional tests to his showroom in London's Kean
Street, in Covent Garden, where later in the autumn (from September 18 to
October 9) the work can be seen.
Zeev Aram always hopes particularly that captains of industry, heads of big
manufacturing combines and other commissioners and inspirers will come to
the show, for there he believes they will find the talent that will help
them produce the products that will sell.
The New Designers Exhibition starting at Islington's Business Design Centre
on July 9 is slightly different. It is much larger to start with  - the work
of some 1,000 different designers will be on show - and it is therefore less
stringently edited.
However, it is full of life and zest. Far from being a mere academic
showcase, these days even the youngest designers have got street-wise and
clued up on the ways of the market place, which means that almost everything
on show is for sale.
If there is anything that has already been sold that you really want you may
be absolutely sure that its designer/maker will be keen and ready to make
you something almost like it.
The spectrum covered is vast - there is colourful glass from designers such
as Marianne Buus, whose beautiful green jug is photographed here.
There are witty and beautiful pieces of furniture, there are hats and
scarves and shoes and jewellery, there are lights and rugs, silver,
pewterware or ceramics.
Above all, there are some truly lovely textile designs. Many of them have
clearly been influenced by the somewhat New Age symbolism pioneered by
English Eccentrics but the results are often so beautiful that one simply
wants to frame them and hang them.
There are several reasons for going to the exhibition - anybody who is
looking for products or designers to revitalise his business will find
himself spoiled for choice.
Anybody who is interested in what the next generation of designers is up to,
just how talented, how original, how lively they are, will be fascinated to
see the vast range of disciplines on show.
Those who want a jolly day out and a chance to buy some original presents
will be not be disappointed, while those who are thinking of commissioning a
special piece for a special occasion will seldom get a finer chance to find
one.
You should make especially sure not to miss the section headed One Year On
where you can catch up with the work of those who graduated just a year ago.
Prices will range from Pounds 20 to about Pounds 2,000 (for a heavily inlaid
marquetry table from the Parnham School of Furniture Designs) but there will
be lots to choose from at under Pounds 100.
The exhibition opens on Thursday, July 9 at 10 am and closes at 8 pm on
Friday. It runs from 10 am to 6 pm on Friday 10 and Saturday 11 while on
Sunday July 12 it is open from 10 am to 4 pm. Admission charge is Pounds 4,
OAPs, Pounds 2.50.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Gardening: Where green is the colour - Robin Lane Fox visits
designer David Hicks' garden where highly-trained trees keep to the straight
and narrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sun has been shimmering on the cornfields in these late midsummer
evenings; mirages have been everywhere, but I have just emerged from an
oasis whose owner was waving his hands in disgust. The offending object was
his rosebed.
Its roses looked innocent enough, a selection of pale beauties from the
David Austin stable. 'Out,' exclaimed David Hicks, one of the uncrowned
kings of modern interior decor. 'Out, out, out: those roses simply have to
go. They lower the tone.'
Since the mid-1970s, the vision of designer Hicks has undergone an unusual
enlargement. It has moved from patterns on carpets and curtains to the art
of landscape gardening, not to rosebeds but to ground plans with bold
designs. Hicks' gardens are now dotted round the globe, from South Africa to
Portugal. What is the Hicks eye seeing which the Lane Fox eye is too dull to
imagine?
Part of the answer is green, clipped and formal. In the mid-1970s David
Hicks moved house to the sort of site which haunts my nightmares. The house
had no real garden and only a random wall or two in its vicinity. There were
no hills in the vista and no specimen trees. The prospect was a prairie in
all directions. In my mid-50s, I think I would have remained with carpets.
Not so David Hicks. He has grown to love gardening and to concentrate
professionally on his ideas of it. On site, he has thought big, humanised a
blank wilderness and brought life to a setting on Buckinghamshire's answer
to the Urals.
As we walked round the ground plan, I had a rare opportunity to measure
apparent maturity against the passage of time and so to put my nightmare to
rest. If you find yourself banished to a cornfield, think big, think green,
give yourself five years and plant palisades.
Palisades, I learnt, are not a smaller variation of the stockade at the
centre of Treasure Island. They are a neglected garden feature from
pre-revolutionary France which Hicks has cleverly revived for his main
vistas.
In the foreground, you need to plant pleached trees the trunks of which are
kept bare to a height of 4-5 ft, while the upper branches are trained
sideways and clipped to make solid hedge. David Hicks opted for standard
hornbeams from Notcutts Nurseries of Woodbridge, Suffolk, and spaced them
about a yard-and-a-half apart. At first, he had them tied to tall stakes and
trained the branches on to plain wire between them.
Others have often done the same, but pleaching becomes palisading if you add
a second row behind the pleached trunks. You have to plant a hedge of the
same variety and clip it as a background to the trees so that it fills in
the gaps between them. After three years, results were beginning to show;
after five years, they were hardening. Now, after 15, palisades of
formally-clipped hornbeam line and define the main view in a flat garden,
giving it a charming style.
Palisading may sound grand, but it rests on a principle which gardening
books ignore. Hedging plants do not have to be set out in single or double
lines. Small clusters of them can be clipped into cubes, low buttresses, or
backing and filling. These uses do not require long views and broad acres.
Elsewhere, David Hicks repeats the idea in an area which is scarcely 10
yards square. Here, the central trees are the dewy willow (salix irrorata)
which are trained on much narrower trunks to a dome of wire through which
their upper branches grow and form a grey-green hat. Yew, choisya or (my own
favourite), the shiny Osmarea will then grow on to make buttresses and fill
in the gaps between the tree trunks. These touches of formality can be
scaled down to give style to much smaller plants.
Around the new palisades run the David Hicks avenues in which miscellaneous
trees are trained so as to arch into a tunnel on supporting hoops. Here, he
has some advice from experience. The hoops must be made of metal: modern
black plastic substitutes are useless because they cannot support the weight
of a closely-clipped frame of trees. By his own mistake he has learned that
these archways should be as wide as your pocket can afford.
By now, we were into the swing of it and the designer's vision took wing in
words. On either side of the clipped palisade run long strips of unmown
grass, allowed to grow to their midsummer height. They are not an economy.
In Hicks' view, too few gardeners can distinguish between their lawn and a
golf course. Down the Hicks fairway, therefore, run these patches of
deliberate rough which lead up to the arable prairie and the horizon. Did he
not feel at risk to the taste of surrounding farmers, presenting him with a
grain-dryer, maybe, or a shed for deep litter chickens? Not in the least, he
assured me: 'We own the surrounding 1,500 acres.'
We turned past a new gazebo, beautifully built in a subtle mixture of
designer cement and good old pebble dash. Keystones mark out the corners,
and round windows a builder has draped ribbons and swags in artful concrete.
It wins my award for the prettiest new garden building this year: what, dare
I ask, would it cost? It began as a birthday present, acquired a budget of
Pounds 20,000, but ended up as several presents in one.
Behind the cement gazebo, flowers took a segregated turn, in a walled
enclosure where borders of old roses waved to each other on the usual stakes
and frames. Beyond them, down a separate vista, the Hicks eye has bought a
post-modern touch to container gardening.
Circling around, we reached the other main vista from the house, framed by
an ingenuously-chosen hedge of horse chestnuts, clipped into a wall about 20
ft high. Beyond it, a big avenue of yet more chestnuts extends the theme far
into the estate. In front, he has put a narrow swimming pool with dark,
mottled walls which rebukes those of us who follow the marketing ideals and
sink a liner pool in a brilliant shade of Californian blue.
As the vistas opened, so did their owner's enthusiasms. No, he had no time
for variegated leaves: they are as vulgar as bi-coloured cars. Yes, he had
deliberately planned a series of gothic points of emphasis but 'when I say
gothic, I mean gothic: I do not mean gothick with a k'
By now, I was admiring the vision of it all. At the tennis court, I learned
another trick. Outside the court's wire surround, a second surround had been
spaced about three yards away and climbers had been grown up it to make a
covered walk round this potential eyesore. What, though, were these climbers
which were not only growing but flowering their heads off in a robust shade
of carmine red, a riot of single-flowered rambling roses?.
'I have to have them,' their owner explained, 'because I grew up with them
years ago in Essex.' Essex Man turned designer? He rather liked the notion.
Faced with an English rose, even Essex Man loses his insistence on the
principles of green, straight and narrow.

Alstroemeria Ligtu hybrids A beautiful race of herbaceous plants originally
occurring from an accidental cross between alstromeria ligtu and A
Haemantha. They produce, on 3ft stems, clusters of small, lily-like flowers
in various shades of pink, salmon and orange. They grow from rather fleshy
roots which, when established, run about fairly freely though not
sufficiently so to become a nuisance as the common, orange flowered A
Aurantiaca frequently does. They are best raised from seed in pots in
spring, over-wintered in a frame or cool greenhouse and planted outdoors the
following spring in good, well-drained soil and a sunny position. The roots
can be protected in winter with a covering of peat or coir.

WHEN I tried to buy a scarce hardy geranium recently I was told that I could
not have it until after the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, a small
example of the importance which nurserymen now attach to this international
exhibition to be held next week from July 9-12.
The show was an immediate success when it was launched by British Rail's
Network South East in 1990. Last year it was joined by the Royal National
Rose Society and the British Rose Growers Association which are again this
year occupying a large marquee for the British Rose Festival.
An entirely new exhibitor this year is the National Council for the
Conservation of Plants and Gardens, which will have 31 of its collections on
view, the first time that the NCCPG has exhibited on such a scale.
Show gardens for Hampton Court are specially chosen and this year there are
to be 34 of them, including five for Aquatics Village beside the Long Water,
a canal-like lake that stretches almost to Kingston upon Thames. One of
special interest to the elderly is a retired gardener's garden made by City
Rural Landscape Services for the Gardeners' Royal Benevolent Society. It is
full of good ideas that are neither costly to make nor difficult to
maintain.
A second garden with a similar theme is being made by Robin Templar Williams
for Help the Aged. There is also to be a small garden by Cottage Garden
Roses featuring a new variety, Gloria Hunniford, which reminds me of a
favourite rose of half a century ago, Madam Butterfly, with shapely,
well-scented, pink flowers.
More fanciful in conception and execution is Paul Cooper's 'Crystal Palace',
a garden which uses glass and mirrors. Elevated pools allow fish and aquatic
plants to be viewed from below.
There are two gardens with a Japanese theme. One is by Keith Gott for Tatton
Park, the National Trust garden in Cheshire which has a very fine Japanese
garden. The other is by Inner London Landscapes and features a carp pool.
Look for the water garden with mature specimen plants and trees by Pantiles
Nurseries which specialises in large trees in containers.
Naila Green, of Green Gardens, south Devon, is making a garden entitled
'Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained' based on two circles, one planted with
twisted, thorny, poisonous plants and the other an oasis of green and white
around a bronze sculpture and a water basin.
BR is again making a garden based on a railway theme but it will be
completely different from those of the previous two years.
Midland Group and Courtyard Design have combined to make a romantic garden
called 'Then and Now' which includes a flamboyant example of the 1930s style
of garden contrasted with a modern garden.
Floral and other exhibits in the eight big marquees are bewildering in their
variety. Two new varieties of Ballerina apple trees are to be shown. These
are the varieties bred at East Mallon which restrict themselves to a single
main stem with short flower and fruit bearing side growths, without need for
any pruning. The search now is for better flavour and a wider range of
ripening times and these two newcomers represent steps in that direction.
Kelways of Langport has two new varieties of peony, the first really new
ones raised by this famous Somerset nursery for 60 years. Burncoose and
Southdown are coming from Cornwall with a big exhibit of exotic plants and
are expected to include some new lilies.
There are two national collections of hostas, one from Diana Grenfell and
the other from Mr and Mrs R Bowden, and there is to be a hosta exhibit from
Park Green Nurseries, which contains some strange names, such as Bright
Lights, Pizzazz, Great Expectations and Gene's Joy.
Squires Garden Centre promises Top Marks, the rose of the year, and is also
showing Strawberry Fayre and Julie Andrews. Rougham Gardens is bringing four
new delphiniums. New to me is the variegated apple blossom Promises by
Westdale Nurseries. One wonders what any apple blossom, variegated or
otherwise, is doing out in July. Stephen Bailey will be showing carnations,
Three Countries Nurseries will have pinks and Hollygate Nurseries will have
an extensive exhibit of cacti and other succulents.
The theme of the British Rose Festival will be 'Roses through the Ages' and
this will be reflected throughout the 36,000 square feet of the marquee
which is being arranged to an overall plan by the international designer
Keis van Driel. Several new roses will be launched including the Thomas
Barton Rose from French breeder Alain Meilland.
There will also be a competition to decide the best scented rose and the
national competitions for both amateur rose growers and floral artists. The
James Mason Memorial Gold Medal, for the rose that has given most pleasure
to rose growers, will be presented during the show.
Information: The show will be open to the public from Thursday July 9 to
Sunday July 12, from 10am to 7.30pm, except on the 12th when it will close
at 6.30pm. Admission is Pounds 12 for adults, Pounds 9 for senior citizens
and Pounds 6 for children, with reductions of up to Pounds 2 on tickets
purchased with a rail ticket. Tickets can be obtained in advance, Tel:
071-379-4444.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Property: An international penthouse view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN property company Metropolitan &amp; County bought the 200 large Edwardian
flats known as Bickenhall Mansions, in London's West End, it was unaware
that planning permission existed for further flats in the roof. On examining
that area it found there was enough room to build 35 penthouses with between
three and five bedrooms.
That was in 1986 and the last batch is nearing completion. They are on two
floors, with galleries and small terraces. Not many companies have the luck
to 'win' about 47,000 sq ft of space in this way - and this for penthouses
which have a cachet of their own. These units are offered from Pounds
750,000 to Pounds 1.3m (tel. 071-935-8510).
Penthouse prices vary with size and location but their pattern is similar
across the world, as a selection from the register of Sotheby's
International Realty shows. Most of these examples were built in the 1980s
and all are being offered by Sotheby's (tel. London 071-408-5196).
In central Athens, a penthouse occupying the whole ninth floor of its
building has views of Mount Lycabettus and the Acropolis. The salon has
glass walls and a wide balcony. There are three bedrooms and bathrooms and a
staff flat. The price, Pounds 575,000, is modest by penthouse standards.
In Charlottenburg, Berlin, a fifth-floor penthouse with four terraces is of
angular, modern design. The living room has pillars and a gallery.
Accommodation includes two bedrooms with bathrooms and a separate apartment.
Price: Pounds 875,000.
In Toronto, Canada, a penthouse condominium overlooking Balfour park and
with views to the skyline, is 10 minutes from the financial district. There
is a private lift to the 6,000 sq ft apartment which has silk
wall-coverings, marble fireplaces, oak-panelled library and study.
The formal area has a 600 sq ft entertaining room and a dining room with
floor-to-ceiling windows. There are five to six bedrooms and eight
bathrooms, plus a staff flat. Price: Pounds l97m.
In New York City, a two-bedroom penthouse at United Nations Plaza has
'wraparound terraces' and a full range of services. It is Pounds 1.63m
furnished. Another penthouse, on East End Avenue, has nearly as much terrace
space (2,500 sq ft) as living space (2,800 sq ft) for just Pounds 1.5m.
Washington Harbour in Washington DC, five minutes from the White House, is
described as a 'fanciful post-modern structure.' A penthouse for sale there
'with the most spectacular panorama in all of Washington DC' has 5,423 sq ft
of living space.
The octagonal entrance is 'finished with a jewelbox ambience, with 17 coats
of lacquer on its walls.' A gallery with windows overlooking the Potomac
river has steps down to a circular living room with domed ceiling and glass
walls. There is a master bedroom suite in one wing and a second suite in the
opposite wing. Asking price: Pounds 2.93m.
Equally lavish is a 25th-floor penthouse on the intra-coastal waterway at
Miami Beach, Florida. Its 10,000 sq ft interior includes 14 principal rooms
incorporating onyx, marble, Valverdi stone and ebony. The dining room can
accommodate 75 for a formal dinner and there are three entertaining
galleries. From the six terraces, there are views of the Atlantic, Biscayne
bay or the city skyline. Price: Pounds 2.37m.
So where did penthouses come from? Sotheby's Michael Bastian in New York
says: 'The history of the penthouse is pretty much the history of high-rise
 -an urban phenomenon.' The one on top was the best apartment with the least
noise, best sunlight and best views.
One of the most notable penthouses was built in New York in 1926. A woman
agreed to sell her townhouse if the builder would recreate it on top of an
apartment block. The result was a 54-room triplex (three floors) penthouse.

Properties for all tastes and all pockets

<TEXT>
MANY visiting Spain for the Barcelona Olympics (July 25 to August 9) or Expo
'92 in Seville (until October 12) will combine these events with a holiday
and see more of the country.
Plenty will use Spain's new EC-funded motorways linking its Mediterranean
resorts - and find the road journey much safer and more enjoyable than it
used to be. Some, tired of crowds, may explore the inland areas. After all,
there are 197,000 square miles of the country, with a population of only 38m
spread around it. A number may consider Spain for a second home. There are
plenty of smart new buildings and cut-price resales.
Some may want to view the results of the much-publicised activities of the
mayor of Marbella, Jesus Gil y Gil, in cleaning up the town, tearing down
buildings and planting hundreds of palm trees along the roads, at Pounds
1,000 a time.
Stories of his television interviews, given in a jacuzzi while wearing his
chain of office, do nothing to spoil the legend and may help sell apartments
being built by his company, on a plot running down to the Marbella
waterfront.
Los Cipreses del Mar consists of three blocks in the centre of the town. One
white marble confection has a vast marble and smoked mirror foyer. Security
is tight and seems to be run entirely by computers. There are pools, garage,
restaurant. Every apartment has a hi-fi system. The prices of the balconied
flats range from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 1m.
A more relaxed development is the Marina Puente Romano apartments adjacent
to the Puente Romano hotel. There are 234 units in three groups. Prices
start at Pounds 139,000 for a two-bedroom apartment. A duplex penthouse with
its own pool could be Pounds 700,000.
Such projects tend to be targeted at a specific market. This would suit
tennis buffs. It has 11 tennis courts and is next to the Manolo Santana
tennis club and buyers get free life membership of the club.
In the hills nine miles from Marbella, 400 plots are for sale in La Zagaleta
country club. Buyers will be able to build detached houses, and play golf on
an 18-hole course. There is riding, tennis, swimming, a heliport and a club
house, with lounges, bars, restaurants, glittering disco and a pavilion
suitable for large-scale entertaining.
The 2,000-acre estate was owned by Adnan Khashoggi, the arms dealer. The
sumptuously furnished clubhouse was one of his many homes. It is now in the
hands of the Spanish bank which repossessed it.
Hamptons International has just opened in Marbella, working with established
agent Barry Randal-Williams (London tel 071-493-0222; Marbella tel 861-909).
These three projects are on its books.
Along the coast, Bovis Abroad is having a sale. It is offering properties at
La Manga club, near Cartagena (a long-established golfing and holiday
resort), at prices reduced by up to 25 per cent.
A one-bedroom flat is available at Pounds 36,000; a two-bedroom villa with
pool, at Pounds 105,000. 'These are odds and ends we have left over,' says
sales director Charles Weston-Baker. (Bovis, London Tel 081-422-3488).
Above Alicante is Denia, a typical small Spanish resort. It is a cheerful
venue for package holidays in summer when its population swells from 28,000
to 150,000. On the edge of the town, looking into the hills, Bovis has a
compact development of terrace houses and flats. There are two swimming
pools. Prices start at Pounds 50,000 for a two-bedroom house or flat.
Expected high-season rentals: from Pounds 1,300 a month.
A glut of apartments in and around Barcelona will be on sale once the
Olympics are over and advance offers are being sought.
There are stories about blocks of flats in the city collapsing because of
defective cement. Britain's Building Research establishment was consulted by
Spanish authorities about this problem. Shaun Pilgrem, an architect with
British and Spanish qualifications practising in Barcelona, says the stories
are true, but the problem is localised and the authorities are dealing with
it. Others in the property world are less sure. Clearly professional vetting
of a property there would be wise.
What of Spain's little known regions? South of Seville there is the coast on
either side of Cadiz, the Costa de la Luz.
Home seekers might look at the estate of Atlanterra 90 minutes from
Gibraltar overlooking the largely deserted silver Atlantic beaches.
Civilisation in this southernmost tip of Europe is represented by the
village of Sahara de los Atunes, which boasts a four star hotel. Adjoining
it is the office of Ignacio Silva, who speaks English and handles sales for
the Atlanterra estate (tel 43-91-51). Normally, he says, the minimum total
price for a plot and a house built to your requirements is Pounds 240,000.
But there is one house available, right on the beach. The living room opens
on to the garden, swimming pool and sands. There are two bedrooms and
bathrooms in the house and two in a separate guest section. The property is
Pounds 682,500.
The holiday home hunter in a different price bracket might usefully explore
the rural villages inland from the Mediterranean coast. Many, like similar
areas in France and Italy, are becoming ruins as the young people leave for
the towns.
In his Overseas Homebuyer's Handbook, property expert Geoffrey Pilgrem
explains that few agents bother to offer such property partly because prices
are so low that it is not worth their trouble. In some areas whole villages
have been abandoned. Pilgrem suggests the valley and lake region south west
of Andorra.
He warns that there might be difficulties acquiring such a rural home and
'one needs one's hand firmly held.' Some people might see the abandoned
villages as 'spooky.' He sees the area as 'quite magical.'
One British agency that specialises in this corner of Spain is Bradley
Vaughan, in Haywards Heath, Sussex. (tel 0444-412551). It offers properties
for renovation from Pounds 8,000. But Pounds 15,000 might be more realistic.
Overseas Homebuyer's Handbook, David &amp; Charles, Pounds 13.99, 256 pages.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Motoring: Romeo stoops to conquer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALFA ROMEO, having peered into the abyss, is feeling confident about making
a comeback in Britain.
The new 155, which went on sale this week, has the ingredients of success.
It looks, goes and even sounds like a proper Alfa Romeo.
Starting with the traditional shield-shaped air intake, the 4-door body
rises like a wedge to a high boot lid. Aerodynamic efficiency is claimed to
be among the best in class and, hard lessons having been learned, corrosion
resistance has been built in.
Two engines are offered; the twin overhead camshaft, two plugs per cylinder
Twin Spark in-line four and a V6. The Twin Sparks come in 1.8 litre, 129
horsepower and 2.0-litre, 143 horsepower versions. The 2.5-litre, 166
horsepower V6 has been developed from the 3-litre engine used in the big
Alfa 164.
They are transversly mounted, driving the front wheels through a 5-speed
gearbox. Italian males being what they are, Alfa Romeo does not even offer
an automatic alternative. A turbocharged four-wheel drive 155, with left
hand steering only, joins the range in the autumn.
Pricing looks almost predatorily keen. All 155s have power steering,
electric front windows and sunroof, central locking and headlamp wash.
The 1.8 is listed at Pounds 13,700. Even the V6, complete with ABS brakes,
alloy wheels, climate control, power adjusted and heated front seats and
exterior mirrors, is under the Pounds 19,250 tax band at Pounds 19,050. A
similarly equipped 2.0-litre Lusso is Pounds 17,650.
Alfa Romeo is looking for conquest sales, mainly among under-40 year old
males.
It thinks the 1.8 Twin Spark could seduce present business users of Vauxhall
Cavaliers and Peugeot 405s. The 2.0-litre Twin Spark models (Pounds 15,100
and Pounds 17,650) are seen as alternatives to the Audi 100, the top of the
range Nissan Primera and BMW 320i. And for the V6, Alfa Romeo has the Rover
800 and Mercedes 190E in its sights.
A few days ago I drove a 2.0-litre Twin Spark and a V6 for over 300 miles
(500 kms) in Scotland. The roads varied from the M8 to narrow single tracks
with passing places on the remote Ardnamurchan peninsula.
Of the two cars, I preferred the 2.0-litre Twin Spark. True, it had less
muscle than the V6. But it rode much better on its soft, quiet and shock
absorbing Goodyear NCT2 tyres than the V6, sportily shod with lower profile,
higher speed-rated Pirelli P700s.
Allowed to spin freely on the gears, the Twin Spark's 4-cylinder engine
growled satisfyingly. The V6's exhaust note was just as authentically Alfa
Romeo. Though it would pull happily enough in traffic at low revolutions in
high gear, it enjoyed being given its head.
What can one say of performance nowadays without perjuring oneself or
putting one's head in the noose? Alfa Romeo claims, I am sure correctly, top
speeds of 128 mph (206 kph) and 0-60 mph (0-96 kph) acceleration of 9.3
seconds for the 2.0-litre, 134 mph (216 kph) and 8.4 seconds for the V6.
I found both cars nimble, well mannered and - can one say this of a machine?
 -enthusiastic.
Being tall, I have never been happy with the driving position in Alfa Romeos
of the past. The new 155 is no different. Alfa man is still reckoned to be
as long armed and short legged as a chimpanzee. With the well shaped and
pleasantly soft seat back as far as it would go, my right foot was still
bent at an acute angle though my arms were almost straight. But drivers
under 5ft 10 in (178 cm) tall are less likely to complain.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Sport: King William and Mary - Olympic equestrianism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITHE, loose-limbed and brave. 'Forward-going,' the horsey crowd would say.
One could apply the words equally to Mary Thompson or King William, the
chestnut gelding who carried her to victory in this year's Badminton
three-day event. Thompson's place in the British equestrian team for
Barcelona will be announced on Tuesday, and she is itching to get to Spain.
'I am just so looking forward to it. Can't wait. It's been my ambition to
ride in the Olympics as long as I can remember,' she said, sitting tanned
and T-shirted in the garden of her parents' home on the Devon-Dorset
borders. 'Badminton is the top of the tree for an eventer but the Olympics
has other magic.'
Thompson is still refreshingly besotted with her sport. 'When you're riding
cross-country, totally at one with your horse, who's going boldly and
quickly around a big track, the thrill is amazing,' she says. 'Powering on
towards the next fence with his ears right back. Nothing touches it.'
Eventing can be as dangerous as motor racing. Does she get frightened? 'Only
of spiders. I'm not too bad for nerves. My mother is a very calm, relaxed
woman and I think I've inherited an inner calmness from her,' says Thompson.
She lives in the family home, a modest cottage, rent-free with her father's
part-time work as church verger.
The village is as sleepy and pretty as any in England, a world away from the
equine intensity of Newmarket or Lambourn. The Thompson yard, complete with
hanging baskets, is a five-minute walk away. Half-a-dozen eventers,
including King William, are trained there by Mary and two women grooms.
'I love these hills,' she says. 'I've lived here since I was three. I don't
think I'd know how to get a horse fit on level ground. Whichever way you go
from the stables you go up or down 600 ft.' If a horse is balking at
water-jumps he spends time splashing around in the River Sid.
Thompson's family are neither horsey nor affluent, two usual precursors of
success in eventing. Her first riding was on a pony borrowed from the vicar
and it was only after Mary started to shine in local pony club events that
they scraped up the money to buy a horse.
'Mum and Dad haven't got any money and I so much wanted to event after I
left school but it just didn't seem possible. I rented the stable we now
have and did all kinds of jobs just to pay for it. I took in livery horses,
did a butcher's round, Hoovered old people's houses and cleaned the local
campsite loos. I even taught riding, although I now avoid it like the
plague. I can't seem to get people to understand me although I'll happily
school horses all day long.'
One thread in her success is an eye for a horse. She spotted King William, a
raw five-year-old with no known breeding line, and said: 'That's the one for
me.' She was offered Pounds 120,000 for 'Willie' before Badminton. That was
more than any event horse has sold for. He must now be worth much more.
Beyond price is the relationship between horse and rider. Equestrianism is
unique in the Olympics because the athlete depends on another sentient
being. There is no comparison with the role of a professional jockey who may
jet in from another continent to ride a horse he has never seen before.
'The link between horse and rider in eventing takes years to build up. It is
simply total trust. He knows what you're thinking and vice versa,' says
Thompson. 'He has to believe that the rider will only put him in a situation
that it's possible to get through. At that stage they will do anything for
you.'
She is 31, though she professes to feeling older after the stress of
Badminton. She led through the initial dressage section and had the two
fastest times around the slippery cross-country course, but had a
nerve-racking finale in the show-jumping. King William took exception to the
waterfall in the arena and Thomson had trouble directing him. His hooves
tapped many of the poles and it was a shaky finish.
'So often with bold and strong cross-country horses their show-jumping isn't
careful enough,' says Thomson, who admits to disliking the discipline.
'Willie does seem to be improving a bit, thank goodness. He is also becoming
very good indeed at dressage, which I like.'
The X-factor for equestrians at the Olympics is that this is primarily a
team event. The four riders in each team must put rivalries behind them and
go for team points. 'You'll be riding to orders,' says Thomson, 'The first
person out is usually asked to ride conservatively and that means you
probably forfeit your chance of an individual medal.
'But this is one of the few sports where competitors all share information
anyway. When you've come back from doing the track at Badminton, you'd
instinctively tell the other riders where the problems are, or if there is a
pothole at the waterjump. Perhaps it's trying to minimise the danger.'
In Seoul, the British team took silver. This time they are favourites for
gold. Thomson's strong voice trails away. She is so excited just going to
Barcelona that she doesn't want to think about winning.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Sport: The selling of an American dream - Olympic Basketball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE AN avalanche, the selling of the US Olympic basketball team threatens
to bury America's coverage of this summer's Barcelona games under a mountain
of hype.
It is still three weeks to the Olympic opening ceremony, so Americans have
yet to acquaint themselves with most of the sprinters, swimmers and cyclists
going to Barcelona. The same cannot be said of the basketball players. It
has been impossible these past six months to escape the deluge of publicity
about the 12 superstars chosen to go for gold in Barcelona.
During the recent professional basketball championship playoffs, the NBC
network, which is televising the Olympics, filled its coverage with
advertisements, interviews, flattering profiles and punditry about what
everyone is inevitably calling the 'Dream Team.'
The hype has included a truly offensive cartoon showing mountainous US
players stomping all over puny foreign opponents, jokey interviews with team
members (including one, Charles Barkley, who said: 'We better win the gold
medal, or else we won't get any more endorsement deals'), and endless paeans
to the achievements of the stars such as Earvin 'Magic' Johnson and Michael
'Air' Jordan.
There have also been acres of coverage in the press, and a blitz of
advertising by the team's 13 official corporate sponsors (among them
McDonald's, Quaker Oats and Visa) which between them will spend Dollars 40m
(Pounds 21m) boasting about their connection to USA Basketball. Millions
more will be spent by the makers of the sneakers and sports clothing the
players wear.
There has been little mention of the opponents the US may face, or of the
Dream Team's chances of success. This is because it is painfully obvious
that the US will walk away with the gold medal, no matter who they play.
In the past, the US has sent university players to the Olympics, where they
have usually won (nine golds out of 11 so far) with relative ease. In 1989,
however, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) voted overwhelmingly
to allow professionals into the Olympics. The idea was to improve the
standards of world basketball by allowing everyone to compete against the
best, yet it was accepted at the time that it would be years - decades,
probably - before any country matched the US depth of talent.
The Olympics will show just how wide the gulf is. In the last five Olympics
in which the US has competed, it has won 37 of 39 games. And that was with
college players, not the thoroughbreds who will play in Barcelona.
As Michael Jordan said to Playboy magazine recently: 'When you look at the
talent and the teams we're supposed to play against, it's a massacre. It
should never be close . . . Who's going to beat us? The Japanese? The
Chinese?'
Unlike other Olympic sports, where selections are made just before the games
to ensure the competitors chosen are those in the best form, the US
basketball team was named last September. The early start provided lots of
time to hype the Dream Team.
This was especially important to NBC, which paid Dollars 401m for the rights
to show the Barcelona games. At a time when sports has been bad business for
TV, NBC knows that the US basketball team will be the most popular draw this
summer.
The NBA - the most successful marketing organisation in world sport - also
stands to benefit greatly from the Dream Team. By cranking up the publicity
so early, it can spread more of the basketball gospel around the globe.
The glamorous US team will also help sell more of the merchandise that each
year brings in hundreds of millions of dollars to the NBA and its teams. As
the president of the NBA sponsorship and licensing agency said recently:
'This will be the most concentrated marketing exposure any national
governing board has ever received, for any sport.' If the early choice of
the squad was to give the hype-merchants a head start, the selection of the
players was also designed to make the job of the salesmen easier.
By any measure, it was the most marketable - not necessarily the most
in-form - players who were picked.
This explains why the US will be represented this summer by Magic Johnson,
who had retired from basketball because he has the HIV virus, and Larry
Bird, an ageing superstar whose bad back restricted him to a few largely
ineffectual appearances late in the season.
While the two have contributed hugely to the popularity of basketball in the
US, neither can remotely be described as among the best dozen current US
players. But both were obvious choices, on sentimental, as well as
commercial, grounds.
Even the selection of the token college player smacked of expediency.
Instead of picking the outstanding performer in the college game, Shaquille
O'Neal of Louisiana State University, the selectors chose Christian Laettner
of Duke University. In a squad already dominated by black players, the
colour of Laettner's skin (white) may have had more to do with his selection
than his skill, which is considerable, but some way short of O'Neal's.
Laettner, however, is just a member of the chorus line, as are most of the
others in the squad. The star, and the player the NBA hopes will sell
basketball to the world, is Michael Jordan, the most charismatic athlete in
US sport.
Like everyone else, Jordan knows what the Olympics mean to the bottom line.
Initially reluctant to give up his normal summer routine of all-day golf,
Jordan eventually agreed to join the team, no doubt aware that his presence
in Barcelona could prove rewarding financially. This year he is expected to
earn about Dollars 13m from corporate endorsement deals. This is a
conservative estimate. Include his involvement in the Olympics and the
attendant worldwide exposure, and Jordan's earnings could rocket.
Not surprisingly, everyone involved is hoping Jordan remains in good health.
As New York Times columnist George Vecsey wrote in a report on a recent NBA
playoff match: 'When Jordan tripped on a photographer and hobbled back on to
the court with a sprained ankle, one could smell the fear from the network
(NBC), the league (NBA) and the International Olympic Committee, for whom he
is the ultimate meal ticket.'
The key to why the NBA, NBC and the corporate sponsors riding the basketball
bandwagon so love the Dream Team is summed up in two words dear to any
businessman's heart: success guaranteed.
The US is going to win. Everyone knows it. Even better, the US is going to
be seen thrashing the best the world can put up. For a country that is
deeply unsure of itself, Olympic basketball will offer a comforting display
of US might. As one television commentator put it after the Dream Team's
ludicrous 79-point win over Cuba in the regional qualifying round: 'Those
who loved Grenada would love this.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / Sport: The mind of Seles vs the body of Graf - Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S singles final at Wimbledon between the top two women's seeds is the
perfect climax to an absorbing fortnight. Monica Seles, 18, of Yugoslavia,
the world champion, faces Steffi Graf, the 23-year-old German who is the
Wimbledon title-holder and was her predecessor as world No 1.
It is a battle for the world's premier title between the holder of the
Australian, French and US Open titles (Seles) and the golden grand slam girl
of 1988 - the two women who have dominated the world scene since the eclipse
of Martina Navratilova and the retirement of Chris Evert.
Graf has won five of her eight meetings against Seles, including a 6-0 6-1
fourth round victory at Wimbledon in 1989. But Seles was a frail 15-year-old
then, a matchstick, all arms and legs, who had just given Graf the scare of
her life in a thrilling three-set semi-final in the French championship.
I well remember that day in Paris, and could see what Steffi's father,
Peter, had meant when telling me three years earlier: 'I have seen a young
Yugoslav kid called Seles who hits the ball with two hands both sides - she
will be the one to beat.'
In those days, Monica was training under Nick Bollettieri at the American's
academy in Florida. Bollettieri realised that too much competition would
impose too great a strain on the growing girl and encouraged Monica to
perfect her early-ball attacking ground strokes in long sessions on the
practice court. When Graf again beat Seles in the Brighton final at the end
of 1989, a narrow 7-5 6-4 win on a fast indoor carpet, it had become
apparent that the double-handed teenager hit the ball harder than any of the
other leading players.
The following March, the family left Bollettieri because, they felt, he was
spending too much time with his other star pupil, Andre Agassi. Monica's
cartoonist father, Karoly, again became Monica's coach.
By May 1990, Seles needed no inducements to fire her ambitions. She had
grown a full 5 ins in 12 months and now, much stronger, was covering the
court with greater speed. In Berlin she beat Graf for the first time and
repeated the feat a few weeks later in Paris to win her first grand slam
title.
Last year, Graf enjoyed two successes against Seles - on hard courts in San
Antonio and on clay in Hamburg - as the two of them swapped the No 1 ranking
five times. Their rivalry was growing as the younger player finally usurped
Steffi's position in September by winning her first US Open crown. Four
months later Seles increased her lead in ranking points by claiming a second
Australian title in a tournament Graf was forced to miss because of illness.
As a result, their showdown in the French final last month was more than
routine. It was Graf's chance to prove that she had regained her full powers
after suffering from the effects of prolonged family problems surrounding
her father's private life.
What a match it was. The first set went to Seles in a whirlwind of powerful
two-fisted driving; the second to Graf as the German raised the level of her
counter-hitting. As the fluctuating 18-game final set built towards its
tail-twisting climax, with both players responding magnificently to ever
greater challenges, it became apparent that we were watching a battle
between two intense personalities, neither of whom could bear to admit
defeat.
Four times Seles was denied her win as Graf saved match points in the ninth
game. Twice Seles had to hold serve to keep her hopes alive as Graf surged
ahead 6-5 and 7-6. Then, when Seles at last broke Graf again to lead 8-7,
her own serve was ruthlessly dismantled by an opponent who found a new level
of ground stroke aggression.
Immediately Seles broke again with a grunting ferocity that was almost
frightening, and then served out to retain the title she held since first
beating Graf two years earlier.
Today, then, is a very special occasion. Graf is still smarting from the
Paris defeat (which she refuses to discuss), and secretly believes that on
grass she can at last lay the Seles ghost that her father had seen creeping
up on their ambitions all those years ago.
Graf's performance in beating Gabriela Sabatini in Thursday's semi-final was
impressive, light-years ahead of her stuttering win against the same
opponent in last year's final. Improved serving was the key. By creating
momentum at the start of the point, Steffi was able to fire her famous
forehand into the corners and could launch some well prepared net attacks.
She has her Swiss coach, Heinz Gunthardt, to thank for restoring
sorely-needed confidence in these crucial areas of her game. Seles, too,
came through her semi-final test with flying colours. In beating the
nine-times champion, Martina Navratilova, 6-2 6-7 6-4, Seles demolished the
doubts about her ability to cope with a rampant volleyer on fast grass.
Her return of serve was the key to her success because it never allowed
Navratilova to dominate in the forecourt. Her own serve, too, though not as
efficient as it had been in helping her through five matches without the
loss of a set, still presented problems, and her clinical despatch of
mid-court balls was as ruthless as ever.
In the tense closing stages the younger player's remarkable coolness and her
courage in going for risky winners turned the tables. The firmer courts this
year have provided a higher bounce than usual and make it possible for the
ground stroke artists to hold their own against the power servers, as Andre
Agassi has proved along with Seles.
It should be a fascinating confrontation. Graf is undoubtedly the finest
natural athlete in the game, while Seles has the sharpest mind. All will
depend on their ability to produce their best shots when it really matters.
Seles will attempt to apply the pressure on service return and from
mid-court. Graf will try to unleash her deadly forehand.
But unless Graf can keep her serves and drives really deep she will be
out-hit by the fiercest ground strokes the women's game has seen. Fasten
your seat belts. We could be in for a bumpy ride.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Mitterrand de Bergerac: James Morgan asks if the French
president's visit to Bosnia was really a triumph for German foreign policy -
As they say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG THE many events of European nostalgia week was President Mitterrand's
visit to Sarajevo on the anniversary of the assassination of Archduke
Franz-Ferdinand.
Fortunately he survived it, but in going to the Bosnian capital when he did,
he managed to destroy a tradition rather than recall one. It was the German
financial daily, Handelsblatt, that hit the nail on the head. 'This
demonstrative gesture underlines the fundamental change in a hundred years
of French Balkan policy. Mitterrand rebuffed the Serbs whom France has
supported for decades.'
It concluded that Bonn and Paris now stood shoulder to shoulder on the
Yugoslav question. There is a substantial body of feeling in the German
financial community, and which is reflected in the editorial politics of
Handelsblatt, that holds that Germany has danced to a French tune for far
too long. Clearly things have now changed.
The view elsewhere was that French foreign policy seemed to be returning to
what was hailed universally as panache and audacity. The Dutch paper, De
Volkskrant, cried: 'Hero Mitterrand in Sarajevo visit.' In France itself,
however, there was self-doubt.
Sud-Ouest wrote, 'Everybody, from his soul and his conscience, will admire
Francois Mitterrand's gesture, for his 'courage,' as our British neighbours
say, with that touch of irony which hints at the Gallic limitations of the
enterprise.'
The business paper, Tribune de l'Expansion, said: 'There is Cyrano (de
Bergerac) in all this. Abroad surprise outweighs admiration. Our European
partners can rightly wonder at an initiative taken in a full summit without
the slightest concentration.'
This is all a far cry from the not so distant past when any French
initiative would be greeted with Gaullist slogans about France fulfilling
her 'noble, global destiny' (it sounds better in French.)
So if Mitterrand was trying to recreate the past the attempt failed and to
many it merely provided evidence of how France had changed, not how she had
remained faithful to her traditions. To others it seemed a quixotic gesture,
almost irrelevant to the dreary world of concentration and harmonisation in
which western Europe lives today.
Struggling against this windmill was John Major. He gave an interview to Le
Monde on the occasion of the Lisbon Summit, British presidency et al, that
attracted no interest in Britain but was a rather skilful operation designed
to win friends and influence people in France.
He at least was not prepared to relinquish the realities of the old Europe
and he set about asserting the principles of a Europe of Nations. So there
came this passage: 'Look: no nation is more involved in the Community than
is France or Germany. Are the French any less French than they were 50 years
ago? Certainly not] Are the Germans any less German than 50 years ago?
Certainly not]' (My italics).
This is taking a taste for tradition too far, I feel. Most Europeans would
hope that the Germans had changed a bit since 1942. That, after all, is what
the European Com- munity is for.
Major also thought the British were just as British as they were then, which
may well be true. But by and large his country is not regarded as a lone
defender of civilised values these days, last month's images from Sweden of
bad English football and worse supporters have helped build up a picture
that is somewhat at odds with the traditional English view of themselves.
So the headline that appeared in Dagens Nyheter of Stockholm looked strange:
'Major loses battle for Sweden.'
In fact it turned out to be the Swedish view of the Lisbon Summit which,
apparently, was largely devoted to Swedish membership of the Community and
which will not come as soon as many Swedes would like.
The lesson from the Rotterdam paper, NRC- Handelsblad, was that the past was
past and it is no use repining. An editorial headed 'The strawberry dilemma'
began irresistibly: 'Straw- berries, those little kings of summer wrested
from the cold earth, are undermining Dutch labour ordinances.'
Once upon a time, 18,000 workers were recruited by the employment offices to
work as seasonal labourers in the strawberry fields of Limburg. This year 30
turned up. The same crisis has hit the asparagus crop too.
The trouble is that the rate for the job in the fields is lower than the
current level of unemployment benefit. So now there are thousands of Poles
queueing up to do the work and turn their guilders into millions of zloties.
But the paper continues, 'Poles are ready to pluck the strawberries and
store the asparagus but that cannot happen so long as the Minister of Social
Affairs says there are Dutch workers available to do the job.' But they will
not do it, so the strawberries rot.
The paper concluded there were two solutions, one involved cutting the dole,
which was impossible, the other - getting the Poles to do the work.
'But why should the Poles trek to Limburg in grotty buses and pay commission
to middle men?' The answer is to grow the strawberries and asparagus on the
plains of central Europe instead of in the Netherlands.
So this is the future for the new Europe. Politicians and industries can go
to the east, but the east must stay firmly where it is.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Travel: The old world of modern Iran - The sights of Iran
are impressive - but does anyone want to go there?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS spring in Iran, and you can imagine the poets hymning it. Roses and
plum blossom burst out against the dusty hillsides and pale blue skies,
while the snow melts into rivulets that combine into streams that water the
land.
As you head lower, farmers are ploughing rich brown furrows in the grey soil
and scattering seed. Wheat and rice start appearing. Land that looks too
poor to raise crops is grazed by sheep and goats, tended by boys with big
sticks.
Way down in south Iran, by the Gulf, the herds are heading higher as the
weather warms, with Kashgai nomads in attendance. Real nomads do not lead
the sheep but follow them, their possessions bundled on donkeys. We saw a
rare sight, a brightly-clad group riding camels; but today's preferred beast
of burden for the Kashgai is a Toyota pickup.
People have been travelling these roads, between east and west, for ever. On
the plain at Pasargadae, near modern Shiraz, Cyrus the Great overthrew his
Medean grandfather in 550 BC, the first step on the way to building the
first Persian empire. He beat Croesus of Lydia, who was promised by the
oracle at Delphi that if he went to battle he would destroy a great empire
(Croesus did, only to find it was his own empire).
Cyrus also conquered Babylon and earned everyone's admiration for his
generosity: he restored the old gods, encouraged religious and cultural
tolerance, and won glowing mention in the Bible for sending the Jews home
after their long exile.
Here, at Pasargadae, he was buried in a small, stepped building which looks
as if he was imitating the pyramids but had not realised the size of them.
Alexander the Great, another admirer although he spent much of his career
fighting the Persians, executed the underling who looted the tomb.
Cyrus's successor-but-one, Darius, moved his palaces to Persepolis and Susa
 -proper, walled, defensible cities, whereas Pasargadae was a nomad camp in
stone. The walls at Persepolis are decorated with neat bas-reliefs, as clear
and detailed as if they were carved yesterday, of long-gone subject peoples
bringing him tribute: Arachosians with goblets, Gandarians with bison,
Sagartians with a horse.
They had to prostrate themselves before the King of Kings; if they so much
as touched the royal carpet they were put to death. The Greeks were
disgusted by this oriental pomp, and Alexander burnt the palace after
capturing it.
Along the same roads, though, is the evidence that the Persians rose again
under the Sassanian dynasty. In 260 AD, King Shapur captured the Roman
emperor Valerian, and wanted everyone to know it. By Darius's tomb near
Persepolis, and at other prestige sites throughout Iran, are sturdy rock
carvings showing him humbling the hapless Roman. When Valerian died, Shapur
had him stuffed with straw and mounted in a temple, to keep alive the memory
of his victory.
Other Sassanians appear in similar self-advertisements, unhorsing opponents
in battle or being crowned by their chief god, Ahura Mazda - impressive,
inelegant stuff that has lasted through the ages, as it was meant to.
The following millennium of rule by Arabs, Seljuks, Mongols and Timurids
left monuments everywhere, pavilions and gardens and poets' tombs, but above
all in Isfahan, capital of the 16th-century Safavid kings. There are bridges
across the Zayandeh Rud river: one with 33 neat arches, another with steps
on the downstream side, where people sit in the sun on their day off,
supping a sort of ice cream made of rice powder and lemon sauce
(unexpectedly refreshing), and women, swathed from head to toe in the
standard black chadors, cruise round in pedalos.
Above all, Isfahan has mosques, with the bluest domes this side of
Samarkand. On the main Friday Mosque, the delicate 15th-century tilework
hides an older maze of brick pillars, arches and cupolas, which seems to
have just accumulated over the years.
On what used to be the Royal Mosque, and is now the Imam's Mosque, the
decoration is total. Four huge, arched rooms open on to a central courtyard,
and every one of them is awash, inside and out, with tiles, swirling foliage
patterns, geometric decorations and angular calligraphy.
Scholars grumble that this is all over the top, decadent, a rush job begun
in 1611 by the Great Sophy - Shah Abbas - to complete one end of the city's
great rectangular open space, the Maidan (which has smaller buildings in the
middle of the other sides, and two storeys of arches in between, and is
anyway so big you hardly know it is there).
Maybe. But I defy anyone to walk into this mosque and not be dazzled by the
overwhelming luxuriance of it all.
All this magnificence, though, raises the question of whether anyone is
going to go to Iran to see it. Its sights, natural and man-made, are as
exciting as those of, say, Mexico; but a decade of religious rule and Gulf
war have left Iran looking like a bad risk. Foreigners are, at best,
trickling back.
Understandably so. Our hotel in Tehran bore the words DOWN WITH THE USA in
letters a yard high over its front door; this was only partly offset by the
amusement park over the road with Mickey Mouse painted on the walls. Like
the French at Eurodisney, the Iranians are half-fascinated, half-repelled by
the Great Satan and his mouse familiar.
For all that, the people seem friendly. Children gawp and grin and say
hello, but unlike their counterparts in much of the Third World they do not
demand pens, sweets or money (yet). Some women were as eager to photograph
us as we were to photograph them. Anyone who speaks English will probably
try it on you.
Modern Iran has not, to be honest, many monuments to recommend it. Villages
are poor, mud-brick things. You can visit the ousted Shah's estate in
Tehran, gracelessly decorated; there was once a statue of him there but only
the boots, a yard high, are left. (The fabulous Peacock Throne, however, is
to go on public show again). Khomeini's tomb, also in Tehran, is the main
contemporary shrine: still unfinished, it looks like the Pompidou centre
inside, all its service ducts exposed.
There is no alcohol, and not much night life either, but you could try one
of the Houses of Strength, gymnasiums in which brawny young men work out in
unison while a leader plays a drum and chants the Shahnama, the Persian
national epic poem. It makes for an odd mixture of aerobics, juggling,
weight-lifting, dervish-whirling and recitation. At the end, the owner
thanks all his visitors from Inglestan and wishes them a safe trip home.
John Westbrooke travelled with Jasmin Tours. Tel: (0628)- 531121. There have
been no guidebooks for 20 years, although Lonely Planet has one in the
works. The old ones are wildly enthusiastic about how progressive and
popular the Shah was; Nagel's is the best of them. Bureaux de change and
film are often unavailable. Take a universal bathplug, a headscarf (if
female), a taste for rice, and some patience: Iranians are re-adjusting only
slowly to tourists.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Program your life - Computing /
Personal information managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN J BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the problems of modern life is keeping all the information you
require at your fingertips. The Filofax, or personal organiser, was a
possible answer to this dilemma. It was portable and it allowed you to make
notes, keep a diary and an address book all within one compact booklet. But
it had a great failing: it was difficult to cross reference the information.
I found that trying to retrieve the information I needed was a constant
headache. And, when re-organising my notes to make it more accessible,
invariably one side of the page had notes about one subject and the other
had information about some totally unrelated topic. Often I spent hours
rearranging the notes rather than using the time productively.
An increasing proportion of the working population now has a computer at its
desks, or a portable computer which they carry around. The Filofax is
becoming rather passe.
Computer companies make great play of the machines' ability to store massed,
structured data. A high proportion of computer software is designed for one
of four tasks: word-processing, database management, spreadsheets and
accounts. These are fine for manipulating large amounts of data, be it in
the form of word-processed documents, complex work sheets for repetitive
calculations, or information that can fit into a list structure. Until
recently, there has been little for storing, in a usable fashion, the
snippets of information we gather day-to-day.
Now, instead of a personal organiser resting on my desk my diary, address
book and notepad are kept within the computer. The type of software I use
has a generic team of personal information managers or, as acronym
assemblers will have it, PIMs. The advantage is the PIMs' ability to search
for character strings.
PIMs can search across the whole range of features. If you wrote a note in
your diary instead of the notetaker, the PIM will find it for you. Many also
offer direct links between diary schedules and notebook text. You may
arrange a meeting to discuss a particular proposal and enter it into the
diary section. A linked note to that diary entry may contain the agenda for
the meeting as well as more detailed information of the proposal.
PIMs are personal tools. They are designed to keep track of an individual's
personal store of information. A PIM can be anything from a simple notetaker
to a small scale project management package.
People use PIMs in very different ways. Therefore, the term covers software
packages which differ widely in the features they offer. Some might switch
to a PIM only occasionally and exploit it for little more than jotting down
random thoughts and noting telephone calls - others might keep the PIM
running all day as the main program they use on their computer. And, where
one person may use it to keep a record of his or her activities, another may
be using it for managing others.
These diverse uses have led suppliers to two competing strategies. At one
end of the spectrum are products which are complex but can be adapted to an
individual's particular needs. At the other end are packages deliberately
limited in their range of features. The approach of the latter is simplicity
of use.
The original PIM, Sidekick - released in 1984 - was a surprising success. It
offered users the chance to clear their desks of the paraphernalia of
day-to-day life and the ability to call up a diary, notepad, calculator and
address list with just a couple of keystrokes while still running the main
application. As soon as you had completed the Sidekick task you could drop
back to where you left off in the spreadsheet, database or word-processor
you were using. Sidekick has had many competitors since - many offering the
same facilities - and others which took a rather different formula for the
amenities they offered.
In the past couple of years there has been much written in computer journals
about the Windows Graphical User Interface (GUl). It has advantages beyond
the ease-of-use that is often mooted. These are well demonstrated where the
personal information manager is concerned. A PIM works best when it is
constantly available.
The Windows environment allows several programs to be available at the same
time. On more high-powered computer systems several programs can run at a
time - a facility called multi-tasking.
Microsoft Windows also allows graphics which duplicate such things as index
cards, calendars and even standard, six-hole, Filofax paper. By offering
applications which look similar to their paper-based forebears many software
producers hope to increase their market.
Another PIMs platform is the hand-held, or palm-top computer. Though not as
powerful as desktop or notebook computers they present a reasonable
alternative for lightweight everyday tasks. Most offer some form of note
input as well as the all-important searches. Many pocket portables offer
easy connection to more powerful desktop machines.
Any personal information manager only works as well as the data it holds. It
takes some initial effort to remember to enter each phone call and
appointment into the computer. But, once you have overcome this block, it
can pay handsome dividends.
Some PIMs work to their best only if they take over your life. Others are
quite happy to take advantage of any information given to them. From this it
follows that a PIM is not much use unless it does what you want and in the
way you want. As with all software the onus is on the user to select the
right package.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Launching a company with a little
'fringe lunacy' - Nick Garnett meets the creator of the modern amphibious
vehicle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT PROBABLY takes an Irishman to build something like this.' Well, Sean
Dooley-Power is Irish and he has built it.
A curious creature is his creation. As tall as a small house and looking a
bit Heath Robinson, like something made by sixth formers for a science
competition, the C-MAC amphibian nevertheless incorporates clever
technology. It can also transport 36 passengers at 35 miles per hour on land
and seven knots on water.
All Dooley-Power now has to do to make a business out of this curious beast
is to persuade potential customers to buy the four-wheel-drive machine. So
far, the venture, including building the prototype, has absorbed more than
Pounds 150,000 with no return. 'It has felt a bit like the loneliness of the
long distance entrepreneur,' Dooley-Power says.
Dooley-Power, a 37-year-old business-studies graduate, worked for the Ford
motor company, a merchant bank and a property company, married a Jersey
woman and moved to the Channel Islands.
A home-catering business provides the family with a regular income but
Dooley-Power wanted to be a different kind of entrepreneur. After helping to
design and build three old-fashioned amphibians for a Jersey operator he
started to plan what he claims is the first significant technical advance in
amphibious vehicles since the lorry-based landing craft of the second world
war.
'I've taken the concept where it was left back in 1945 and put in modern
design criteria, modern survivability demands and modern technology.'
Instead of a truck chassis with a propeller, Dooley-Power's tiny company,
C-MAC Industries, offers a boat with wheels. It incorporates a 200hp
air-cooled engine with power and steering in the water provided by
swivelling water jets. There is no direct mechanical drive between the
engine and the separate motors on each of the four wheel hubs. So there are
no metal components such as a drive shaft to suffer rust under water. The
bottom of the amphibian is just a flat box. The company has a patent on a
hydraulic mechanism which transfers power from one axle to the other as the
vehicle leaves or enters the water, creating greater traction.
So far, so good. But Dooley-Power has been forced to learn some pertinent,
if unsurprising, lessons about trying to start a business on the back of a
new product. The first lesson was that he had to build the vehicle. 'I
learnt that you cannot sell a concept off a set of drawings. No one wants to
know. I had to make a prototype.' This was even though the drawings were
made by a proven boat designer, Stan Goldman, whom Dooley-Power met at a
boat show.
The second lesson was that on a project like this, the banks will, in
unison, turn up their noses. 'I wrote to 26 banks and got nowhere. I also
tried 3i and they were dismissive. I was naive enough to believe that my
commitment to the venture would be good enough. Instead people start
thinking of you as a kind of Walter Mitty."
The funding for the project, says Dooley-Power, has come from Kevin Leech,
head of quoted company ML Laboratories, also a Jersey resident.
The backer has taken a 50 per cent stake in the company in return for
funding the Pounds 138,000 needed to build a prototype. This money includes
all the fees to obtain approval from Lloyd's Register for sea-going vessels
and the Department of Transport.
The cost was partly inflated by the need to use sub-contractors. The
aluminium-bodied amphibian was constructed by an engineering company in
Cornwall. 'What that means though is that my fixed overheads are kept down
to zero,' says Dooley-Power, whose hero is Joe Bamford, founder of JCB, the
earth moving machinery manufacturer.
Another lesson he is still learning is that luring customers usually proves
a hard slog. Dooley-Power has spent Pounds 20,000 of his own money on the
project, partly taken up by visiting potential customers overseas.
'We have proved the concept and the vehicle is virtually maintenance free
but nevertheless people always ask: 'How many have you sold?'.' Possible
customers include existing operators of passenger-carrying amphibious
vehicles to islands one or two miles from the mainland and operators wanting
an amphibious work boat, including oil companies using pipelines in swampy
terrain and local authorities faced with oil and algae pollution of ports
and beaches. The basic machine will cost Pounds 160,000 but a range of
different work platforms are offered as well as four-wheel steer.
Dooley-Power says the venture includes an element of 'fringe lunacy'. Being
immersed in it for the past few years has resulted in many a sleepless
night. But he is convinced there is a slot for the C-MAC. 'It is, though,
the ultimate niche market.' The machine has taken two years to complete. The
next year or two will decide whether it sinks or swims.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A stirring tale of Essex
enterprise - Suzanne Askham talks to two men who built a successful vending
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUZANNE ASKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIT BACK. Let me tell you the story of how Gary Klein has made a success of
selling millions of cups of coffee, such as the one you are about to drink,
to businesses in the Midlands and south-east England.
Thirteen years ago Gary Klein was selling coffee machines for a vending
company. He began to think, in the way of would-be entrepreneurs: 'Why am I
doing this for someone else, when I could be doing it for myself?'
A junior sales colleague, Steven Murray, shared his views. Together they
resigned from their jobs and founded Bru-Stir Services.
They planned to provide high-quality coffee products to offices, with the
added sweetener of good service.
'And that,' says Klein, 'is when our problems began.'
Initially, they operated from a tiny room in Klein's home in Essex. They
borrowed the small capital required - Pounds 3,000 - from Klein's mother,
and split the ownership of the company 70/30 in Klein's favour, paying
themselves little or no salary.
'I wouldn't go to a bank,' he explains. 'None would lend to me, I believed.'
Most of the capital was spent on stock - coffee, creamers, cups - and the
two partners proceeded to do what they knew best: selling.
Klein now realises that their sales background led to a peculiar crisis in
the first year. 'We had intended to sell table-top coffee dispensers (these
look like half-sized vending machines), just as we had been doing in our old
company, and have a few smaller brewing machines to fall back on for those
customers who didn't want to invest in such a big machine.
'But we quickly found we were getting much more business from the coffee
brewers, which turned our cashflow projections upside down.'
The problem was this: the big machines were supposed to sell for Pounds 400,
which would bring back cash quickly to Bru-Stir. But the more popular coffee
brewers were not being sold, but lent; the idea, borrowed from America, was
to let a client have a free brewer for as long as it continued to buy coffee
from Bru-Stir.
Although highly popular, it meant that Bru-Stir was spending about Pounds
150 per machine, and waiting perhaps 30 months before the coffee sold to
supply it, at a profit of Pounds 5 per box of coffee, finally paid for the
brewer.
The problem got so bad that the two cut their salaries from Pounds 100 a
week to Pounds 50, and Klein borrowed an additional Pounds 2,000 from his
mother. Ironically, the turnover for the first year up to August 1980 was a
healthy Pounds 38,800, but the profit was nil.
Murray decided to sell his shares back to Klein for a much-needed cash sum
of Pounds 2,000, but he continued to act as a partner. From this difficult
beginning the business grew slowly but sturdily - the machines began to pay
from themselves. In 1982, turnover was Pounds 131,500.
Bru-Stir moved into a small office in Islington, then a slightly larger one,
and, two years later, to bigger premises in Gants Hill, near Ilford, Essex.
The 21-year lease with three-yearly rent reviews was going for Pounds 3,500,
and for this, unusually, Klein approached his bank, National Westminster
Bank, for a loan. 'We had to sign personal guarantees. It was a real
performance.'
Staff were being added gradually, first a driver and an office worker, and
then more, to a current total of 46. The Gants Hill office proved too small,
because Klein's philosophy of organic growth - 'the business has to pay for
everything - and that includes the fleet of vans and cars, I don't believe
in contract hire; and we have never had a bank overdraft' - was finally
reaping profits.
In 1985 turnover was Pounds 417,000, and in 1986 it reached Pounds 782,000.
Coffee was making up about 55 per cent of the business, with teas, cups and
hygiene products responsible for the rest. From the total, Klein was aiming
for a return of at least 30 per cent.
In 1987 turnover passed Pounds 1m and Bru-Stir moved to its current spacious
property in Dagenham, Essex; 18,000 sq ft plus grounds. In a canny deal,
Klein bought the 105-year head lease with 21-year rent reviews for around
Pounds 140,000 on a bank loan. The company now pays Pounds 15,000 a year
rent - less than its rates.
Credit control is successfully dealt with in-house, and Bru-Stir is now
concentrating on better marketing and advertising, particularly on its own
brand of coffee, Noble Tree, which was launched in January this year.
Turnover in 1991 was Pounds 2.8m, and the growth looks set to continue.
Murray has bought back 10 per cent of the shares. The company has set up an
office in Nottingham, taking over a failed concern, and is open to more
acquisitions.
'I believe the best thing in a recession is to grow, so you're not too lean
when it's over,' says Klein. 'But we'll never do it by spending more than we
can afford. I like to sleep at nights.'
He is not the sort to let coffee keep him awake.

MY brother-in-law died in November 1984 and another brother-in-law and I
were named executors. My co-executor died in June 1990. I have the complete
record of the liquidation of assets and the final distributions which were
made according to his will. The benefactors were all family members.
The beneficiaries have gained their inheritances and no query is expected.
How necessary/desirable it is for me to continue to hold the records? They
are somewhat bulky and I would prefer to dispose of them.
We think that you should retain all documentation until at least six years
after completion of the administration of the estate. If the final
distribution was made in 1985 you could consider disposing of the documents
now - otherwise you should wait longer before doing so.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): CGT on legacies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PERSON died two years ago and left a substantial legacy mainly in private
company shares - the valuation of which is still under negotiation with the
Inland Revenue.
Aside from inheritance tax on the estate which as residuary legatee I am
liable to pay, are capital gains tax also involved, viz: any gain from a 31
March 1982 base point and whatever the decided valuation is at the person's
death on the shares I inherited.
Also, about a year ago, I gave a nephew a small parcel of shares in the same
unquoted private company - will I be liable for capital gains tax on these
from 1982 or from eight years earlier when I first had them?
1) No: Capital gains tax on death was abolished in 1971.
2) You are deemed to have acquired the shares on the day of the previous
shareholder's death, at the value which is ultimately agreed.
Ask your tax office for the following free pamphlets: CGT14 - Capital gains
tax: an introduction, CGT16 - Indexation allowance: disposals after 5th
April 1988 and IR45 - What happens when someone dies.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): A forced share sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WORK for, and hold shares in, an unquoted company. Recently, when I asked
to transfer some more of my shares into my wife's name (she already holds a
few), the request was turned down simply because I had recently refused to
sign a letter stating that should I leave the company for reasons other than
retirement or illness, I would offer my share for sale. I consider this an
unreasonable restriction.
Thus, as I doubt that I can force the company to register the transfer - can
I make some sort of declaration, which would be accepted by the Inland
Revenue, that I consider my holding in these shares to be in joint names,
thus reducing the taxation burden on the dividends and CGT on any sales?
A solicitor could draw up a declaration of trust, saying that you hold
certain of the shares in trust for your wife absolutely (not jointly because
of the anti-avoidance legislation in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988, as amended), but there may be a problem if you predecease your wife.
If you want to pursue this possibility, send the solicitor a copy of a
company's memorandum and articles of association, so that he or she can
check the restrictions on transfer and any pre-emption rights.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Capital gains and Polly
Peck
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE recently received a Polly Peck International report to the creditors
dated May 25 1992 in which it says 'confirmation has now been received from
the Inland Revenue that PPI shares can be treated as of negligible value
from 7 May 1991. Accordingly shareholders may make negligible value claims
for the tax year 1991/92.'
As I was not informed of this fact before April, I only took Pounds 5,500
capital gains from my share sales to keep within the exemption limit. If my
loss of Pounds 4,000 on PPI must be taken in that tax year I will still not
be liable to tax as my gains would be Pounds 1,500 of the losses.
If I had been informed before April 1992 I would have taken Pounds 9,500
capital gains tax free.
My question is: can I claim that my PPI shares became of negligible value in
the tax year 1992/93, thus allowing me to make Pounds 9,800 capital gains in
the present financial year without being liable to CGT?
If not, I feel that I have been cheated out of using my PPI loss by not
being informed before 5 April 1992.
It is a pity that you have missed all the published replies about negligible
value claims in our columns over the years. You would have known that the
answer to your question is 'yes', and you would have been spared much
anxiety.
On April 1 1993 or the next day or so, (not before April, but in time for
your letter to reach the tax office by April 5) you should write to your tax
inspector along the following lines:
'In accordance with section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992, I claim that the value of my holding of . . . Polly Peck International
plc shares has become negligible, namely one penny, and that I should
therefore be treated as though I had sold that holding for that sum today,
April 1 1993, and had immediately reacquired it for that same sum in
circumstances falling outside section 105(1) of that Act.
'Please let me have your decision on this claim within 30 days.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The frown on the face of the tiger -
Investing in . . . Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROAR of South Korea, one of the Far East's four tigers, has been
subdued.
Along with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, South Korea was one of the Far
East economic miracles which showed that countries could industrialise on
the strength of their exports.
An average 13.6 per cent growth in the volume of exports between 1980 and
1988 led to gross national product growth averaging 9.2 per cent during the
same period. The Seoul stock market index had an impressive rise, increasing
from 127.3 in 1982 to 909.7 in 1989, according to figures from Goldman
Sachs.
Since then the picture has been different. The market hit its lowest level
in almost five years last week with the index down to 559 - a drop of more
than 40 per cent in the past three years - in spite of the intervention of a
government stock market stabilisation fund.
'Korea has been a very sorry market since April 1989,' said Michael Watt,
investment manager of Touche Remnant's Pacific Investment Trust, which has
ranked consistently highly in the Far East excluding Japan sector. The Korea
weighting in the fund has been halved since 1989 to only 6 per cent today.
The main problem has been the erosion of South Korea's international
competitiveness in the last five years, caused in part by a jump in wages.
Industry prospered on cheap labour but, with the introduction of full
democracy in 1987, organised labour grew, leading to strikes and pay rises
as workers tried to keep up with higher consumer prices and climbing housing
costs. Inflationary pressure was fuelled by an expansion of the money
supply. The recession in the US, the main export market for Korean goods,
did not help.
Nevertheless, the economy is one of the world's fastest expanding, with an
expected growth rate of at least 7 per cent this year following a gain of
8.4 per cent in 1991. It still has to bring down inflation - currently about
7 per cent - and to deal with the steep interest rates and a trade deficit
of Dollars 8.7bn last year.
These obstacles make it difficult for Hugh Young, managing director of
Abtrust in Singapore, to be positive about Korea. 'The market has a lot of
problems with the level of corporate debt. So far this year we've seen 11
quoted bankruptcies. The level of bankruptcies is well up in the hundreds.
This is all due to corporate debt levels - a gearing of five to one is not
uncommon,' he said.
But many fund managers are optimistic and see potential attractions in Korea
for the private investor.
Save &amp; Proper has chosen this month to launch a single country Korea onshore
unit trust. Qais Zakaria, manager of the fund said: 'We understand the
negatives but we are anticipating a pick-up in 1993 based on a recovery in
the world market. The Korean market is not attractive now but it is better
to launch early in order to pick up stocks cheaply.'
Julian Tregoning, director of Save &amp; Prosper, underlined the risks and said
the Korea fund would carry a warning that it should only form part of an
investment portfolio but, 'taking a 10 year view we believe that the Korean
economy will be second only to Japan, with China as the unknown factor.'
Foreign interest in Korea was stimulated in January and February by the
opening of the market to direct foreign investment. This led to a brief
rally.
However, Jeremy Hill, chairman of the Schroder Korea Fund, launched last
December to take advantage of the new regulations, described the opening of
the market as 'very disappointing'. 'By the time the government opened up
the market, the economy was in retreat and the stock market had fallen and
is still falling,' he said.
He too believes the longer term outlook is quite different. 'We're bullish
looking to a year or so. Korea is tremendously dynamic and the basic economy
is strong. Its problems, such as labour shortages are really those of
success. In the short term there is a lack of confidence and an overhang of
stock in the market which should get worked through with time.'
The government is lifting the 10 per cent limit placed on foreign ownership
of shares to 25 per cent, and has allowed foreigners to acquire an 8 per
cent holding in either Pohang Iron &amp; Steel or Korea Electric Power
Corporation. The two companies account for almost 13 per cent of total
market capitalisation.
Collective funds, in Korea only or in the Far East as a whole, offer the
safest way into the market. Unit trusts had been hampered by regulations
until March this year, when the Securities and Investments Board added Korea
to its approved securities market for unit trusts, removing the 10 per cent
limit on participation in an unapproved market.
Peter Irving, fund manager of Schroder's Korea-Europe investment trust,
says: 'The arguments in favour of Korea are long term; 1993 and 1994 could
be good years if there is a worldwide recovery but 1992 will be unexciting
as the stock market digests the implications of a slower economy.'
Sectors which are expected to do well are export-oriented, low cost high
technology producers, such as Samsung Electronics, which has an
international reputation in the semi-conductor business.
Watt also singles out service companies such as Korea Mobile Telephone
Corporation. The smaller companies sector, which has performed well over the
past 18 months, has fallen out of favour with managers.
Watt says he will be increasing the exposure of the Pacific Investment Trust
to Korea later in the year. 'Company ratings have come down to sensible
levels. The stock market is highly geared, so under the right conditions - a
rebound in company profits and a good world economy - the market in Korea
could double. That is by no means impossible over three years.'
These contingencies make it a market reserved for what he describes as the
'highly specialised and affluent investor.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: FED tax rule changes - Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN

<DATELINE>
   NO-ONE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and that includes the Inland Revenue - seems to understand exactly how the
foreign earnings deduction (FED) is supposed to work.
The latest set of changes to the rule means yet more administrative hassle,
but also offers the prospect of substantial refunds for some.
Under the rule, enacted 18 years ago, employees who do their job wholly or
partly abroad but are not absent long enough to achieve non-residence may be
entitled to a deduction of 100 per cent for tax purposes from their foreign
earnings. This is Revenue-speak for saying these earnings will be free of
all UK tax.
This could happen, for example, if your employer seconded you overseas from
May 5 1990 to January 5 1992. This absence does not exceed a complete tax
year, so you would remain UK resident and ordinarily resident throughout.
To qualify for a FED, you must spend 365 days or more working full-time
wholly outside the UK, during which you would have to ensure that your UK
visits did not exceed either 62 consecutive days nor one sixth of the days
in the period during which you are overseas. Greater limits apply to
seafarers.
The process is quite simple if you have spent an entire tax year (from April
6 one year to April 5 the next) out of the country, but gets very
complicated when used to calculate tax liability for long stays out of the
country which straddle two tax years.
The FED applies to people, such as company directors or airline pilots, who
become resident because they perform duties of substance (in other words,
not just duties incidental to those which they perform overseas) in the UK,
and have maintained a home there.
The Inland Revenue intimated last November that it had been applying the
rules incorrectly in certain respects. The changes, effective from April 6
this year, will have adverse results on the taxability of terminal leave pay
received by those who had previously been UK non-residents.
And earlier this month, the Revenue made clear that yet more changes are in
hand. These relate to the level of overseas earnings to which the FED
applies. Should it be the gross earnings or the net earnings after deducting
items such as capital allowances, contributions to employers' superannuation
schemes, travelling and other expenses?
The answer, we are told, is that the law intended it to apply to the net
figure and, indeed, the Inland Revenue has consistently applied it on this
basis. Unfortunately, it now accepts that following an unintended change in
the law in 1984, this treatment has been incorrect.
If your pay is excluded from liability for a complete tax year, it makes no
difference which basis is applied. So, if your salary is Pounds 60,000 a
year and you pay employers' pension contributions of Pounds 9,000 a year,
the result is the same whether you receive FED on Pounds 60,000 or relief
for your pension contributions of Pounds 9,000 and FED on Pounds 51,000.
But it matters a great deal for the broken tax years of departure and
return. So, if the same figures apply to the May 1990-January 1992 absence
mentioned earlier, the first 10 months of your salary for 1991-92 would be
fully covered by the FED, leaving the full Pounds 9,000 annual pension
contributions to be set off against the taxable Pounds 10,000 salary for the
last two months. The position for 1990-91 would be similar.
By contrast, if a net basis is applied, the calculation for the first 10
months will be: salary Pounds 50,000 minus pension contributions Pounds
7,500 = Pounds 42,500 minus Fed Pounds 42,500.
No pension contributions could be carried forward from this period, so the
two months salary which was taxable would attract relief only for the
contributions in those months, that is, Pounds 10,000 minus Pounds 1,500 =
Pounds 8,500.
To correct the situation, a new clause has been tabled to the summer Finance
Bill. This makes it quite clear that from April 6 1992, the net basis
applies.
You can only be certain of a right to re-open assessment for the years
1990-91 and 1991-92 although it may, in some circumstances, be possible to
go back further.
So if in the recent past you have benefited from the FED for part of a tax
year, you would do well to get out your old papers to see if you are
affected. If you are, you could be entitled to a substantial refund of the
tax you have already paid.

jackdaw - Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson on his mania
for collecting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
and profitable.
When I was a small boy I used to hunt through my money, looking for a
valuable 1933 penny. I even became the school money-lender, giving up lunch
so I could lend my five shillings-per-week dinner money to other pupils.
Interest was levied at a weekly rate and people were encouraged to pay in
copper coins, just in case there was a rare coin among them, although I
would also accept foreign coins, postage stamps, toys and anything else I
thought I could re-sell at a profit or which I felt was worth saving in the
hope that it would appreciate in value.
Thus began my fascination for collecting, although (apart from a few postage
stamps) I have long since disposed of my schoolboy possessions and I never
found a 1933 penny in my change.
The attraction of owning a British 1933 penny was that only seven or eight
were ever produced and several are in museums.
In November 1985, at a coin auction held by Spink and Son in London, I
achieved my schoolboy dream and acquired a 1933 penny in extremely fine
condition. According to one coin collectors' catalogue (not produced by
Spink) which I had looked at prior to the auction, a 1933 penny had sold in
1980 for Pounds 28,750 and a similar coin, but in extremely fine condition,
was supposedly worth Pounds 50,000.
I was therefore overjoyed at 'only' having to pay Pounds 17,250 for my 1933
penny. But a 10 per cent buyer's premium was added to the price, plus VAT on
that premium, bringing the total cost to Pounds 18,975. It still seemed to
represent a good investment - but what do you do with a penny coin?
A rare coin is easy to flee the country with if there is ever an obnoxious
government but, unlike a painting, a coin cannot be hung on a wall and it is
not exactly beautiful to look at. If I touched it too much with my bare
hands I might accidentally scratch it and thus reduce its value, so it had
to be kept in a Perspex container. Then, with an increase in burglaries in
our area I thought it was best to keep it in a safety-deposit box at a bank.
All this is very boring. I visit my coin about three times a year but the
thrill of ownership has rather worn off. I suppose owning a 1933 penny is a
bit like climbing Mount Everest - it was an exciting challenge and a thrill
to gain the peak, but after that everything else seems a bit disappointing.
Fortunately, the coin has increased in value and I am now considering
selling it.
Another investment whose attractions have rather dimmed is my wife's title
of the Lord of the Manor of Westleton Grange, which I bought for her as a
surprise Christmas present in 1986. Westleton Grange is in Suffolk and the
title was at one time held by the third Duke of Norfolk, whose niece was
Anne Boleyn. Over the years, the title passed to various people, including
Sir Harbottle Grimston. In 1955, the title was sold for Pounds 350. It was
re-sold for Pounds 1,025 in 1966 and I acquired it at auction for Pounds
7,000.
There was considerable interest in such titles in 1987-88 when the average
price went to Pounds 9,000-Pounds 13,000 but prices for ordinary lordships
are now back to 1986 levels.
However, one of the attractions of the lordship of Westleton Grange was that
it came with a small collection of ancient documents, including the court
book of 1689-1777.
I suppose if we lived in Suffolk the lordship would retain some of its
appeal but my wife is Chinese and would prefer a simpler title. So she is
now considering selling it - either at one of the regular auctions which are
held for such titles or by private treaty.
Over the years, my attitude towards collecting has changed. Unless the
object concerned is of sentimental value, or pleasant to look at, then I am
prepared to sell it.
Sentimental objects include a deceased aunt's medals, including a Royal
Victorian Order. Every time I look at it I am reminded of her kindness and
how, when I was a young boy, she used to regale me with tales of her work at
Windsor Castle. I would never part with my aunt's medals.
Nor would I dispose of my own modest collection of white Chinese jade. It is
beautiful to look at, and to feel, and the carving is exquisite. Just to
hold a delicate carving of a peach - a symbol of long life - is to be filled
with a sense of peace and tranquility. That, to me, is worth much more than
its increase in value since its purchase.
However, insurance means that valuable items have to be held by the bank.
Larger items, such as paintings and sculptures, which I collect, cannot be
kept in a safe. But I only collect modestly-priced works by living artists
and the works I own are all easily identifiable and so would be hard to sell
by a thief. And who (apart from my wife who bought it) would want a John
Bratby portrait of me?
Every year I visit the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition but in recent years
some artists - particularly those accepted for the first time - have been
asking rather too much for their work so I have refrained from buying at the
exhibition.
Instead, I buy the small, green Royal Academy catalogue which lists all the
exhibiting artists' addresses. If I like a particular artist's exhibited
work I wait until the euphoria of the exhibition has worn off (usually after
six months) and write to the artist concerned asking if he/she has any other
works for sale.
The responses are usually encouraging and it is often a real delight to meet
them and to see their studios - and quite often their works can be acquired
direct at modest prices. It also cuts out hefty commission payments to
commercial dealers, some of whom have been known to charge 40 per cent.
Whether anything I have collected will prove to be of tremendous monetary
value is probably for a future generation to discover: but for people
wanting to make genuinely long-term investments, while gaining pleasures for
the eye, collecting works of art has much to recommend it.

<TEXT>
HOMEOWNERS who are finding it difficult to meet their mortgage repayments
may be considering letting out a room in their house.
But they should be aware that this will have an effect on their house
contents insurance cover. 'Most insurance companies will restrict theft
cover and delete accidental damage cover when paying guests are living on
the premises,' said Clive Longhurst, of the Association of British Insurers.
The government has given a tax incentive to those considering renting out a
room by adding a new clause to the Finance Bill which is expected to pass
through parliament later this month.
The rent-a-room scheme would allow people to let out a furnished room for
Pounds 62.50 a week before becoming eligible for tax. The relief is
available to individuals for their only or main home and will apply to gross
rents, up to a limit of Pounds 3,250 for any tax year. It will take effect
from the current tax year.
If the rental income is more than this amount, homeowners face two choices:
they can either pay tax on the excess, without any separate tax relief for
allowable expenses, or they can calculate profit from letting a room and pay
tax on the profit.
Legal &amp; General is warning those who want to take in lodgers that house
contents insurance cover will be restricted because 'people staying in
short-term rented accomodation do not have the same incentive to take care
of the property as the owner does,', according to the company's Rod Young.
Like most insurers, it will withdraw cover for theft unless clear evidence
can be given of a break-in. You would not be covered if the lodger stole
from you and cover for malicious damage by the lodger would also be removed.
Similarly, if the homeowner had accidental damage cover, this would also be
withdrawn, although in most cases Legal &amp; General will refund the remaining
cover for the year.
It says that that cover cannot be restored through payment of increased
premiums because that would have the effect of endorsing the homeowner's
ability to judge who would be a good lodger.
If you are considering renting out a room, you must inform your insurer in
order to know how your cover is affected and inform the lodger that his or
her possessions are not covered by your home contents policy.
Other sensible measures are to take up references from prospective lodgers
and to ask for a deposit to be repayable when they leave. It is also a good
idea to use a formal agreement for letting.
Lloyds Bank is launching a telephone insurance service from Wednesday.
Insurance Direct will provide on-the-spot quotations for buildings and
contents insurance. Two policies are available: Value Cover Standard, which
offers basic cover and Value Cover Plus which includes accidental damage
cover. Premiums are based on postcodes and the number of bedrooms in the
house, with contents covered up to a maximum of Pounds 30,000 on a
replacement-as-new basis. (Freephone 0800-300820).

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pensions, the best of both worlds -
How to increase contributions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANT TO have your pension cake and eat it?
Pensions come in two varieties - occupational schemes, run by employers, and
personal pensions, managed by independent fund managers or insurance
companies. As a rule you have to decide between the two.
The normal way to boost your pension if you are a member of an occupational
scheme is to take out an Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC). These can
be free standing contracts, or schemes offered by your main pension plan.
But they do not allow the same flexibility as a personal pension. So if the
special circumstances in which a personal pension and a company scheme can
be run side by side apply to you, it pays to investigate further.
Where bonuses and overtime are not included in the employee's pensionable
salary under the main scheme, they can be used to pay AVCs or FSAVCs
(Free-Standing AVCs). Also, the taxable value of fringe benefits can be used
for FSAVCs. The contribution limit is 15 per cent for both main scheme and
FSAVCs, subject in some cases to the earnings cap.
Unlike a personal pension, you cannot take tax-free cash from a FSAVC - all
of the proceeds must be put into an annuity. The same applies to AVCs
started after April 1987.
Also, the date at which FSAVC benefits can be taken is determined by the
main scheme rules. The only exception is where an employee has left the main
scheme and has stopped paying into the FSAVC, in which case the FSAVC
benefits can be taken at any time between the ages of 50 and 75.
For these reasons, a personal pension seems preferable to an AVC. However,
anyone contemplating an occupational and personal pension cocktail should
seek expert advice to make sure they are not unwittingly contravening Inland
Revenue rules. The Revenue monitors contributions strictly. In the case of
accidental over-funding the excess contributions normally are refunded, less
tax relief. But if over-funding was deliberate, hefty fines are common.
The contribution and benefit limits for occupational schemes are very
different from those applying to personal pensions. Under personal pensions
the maximum contribution is 17.5 per cent of relevant earnings (more for
older employees*) subject to the earnings cap, currently Pounds 75,000.
Under an occupational scheme employees can contribute up to 15 per cent
pensionable salary to build up a maximum pension of two-thirds final salary
subject, in some cases, to the earnings cap. Personal pension benefits can
be drawn from age 50, whereas the company pension must be drawn at the
scheme's normal retirement age - usually 65.
There are advantages and disadvantages with both schemes. Personal pensions
are more flexible and portable than occupational schemes. But company
schemes generally link the value of the pension to the employee's salary and
thus provide a better hedge against inflation than a personal pension, which
simply provides a fund at retirement which is used to purchase an annuity,
making it vulnerable to the health of the gilts market at the time you
retire.
Personal and company pensions are often used in conjunction when the company
scheme is contracted in to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme
(Serps). Most schemes in the UK are contracted out of Serps - in other
words, in return for a rebate of National Insurance Contributions (NICs),
these schemes guarantee to provide pensions which are as good as, or better
than, the Serps pension they replace.
However, more than 1m employees are members of contracted-in schemes where
the scheme benefits are paid in addition to the Serps pension. In these
cases it is possible for an employee to use an 'appropriate' personal
pension to contract out of Serps on an individual basis. An appropriate
personal pension can only be used to take the rebate of NICs which, for the
current tax year, is worth up to Pounds 1,500.
Most employees under the age of 35 would be better off with such a personal
pension as the value of the rebate is greater than the value of the Serps
benefit given up. Taking out a personal pension does not affect the
employee's rights and benefits under the main company scheme.
Personal pensions can also be used by employees who have a second source of
income, from freelance work for example. Younger employees can contribute up
to 17.5 per cent of these freelance earnings to a personal pension. The
Revenue does not take into account the benefits from the personal pension
plan when assessing maximum benefits under the occupational scheme.
However, it does check payments made by employees to ensure there is no
crossover between contributions made in respect of the two sources of
earnings. Freelance earnings must derive from an entirely separate source
from the main salary. Bonus or overtime earnings cannot be used to fund a
personal pension.
Personal pensions can, however, be used as a stop gap between the date of
joining the company and the date the employee becomes eligible to join the
pension scheme. The length of this 'waiting period' varies and can extend to
age 30. A high pension-scheme entry age is common among companies which have
a rapid turnover of younger staff and do not want the administrative hassle
of refunding contributions or arranging transfer values. Contributions to
personal pensions must stop when the employee joins the company scheme.
Occasionally, an occupational scheme may provide only death and dependants'
benefits. If this is the the case, it is possible to take out a personal
pension. And finally, an employee who is a member of an occupational scheme
may also use a personal pension to take a transfer value from an earlier
period of employment.
In several of the above examples the contributions to the personal pension
will be on a temporary or ad hoc basis. As a result, it is vital that the
plan is genuinely flexible so that there are no early termination penalties
if freelance earnings dry up or the employee becomes eligible to join the
company scheme.
The best way to retain full flexibility is to avoid a regular premium
personal pension and instead pay a series of single premium contributions,
since these carry much lower up front management and commission charges.
* Contribution limits for personal pensions as a percentage of net relevant
earnings (subject to the earnings cap): Up to age 35, 17.5 per cent; age
36-45, 20 per cent; age 46-50, 25 per cent; age 51-55, 30 per cent; age
56-60, 35 per cent; age 61-74, 40 per cent.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why it pays to motor around - There
are ways of keeping down your car insurance bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR insurance premiums have been rising steadily over the past two to
three years, as motor insurers adjust to large increases in accident and
theft claims. Equally, competition in the industry has increased to such an
extent that, more than ever, it is worth shopping around.
It is no longer necessarily the case that there is a standard rate for all
cars and drivers. Insurers work out their premium rates with reference to a
rising number of factors - ranging from the age and type of motor to the age
and record of the driver.
By the end of this month most companies will have introduced a new system of
rate banding set out by the Association of British Insurers last year.
Instead of nine insurance bands, cars are being grouped into 20 bands. The
old system, which dates from the 1960s, does not take into account the range
of models now available on the market.
The effect will be to penalise the 'hot-hatches' - small cars with powerful
engines - that are perceived as high risk because of their speed and the
high probability that they will be stolen. For example, the new band for the
Volkswagen GTi is 14 instead of 6, for the Peugeot 205 1.6 GTi, it is 12
instead of 5, while the Ford Fiesta XR2i, which was in band 5, is now in
band 14.
'As a rough rule of thumb, cars that have doubled their rating band should
be in the same position,' said Eileen Kimber of the ABI who estimates that
nearly a third of motorists will be worse off as a result of the new system,
a third better off and the rest should see no change.
'In the long run, the new ratings are sensible because we now have so many
cars with differences in their performance on the market,' said Noel Privett
of the Automobile Association. The beneficiaries will be family saloon cars
such as the Vauxhall Cavalier 1.6L. Its new rating is a modest 6 instead of
4. Cars such as the Ford Orion 1.6i which shared the same insurance band as
the Ford Fiesta XR2i will move into band 9 instead of 14 for the Fiesta.
Competition among insurers is increasing, as more insurers choose the direct
route to the customer, using mass media advertising to attract potential
custom and then evaluating risks and selling policies over the telephone.
The smaller brokers, the insurance industry's equivalent of the corner shop,
are losing out and are being forced to respond to the threat by deploying
their own packages and technology.
Companies such as Directline, direct insurance arm of the Royal Bank of
Scotland and Churchill, direct motor insurer set up by Switzerland's
Winterthur, have cornered around 15 per cent of the market. Some of the
composites, such as Eagle Star and General Accident have also got in on the
act by setting up direct sales services.
'Most of the big companies have had very bad losses and are having to
increase premiums,' said Martin Long, chief executive of Churchill.
'The costs of setting up were high but we are now trading profitably. By
cutting out the middleman we have lower costs and can attract business more
cheaply.'
While direct sales insurers are cheaper for many drivers, they are not a
good deal for some. Their strategy is to write policies for low risk drivers
only.
'We don't quote for young drivers in performance cars and we are not
attractive in most inner city areas,' said Chris McKee, director of
Directline, the first direct sales company, set up in 1985.
This strategy has ensured profits at a time when the big composites are
facing losses on the motor insurance side because of a rise in claims,
partly as a result of an increase in motor theft. The ABI said last week
that motor insurance underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 1.2bn last year.
Andy Miller, development manager at Norwich Union, predicts that the cost
advantage of the direct insurers will diminish when the process of
networking, by which intermediaries are linked directly to the composite
insurers through the electronic marketplace becomes widespread in 1994.
Other profitable sections of the motor insurance market are some of the
Lloyds syndicates which can offer rates equally competitive with the direct
insurers. Barry Hulbert, of Hill House Hammond, the retail insurance broker
owned by Norwich Union, says that by using the range of the market, brokers
can quote premiums that are 10 to 15 per cent cheaper than that of the
direct writers.
The table shows clearly the substantial differences in motor insurance
quotations. Rates can be up to 65 per cheaper than those shown since we have
excluded no claims bonus discounts. Motorists who install safety devices are
also likely to obtain lower quotes.
Premiums are expected to increase by an average of 25 per cent in the next
year but if you do not fall into the high risk category, comparing quotes
should ensure that your motor insurance bill does not rise by this amount.

Asda, the highly-indebted Leeds-based grocery chain, will have much to tell
its anxious shareholders when it reports its full-year results on Monday.
Analysts have pencilled in an Pounds 80m profit figure but this could be
severely depressed depending on how much of a financial hit Asda takes on
its redundancy programme and whether it accepts the charge above or below
the line.
The hard-pressed company has also warned that it is likely to take a
substantial write-down on the portfolio of 60 stores it expensively acquired
from Gateway in 1989. This could run into several hundreds of millions of
pounds.
Shareholders will want to know how Asda plans to tackle its shrinking
volumes and pinched margins.
On Wednesday, the UK's biggest electrical chain, Dixons, will report its
full year results, which should provide a good insight into whether there
are any flickerings of life on the high street. At the time of its interim
results, the company's chairman, Stanley Kalms was upbeat about the strength
of the recovery but since then demand is believed to have slackened.
Pre-tax profits are expected to have fallen by some Pounds 10m to Pounds 71m
with the company's US operations continuing to drag down the overall
numbers.
The Rank Organisation is expected to report on Thursday six month pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 90m and Pounds 94m, slightly down from last year's
Pounds 96m. The fall is likely to come from Rank's share in Rank Xerox, the
photocopying company, and particularly from Fuji Xerox, which has been hit
by the downturn in the Japanese economy.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewer, is likely to report on Monday pre-tax
profits for the year to April only marginally ahead of Pounds 217m a year
earlier. Higher interest charges have eaten up much of the increase in
operating profits.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Phantoms and liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTIMS of 'phantom withdrawals' from cash dispenser machines may find that
their liability is not automatically restricted to Pounds 50 as they were
led to believe by the Code of Banking Practice.
The code appears to state this clearly, but it may be more cryptic.
Cardholders could be at the mercy of legalistic quibbling and ad hoc
inter-ombudsmen arrangements.
The main problem is that the code does not specify whether the Pounds 50
limit is a maximum or a limit applying to each unauthorised transaction.
'It is something we must think about,' said Jane Woodhead, a building
society ombudsman. 'We can't decide in advance. The most you can say is it
is possible the limit could apply per transaction.'
She explained that under the Consumer Credit Act, the deciding factor would
be whether the card had been in the holder's possession between
transactions.
The banks are divided on the limit. Barclays and National Westminster said
they thought the Pounds 50 applied per account not per transaction. Lloyds
said that in the exceptional case of someone losing a card which then came
back into their possession, the liability could be Pounds 50 per
transaction. Midland Bank saw the Pounds 50 limit as a maximum but said each
case would be treated on its merits. The bank would be bound by the
ombudsman's decisions if these came down on the side of a limit per
transaction.
Chris Eadie, deputy banking ombudsman, said that while Pounds 50 could be
the maximum liability for a series of unauthorised withdrawals, it might
also apply several times if the series were broken by the customer using the
card legitimately.
The Pounds 50 limit does not apply in cases where the bank (or building
society) can prove that the customer acted fraudulently or grossly
negligently.
But Stephen Edell, one of the building society ombudsmen, notes there is no
authority in law on what 'gross negligence' means, apart from a 19th century
definition that it is 'negligence with a vituperative epithet.'
'The banking ombudsman and we will have to decide about this as cases
arise,' said Edell. Woodhead suggested the requirement to prove gross
negligence - however defined - was easier on customers than simple
negligence would have been.

<TEXT>
DURING a week remarkable only for its quietness, directors' activities
continued to be low key.
London International's announcement of unexpectedly poor results led to
shares falling rapidly.
Immediately following the fall, two directors took the opportunity of
increasing their holdings. Alan Woltz, the chairman, and Anthony
Butterworth, chief executive, bought 15,000 and 50,000 shares respectively
at prices around 227p.
At Westport Group, the exhibition equipment company, four directors bought
shares after final results were announced. Lyn Evans, David Ludlam, the
managing director, and Ian McQuattie, the chief executive, each bought
250,000 shares. Currently trading at only 2p, the total value of these
purchases was low; however, the impact was to double McQuattie and Ludlam's
holdings and to establish Kanter's entire holding.
The share price at Scottish Television has performed steadily over the past
18 months. William Brown, the chairman, has sold 79,596 shares at 403p. His
previous sale was made at 290p six months ago. Brown still retains 190,000
shares.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Only the cynics find crumbs of comfort
 -John Authers looks at the stock market's leaders and laggards over the
year's first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKET cynics have had a good six months. Some would claim that making
money out of equities is all about following bid rumours, and nothing to do
with the homework of share valuation.
Such cynics might also claim that no shares beat the market indefinitely,
and companies which come out top one year will be bottom the next.
This caricatured view is too extreme to be sustainable, but the London stock
market's performance over the first half of this year shows why people might
believe it.
Midland Bank has more than doubled in price since January 1. This has little
to do with fundamentals, as the bank has long been regarded by the City as
British banking's weakest link. Not, on the face of it, the soundest of
investments.
But once Midland decided to throw in the towel and give up its independence,
long-suffering shareholders enjoyed a bumper time. The shares leapt 76p to
329p after the agreed offer by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank was announced, to
the surprise of the market, on March 17.
Speculation at the time correctly suggested that a contested bid would
develop which limited profit-taking.
It also meant that the offer from Lloyds Bank, when it was finally announced
on April 28, did not lead to much reaction in the share price  - by now the
news was in the price, which only rose 13p to 394p.
The shares still strengthened 31p to 452p on June 2, when Hongkong Bank
announced its improved offer.
Rumours that Midland would surrender to a takeover bid had circulated the
market for a long time before March. However, the rumours were not reflected
in the price. Midland shares did look cheap at the beginning of the year.
But it would have been hard to justify as a 'blue chip' stock. Those who
could afford to take on slightly more risk and regarded Midland as a
'special situation' would have done well.
Some of the year's other top performers also benefited from bid rumours.
Guardian Royal Exchange produced results which were better than expected,
but lingering speculation that European predators are planning a competitive
bid for the company has done much to prop up the company's price throughout
the year.
Meanwhile, there is a startling addition to the group of laggards - British
Petroleum. Few companies can seem so eminently suitable for widows and
orphans to invest in as BP, but shares tumbled 30.55 per cent in the first
six months of the year.
Again this was due primarily to an event which took the market by surprise -
the Dallas-like boardroom coup which ousted chairman Robert Horton last
week.
This should not have had any great effect on the underlying value of the
company but the share price dropped 34p to 209p the following day. BP had
not had a good six months - which helps to explain Horton's departure - but
it would not have fallen into the laggards' column without this sudden
shock. More grist to the mill of those who believe the market is a
speculators' casino.
Other disquietingly big names among the laggards include Barclays, British
Aerospace and BET.
BP's announcement also brought back worries about dividends. Royal Insurance
passed its dividend earlier this year, while many others, including British
Steel, renowned for its high yield, made substantial cuts to pay-outs. This
has led, according to Maureen Hyland, equity strategist at James Capel, to a
switch into defensive sectors from capital goods 'recovery' sectors which
had put in strong growth at the beginning of the year. For example, Other
Industrial Materials rose 18.65 per cent, Motors rose 17.16 per cent, and
Textiles 16.05 per cent.
Dividend worries and a desire for security primed the sector which seems to
be the big gainer of the year - water. Four water companies are in the top
ten, aided by the election, which removed the political risk affecting the
sector, while water is easily the strongest sector, with a rise of 31.44 per
cent (the next, food retailing, registered 20.87 per cent).
People are unlikely to stop drinking water and, with dividends well
protected, this sector might take over as the destination for income
investors.
But Nick Train, of GT Management, has doubts - his advice to those who want
to invest in water for the safe dividends is to buy a gilt instead. The
yield will be higher while political, social and economic pressures should
all conspire against the cosy and protected monopoly profits on which water
companies can now rely.
Further evidence to support the cynics comes when this year's
weak-performing sectors are compared with last year's.
Twelve months ago, the headline for this story was 'Game, Set and Match to
Wellcome'. Pharmaceutical companies came first, second, third and sixth over
the first six months of 1991, and the Health &amp; Household sector was the top
performer with 36.1 per cent growth. It retained this ranking over 12
months.
So far this year, the sector is third from bottom, having dropped 15.63 per
cent. Wellcome, Glaxo and Fisons, pharmaceutical companies all, are in the
bottom ten.
This is in spite of the market's overall poor performance. Pharmaceuticals'
strength last year was based on its defensive qualities. Whatever the health
of the economy, people will always fall ill.
Particular problems with Wellcome, gearing up for its current massive
flotation, and Fisons, which plummeted 29 per cent in one day after issuing
a profits warning, hampered the sector.
Property was the weakest sector, with a fall of 19.38 per cent. A bad six
months when the problems of Canary Wharf were only the most eye-catching to
hit the sector, made this almost inevitable.
Otherwise the performance of the entire market has been a rag-bag, with few
clear trends. The market has done nothing special, with the FT-A 500 Share
up just 2.52 per cent over six months, and the FT-A All Share up 2.44 per
cent.
All this in spite of the euphoria which greeted the Conservative election
victory in April. Then, the FT-SE shot up 136.2 to 2,572.6, the biggest
one-day rise since October 1987.
The main FT-SE index had risen only 8.3 per cent during the Tories'
1987-1992 term, and many observers felt that the time had come for shares to
take off again.
Amid the euphoria there was a spate of new issues, unequalled since the 1987
bull market. The list included Wellcome, Guinness Peat Aviation and the
Daily Telegraph.
The excitement lasted six weeks. Then reality intruded. Train put it this
way: 'That mood has unwound in the last six weeks as we have come to realise
that interest rates are not coming down, and that the rest of the world is
still struggling under these extraordinary high real interest rates.'
He remains pessimistic for the future, pointing out that UK pension funds
already have around 80 per cent of their funds invested in equities - he
does not see where extra money is going to come from.
The GPA flotation was pulled while the Telegraph's new issue flopped and the
market descended into formless wandering. If you look at the market over a
six-month period, the general election need never have happened.
A strong economic recovery would shake the market out of its worried state,
and cause a switch into 'recovery' stocks, such as those involved in
manufacturing, according to Hyland. She remains optimistic that a recovery
will fuel the market out of its wandering.
There is a little cheer to be had from the smaller stocks. Proteus, a
pharmaceutical company which has announced both a loss and a rights issue
this year, is the only stock of any size to beat Midland. It is using
computer technology in transatlantic joint ventures to develop drugs for
fish, and DNA-binding products, and has seen its share price rise by 157.44
per cent over the first six months of 1992. As it is still producing losses,
this at least reflects a refreshing lack of cynicism in the market.
Then, Yuletide cheer, in this sceptical age, delivered growth of 69.62 per
cent for Park Food Group, which specialises in distributing Christmas
hampers. Sales increased 14.7 per cent for Christmas 1991, so there was some
festivity about.
Some other leading smaller companies, such as Amstrad, boosted by satellite
dishes, and First National Finance, were recovering from serious share price
falls last year.
The year's financial tragedies helped turned some smaller companies into
laggards - the property sector's dismal performance accounts for Regalian,
Kunick, and Greycoat, and will also have harmed the construction companies
BM and Birse.
It is not hard to guess at the reasons for the 59.55 per cent drop in the
price of Sturge Holdings, an underwriting agent at Lloyd's. Meanwhile,
Harland Simon, the control systems specialist which lags everyone having
dropped 89.01 per cent, could in part blame Robert Maxwell for the profits
warning it posted in February.
Contracts with Mirror Group Newspapers and Maxwell Communications took
Pounds 2m out of predicted profits, while Pounds 750,000 was put aside to
cover disputed debts to the two Maxwell companies. This time last year,
Maxwell Communications was one of the 'leaders', having grown 35.1 per cent
in the first six months of 1991.
No wonder some are cynical about the stock market.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Markets: Lower interest rates and lower expectations - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE headline on the front page of the New York Post, as it often does, said
it all. Next to a big picture of President Bush were the words: '10 million
Americans out of work. George may be next."
The headline helps explain why the Dow Jones industrial average fell more
than 20 points on the day the Federal Reserve instigated an interest rate
cut that the market had been crying out for for the past two weeks.
Question: If the market has been desperate for a rate cut, why didn't it
welcome the Fed's move on Thursday? Answer: The Fed only cut interest rates
after a dreadful set of June employment figures, and investors were more
pessimistic about what the highest unemployment rate for eight years might
do to President Bush's chances of re-election than they were optimistic
about what lower credit costs might do to aid the economy.
Recent reports have said that the White House is divided over what line to
take on the economy - should it be guardedly optimistic or should it try to
keep a lid on expectations? - but recently, it is clear, the President has
favoured the former. Only earlier this week he complained vigorously that
the media was distorting the true economic picture so much that people were
unaware of the good news about the recovery.
Bush's optimism looks dangerously foolish in the light of the June jobs
data, and both political and economic pundits were quick to say afterwards
that in the modern era no sitting President has won re-election with the
economy in such a poor state.
In spite of Bush's obvious failings, the investing community appears to
favour him over either Bill Clinton or Ross Perot, so it was no surprise
that the market greeted Thursday's damaging employment news so gloomily.
The stock market was not just thinking about politics on Thursday, however.
There was a good technical reason for the fall in stocks. The Dow had risen
more than 70 points in the first three days of the week in anticipation/hope
of a policy ease, so when the rate cut came, it was already fully priced
into the market.
There was also a fundamental factor at work. If the economy is as weak as
the employment data suggests, then expectations about corporate earnings may
have to be quickly revised downwards.
Economists have already had to lower their forecasts for second quarter
output growth in the light of recent poor economic statistics. Gross
domestic product grew a modest 2.7 per cent in the first quarter of the
year, and having originally expected second quarter GDP growth to exceed
that, economists are now talking about second and third quarter GDP growth
of between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent.
It is now quite possible that for all of 1992 GDP will grow at an annual
rate of no more than 2 per cent, which would make it the slowest
post-recession recovery since the Second World War.
Wall Street analysts will have to do some similar trimming to their
corporate earnings estimates. With the labour market in such a poor state -
the June employment report showed payrolls falling, the jobless rate rising,
working hours declining and average earnings flat - consumer demand is
likely to be weaker than expected.
If consumers are not spending much, and equally worrying, not saving much
either (the consumer savings rate is about 5 per cent, well below the rate
normally required for a robust recovery), Corporate America is not going to
enjoy the profits growth everyone had anticipated.
US companies cannot even look abroad for help. Export sales are poor, even
with a weak dollar, because foreign demand for US goods is being suppressed
by the wobbly global economy.
So where does the market go from here?. The last time the Fed slashed
interest rates (in late December), stock prices took off in an orgy of
buying as investors rushed out of lower-yielding assets and into equities in
the expectation that capital growth would be strong on the back of rapidly
improving corporate earnings.
Do not expect a similar reaction this time. Since the robust economic and
earnings recovery anticipated by those who bought stocks after the December
rate cut never materialised, investors will be reluctant to make the same
mistake twice. This time, they will probably wait for hard proof of better
corporate profits before committing more funds to equities, which means the
market could be in for a long, dull summer.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Markets: An exclusive club that no-one wants to join - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in British Steel have had to endure some heavy blows over the past
year, and none could have been remotely surprised this week to have found
themselves joining an exclusive, but unenviable, club.
As workers at the Ravenscraig steel works in Scotland contemplate
redundancy, British Steel's 307,000 shareholders - including 300,000
individuals - have joined the handful of privatisation investors to suffer a
dividend cut. On Monday, the steelmaker reduced its final pay-out from 5.75p
a share to 1.5p, and announced a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss.
It is all so different from 1989, when booming market conditions - and
profits - lifted the shares from the 1988 flotation price of 125p to a peak
of 159p. Last night, the shares closed at 64p, having touched a
post-privatisation low of 52p earlier in the week.
Investors do not need reminding that British Steel is caught in one of the
deepest recession experienced by the industry worldwide. The reasons are
well-known - severe downward pressure on prices caused by falling demand and
overcapacity, growing pressure on EC markets caused by imports from eastern
Europe, increasing foreign competition.
In the second half of last year, the share price took all this on board with
a vengeance - plunging by nearly 20 per cent on November 11 when the company
warned about the level of its final dividend and looked ahead gloomily on
business prospects. 'Clearly, the shares have been a disappointing
investment,' says Ian Lowe of Smith New Court. 'They have underperformed the
market by more than 50 per cent over the past year.'
Remarkably, though, things could have been even worse this week. The Pounds
55m loss may represent a dramatic fall from 1990/91 profits of Pounds 254m,
but was smaller than virtually anyone in the City had expected. And, despite
hints to institutions that they could expect a 1.5p final dividend, there
was still some relief that the pay-out was not omitted entirely.
This is the heart of the matter for investors. After the fall in the share
price, and with 70 per cent of the shares held by income funds, the share
has become a yield stock. Passing the dividend would have risked seriously
alienating the City, and - quite rightly - British Steel does not want
totally to discourage its shareholders.
Even so, it is making no bones about the uncertainty of economic recovery,
and the consequential effects on future dividends. Restoring levels of
profitability even to support the reduced dividend will depend on an
increase in steel prices, along with benefits from further cost reductions.
According to Andy Chambers of Nomura Research Institute, there is nothing in
terms of demand and supply for steel that indicates conditions will improve
quickly.
So what should shareholders do now? 'The time to sell was probably three
weeks ago when the price was 85p,' says Chambers. In the short-term, he
cannot see the shares going anywhere, one way or another. Looking further
ahead, he predicts a pre-tax loss of Pounds 50m this year, but says the
company will still be only 10-20 per cent geared at the year-end.
One clue to the immediate future for the share price might come from events
this week. US buying has lifted the shares from their 52p nadir, says Lowe,
with investors assessing British Steel's peak profits in the next cycle and
concluding that the company is between 20-100 per cent undervalued.
Lowe feels the share price could come under further pressure, adding that a
further dividend cut is 'very likely.'
Lowe's relatively pessimistic analysis of British Steel's future cash
generation abilities prompts the suggestion that the company should consider
fostering the idea of a US-style 'dividend cycle', linking the payout to the
ebb and flow of profits. One wonders whether UK investors would wear it.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Markets: The new age of uncertainty - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE are living in uncertain times in which the expected does not happen and
the unexpected does. The recovery, which everyone hopes to meet around the
next corner, remains as elusive as ever. The stock market, even putting
fears of a Labour government behind it, dropped to almost its pre-election
level this week.
Investors who thought they would be spoiled for choice, because of the
number of new issues coming to the market, are finding their indecision
being taken care of for them.
First, GPA, an aircraft leasing company, cancelled its Pounds 3.5bn
flotation just days before it was to go on to the market. Then, the share
issue by the Daily Telegraph ended in ignominy when only 3m of the 13m
shares available to the public was taken up. 3i and Del Monte have postponed
their flotations.
The bitter vagaries of the stock market are illustrated only too well this
week in our own stock market round-up of leaders and laggards.
Ailing Midland bank has become the market leader, while Wellcome, the
successful drugs company and leader one year ago, is now a laggard.
'We go into work every day, wondering where the next shock will be coming
from,' confided one fund manager this week.
With the experts worried, it is hardly surprising that consumers are keeping
their heads down.
A report this week from Mintel, the market research organisation, examined
whether consumer confidence, supposed to rise in the wake of the general
election, has returned. It found that although people are optimistic about
the long term, they are uncertain and cautious for the present.
After the spending spree of the 1980s, the level of indebtedness has risen;
with real interest rates still high, people have learnt the lessons of easy
borrowing the hard way.
The survey found that just under 60 per cent felt that borrowing for
anything other than a house should be avoided and almost two-thirds said
they would not use a credit card to buy goods. Surprisingly, more than half
the 15-to-19-year-olds, whom one would have expected to be carefree, also
concurred.
The reluctance to borrow shows that a consumer-led recovery is a long way
off, said the report. This conclusion was further strengthened with the
release of figures from the Central Statistical Office showing that savings
by consumers are at a 10-year high. Real personal disposable income is up
but people are choosing to save the increment rather than spend it.
Of course, if you have enough money to spend and save, it is a good time to
do both. Inflation at around 4 per cent is low while interest rates at 10
per cent are high. For the same reasons, it is a bad time for borrowers.
Those who are in debt, although under less pressure than a few years ago,
when interest rates were 15 per cent, will be better off spending their
money on reducing their level of indebtedness and the amount of interest
they have to pay.
Where should investors be keeping their money? The big debate is between
equities as a long-term investment, and money on deposit or fixed rate
instruments such as gilts, which are offering attractive yields.
There are two points to consider in any investment - the level of return and
the security of capital. The volatility of the stock market in an uncertain
economic climate is not good for frayed nerves and private investors appear
to be turning more in favour of security than dreams of capital gain.
The Mintel survey found that more than two-thirds of respondents wanted to
put money into a 'rainy day' savings account.
Safe products, such as Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts and National
Savings, have reported a buoyant inflow of funds.
Some Pounds 10bn has been put into Tessas since their introduction last
year, with Pounds 3bn of this deposited in the first three months of the
year.
National Savings contributed Pounds 552m to the Exchequer during May, the
fourth best month on record, increasing the total to Pounds 40.8bn. The
launch of a new fixed rate product later this month will increase this
intake still further.
But it would be a mistake to eschew equities altogether. The argument that
equities will not outperform as they did in the 1980s, because Exchange Rate
Mechanism discipline means we are entering a low inflation era, is sound
enough. But the rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danes last month
was an another surprise that served to increase uncertainties about the fate
of the ERM.
There is still investor interest in collective funds, such as unit and
investment trusts, which lessen the risk of equity investment by
diversifying into numerous holdings. More than half the people surveyed by
Mintel said they would consider this sort of long-term investment, while the
Unit Trust Association reported an all-time high of Pounds 60bn in funds
under management last month.
Although the crystal ball is looking very cloudy at the moment, the basic
rules of investment hold good now as much as ever before.
Hold on to safe products such as Tessas and National Savings by all means;
but, since the unexpected can happen, it is as well to spread some
investment into equities in case the stock market does take off later in the
decade.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Markets: Grunts don't just afflict Wimbledon - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEEPING skies and a regular low moan, traditional features of Wimbledon when
Monica Seles is playing, have been equally appropriate in London EC1 this
week. The precipitation has been as much economic as celestial; the moaning
has come from investors watching the FT-SE index slide to pre-election
levels.
Big-business economists have told the Treasury that the pickup in
manufacturing output seen in the first quarter has halted. House sales have
faltered in the last six weeks, after showing signs of recovery in the
spring. Consumers are spending less of their income than at any time in
nearly a decade. Companies are headhunting 12 per cent fewer executives than
a year ago. And Conservative MPs are starting to shift nervously on their
green leather benches, mumbling that it is time for the government to do
something to get the economy moving again.
All that leads to two questions: is Britain trapped in a seemingly endless
recession? And if it is, will the government make a big change in policy to
escape from it? City economists mostly answer 'no' to the first question,
though they do not necessarily expect the upturn to amount to much when it
comes. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, for example, one of the first forecasting teams
to predict zero growth for 1992, expects 1993 to bring a 1 1/2 per cent rise
in GDP - not much of a recovery, but not a continued recession.
Economists, who do their calculations on the basis of unchanged government
policies, are not the best people to ask for an answer to the second
question. Political journalists, who spend their time sniffing the wind for
the scent of a U-turn, are probably a better guide. So here is what the FT
political team thinks:
At the moment, Tory MPs are looking for signs of action, rather than a real
change of course. Pressure could mount by the autumn, though, especially if
the party conference looks like proving difficult as anti-EC sentiment among
some constituency associations spills over into the debate about the impact
of the ERM on the UK. Still, John Major will not shift. He and his team
don't think a small devaluation would do any good, since the loss of
credibility it would involve would push interest rates up rather than down.
A big devaluation is out of the question - not least because the ERM, in the
prime minister's view, provides the essential framework for
anti-inflationary policy which was missing in the 1980s.
That leaves one other possible escape route: a big shift in thinking among
other EC governments, especially France. So far, only Labour is pushing that
idea: John Smith raised the possibility of a concerted EC growth strategy
involving lower interest rates and an ERM realignment in the Commons on
Thursday night. If pressures continue to grow in France and elsewhere, that
may become a talking point among Conservatives, too, by the autumn.
In the meantime, the markets are clutching at straws. On Friday, after US
interest rates dropped to levels not seen since the Beach Boys were thin,
the stock market jumped to the conclusion that a cut in UK interest rates
was also on the way. Traders were over-reacting to some not-very-exciting
moves by the Bank of England in the money market; but the hope of lower
rates was enough to take the FT-SE index back up again towards the 2,500
mark. The FT-SE closed on Friday at 2,497.1, up 21 points on the day but
down 37 points on the week.
The economy was not the only cause of that decline, however. Just as
important, in institutional investors' minds, was the flow of bad news about
share issues. After the GPA float was pulled last month, almost nothing has
gone right. The Daily Telegraph issue met with a resounding lack of
enthusiasm among private investors. MFI, the furniture business, and Anglian
Group, the double-glazing supplier, both found underwriters, but at prices
much lower than had been hoped for. Del Monte Foods International followed
3i in postponing its planned float until times were better. Al though the
sale of Wellcome shares shows every sign of going ahead, there are plenty of
white knuckles visible.
Two results this week provided contrasting pictures of how to deal with
recession. British Steel announced a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss for the year,
and cut its dividend by three quarters. The share price dropped to half its
privatisation level. GEC, by contrast, announced profits up 1 per cent and a
dividend up 5 per cent. Cash reserves rose from Pounds 528m to Pounds 876m,
and the company's net cash (including that held by its joint-venture
subsidiaries) is Pounds 1.46bn. British Steel shares ended the week at 64p,
down 6p; GEC closed at 237p, up 9p.
The first half of the year, which ended on Monday, saw a 2 per cent rise in
the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. Among big companies the best performer was
Midland Bank, up 113 per cent thanks to the successful takeover bid by
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. Other rises were less remarkable,
but three big companies managed to increase in value by a third or more:
Siebe, Thames Water and Guardian Royal Exchange.
At the bottom end of the scale, British Petroleum was down by just over 30
per cent, hit by concerns about the dividend and British Aerospace dropped
23 per cent. Given the outlook for oil companies and defence contractors,
those figures were perhaps not surprising. But the drop in the shares of
Glaxo and Wellcome, both down by 20 per cent, reflected the fading glamour
of the big drugs stocks. SmithKline Beecham, which did not benefit quite so
much from last year's over-enthusiasm, did much better: it ended the half
year down less than one per cent.

FT  04 JUL 92 / The Long View: Garbage in, garbage out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE hard times for forecasters. Having got their 1991 economic
predictions wrong by often 3 percentage points of national income - an
enormous margin - it is beginning to look as though the same
number-crunching disaster may be happening again in 1992.
Take the Treasury, which is not actually the worst offender, in spite of all
the political pressures on it last year to be starry-eyed. Last November its
computer served up a forecast of 2 1/4 per cent economic growth in calendar
1992. By the time of the March Budget this had been revised down to 1 per
cent. The Treasury has no reason to publish another official forecast until
November, but the average growth in independent forecasts appears to have
come down to under  1/2 per cent and this week the Treasury was warned by
manufacturers that output, far from beginning to recover, is turning weak
again.
Elaborate computer models disguise the fact, but economic forecasts actually
look backwards rather than forwards. This is because the model is designed
to emulate past situations which appear to parallel those of the present,
and it is then assumed that economic events will unfold in more or less the
same way. The trouble comes when some crucial factor is different. There has
been no recession like the present one since the 1930s, long before
forecasting became popular. The memory chips have no relevant entries. This
is why the uncomprehending electronic boxes have been cranking out empty
promises of growth while the economy is locked into a declining trend.
In the stock market, too, optimism is a hard habit to break. I remember
being struck by the extraordinarily upbeat attitudes of stockbrokers at
their seminars towards the end of last year. Brokers are always bullish, of
course: no surprises there. But they normally predict a rise in share prices
of 10 to 15 per cent over the ensuing year. Yet firms such as James Capel,
Kleinwort Benson and Goldman Sachs were predicting gains of 25 to 30 per
cent in 1992. On the back of a strong economic recovery, company profits
were going to jump by up to 25 per cent. In fact the first half of the year
has produced an advance of just 2 per cent in the All-Share Index, even
including the boost from the Tory election victory.
I never believed the economic recovery story, and last December I suggested
that any profits upturn would be a story for 1993 rather than this year. But
I thought that a fall in interest rates would encourage some modest share
price gains. It turns out, however, that I was too optimistic in hoping that
German interest rates would start coming down by the middle of the year. We
will now be lucky to see any falls before 1993. Borrowers will remain badly
exposed.
Regular readers of this column will know that I have been appalled at the
relentless build up of debt. Personal debt, for example, doubled between
1980 and 1990 as a percentage of disposable income: the ratio has stopped
growing but it is not falling.
To begin with the Treasury regarded such borrowing as unimportant, merely
marking a 'portfolio shift' of assets and liabilities following financial
market deregulation. By last year it realised it might be wrong, but
politically could not afford to draw the logical conclusion that this debt
mountain might prevent economic recovery. If house prices and national
income continue to slide during the second half of the year the computer
model will, however, surely have to be reprogrammed. But no serious policy
changes are possible while the UK stays within the European exchange rate
mechanism; and the ERM is surely sacrosanct during the UK's six-month
presidency of the European Community.
Government ministers are notoriously fond of saying that the economy is just
about to pick up. Like the desperate company chairman who writes in his
annual report that 'your company is extremely well-placed to benefit from
any recovery in demand' Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, is fond
of saying that 'all the classic elements of recovery are in place'.
Unfortunately they are not. The money supply is scarcely growing. Mortgage
demand is weak. House prices are heading south. Without buoyancy here a
sustained recovery will not happen.
Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research has supplied me with some interesting
figures on housing debt. Mortgage indebtedness as a percentage of housing
equity has now reached an all-time peak of 43 per cent. If house prices were
to fall by 6 per cent over the next year (as they have over the last 12
months) this ratio could climb to nearly 50 per cent. At the bottom of the
last recession, the ratio was not much more than 20 per cent; this time
around there will be no debt-financed recovery.
How can we get out of this mess? For the time being we will not follow the
Americans, who this week slashed short-term interest rates to 3 per cent to
stimulate the economy regardless of what happens to the dollar - now heading
towards two to the pound. We could save our way out, and indeed this week's
first quarter personal sector figures showed a saving ratio of 11.5 per
cent, more than doubled in three years. Even so it would require many years
of economic stagnation to pay down a substantial part of the debt burden
like this.
Perhaps the intolerable will lead to the unthinkable. A less serious debt
hillock in the 1970s was levelled through inflation. In 1975 inflation was
25 per cent but the net interest rate on debt was only 7 per cent. That
neatly chopped 18 per cent off real indebtedness in a year. But the debt is
much bigger now, and we would need three years like that to halve it.
It probably will not happen like that. But if you are an economic forecaster
you might do well to give your computer some practice on data from the 1970s
as well as the 1930s - if, of course, you still have a job.

FT  04 JUL 92 / The superbug destroying our defences: New and virulent
strains of TB are posing a worldwide health threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN DAVIES and JAMIE DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I kept imagining all the things that were going on physiologically: the
lungs aren't getting enough air into the blood, which makes the brain fogged
out and the heart weaker, which makes the breathing more difficult. I kept
expecting some sort of an avalanching effect, with everything caving in
altogether in a dramatic collapse. But it didn't appear that way at all: she
just slowly got more foggy, and her breathing gradually became less and
less, until there was no more breath . . .'
THUS Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize-winning atomic physicist, describing the
death of his wife, Arlene, from tuberculosis in 1946. Such scenes are
enacted to this day, even in the most advanced western hospitals. There are
at least four doctors dying of TB in New York, and the incidence of the
disease is rising alarmingly. Tuberculosis is back - with a vengeance.
This lingering and fatal disease has been endemic for thousands of years.
Skeletons from a Neolithic site near Heidelberg in Germany bear its scars;
it has been identified in Egyptian mummies, and it was described by
Hippocrates and Galen (the Greeks referred to it as phthisis).
Shrouded for centuries in myth and superstition, the cause of TB was first
identified in 1882 by the German pathologist Robert Koch, who isolated a
previously unknown species of bacterium, mycobacterium tuberculosis. During
the slow, inexorable course of the disease, these bacteria evade their
host's defences and gradually eat away at tissues - hence the popular name,
consumption - producing increasingly severe bouts of fever and weakness.
The impact of any disease on a population is governed by two main factors:
the efficiency of its spread to uninfected individuals, and the resistance
of those individuals to attack. For TB, the most important route of
infection is through the air, when infectious droplets are coughed up by
sufferers and inhaled by other people.
Minor routes include contaminated food, especially milk from
tuberculous-infected cattle. Contagion is encouraged by crowding and
mobility. Resistance to infection is governed by individuals' general
health, specifically nutrition and freedom from other sickness.
In Britain's agrarian economy of the Middle Ages, consumption was a familiar
but relatively unimportant disease. Although the population was often
undernourished, it was fairly small, scattered and immobile. Only during the
stressed conditions of the Civil War in the 17th century, which brought
crowding, mobility and poor nutrition, did the incidence of tuberculosis
increase dramatically.
As trade and commerce developed throughout Europe, towns began to grow
rapidly, and people started to live in cramped conditions. By 1750 the
incidence was rising again, and in Naples in 1783 consumptive patients had
to be reported to the authorities. Their belongings were cleaned or
destroyed and their houses replastered - all at public expense. There were
heavy fines for non-compliance.
In England, the labouring poor were forced into mill towns and swelling
cities. In Victorian times, TB was responsible for a fifth of deaths in
English industrial towns. The US was similarly affected: between 1829-1845,
eastern seaboard cities had an average annual TB mortality of around 400 per
100,000.
Unlike the other great killers of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as
typhoid, cholera and diphtheria, TB is a slow, wasting disease which sends
its victims to their deaths only gradually. To the Victorians, with their
almost obsessional interest in death, a consumptive's unhurried decline had
an air of heroic, macabre romance, and the disease developed a cult
following.
By 1824, Alexander Dumas could record: 'It was all the fashion to suffer
from a chest complaint; everybody was consumptive, poets especially; it was
good form to spit blood after each emotion that was at all inclined to be
sensational, and to die before reaching the age of 30.'
What helped create this popularity was the perceived increase in vitality of
sufferers when in a feverish state. The 'romantic' artists and poets were
impressed by the similarity of the flushed face and delicate disposition of
a consumptive to those of a passionate lover. English literature owes a
considerable debt to TB.
At the height of this misguided romanticism, Lord Byron said he hoped he
might die of consumption 'because all the ladies would say: 'Look at that
poor Byron, how interesting he looks in dying'.' John Keats, ironically a
licensed apothecary and general practitioner of medicine, died of TB thought
to have been contracted while nursing his consumptive brother.
Robert Koch's discovery of the biological basis of TB brought an end to this
romanticism, and heralded the beginning of a medical counter-attack. Once
contagion was understood, action could be taken to reduce it as much as
possible. Alleviation of poverty was an early and important step, increasing
resistance and reducing crowding. Campaigns of information about the
disease, often funded by private unions and societies, helped educate the
public; the newly-invented process of pasteurisation prevented infection
from cow's milk, and the introduction of sanataria in the latter part of the
last century isolated severely contagious patients.
In 1912, TB was made a notifiable disease in England and Wales, providing a
means of state-organised control. Careful hygiene proved enormously
effective, even in the absence of more advanced medical techniques.
The first truly medical, rather than sociological, weapon to be developed
against TB was the BCG vaccination. In 1906, the bacteriologist Calmette
isolated a culture of bovine TB bacteria, which he and Guarin mutated and
bred in the laboratory until they had a non-virulent strain. The first
successful trials of BCG took place in 1921; by 1954 more than 60m people
had been vaccinated worldwide.
The second medical defence, and the first to be of great use to patients
already suffering from the disease, was the arrival of antibiotic
chemotherapy in the years following the Second World War. The combined
strategies of improved hygiene, elimination of bovine TB from milk herds,
vaccination and antibiotic therapy effectively ended TB's reign: in the
early 1900s, 0.16 per cent of the British population died of consumption
each year; by 1961 this had dropped to 0.0074 per cent.
However, while the West has enjoyed the results of its battle against the
disease, there remains an immense reservoir of TB in the rest of the world.
Individual travellers and migrating populations provide a continuous source
of virulent bacteria to challenge healthy developed countries. The challenge
used to be resisted, but in recent years tuberculosis has managed to gain a
new and lethal hold, and is becoming a crisis in 'advanced' First World
cities such as New York, which has more than 25,000 TB sufferers. Again,
critical factors of spread and susceptibility provide a means of
understanding the threat.
A partial explanation of the rise of infection lies in the socio-economic
conditions prevalent in large cities, which are once again a focus of
endemic poverty, homelessness and over-crowding. Areas of New York, Los
Angeles and perhaps even London have degenerated into the very squalor whose
abolition was so important in the battle against disease last century.
The rest of the explanation arises from people's resistance to infection,
which is decreasing for several reasons. The first - general ill-health - is
inseparable from poverty. The second is the appearance of individuals with
significantly defective immune systems, either because they are under
immuno-suppression to prevent transplant rejection, or more commonly because
they suffer from leukaemia or Aids. The third reason is the decreasing
ability of antibiotic chemotherapy to protect those infected by TB bacteria.
In New York, almost half the TB samples taken from new patients are
resistant to one antibiotic, and one strain is resistant to 11. Our capacity
for chemotherapeutic treatment of the disease is being eroded quickly.
Clearly, action needs to be taken.
Global eradication of the disease is not feasible (only smallpox has been
eradicated so far). Practical strategies mostly echo those of the past. The
problem of urban poverty and homelessness has proved disappointingly
intractable. It is estimated that New York alone has 90,000 homeless, a
third of whom are infected with HIV or have Aids.
Education has been of great service in the past, but its present lack of
success in controlling drug abuse is worryiong. A programme of vaccination
offers great hope of increasing the resistance of uninfected individuals,
and New York's governor, Mario Cuomo, has proposed that state funds be used
to purchase vaccine for the city's poor.
Faced with the threat of epidemic, basic science has taken arms once again
against TB. After the initial success of chemotherapeutic approaches in the
1950s, little further work was done and much remains to be learned about the
basic biology of mycobacterium tuberculosis. Even the composition of its
unusual outer coat, the part of the bacterium detected by the immune system,
is not understood in any detail.
Increased knowledge of this parasite's biochemical composition is deemed so
important that the Human Genome Project - the immense international
collaboration aiming to read the entire genetic code of human beings - is
being extended to include reading the (much smaller) genetic code of the TB
bacterium. With luck, the work will result in new 'designer drugs' aimed at
specific weaknesses. However, these will need to be used with caution, lest
further resistant strains are generated.
More immediately, science is coming to the aid of busy clinicians through
the development of tests for the presence of TB which take hours rather than
weeks, and a rapid means of testing for antibiotic resistance.
The re-conquering of tuberculosis is likely to be slow, difficult and
expensive. TB's reappearance should remind us that our accustomed freedom
from infectious disease was not easily gained, and requires vigilance and
care.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to evaluate First National Finance Corporation's assertion
that default rates on its consumer loan book are improving when this side of
the business required a further Pounds 36m provision in the first half. The
company told a similar story when it announced its full year results in
January. Now it says the latest provision, which admittedly is below that in
the second half of 1990-91, was necessary because of the lag before lower
default rates work through.
One has to hope that the impact will be felt soon. Next spring, FNFC faces
debt maturities of some Pounds 250m. Its bankers will surely look askance if
there is not some more tangible sign of improvement. The chances are that
the company will be thrown back on further securitisation of its loan
portfolio. Whether it will then be able to retain the bulk of its customary
10 per cent margin is another matter. It cannot look forward to much extra
volume in consumer lending, while losses on commercial lending look set to
continue. If past recessions are anything to go by, small business borrowers
will remain under strain even after the upturn begins. Recovery looks as
remote as ever, and for FNFC the delay is becoming uncomfortable.

FT  04 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Forte/Compass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The breakdown of talks over the sale of Forte's Gardner Merchant catering
business to Compass is plainly an embarrassment to both parties. In
particular, the Pounds 530m on the table would have done much to soothe
Forte's nervous shareholders, who have seen their investment underperform
the market by some 20 per cent in the last two months.
Whether Forte's shares deserve to fall further on Monday is open to
question. Much of the recent weakness has been in line with the sector, as
the market has come to realise that an upturn in the UK hotel industry is
still some way off. While the cash would have been very handy in securing a
dividend which looks like being uncovered by earnings, the fact that Forte
could walk away suggests it was not quite essential. The much-publicised
plan to expand in Europe is not yet concrete enough to require large-scale
funding. Nor is it impossible that the other buyers supposedly in the wings
will come up with the goods.
But the failure of the deal may say something about the market for equity
funding. It appears that Compass would have had to rely on a rights issue
for at least a third of the money. In a week marked by difficult issues from
MFI and The Telegraph, this must have been thought-provoking, especially for
a company whose shares have been suspended for the past month while the deal
was thrashed out. And while Forte explicitly rules out a rights issue now
the deal has fallen through, it is bound to reflect that it may have little
choice in the matter.

FT  04 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: EFA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout the spring, investors in British Aerospace seemed prepared to
look beyond the company's immediate problems towards the faint but emerging
glimmer of a profitable medium-term future. Over the last few weeks, though,
short-term anxieties have again been piling up. BAe shares have lost nearly
35 per cent of their value since mid-May as worries about prospects for the
regional aircraft market have been compounded by growing doubts over the
future of the European fighter aircraft (EFA).
The next move in the shares depends on the fate of the Pounds 20bn project
following Germany's refusal to give the go-ahead to the project. Reports
that the UK cabinet is divided should hardly come as a surprise, given the
icon-smashing opportunity for Eurosceptics and the approach of a very tough
UK public spending round. The dilemma, however, is real. The option of a
significantly scaled down version of the fighter - notwithstanding the scope
for a few modifications - looks implausible given progress so far. Complete
abandonment is not politically appealing for the Italians and Spanish
either. Investors can only hope that governments swallow the manufacturers'
argument that they can keep inside the original budget even with a
three-nation programme.
Ironically, the unresolved regional jet issue is probably more important for
BAe's long-term health. And shares in GEC and Rolls-Royce have responded
more calmly to this week's EFA worries.

FT  04 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Whistling for a cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having misread the Bank of England's money market signals ahead of the May
base rate cut, the City is naturally anxious to avoid the same mistake
again. But that may have led it into reading too much into yesterday's money
market intervention. The Bank simply does not have the leeway to follow the
rate-cutting example established by the US Federal Reserve on Thursday,
desirable as that would be in the encircling economic gloom.
Sterling is at its lower limit against the Portuguese escudo and less than a
pfennig above its theoretical narrow band floor in the ERM. A large part of
its weakness yesterday reflected worries about a possible devaluation of the
Italian lira rather than expectations of lower UK interest rates. But the
currency is now at a level where the government cannot afford to take many
risks without undermining the credibility of its narrow band promise, and
thus possibly also its large funding programme in the gilts market.
A quarter point base rate cut with which the markets were flirting yesterday
would leave UK rates level-pegging with those of Germany. There never was
much ground for assuming the UK could undercut German rates. There is even
less since the Danish referendum called the Maastricht Treaty into question.
That uncertainty will continue at least until the French vote this autumn.
A small UK rate cut might allow a much-needed widening in bank and building
society loan margins, but it would do little for the broader economy. The
timing would be particularly hazardous as the Bundesbank's mid-year monetary
target review looms in two weeks time. With German money supply growth 3.5
points above the top of its target range, the Bundesbank is fretting about
its own credibility. The chances are its council will be more inclined to
tighten further than to relax. Europe has little to offer in the way of
interest rate cuts at next week's G7 summit.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Nike clothes may be run out of Games
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIKE, the US sports shoe and fashion giant, is facing a painful Olympics in
Barcelona later this month after a ruling by Spain's highest court that it
cannot advertise its clothes in Spain and that its sponsored athletes at the
Games may not wear its racy logo.
Choosing their moment with deadly precision, two Catalonians have gone to
the courts claiming that they have had the Nike name, and an emblem very
similar to the US Nike company, registered in Spain since 1932.
The court bought their story. The two are said to be asking Dollars 30m
(Pounds 15.7m) for 'their' marque.
Nike was not available for comment late yesterday but its Spanish
representatives have appealed against the ruling by the Constitutional Court
(Barcelona branch) on June 30. Their problem is that the wheels of Spanish
justice grind hideously slowly and the games are just three weeks away.
Expansion, the Spanish newspaper which unearthed the ruling, is this morning
quoting local Nike (US) representatives as saying the damage to the company
would be 'irreversible and irreparable' if its athletes are not able to
sport the company logo during the games.
While the ruling does not mean that Michael Jordan and Katrin Krabbe will
have to compete without their shoes on, it could mean that TV closeups of
their victorious heaving chests will be free of advertising.
It also means Nike would have to take down its hoardings in Barcelona and
the rest of Spain.
Nike was planning to use the Games to help launch a multimillion dollar
range of sports clothes in the autumn.

FT  04 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late index-linked
selling interrupts Nikkei's rise

LATE index-linked selling and profit-taking ahead of the weekend erased
early gains, and the Nikkei average closed marginally lower, disappointing
investors who had hoped that the index would post its first four-day rise
since October last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed down 39.85 at 16,717.78 but ended 5.7 per cent
higher on the week, having risen more than 1,000 points over the previous
three days. The index fell to the day's low of 16,617.72 on early
profit-taking but moved higher on buying by investment trusts, reaching the
day's high of 16,956.06 in the afternoon.
Volume fell from 337m shares to 330m. Advances led declines by 613 to 351,
with 124 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 1.86 to 1,293.55 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell
0.15 to 1,016.19.
Investors were hopeful of an imminent cut in the official discount rate by
the Bank of Japan, following a similar move in the US on Thursday.
'Investors are hoping that some decisions on monetary policy will be made
during the Bank of Japan's branch manager meeting next week,' said an
analyst at Daiwa Securities.
With most institutional investors remaining absent from the market,
speculative theme stocks led the activity. Taiyo Fishery, which is planning
to breed blue-fin tuna, was the most active issue of the day, rising Y30 to
Y491. But Nippon Formula Feed, the feedstuff maker which has also been
popular for the same reason, fell Y32 to Y740. Investors were discouraged by
restrictions on stock lending by Japan Securities Finance, the sole lender
of stock for margin trading.
Toyama Chemical advanced Y45 to Y765 and Green Cross surged Y149 to Y1,070.
The two pharmaceutical companies were reported to be in joint development of
an anti-Aids drug.
Meanwhile, blue chip high technology issues fell back on profit-taking.
Hitachi plunged Y17 to Y780 and Fujitsu Y9 to Y633. Some banks were also
lower, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y20 to Y1,610 and Sumitomo Bank
retreating Y30 to Y1,390.
In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 242.99 to 19,692.24 in volume of 13.3m
shares.
Roundup
EQUITIES in the Pacific Basin were mixed yesterday, with no panic response
to the overnight slide on Wall Street. Markets which moved seemed, indeed,
to have stimuli of their own. Bombay was officially re-opened after closing
for settlements on Thursday, but brokers refrained from trading.
HONG KONG digested the Sun Hung Kai Properties equity funding, which turned
out to be a HKDollars 3.3bn share placing, then regained some interest in
the afternoon as it anticipated the prime rate cut which came after the
close.
The Hang Seng index fell 11.89 to 6,061.85, 0.8 per cent lower on the week,
after touching a low of 5,985.22 for the day. Turnover dipped to HKDollars
4.10bn from Dollars 4.51bn.
Brokers said that the market was worried that other property groups might
follow Sun Hung Kai in making cash calls, and put pressure on share prices.
MANILA tumbled across the board on heavy selling of Philippine National Bank
(PNB) after news of changes in accounting methods at the state-owned bank.
The composite index fell 36.41 to 1,477.16, 3.2 per cent lower on the week.
Combined volume at Manila's two bourses rose to 3.1bn shares from 2.3bn, but
slipped in value from 281m to 190.6m pesos.
NEW ZEALAND offered a limited, but still positive, response to the low-key
budget delivered by the finance minister, Ms Ruth Richardson, on Thursday
night. Shares took their cue from a rally in the bond market and the NZSE-40
index rose 6.88 to 1,541.89, up 0.9 per cent on the week in turnover of
about NZDollars 22m.
Telecom was a major beneficiary of falling bond yields because of its status
as the biggest utility stock; it rose 3 cents to NZDollars 2.11.
AUSTRALIA rose a little more on persistent hopes of an interest rate cut.
The All-Ordinaries index closed 1.5 higher at 1,663.2, its highest level
since June 10 and up 1.3 per cent on the week. Firm gold prices underpinned
mining stocks. Turnover slipped to ADollars 183m from ADollars 229m.
KUALA LUMPUR returned from Thursday's national holiday, but many Malaysian
investors stretched the holiday into a four-day weekend. The KLSE composite
index closed off 0.39 at 596.08, fractionally higher on the week.
SINGAPORE continued to retreat although modest buying at the close helped
lift prices above the intraday lows. The Straits Times Industrials Index was
down 7.63 at 1,484.10, down 0.6 per cent on the week.
SEOUL dipped to the lowest level in nearly five years as rumours of failured
among small businesses weighed on a weak market. The composite index fell
1.08 to 547.20, a fall of 0.9 per cent on the week and the lowest close
since January 1988.
The index would have fallen further if the stock market stabilisation fund
had not bought 1.6m shares in the afternoon.

FT  04 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Mexican bolsa loses its international
appeal - Foreigners are selling out on concerns about the economy and
corporate earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's stock market has lost some of its glitter in the past month. The
foreigners who pushed the market up and up for two years have taken fright,
causing the market to fall 15.5 per cent in June, the sharpest drop since
October 1987.
While the market has recovered somewhat this week, some analysts warn that
it remains vulnerable. Economic growth is sluggish, which is likely to have
an impact on second quarter earnings. 'If one of these (large) companies
reports bad earnings, I can see the market falling again,' says Mr David
Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services.
The capacity for unpleasant surprises remains since most Mexican companies
and analysts do not bother too much about quarterly earnings forecasts,
while many American analysts do not understand Mexico's complicated
inflation accounting.
This room for misunderstanding between the Mexican and US cultures was
brought home last month when largely-unfounded rumours over the sale of
Telmex stock by the telephone union caused a certain panic in New York, and
a sharp drop in Telmex's share price. Before Telmex had time to recover, an
attack on its growth prospects and accounting practices by an independent US
analyst, Mr David Bodenberg, caused the price to fall once again.
'What you have,' says Mr Terry Mahony, who manages the Baring Puma Fund, 'is
completely neophyte investors applying American analytical techniques to
Mexico.' Other US investors put it differently. Mr Robert Gay of Banker's
Trust says: 'Mexican companies do not recognise the information required of
them. Last year's numbers are never the same, and are always being revised.'
Foreign investors ploughed into the Mexican market last year and in the
first few months of 1992, raising their stake from a modest Dollars 4.25bn
at the beginning of 1991 to Dollars 27.2bn at the end of May. They became
the dominant force in the bolsa, holding 20 per cent of the market
capitalisation, and between one-half and two-thirds of the market float -
that is, those shares which are actively traded.
Until last month foreigners had been rewarded handsomely, with the market
more than doubling in 1991, and up 33 per cent in the first five months of
this year. But in June a series of troubling events lead to a rapid sell-off
by the more fickle investors.
Top on the list of bad news was uncertainty over the US election, caused by
the then growing popularity of Mr Ross Perot and the fear that, if elected,
he would not support the North American free agreement (Nafta).
While brokers are keen to say that Nafta merely makes Mexico even more
attractive, the perception among many investors is that the agreement is
crucial for the long-term stability of Mexico's economic policy. When
Nafta's future came in doubt, many started to sell.
Two worrying trends exacerbated the bad news. First, there was the
overwhelming amount of stock that Mexican companies were offering on
national and international markets. In 1991 Mexican companies offered
Dollars 4.8bn of new stock, and to mid-June this year another Dollars 4.3bn.
Add to that the figure of roughly Dollars 12bn of bank stock auctioned off
by the government, and over Dollars 21bn worth of new Mexican equity has
been sold in 18 months.
'That is equal to 6.7 per cent of Mexico's GDP,' says Mr Timothy Heyman of
Baring Research in Mexico City. 'In the US it would be like trying to sell
off nearly Dollars 400bn of stock in 18 months.'
The straw that broke the market's back was the proposed offering of 220m
shares in Banacci, comprising Mexico's largest bank, Banamex, which was
intended to fetch Dollars 1.5bn.
The offering, personally supported by Mexico's finance minister, Mr Pedro
Aspe, served little obvious purpose, since Banacci is well-capitalised, and
its owners had already paid the government Dollars 3.2bn for 70.7 per cent
of the shares in the recently privatised bank without difficulty.
At the last minute, the offering had to be abandoned because of the market
fall in June. With it, a host of other issues in the pipeline, led by Grupo
Simec and Grupo Synkro, were postponed.
A further concern is the perceived slowdown in Mexico's economy this year.
Mr Gray from Bankers Trust expects Mexican growth to be around 3 per cent
this year, and warns that some companies' earnings will be disappointing. As
he points out, Mexico has tightened short-term interest rates since April,
with rates up by around 5 percentage points.
Companies geared to the consumer and construction markets are likely to
suffer from the higher rates. Cemex, Mexico's main cement producer, reckons
that volume will increase by 9 per cent in the second quarter, against the
10-11 per cent previously forecast. Also, in April, a number of Mexican
banks which had bought bonds offering 2 per cent above inflation are
reported to have lost heavily as nominal rates have climbed to 16.5 per
cent, 4.5 percentage points above expected inflation for 1992.
The peso has been weak in the second quarter, which means that the dollar
earnings of US-quoted companies - in particular Telmex, 25 per cent of the
market, and Vitro, the country's largest industrial company  - will be lower
than many US analysts expected.
The bolsa nevertheless rallied this week, as many experienced investors
believed that the market had over-reacted to the bad news. Mr Luis Pellat,
an analyst at Banamex, argues that 'the market is undervalued with respect
to the valuations we have for the companies. We see this as a moment to
position ourselves for the long term'. The market has a prospective
price/earnings ratio of 11 for 1992, down from 13 just one month ago.
Whether this a good buy or not depends a large part on the mood in the US,
and its inclination to invest in emerging markets. A flight to quality would
hurt Mexico more than most, since it needs substantial capital inflows to
finance its mushrooming current account deficit, expected to top Dollars
16bn this year.
Mr Jorge Mariscal, manager of Latin American equities research at Goldman
Sachs, says that Mexico has already been victimised by the bearish mood
among international investors. He doubts that this will change in the
short-term. 'I don't think the Mexican market will do much until the
uncertainty over the US elections is resolved,' he says.

FT  04 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses firm on hopes of lower
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL bourses chose to focus on lower interest rates, following the US
Federal Reserve's cut on Thursday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose in trading marked by wide swings in individual stocks. The
day improved from a 0.82 decline to 698.92 in the FAZ index at midsession to
a 8.37 rise to 1,776.98 in the DAX at the close, leaving gains on the week
of 0.4 and 1.3 per cent respectively.
Turnover jumped from DM6.5bn to DM8bn. Among blue chips, chemicals recovered
from rumours of downgrades to close narrowly mixed, and carmakers climbed
again with BMW DM7 higher at DM593, Daimler DM8 higher at DM770 and
Volkswagen, which had gone ex-dividend, a net DM9.30 higher at 386.80.
Banks extended their gains sedately after the US discount rate cut,
reflected in a drop in the Bundesbank's average bond yield of 9 basis points
to 8.25 per cent.
Still among the DAX constituents, there were big moves in Lufthansa and
Continental. The airline ended DM9.80 lower at DM114.70, after DM105
following its DM600m operating loss for the first five months of 1992.
The tyremaker, however, rose DM9.50 to DM267 on speculation that Pirelli
could overturn its voting rights limit and relaunch its failed takeover bid.
Among second-liners, Asko resumed trading with a drop of DM109 to DM636,
above a day's low of DM601, after a three-day suspension during which it
announced a loss and passed the dividend.
PARIS recouped Thursday's fall but trading was confined to a fairly narrow
range. The CAC 40 index rose 10.12 to 1,883.64, down 1.6 per cent on the
week, in thin turnover of FFr1.64bn.
Suez was one of the most active shares, dropping to FFr3.80 to FFr270.20, on
fears that it would have to increase its property provisions for 1992. The
company has already warned shareholders that it will have to make provisions
of FFr1.2bn.
Euro Disney dropped FFr1.70 to FFr105.10 on fears that the French lorry
drivers' blockades would harm the theme park's attendance figures.
MILAN ended slightly higher after a nervous and volatile session. There was
some professional buying at the start, in anticipation of a technical
rebound next week, but the lack of follow-through buying by institutions
prompted some dealers to square their positions ahead of the weekend.
Dealers were also worried that opposition parties' calls for the resignation
of the new finance minister, Mr Giovanni Goria, in connection with two
scandals, could put the country's new government at risk. The Comit index
fell 0.35 to 444.16, down 3.9 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at
L100bn after L103.8bn.
Among issues which settled early, Fiat rose L22 to L5,112 but slipped to
L5,090 later in the session.
ZURICH closed an hour early as it moved to a new bourse building, and
celebrated with the SMI index 15.9 higher at 1,870.5, 1.9 per cent higher on
the week.
Dealers liked lower interest rates at home and abroad. Trading was active,
led by the obvious beneficiaries in banking and insurance, where SBC rose
SFr10 to SFr262 and Winterthur by SFr60 to SFr3,150.
MADRID produced a technical rebound which took the general index up by 3.39
to 239.44, still 1.6 per cent lower on the week. However, dealers said that
domestic and international sentiment was still bad, that there had been no
major news to encourage the turnround and that short-term speculators were
behind it.
AMSTERDAM closed broadly higher on the back of a firmer dollar but trading
was thin. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.4 to 123.0, down 0.7 per cent on the
week.
The food producer Wessanen rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 89.50 on news that it had sold
its milling, baking and starch operations to Goodman Fielder Wattie of
Australia.
BRUSSELS closed mixed in trading dominated by Petrofina. The Bel-20 index
inched up 4.49 to 1,174.80 in turnover of BFr1.2bn. Petrofina climbed BFr100
to BFr11,150 and accounted for 60 per cent of the day's business.
STOCKHOLM finished flat to lower in thin trade with the Affarsvarlden
General index 2.8 down at 914.6, 0.7 per cent down on the week.
Foreign interest helped three blue chips buck the trend, Asea B rising SKr2
to SKr392, Volvo by SKr3 to SKr385 and Astra B by SKr7 to SKr522, but volume
slipped to a very thin SKr245m from SKr392m a day earlier.
In COPENHAGEN, the all-share index fell 0.78 to 319.50, also in very thin
trading, writes Hilary Barnes. Hafnia Holding was still suspended and a
statement was awaited concerning its rights issue, subscriptions to which
were postponed on Thursday.
OSLO recovered earlier losses to close virtually unchanged in slow summer
trade focused on the insurance company, Uni Storebrand.
The all-share index ended 0.03 higher at 393.25, down 2.8 per cent on the
week, as Uni Storebrand recovered NKr1 to NKr31in 315,000 shares after a
mid-week fall on a report, since denied, that the company was close to
technical bankruptcy.
HELSINKI hit a new 1992 low in slow trade, the Hex index falling 3.3 to
750.7, 2.2 per cent down on the week.
ISTANBUL fell on continued profit-taking as the 75-share index lost 68.7 to
4,175.96.

BANK of England moves in the money markets led to suggestions of an
impending interest rate cut and prompted a strong advance in stock index
futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE was already strong in early trading.
Then, the Bank of England moves in the money markets provided an impetus for
the September contract to advance sharply and reach 2,532, the day's high,
by mid morning. Thereafter, the contract traded within a narrow range of
2,520 and 2,530 for the rest of the session. With Wall Street closed, the
momentum was maintained by the firmness in the fixed income markets.
September closed at the session's high of 2,532, up 43 on the previous
session and around 18 points above its estimated fair value to cash of about
25. Turnover of 6,366 lots was, however, light.
In traded options, turnover was down on the past two sessions reaching
31,570 lots by the close. The FT-SE contract traded 12,845 lots and the Euro
FT-SE, 2115 contracts. Asda was the busiest stock option with a day's total
of 2,007 lots.

FT  04 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Technical recovery helps share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEREST whiff of base rate optimism from the London money markets was
enough to fuel a technical rally in UK share prices yesterday. The FT-SE
Index briefly regained the 2,500 mark, closing 21 points up and only just
below this benchmark number in the absence of distraction from Wall Street
which was closed for the July 4 holiday.
Equities opened lower following weakness in the Dow Industrial Average
overnight and the continuing worries over the UK economy and the faltering
record of new share issues in the London stock market.
But a dip of 8.6 in the Footsie was quickly reversed upwards when the Bank
of England's actions in the money markets gave some stimulus to hopes of
another early cut in UK base rates. With the enthusiasm taken up in the
stock index futures market, the equity market advanced by 24 points to touch
2,500.1.
Prices for short-dated government bonds turned higher, also reflecting base
rate speculation. Long dated bonds also gained ground while, for good
measure, Index-linked stocks joined in the general upturn.
However, many strategists took a cautious view, and interest rate optimism
soon cooled down. The stock market held on to its gains, encouraged by
firmness in other European centres, and by bear closing operations as
traders bought stock to meet selling commitments entered into earlier this
week.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,497.1 (plus 21 points). This
indicates a loss of 37 points or about 1.5 per cent on the Footsie over the
week. Selling has not been heavy - Seaq turnover totalled 429.5m shares
yesterday - but investors have been distressed by persistent economic gloom
reflected in downgradings of corporate profit estimates by brokers and by
difficulties with successive share flotations.
The withdrawal of the GPA flotation, failure of The Telegraph issue and the
reduced pricing of the MFI Furniture sale have all cast clouds over the
stock market.
However, many market strategists have argued that the stock market has
become oversold and that share prices represent good value at these levels
in terms of the yield relative against the UK bond market. These optimisms
were heartened by the rapidity with which the Footsie regained the 2,500
mark yesterday. But a question mark now hangs over the outlook on Wall
Street.
Retail business in UK equities has begun to recover after falling sharply as
economic and corporate gloom discouraged investors.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper leads rally in
base metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COPPER market led most London Metal Exchange contracts to higher ground
this week as a cut in US interest rates gave added impetus to the existing
upward trend.
In advancing by Pounds 46.75 to Pounds 1,315.25 a tonne for three months
metal copper continued to defy the bearish influence of sterling's strength
against the dollar. After adjusting for that factor the rise on the week
works out at Pounds 58 a tonne. A morning bout of profit-taking had been
absorbed before the price reached that level, the highest for three months
in sterling terms and for 18 months in dollar terms.
Encouraging copper's rise was news that a strike could start at Poland's
KGHM combine on July 20, although that was countered by the agreement of a
labour contract at Asarco of the US. Another bullish influence was the
threat of supply tightness developing later this month and in September and
this was reflected in the short-lived establishment yesterday of a
'backwardation' - a price premium for cash over metal for forward delivery.
The copper market's improved sentiment spilled over into other metals,
notably aluminium and nickel, the former's three months position ending the
week Dollars 69.75 up at Dollars 1,347.25 a tonne and the latter's Dollars
423 up at Dollars 7,719 a tonne. But some traders were dubious about the
sustainability of this trend. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, thought
copper's present price could be justified but saw no good reason for
aluminium or nickel prices to be buoyant as both markets were still
suffering from substantial imports from the CIS.
The only LME market to sustain price falls this week was zinc, which
continued to reflect the unwinding of the options-related supply squeeze
that prompted the exchange to impose nearly three weeks ago a descending
ceiling on the one-day backwardation during the June/July period. The cash
price rose with the other base metals on Monday, reaching a 20-month high of
Dollars 1,391.50 a tonne, but then went into reverse. By yesterday's close
it was showing a Dollars 56 fall on the week at Dollars 1,300 a tonne and
its premium over the three months price, which had reached Dollars 189 a
tonne before the LME acted to end the squeeze, had shrunk by another Dollars
42 to Dollars 15.50 a tonne.
Platinum was the star performer in the precious metals market, with the
price fixed yesterday afternoon at Dollars 386 a troy ounce, up Dollars 19
on the week. On Thursday it had reached a 13-month high of Dollars 387.90 an
ounce.
The chief factor behind the rise was concern about the situation in South
Africa, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the world's platinum
supplies. Although analysts thought the unrest was unlikely to result in a
miners' strike they said the possibility made it too risky to go short
during the present rally.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, had serious doubts
about the price rise, however. He thought the market was not taking
sufficient account of weakening Japanese economic activity and suggested
that Thursday's 0.5 per cent cut in the US discount rate 'smells of panic in
the face of a slowing US economy,' and was therefore negative for the
platinum price.
He said the discount rate cut was positive for gold, which rose Dollars 2.35
this week to Dollars 346 an ounce, but added that a rising gold price would
stimulate selling by producers and stockholders.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange the cocoa market put in its
strongest performance of the year so far as producers resisted the
temptation to sell into a technical rally. Dealers saw the rise, which
lifted the September position by Pounds 55 to Pounds 590 a tonne, mainly as
a reaction against the 16 1/2 -year lows reached last week.
The rally appeared to have run out of steam on Thursday, when a small
setback was registered, but after a shaky start yesterday the upward trend
was resumed and the September price ended Pounds 15 up on the day.
Further talks on the renegotiation of an International Cocoa Agreement with
price stabilisation clauses, are to start on Monday in Geneva.
Coffee prices also moved ahead, encouraged by US investment fund buying,
before slipping back yesterday in thin trading. London's September futures
position closed yesterday at Dollars 717 a tonne, down Dollars 5 on the day
but Dollars 31 up on the week.

FT  04 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome doubts revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP bounce in the price of Wellcome was believed by some traders to
reflect concern about the forthcoming share flotation. The shares jumped 21
yesterday to 877p, as some traders appeared to be covering positions in a
hurry.
One senior analyst commented that several marketmakers had left themselves
short of Wellcome stock ahead of the proposed issue of between 25 per cent
and 48.6 per cent of the Trust's shares. However, concern has grown that
Wellcome Trust might decide that the current share price was too low and,
therefore, might postpone the flotation. Such a decision would be likely to
squeeze the share price up sharply, inflicting severe losses on dealers with
uncovered positions. Some dealers perceived yesterday's buying as a rush to
cover.
However, a source close to the company said yesterday; 'With the book for
share bids due to open on Monday it comes as no surprise to see the bears
covering their positions.'
Forte setback
Hotels and leisure group Forte, already suffering from worries over the
proposed sale of its contract catering arm, confirmed the market's fears
after trading hours last night. The board announced that negotiations with
Compass and ARA, prospective buyers for Gardner Merchant, the contract
subsidiary, had been terminated. The shares closed a net 9 lower at 185p
with 2.9m traded and traders predict a further heavy fall when dealing
re-opens on Monday. A line of 1m shares is believed to be hanging over the
market.
Press reports, that the sale negotiations were about to collapse had already
sent the shares into retreat early yesterday, making Forte the biggest loser
in the FT-SE 100 index.
Some analysts suggested that Forte had declined the Pounds 500m to Pounds
550m initially offered by Compass, hoping for a higher offer. Compass is
believed to have tried to reduce its original offer because of the fall in
the stock market. Also, it was expected to raise part of the funding for the
deal by means of a share issue, which could have proved difficult in the
current climate.
Compass yesterday asked the Stock Exchange to lift the share suspension
imposed at the end of May. Analysts were predicting a sharp decline for the
shares on Monday.
A holiday on Wall Street gave Glaxo Holdings a chance to pick itself up
after a bad week and the stock was one of the most heavily traded in the
London market yesterday. The shares were 17 down at 636p in early trading
reflecting a sharp Thursday night fall in New York for the American
Depositary Receipts.
However, Wall Street was closed for a extended July 4 weekend yesterday and
the disappearance of US sellers allowed the shares to rally in London and
close 8 better at 661p on turnover of more than 8m.
ICI recovered slightly after recent heavy falls, bouncing 4 to 1174p.
Mention of ICI yesterday contained incorrect figures for the 1991 sales of
ICI's headline drug, Tenormin. The correct figure was Pounds 660m with
around Pounds 327m coming from the US.
Banks made strong progress but gains owed more to marketmakers closing short
positions than to genuine buying.
Barclays put on 11 to 339p and NatWest 10 to 327p, closely followed by Abbey
National which added 8 at 284p.
The better showing by the equity market was behind the good performance of
composite insurers where Commercial Union, said to have been recommended by
Strauss Turnbull, the broking house, rose 8 to 476p. Royal Insurance rallied
3 to 214p and Sun Alliance put on 8 to 274p.
British Gas retained its position as the most heavily traded stock in the
energy sector, with the shares edging ahead 2 to 252p after exceptionally
heavy turnover of 17m shares. The group issued an announcement to the market
that it had told regulator Ofgas that it should earn a rate of return on its
gas transmission business of 6.7 per cent and 10.8 per cent on new
investment.
Some specialists adopted the view that such a requirement would lead to a
scrap with Ofgas which would ultmately mean the company being referred to
the Monopolies Commission. Others in the market said that it was by no means
certain that Gas would have any more to lose by seeking a MMC referral.
British Petroleum, suffering the roughest of rides in the market since the
resignation of former chief executive and chairman Mr Bob Horton two weeks
ago, eased 2 to 210p with turnover reaching 12m shares. After the big slide
in the BP share price many UK funds have been switching out of Shell and
back into BP.
Hints of a broker downgrade left Burmah Castrol 6 off at 583p. There was
more big activity in Lasmo where the shares recently plummeted as the sale
of its Californian downstream assets brought in less than had been expected
before staging a strong rise on the back of takeover rumours. Suggestions in
the market were that a bid had been lined up, but was pulled at the last
moment. Lasmo shares were 7 firmer at 173p.
Regional electicity stocks suffered profit taking, with the Electricity
Package dipping to close 22 down at Pounds 3213.
BT's elevation to the County 30 list of best buys and the passing of the
deadline for the second payment on the partly-paid shares prompted a
significant upturn in both classes of BT stock. The 'old' settled 9 higher
at 343 1/2 p ans the 'new' 8 1/2 to 242 1/2 p.
The building sectors included another major casualty in British Dredging
where a profits warning led marketmakers to lower the shares by 38 to 80p.
Heywood Williams, which earlier in the week shocked the market by issuing a
similar warning, slipped 2 more to 269p.
A profits downgrade by Kleinwort Benson is reported to have caused the
decline in TI Group, which held a presentation at the securities house on
Thursday. The shares fell 9 to 336p with a large line of stock said to be
overhanging the shares. BAA added 10 to 670p following an analysts'
presentation at Heathrow Airport yesterday.
Shares in BM Group jumped 25 to 145p, after the company issued an upbeat
trading statement and predicted an improved dividend. A change of view by
one securities house gave a much needed fillip to Pearsons. The leisure and
media conglomerate's shares, which have fallen more than 60p in the past two
weeks rallied 15 to 375p.
County NatWest reversed its short-term recommendation from sell to hold
after deciding that the shares had run back too far. County believes the
balance sheet is sound and there is positive news surrounding BSkyB in which
Pearson has a significant stake. However, it is maintaining its recently
reduced 1992 profit forecast of Pounds 181m, which is believed to be at the
top of the range of estimates.
Reed International also benefited from the improved sentiment surrounding
Pearson. It firmed 8 to 523p.
Carlton Communications fell 8 to 600p after the company's joint broker was
said to have downgraded its profits forecast.
Cazenove never comments on market talk but traders said it had trimmed its
forecast for the current year's profit to Pounds 102m from Pounds 106m and
for 1993 to Pounds 128m from Pounds 132m. One dealer said the cuts brought
Cazenove into line with the rest of the market and the stock had been a very
good performer over the past three months so a few people had taken profits.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira under heavy pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS swept through the markets yesterday, forcing at least two European
central banks to intervene to support their currencies.
With the New York markets closed and next week's summit of the Group of
Seven industrialised nations imminent, the day was ripe for speculation, and
the lira bore the brunt.
The trouble began in the morning. Rumours, ranging from a D-Mark revaluation
this weekend - which would put pressure on the weaker European currencies -
to Italian banks being ordered to stop trading lire, combined to put the
Italian currency under heavy pressure.
The Bank of Italy firmly denied that it had ordered Italian banks to stop
quoting lira prices but as the currency dropped to 760.25 per D-Mark, two
lira down on its mid-day fixing, it was forced to intervene twice during the
afternoon. The plunge took the currency to within five lire of its floor
against the D-Mark in the European Monetary System grid.
The lira has been under pressure since the Danish rejection of the
Maastricht treaty at the start of June. Investors are afraid that Italy will
not get its public accounts into order without the discipline of European
economic convergence rules. But yesterday's run on the currency, coming only
a day after Italy's new treasury minister said a stable lira was the centre
of the government's economic policy, reflected just how nervous investors
have become.
The lira recovered some ground to trade at 759.20 to the D-Mark by
mid-afternoon. It closed at 757.5 per D-Mark.
The lira speculation added to nervousness about the peseta and the Bank of
Spain announced that it too was intervening to support the currency. Worries
about public spending being out of control have undermined Spanish markets
in recent weeks.
The pound did not escape the traumas. It moved in line with the weaker
currencies, dragged down by the D-Mark's gain. The French franc held its own
against the D-Mark.
One other rumour doing the rounds was that sterling would join the narrow
bands of the ERM this weekend accompanied by a cut in base rates. The UK
currency fell quite heavily during the afternoon but bounced back to close
at DM2.8950 against a previous close of DM2.9025.
'If there was any central bank support it was done very secretly,' said one
dealer.
There was one beneficiary of the turmoil - the dollar. 'The dollar simply
drifted while attention focused on the weaker ERM currencies,' said Mr
Michael Feeny, market analyst at Sumitomo Bank. The US currency edged a
little higher in late trade, closing in London at DM1.5165 against a
previous close of DM1.5135.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut rumoured
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK money markets were awash with rumours of a base rate cut after the
Bank of England shaved its long term money market rates in morning
operations.
A feeling of uncertainty already prevailed after the US Federal Reserve cut
its discount rate on Thursday.
So when the Bank of England cut  1/32 of a point off its band-3 and band-4
rates to 9 5/8 per cent and 9 9/16 per cent respectively, speculation of a
base rate cut swept the market.
Three month money fell from around 10 per cent before the early operations
to 9 27/32 per cent afterwards.
The other, more likely, interpretation of the Bank's move was that it was
trimming its dealing rates to keep them in line with market rates which had
edged lower on Thursday following the US discount rate cut.
One trader said: 'The Bank has been saying for quite a while that from time
to time it will change the rates at which it intervenes in bills to more
closely reflect the market rates.'
Among optimistic traders the first interpretation took precedence, but
opinion was divided.
'We are not sure about it here,' said one trader yesterday afternoon.
'We still think that UK rates are dependent on German rates and I think the
sterling market exchange rate is still not firm enough for another cut.'
Activity in sterling futures was extremely bullish. The September contract
traded in a 16 basis point range, touching a high of 90.41 before settling
at around 90.35.
The December contract moved up by around 11 basis points to around 90.59.
The rumours of a base rate cut made it difficult for the Bank to meet its
forecast liquidity shortage as dealers held on to their assets.
An initial shortage of Pounds 2.1bn was revised to Pounds 2.3bn later on. In
the early round, when the Bank cut its long rates, it purchased only Pounds
266m of bills.
This included Pounds 2m of band-3 bills at 9 5/8 per cent and Pounds 4m of
band-4 bills at 9 9/16 per cent.
In further morning operations the Bank bought Pounds 94m of bills.
In the afternoon the Bank bought Pounds 938m of bills and provided late
assistance of Pounds 585m.
With the shortage unmet, the overnight rate rose sharply to around 16 per
cent.

<TEXT>
BANCA del Gottardo reports an 11 per cent rise in cash-flow to SFr50.1m
(Dollars 36.50m) in the first half, but warned that the unfavourable
economic situation and the need for high loan loss provisions would make it
difficult to do as well in the second half.
The bank, in which Sumitomo Bank of Japan has a controlling stake, said the
strong result was due mainly to a surge in foreign exchange trading. Also,
in spite of a considerable contraction in new issue activity, commission
business developed satisfactorily.

FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: ITT nets Dollars 600m quarterly
gain on Alcatel share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, said it would record a third-quarter extraordinary
gain of Dollars 600m as a result of the sale of its 30 per cent shareholding
in Alcatel, the French telecommunications company, to Alcatel Alsthom,
Alcatel's French parent company.
The Alcatel share disposal - which will involve the payment to ITT of
Dollars 3.7bn in cash and stock between now and 1994 - was first announced
in March and completed yesterday.
ITT said it might use some of the proceeds of the disposal to buy back its
own shares: the ITT board in May approved the repurchase of up to 25m
shares.
Alcatel was first formed in 1986 when ITT sold its European
telecommunications businesses to Compagnie Generale d'Electricite of France
(CGE) in exchange for Dollars 1.3bn and 37 per cent of the combined CGE-ITT
operations.
Two years ago ITT began disengaging from the Alcatel shareholding by selling
a 7 per cent stake in Alcatel to CGE for Dollars 640m, thus reducing its
equity interest in Alcatel from 37 to 30 per cent.
The Alcatel share sale involves an immediate Dollars 1bn cash payment to ITT
from Alcatel-Alsthom, which was ITT's joint venture partner in Alcatel.
As part of the transaction, ITT also received 9.1m newly issued shares in
Alcatel Alsthom, giving the US group a 7 per cent stake that had a value of
Dollars 1.lbn based on Thursday's closing share price of FFr638 (Dollars
125.09). ITT has agreed to retain these shares for five years.
The balance of the Dollars 3.7bn of payments to ITT will come in the form of
cash over the next two years.
A year from now ITT will be paid Dollars 766.8m, while the final payment of
Dollars 816.6m will occur in July 1994.
Rand Araskog, ITT chairman, has meanwhile been named to the board of Alcatel
Alsthom.

FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cargill sheds its secretive
image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARGILL, the Minnesota-based grain trading and commodity trading empire that
ranks as the biggest privately-held company in the US, yesterday announced a
28 per cent rise to Dollars 450m in earnings for the year ended May, 1992.
The publication of the profits, which marked the first time Cargill had done
so in its 127-year history, is part of an attempt by the company to shed its
secretive image.
Cargill said cash-flow for the 12 months increased to just over Dollars 1bn
from Dollars 885m in the 1990-91 period. The group's turnover for 1991-92,
which was not disclosed, is believed to have been about Dollars 49bn.
The company, which is majority controlled by the Cargill and MacMillan
families, did not provide any breakdown of earnings or turnover. It is
believed, however, that the grain trading business, which accounts for much
of Cargill's revenues, was hurt by the slump in US farm exports. Cargill is
estimated to handle about a quarter of total US grain exports.
Cargill employs a workforce of more than 60,000 people in 54 countries and
divides its operations into five main divisions.
These are its grain and commodity trading; its industrial holdings in steel
cutting, fertiliser production, salt mining and resin manufacture; its meat
business; its agricultural operations in feed and seeds; and its food supply
division.

FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Braniff decides to call it a day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRANIFF International Airlines, a small US airline that last year filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, said
yesterday it had ceased all operations, including all regularly scheduled
flight service.
The privately held Texas-based airline, which did not reveal any of its
operating figures, assets or liabilities, attributed the shutdown to the US
fare wars that resulted in ticket prices which undercut Braniff's fares and
caused substantially lower yields.
Braniff also said 'a substantial amount' of summer airline traffic, normally
a high volume period, was diverted to the major carriers.
Braniff said it was unable to meet its current obligations because the
reduced prices available at the bigger airlines, together with the loss of
passenger traffic, had negatively affected its cash flow.
The company added it was considering legal action over the pricing practices
which led to its halt in trading.
Passengers holding Braniff tickets were advised to contact other airlines to
see if the tickets would be accepted.
The present incarnation of Braniff was formed in 1989 when the original
Braniff Inc went bankrupt and two property developers - Mr Jeffrey Chodorow
and Mr Arthur Cohen - paid Dollars 313,000 for the Braniff name and
operating manuals.
The investors then bought Emerald Air, another bankrupt airline, and changed
its name to Braniff.

FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: OMV and Verbund to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER A reorganisation plan for Austria's state-owned industrial companies,
the government is planning to merge OMV, the oil company, with
Verbundgesellschaft, the largest utility.
The move would create an energy group with a turnover in excess of Sch85bn
(Dollars 4.2bn) and would help relieve the financial strains at Austrian
Industries, the state holding company which owns 72 per cent of OMV.
Verbund itself is 51 per cent controlled by the government, with the rest of
the company's equity publicly owned and listed on the Vienna bourse.
Verbund is expected to acquire at least 50 per cent of OMV, which is worth
about Sch10bn at stock market prices, although Walter Fremuth, Verbund
chairman, has said he would pay less than market value for the OMV stake.
The deal would give Austrian Industries a much needed cash injection and
bolster the group's plans for a public flotation in 1993. These have been
threatened by heavy and continuing losses at AMAG, the group's aluminium
offshoot.
Analysts believe a slimmed-down Austrian Industries reduced to its remaining
steel, aluminium and engineering activities, would pose less of a problem in
terms of profit prospects, borrowings and investment attractions in the
event of a public issue of shares.
But the loss of OMV would constitute a setback for Austrian Industries
chairman Hugo Michael Sekyra, who until recently had hoped to float the
group as a whole on to the Vienna bourse.
However, the merger of OMV and Verbund has still to cross a number of
hurdles, notably the tangled webb that constitutes the Austrian political
scene.
The planned reorganisation is the brainchild of the new minister of
transportation and nationalised industries, Viktor Klima, a Social Democrat
and former OMV executive.
In contrast, Verbund is under the control of the ministry of economics,
which is the in hands of the opposing conservative People's Party.

FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Continental fends off Pirelli
voting plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HANOVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between Pirelli and Continental, two of Europe's biggest tyre
groups, plumbed new depths of hostility yesterday when Pirelli was
out-manoeuvred in its attempt to remove shareholder voting restrictions at
Continental.
The defeat for the Italian company, which last year abandoned plans to merge
with the German group, came at Continental's annual general meeting in
Hanover.
In front of several hundred shareholders Mr Ulrich Weiss, chairman of the
Continental supervisory board, ruled that the voting rights on Pirelli's
direct and indirect shareholding in Continental would remain limited to 5
per cent.
This was the second time that Pirelli had sought to remove a rule which
limits shareholders' votes in Continental to 5 per cent no matter how big
that shareholders' stake. Pirelli has 5 per cent of Continental and options
over a further 33.4 per cent.
However, Pirelli was able to inflict an immediate counter-blow by
withholding its support for Continental's move to increase its nominal share
capital by DM150m (Dollars 98.6m) as a prelude to a rights issue.
For technical reasons, Pirelli was able to vote its full holding on this
point and the motion obtained only a 50 per cent vote compared to the
required 75 per cent.
Mr Weiss's decision over voting rights provoked a furious reaction from Mr
Gert Silber-Bonz, chairman of Pirelli's German operations.
He delivered a short statement to say that Pirelli was 'dismayed' at the
'absolutely unwarranted decision'. He said Pirelli would challenge the
decision and all others taken by the meeting in the courts.
The decision - which was greeted with cheers from many small shareholders -
came despite a last-minute bid from Pirelli to persuade Continental that its
option agreement did not breach the rule which limits votes in Continental
to 5 per cent.
Mr Weiss, a main board director at Deutsche Bank with responsibility for its
Italian operations, told the meeting that Continental's independence would
be threatened if Pirelli were allowed to exercise its full voting rights.
'I believe that the elimination of voting rights restrictions is not in the
interest of the company at the present time,' he said, 'or of small
independent shareholders. If Pirelli made use of its option, it would have
control of the company'.
Yesterday's events are likely to provoke a prolonged bout of litigation
between the two companies. It was in December last year that they abandoned
merger talks after more than a year of often acrimonious negotiations.
Last year Pirelli won a vote to get rid of the voting restrictions, but this
decision was never enacted pending an appeal to the Hanover court. The court
recently annulled the decision, on the basis that Pirelli failed to reveal
that it spoke more than 25 per cent of Continental's shares.
Continental's chairman, Hubertus von Gruenberg, expressed disappointment a
the failure of the capital move.
He said Continental would consider listing its Contitech unit on the German
stock market next year and would also consider other measures to raise
funds.
