Demand for pepper has increased in the wake of the attractive prices quoted
for almost all black and white grades, reports Man-producten. The weaker US
dollar and the soft undertone of the market makes prices in European
currencies extremely cheap. Indonesian white pepper is offered at Dollars
1,175 a tonne cif and black pepper grade 1 from various origins at Dollars
900 cif. Sarawak's new crop is being harvested; the Indonesian and Brazilian
crops are to be expected soon.

W&amp;A INVESTMENT, the diversified South African consumer and industrial group,
has bought a 'substantial' foreign scaffolding business for R118m (Dollars
42.7m).
Mr Jeff Liebesman, W&amp;A chairman, said it was too sensitive to disclose the
name of the company.
Local sources have named the target as the Kwikform scaffolding business of
Australia.
W&amp;A has financed the initial payment of R88.5m through a vendor placing of
22m convertible debentures and 1m new shares, all valued at R4 each.
W&amp;A says it expects substantial rationalisation benefits from the
transaction and, in the medium term, a significant contribution to profits.
The acquisition will make W&amp;A one of the world's largest scaffolding
companies.

FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: DM600m operating loss at
Lufthansa

<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, made an operating loss of DM600m
(Dollars 375m) in the first five months of this year and is talking with
trade unions about increases in working hours and delays in pay increases.
'We have to move a big mountain,' said Hans-Helmut Ebersbach, personnel
director, about the need to reduce labour costs. Because of higher living
expenses, pay reductions were out of the question. 'So we have to be more
efficient with fewer employees at the same income levels,' he said in an
internal publication.
The airline, in which just over half the shares are owned by the state,
incurred a pre-tax loss of DM386m during the first quarter of 1992.
It said yesterday that it did not expect to end this year in the black. The
public sector workers' strike in May, which led to airport disruptions, cost
the group a further DM60m in lost profits.
Under its new chief executive, Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa has emphasised the
need to lift productivity and reduce costs at a time of intense competition.
Like other airlines, it has suffered from price competition across the
Atlantic and wants agreement with a US airline to increase its penetration
of North America.
Mr Weber has also inveighed against what he regards as the restrictive
attitude of the US government towards allowing greater access to European
airlines.
Last year, Lufthansa made a loss of DM301m before tax against a profit in
1990 of DM142m.

GOODMAN Fielder Wattie (GFW), the Australian foods group, is set to become
one of the largest flour millers in continental Europe following agreement
to acquire assets from Wessanen, the Dutch foods producer, for some ADollars
200m (USDollars 149m).
The assets to be acquired include four flour mills, three bakeries and one
starch plant and will be made through GFW's Dutch-based subsidiary, Meneba.
GFW expects to complete the deal in about three months.
Mr Michael Nugent, GFW managing director, yesterday described the purchase
as the largest and single most important step in the company's European
development since the Meneba acquisition in 1988.
'GFW's share of the Dutch flour market will increase from about 35 per cent
to about 62 per cent and its share of the Dutch baked foods market will
increase by about 3 percentage points to 25 per cent,' he said. 'GFW's
stated strategy in Europe specifically targets milling and baking as the key
areas for development.'
The agreement caps a week of deals for GFW. The company has announced the
ADollars 330m acquisition of Uncle Tobys, the leading Australian cereals
group: and it has given details of a planned ADollars 330m flotation for
Wattie, its New Zealand-based arm.
Mr Nugent said the three deals would increase GFW's sales, profits and
earnings per share in the first year. The company's gearing ratio was also
expected to return to its current level of about 65 per cent within a year.
Wessanen said yesterday that it wants to use the money generated by the sale
of its grain division to finance acquisitions in Europe, Reuter reports from
Amsterdam. 'We hope to have made some acquisitions before the end of this
year,' the company said.
Acquisitions are sought in the cheese, breakfast cereals, ice cream and
frozen snacks sectors. Wessanen is in talks with several European companies,
Wessanen said.

MANNESMANN earnings fell during the first five months of 1992, Reuter
reports from Duesseldorf.
Group sales rose 21 per cent to DM10.4bn (Dollars 6.8bn), mainly due to the
first time inclusion of new units, Werner Dieter, management board chairman,
told the annual meeting.
Mr Dieter gave no profit figures but said that incoming orders jumped by 25
per cent to about DM13bn during the five months, compared with the same
period in 1991.
Mannesmann said earnings in the current year are under pressure from
start-up costs for its D-2 mobile telephone system and new acquisitions.
Outlay for the D-2 network will peak this year, it said.
In the engineering and plant divisions, incoming orders rose 8 per cent to
DM5.6bn while the division's sales rose 4 per cent to DM3.8bn. Sales in the
transport technology division advanced 36 per cent with a 20 per cent rise
in orders.
Five-months sale were flat in its hydraulic engineering division but
incoming orders increased 9 per cent to DM1.4bn.
Triumph Adler, the German arm of the Olivetti group, told the annual meeting
yesterday that sales in the first five months of 1992 were holding level,
but orders, especially domestic orders, showed a clear decline since the
start of May.

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE ownership of Adidas, the German sports shoe and clothing company
remained uncertain yesterday after the lapsing this week of the management
buy-out offer made by Rene Jaggi, the chief executive, and a group of
investors.
The offer, worth nearly DM1bn (Dollars 645m) and including a capital
injection as well as the purchase price, was put on June 26 to Mr Bernard
Tapie, the French financier who bought Adidas two years ago. But no response
was received from his company, Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), and the offer
lapsed after its deadline of last Tuesday had been extended a day.
The buy-out proposal, headed by Charterhouse Development Fund of the UK,
included several institutional investors who are thought to remain
interested in the German company. It was put together by Botts, a small
London-based investment bank. Adidas had no comment.
In Paris, BTF also declined to comment about Mr Jaggi's offer.
The company, which is about to clear its short term debt on the FFr2.2bn
(Dollars 432m) acquisition of Adidas but is still burdened by long term
borrowings, claimed this week it had received two other offers for Adidas as
well as the management package.
Under the terms of BTF's agreement with Adidas' other shareholders, they not
only have pre-emptive rights over its controlling 55 per cent stake in the
company but can also demand that any offer for that holding be extended to
them.
Pentland, the UK consumer products company which holds 20 per cent of
Adidas, has made no secret of its hopes of taking control, but has stressed
it would only do so 'at the right price'.

Kleinwort Benson Investment Trust Management announced yesterday that it had
placed Pounds 22.5m of shares for the launch of its new investment trust.
The placing was made with institutions, stockbrokers and intermediaries, and
Kleinwort Benson is now seeking another Pounds 7.5m via a public offer.
Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust will be the first investment trust to
invest solely in unmatured life assurance endowment policies which have been
surrendered by their original holders.
Levels of surrender for these policies have been very high in the last three
years, as they are often taken out as repayment vehicles for mortgages.
Several companies have started making a market in them - aiming usually at
small investors.
There has also been strong demand for them from continental Europe.
The KEPT aims to spend the first year of its life buying endowments - the
trust will have a fixed life span of 11 years.
The offer for subscription will close on July 21, with dealings expected to
start on July 27. Smith New Court has organised both the placement and the
offer.

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day appoints finance director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBER DAY, the discount retailer which has seen its share price plunge in
the last six months, yesterday appointed Mr David Thompson as group finance
director.
Mr Thompson, 38, was group financial controller at Storehouse until the
recent management reshuffle at the retailing conglomerate. He replaces Mr
Graham Coles, who will become finance director at First Leisure, the hotels
and leisure operator.
Amber Day shares yesterday closed 6p higher at 46p. The shares have fallen
from a peak of 129p last November following rumours and criticism concerning
Mr Philip Green, the group's chairman and chief executive.
Mr Thompson said he had joined Amber Day only after discussing the company
with Mr Coles, who was finance director of Storehouse's BhS for three years
before he joined Amber Day last August.
Mr Thompson said: 'I obviously had to satisfy myself there was nothing
untoward going on. Amber Day has a concept that works and I look forward to
the challenge.'
Amber Day is still looking for a chairman to work alongside Mr Green, who
will continue as chief executive.
Mr Coles' departure was announced on June 15, along with the resignation of
Amber Day's only non-executive director, Mr Leslie Warman.
On the same day, Amber Day said trading for the second half of the current
year - to August 2 - had not come up to budget and full-year profits would
be below stockbrokers' expectations. Analysts accordingly reduced their
forecasts from Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m to about Pounds 12m.
Last year the group more than trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.1m,
thanks mainly to its acquisition in 1990 of the What Everyone Wants discount
chain, which operates in Scotland and the north of England.

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Poor second half at Graig Shipping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'disappointing second half' for Graig Shipping, the Cardiff-based
transport, mineral and investment company, meant that the Pounds 1.7m
pre-tax profit of the first half was reduced to Pounds 1.22m for the year to
March 31. Last time profits were Pounds 1.01m.
The pre-tax result was struck on turnover of Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 37.8m) and
while it included a Pounds 3.57m profit on sale of a ship there was also
Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 641,000) written off investments.
The directors said that the second half result reflected a considerable
downturn in the dry cargo freight market, high costs of a survey and repairs
to the Graiglas merchant vessel, and the strength of sterling against the
dollar.
All the group's subsidiaries and associates had produced disappointing
results apart from North End Oil and restructurings and disposals would be
considered, they said.
Earnings per share worked through at 8.2p (7.2p) and the proposed final
dividend is 2.5p (3p) for a 4.5p (4p) total.

<TEXT>
Losses at Seafield, the Dublin-based group with interests in property,
transport and warehousing, virtually doubled from Pounds 11.48m to Pounds
22.38m in 1991.
The figure was after taking account of exceptional provisions of Pounds
19.52m (Pounds 18.65m), of which Pounds 18.12m (Pounds 13.86m) related to
property write-downs.
Seafield's transport distribution and warehouse division had a good year and
the directors said it was in that area that they intended to focus most of
the company's future thrust.
Group turnover declined to Pounds 22.76m (Pounds 30.7m). Operating profits
of Pounds 2.53m compared with Pounds 9.26m last time. Net interest payable
rose to Pounds 5.39m (Pounds 2.09m).
Losses emerged at 31.9p (15.8p) and at the year end net assets per share
stood at 41p (73p). The shares dipped 1p to 10p.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN BM Group bounc-ed back sharply yesterday after the construction
equipment group put out a lengthy statement underlying the strength of the
company despite the resignation of its influential chairman, Mr Roger Shute.
With remaining members of the board making a grueling tour of its
institutional investors, the shares rose from 111p to 145p.
Mr Shute's resignation on health grounds on June 26, coming amid a flurry of
bad market news, triggered a share price collapse. The company's brokers
then issued a profits downgrading and the shares fell to a low point of 85p
on Wednesday. Only a month ago BM stood at 398p.
BM's board confirmed that it intended to pay an increased final dividend of
at least 2.3p for the year to June 30 as promised at the time of the January
rights issue.
The board also said it was confident that it would be able to recommend
'further significant growth' in the dividend for the current year.
At the dividend level of not less than 4.4p for 1992 (3.4p), the dividend
cover was 'very substantial', the company said.
On current trading BM said it had encountered tough conditions in many of
its markets. Sales had been disappointing in April but had recovered in May
and June.
Adverse currency movements on translation would also hit reported earnings.
On the basis of management accounts received for the first 10 months of the
year, the directors said there would be continued growth in the
profitability of the group.
There would nevertheless be 'modest decline' in earnings per share from last
year's 27.2p as a result of the increase in the number of shares in issue.
BM also said it continued to have strong relations with its important
suppliers.
In the UK, distribution agreements with Hitachi of Japan had recently been
extended for five years; in the US 'strong working associations' continued
with Komatsu Dresser Corp.
The integration of Thomas Robinson, the most recent of the many acquisitions
through which BM has managed to grow rapidly, was proceeding satisfactorily,
the directors said.

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Henlys to resist Cowie bid saying price is
too low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the motor trader, yesterday posted the offer document in its Pounds
27.3m all paper bid for rival Henlys Group. The document forecast interim
profits from Cowie of not less than Pounds 11.5m, a 48 per cent increase
over the previous year. It said current trading was 'encouraging'.
Henlys said it would continue to resist the bid after seeing the offer
document. It said the price was too low compared with Henlys net asset value
of Pounds 47.7m at the end of 1991.
The 1-for-2 offer values Henlys' shares at 72p with Cowie's share price
closing at 144p, up 2p, yesterday. Henlys closed unchanged at 75p. There is
no cash alternative.
In the letter to Henlys shareholders, Sir Tom Cowie, chairman of Cowie,
said: 'Henlys has lost its way.' He contrasted Henlys performance with that
of Cowie. While Cowie increased profits in 1991 from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds
18.2m before tax, Henlys dropped into a loss of Pounds 6.8m. Henlys has also
forecast an interim loss for the current year.
Mr Michael Doherty, chairman of Henlys, said that Cowie's suggestion that
Henlys lacked financial strength was 'a bit rich'. He said Cowie, which has
a large leasing business, had gearing of 350 per cent while Henlys' stood at
60 per cent.
Cowie also said that its management could increase the return on Henlys
assets. Mr Doherty said that Henlys' only problem was its bus and coach
manufacturing business, and Cowie's management had no experience of
manufacturing.

</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, the big Spanish retail bank, yesterday said it would underwrite the
placement of shares in its business that were owned by British Petroleum in
an agreement that concluded an angry dispute between the two institutions.
The shares, which BP had since February been attempting to return to Banesto
under a buy-back clause, were acquired by the British company a year ago
when it paid Pounds 340m for Petromed, the Banesto-owned oil refiner and
distributor.
Under the agreement BP transferred to Banesto 2.9 per cent of equity held in
the Banesto bank and a further 2 per cent of stock in Banesto's industrial
conglomerate.
Banesto said it had already placed 1 per cent of the bank stock with an
unnamed third party at a price of Pta3,000 per share and that the remaining
equity would be placed in a 'gradual and orderly' manner.
The initial 1 per cent sale of the bank stock, which will net BP Pta3bn
(Pounds 16.6m), represents a premium on Banesto bank's current share price
of Pta2,440 but is well down on the Pta3,965 value of the bank's shares when
BP acquired them in the takeover.
BP can also expect to incur a loss on the placement of its Corporacion
Banesto stock as the industrial conglomerate's share price has fallen by
more than 50 per cent in the past year.
In May the buy-back dispute between the bank and the UK refiner came to a
head when BP voted against Corporacion Banesto's 1991 accounts at the
conglomerate's annual meeting. Yesterday BP said the agreement was
'satisfactory' and that hostilities were at an end because 'we are no longer
Corporacion shareholders.'

European Motor Holdings yesterday reported sharply reduced losses for
1991-92, two acquisitions and a share issue to raise Pounds 610,000.
Losses for the year to March 31 of Pounds 1.38m pre-tax compare with Pounds

group.
Turnover on continuing activities amounted to Pounds 23.12m (Pounds 8.62m).
Losses worked through at 18.1p (139.6p) and the dividend is being omitted -
0.5p was paid previously.
The acquisitions are of Mill Garages, a Sunderland-based operator of 13
motor retail franchises, for Pounds 2.59m, and the business and certain
assets of Wiltshire-based Nigel Bristow Toyota, and a garage owned by
Bristow, for Pounds 640,000.
The purchase price for Mill Garages will be satisfied via the issue of 2.3m
new ordinary shares, of which 1.57m are being placed on behalf of the
vendors. The 570,000 shares being issued for the purchase of Bristow are
also being placed on behalf of the vendor.
The share issue to raise Pounds 610,000 is of 540,000 new ordinaries at 112p
per share. The cash will be used to reduce debt of the enlarged group.

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Losses at FNFC rise sharply to Pounds 22.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST NATIONAL FINANCE, the consumer finance and banking group, said
yesterday that it believed it was poised for a significant improvement in
its business in the second half of the year, despite heavy pre-tax losses in
the first six months.
Mr Martin May-Smith, chairman, said that though there were no clear signs of
a recovery in the property market, he thought the worst was now over as far
as the group's businesses were concerned.
He said that the group's gross margin had widened by one percentage point to
ten per cent and that it was now concentrating on less risky but still
profitable business, such as home improvement loans.
Despite this note of optimism, FNFC turned in another set of discouraging
results.
Pre-tax losses for the half year to April 30 were Pounds 22.64m, up from
Pounds 6.24m in the same period last year.
All three divisions of the group were in the red, with the heaviest losses
coming in its consumer credit oper-ations which lost Pounds 12.85m (Pounds
6.47m).
The commercial lending division, which made a Pounds 3.92m profit in the
first half of last year, plunged into a Pounds 5.48m loss. Mr May-Smith said
that this sector was causing especial concern.
There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 16.94m on the group's property
portfolio against losses on immediate sales of undeveloped sites where the
group had received an offer from a potential purchaser in line with current
market prices.
Group turnover excluding the banking business was slightly up on a year ago
at Pounds 21.25m (Pounds 20.3m) though it was down from Pounds 26.06m at the
end of October.
FNFC now has a total loan book of Pounds 1.2bn. Around six per cent of the
group's mortgage customers are said to be in arrears of six months or more.
Bad debt provisions on consumer credit were Pounds 35.7m with a further
Pounds 14m for suspended interest. The total group charge for bad debts was
Pounds 64.5m for the half year, compared to Pounds 120.5m in the whole of
last year.
The group is considering a variety of strategies,including refinancing,
securitisation and asset sales to cover borrowing which falls due during
1993. Mr Tim Ingrams, previously of ANZ Grindlay's, has been appointed
finance director.
Net asset value declined to 89p per share from 118p in April 1991.

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fuller Smith dips 13% in year of mixed
blessings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULLER SMITH &amp; Turner, the west London-based brewer, yesterday reported a 13
per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.01m to Pounds 7.8m. A 'year
of mixed blessings' saw a substantial increase in its beer sales to the free
trade while its own pubs, hotels, and wine shops were hit by recession.
Turnover for the year ended March 28 rose 9 per cent to Pounds 76.23m, but
higher costs reduced operating profits from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 8.52m, and
interest charges of Pounds 722,000 were nearly seven times higher after the
purchase of pubs from Allied-Lyons.
Earnings per share, helped by a one-off tax credit of Pounds 1m, rose 3 per
cent from 24.38p to 25.18p but would otherwise have declined to 21.15p.
However, a final dividend of 4.46p - reflecting 'optimism for the future' -
makes a payment 10 per cent higher at 6.71p.
Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman, said the current year had started well with
beer production up, but hotels still affected by recession. 'It is extremely
difficult for me to indicate when there will be a full recovery.'
Fuller's brewed a record 113,000 barrels of beer last year as sales of
cask-conditioned ales to the free trade increased 52 per cent. Volumes of
its London Pride brand rose 23 per cent.
Free trade gains were made without giving excessive discounts, Mr Fuller
said. Further benefits were expected from a trading agreement with Bass in
southern England, and the company was spending Pounds 1.76m on expanding the
Chiswick brewery.
Exports - to North America, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean and France
 -increased 20 per cent and now accounted for 4 per cent of production.
Beer volumes sold in Fuller's own estate fell 5 per cent, in spite of the
acquisition of 44 more pubs. 'The severity of the recession affecting the
average pub customer was certainly greater than we had expected,' Mr Fuller
said.
Profits from the company's 77 managed pubs and three hotels were Pounds 1m
lower and sales through its wine shops fell by Pounds 335,000.

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: TI and Dowty integration starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP, which last month successfully bid for Dowty, has announced the
first phase of a corporate reorganisation to integrate the aerospace and
information technology group.
Mr Bruce Ralph, Dowty's former chief executive who left the Dowty board on
Thursday, will remain as a consultant to Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI's
chairman and chief executive.
Mr Roy Roberts, Dowty chairman, and Mr Reg Moore, finance director, have
already resigned from the board.
The reorganisation will lead to the closure of Arle Court House, Dowty's
headquarters outside Cheltenham where the company's founder George Dowty
built the business that supplied landing gear to all makes of RAF aeroplane
that flew in the second world war.
TI made the announcement, which will mean 70 job losses, to clarify local
uncertainty about the future of the company which has long been the area's
largest private sector employer.
While reorganisation of Dowty's operating businesses is being examined there
are as yet few changes in the operating structure.
Mr Norman Askew and Mr Jim Lightfoot, respectively TI's and Dowty's managing
director of aerospace, remain in charge of separate companies based in
Abingdon and Cheltenham. Both will report to Mr Sid Taylor, TI's chief
operating officer. 'This is not the final picture,' TI said. 'Sid Taylor
will sit down and discuss how best to run the aerospace division in the
longer term.'
Mr Lewinton said he had been impressed with the quality of Dowty. 'All that
we have learned about Dowty so far confirms that our strategy of
concentration on its core specialist engineering businesses is well
founded.'
TI is negotiating with a number of people who had expressed an interest in
the information technology business which TI said it would sell if it won
the bid. 'We do not drag our feet. We want to concentrate all our efforts on
the core business of Dowty.'

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Ferromet plunges to Pounds 13m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERROMET Group, the USM-quoted metals trader, plummeted from profits of
Pounds 624,000 to pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.9m in the year to December 31.
Its shares were unchanged at  3/4 p.
It said its accounts would be qualified by the auditors because, as
previously reported, Ferromet Resources, had been placed into Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings by some of its bankers. It is the group's principal
operating subsidiary in the US and 'a large part of the group in terms of
assets and earnings', according to Mr Roger Wain, group chairman.
Mr Wain said a full provision had been made in the accounts against the
group's investment in the US subsidiary, though he declined to specify its
size. He reiterated the comments he made in March that the board was in
discussions with prospective new investors.
Turnover in 1991 expanded to Pounds 73.6m (Pounds 48.3m), boosted by the
acquisition of Cronite Alloys from the receiver in June 1991 and of Missouri
Precision Castings (now under Chapter 11) in July. Operating losses amounted
to Pounds 8.48m (profits Pounds 2.47m) after administrative expenses of
Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 2.69m). Net interest payable grew by almost Pounds 1m
to Pounds 2.72m and there were exceptional charges of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds
44,000).
Retained losses came to Pounds 12.8m (profits Pounds 256,000). Losses per
share were 6.25p (earnings 0.17p) and there is no dividend for the second
year running.
The board has shrunk to three members - Mr Wain, Mr Hillel, finance
director, and Mr Larry Whyte, who in 1990 was paid more than a third of
group profits for that period. Three directors have resigned since early
December.

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional Pounds 32m gain will bolster
L&amp;G balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL AND General, the life assurance and financial services group, said
yesterday that it was planning to strengthen its balance sheet through a
transaction that would result in an exceptional profit of Pounds 32m for the
six months ended June 30.
The transaction would involve the sale of L&amp;G's UK investment management
businesses - currently owned by the corporate holding company - to L&amp;G's
Society Life Fund and would allow L&amp;G to extract about Pounds 42m of
shareholders' funds in the life fund and shift these into the corporate
balance sheet.
The proceeds will include roughly Pounds 10m of consolidated tangible assets
attributable to the four investment management companies. The four are the
pensions management, unit trust management and portfolio management
companies as well as the investment management holding company.
There will be no capital gains tax on the transaction because a period of
poor investment performance in the mid-1980s meant that the value of the
combined companies has risen little over the past 10 years.
As of December 31 1991, the UK investment management businesses had Pounds
17.1bn of funds under management - of which Pounds 12.1m related to L&amp;G
Society Life Fund.
About Pounds 1.7bn of the Society Life Fund is allocated to shareholders
under complex regulatory arrangements set out by the Department of Trade and
Industry. L&amp;G said it had consulted the DTI about the transaction and that
no objections had been raised.
Composite insurance companies have been seeking ways to extract
shareholders' funds from their life funds in order to inject capital into
their general insurance activities which sustained heavy losses over the
past year. In 1991, L&amp;G recorded losses in its general insurance businesses,
particularly mortgage indemnity, of Pounds 176m. Its life insurance
activities, however, recorded profits of Pounds 126m.
Extracting shareholders' funds from the life fund also enables companies to
maintain dividends in the face of heavy losses.
Insurance industry analysts yesterday applauded L&amp;G's move, saying that the
transaction had bolstered the company's ability to maintain its dividend in
line with inflation.
Meanwhile, L&amp;G said the move was justified on managerial grounds as well.

FT  04 JUL 92 / All set for a second-best summit: The prospects for next
week's G7 meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Munich is almost certain to
decide second-best solutions for the world's most pressing problems.
The leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Canada and
the European Commission (which also takes part in most of the talks) are
gathering against the background of a weaker-than-hoped-for world economy
and an increasingly worrying slippage of economic reform efforts in Russia
and the other states of the former Soviet Union.
Their two overriding objectives will be to boost business confidence in the
industrialised world and help as far as possible with economic and social
transformation of the former communist countries and their integration into
the mainstream world economy.
While they may make some progress, the solutions chosen will probably be
less than optimal. Each of the G7 countries has pressing political or
economic concerns at home that are making them inward-looking and which
impose limits on their willingness and ability to co-operate.
Although the summit theme is about shaping a new international partnership
between the former communist countries and the developing world, there is
unlikely to be significant progress on the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks, which is the one issue that could help all.
This year's summit host, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, has ordered a
lean agenda and a short final communique in an attempt to focus the
summiteers' discussions. On Wednesday, after the formal close of the
economic summit, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin will join the group for
lunch and further discussions in the afternoon.
Although there is always a risk that global political problems such as the
bloody civil war in Yugoslavia will hijack the summit, Mr Kohl is determined
that the meeting should live up to its name. The two and a half days of
talks beginning on Monday will therefore focus on economic issues and cover:
world economic developments, and especially the need to enhance the growth
prospects of the leading industrial countries;
how best to help the states of the former Soviet Union overcome growing
economic crisis and secure democracy;
the difficult progress of eastern Europe towards pluralism, democracy and
the market economy;
co-operation between industrialised and developing countries;
the follow-up to the recent Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro; and
plans to make safe Soviet-designed nuclear power stations in the former USSR
and eastern Europe.
The striking thing about the summit agenda is that the first four points
would be greatly advanced by a breakthrough in the long-running Uruguay
Round trade talks. Freer trade and an end to the negotiating stalemate could
also provide the boost to confidence that the world economy needs.
But, although last-minute surprises cannot be ruled out, all the indications
over the past week argue against a solution to the deadlock between the
European Community and the US on agricultural trade at the summit. While the
main players, such as Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, and Mr
Frans Andriessen, the EC's chief trade negotiator, will be in Munich,
pre-summit briefings have deliberately lowered expectations. US officials
and Mr Horst Kohler, the German government sherpa charged with preparing the
summit, have pointed out that a gathering of government leaders is not the
forum for complex technical negotiations.
The discussions will therefore centre on the first two agenda points and on
the nuclear safety problem. Without a trade breakthough, the G7 will be left
with a patchwork of less impressive measures to stimulate growth and help
the former communist nations and the third world.
These measures have been falling into place over the past week. The US cut
its discount rate by half a point to 3 per cent, its lowest level since
1963. Japan's ruling Liberal Democrat Party has proposed the introduction of
an economic growth package that could total between Y6,000bn (Pounds 25bn)
and Y10,000bn later this year. Germany announced a strict 1993 budget and
four-year savings plan that is intended to pave the way for lower interest
rates eventually. But it offers no relief to Germany's partners in the
European Monetary System which are forced to follow the Bundesbank's high
interest rate policy.
All G7 countries are aware that President Yeltsin cannot leave Munich having
suffered a rebuff. After swallowing hard, the industrialised countries are
likely to agree to grant Russia a breathing space of perhaps three or five
years on servicing its official debts. They will also signal their
willingness for the International Monetary Fund to provide Russia with
Dollars 1bn in loans on condition that Moscow gets its budget deficit and
inflation under control.
The summit will give its blessing to practical help such as improved
co-ordination of technical assistance for Russia and the other former Soviet
states through a system of country co-ordination groups. Although
differences remain about how to organise the safety programme for the
Russian-designed nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union and eastern
Europe, the G7 agrees on the need for action.
But the leaders are all having to look inward. Germany is only slowly waking
up to the size of the task of absorbing the former east Germany. US
President George Bush is distracted by the looming November presidential
election. Japan has a weakening economy and a weaker government.
The EC is currently preoccupied with the aftermath of the Danish rejection
of the Maastricht treaty. Italy has only just appointed a new government
after months of difficult coalition building. France is facing its own
referendum on Maastricht in September while the popularity of President
Francois Mitterrand is low. In Canada, Mr Brian Mulroney's government is
trying to deal with complex constitutional problems and has long been below
an approval rating of 20 per cent in public opinion polls. The UK government
has a working majority for a full five years in office: but Mr John Major,
the prime minister, faces increasingly difficult economic problems and
cannot ignore the hostility of part of the Conservative party to the
Maastricht agreement.
The problems faced by Presidents Bush and Mitterrand go a long way to
explaining why a Uruguay Round breakthrough is unlikely, even though all can
agree that the Dollars 320bn paid in farm support each year by the
industrialised world is a waste and that the best way of helping eastern
Europe and Russia would be to open markets for their steel, textiles and
food products.
Officials preparing the meeting admit that the world will not be a very
different place next Thursday, after the leaders and the accompanying
4,000-strong media circus have left Munich. But if it adds a little to
mutual understanding, the G7 gathering will have done some good. In view of
current global uncertainties there is much to be said for Winston
Churchill's remark that 'to jaw-jaw is better than to war-war'.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Letter: Electrical industry training stifled by fragmented
dealings with Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL GALLAGHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My interest was aroused by your article, 'Shephard Investigates
Training Shortfall' (July 1), because on June 30, together with other
leaders of the electrical contracting industry, I met Patrick McLoughlin,
the junior employment minister. We took the opportunity then to raise with
him the difficulties being faced by our electrical contracting training
scheme.
Traditionally, the electrical contracting industry has train-ed 4,500
apprentices per year: important not just for the contracting industry but
for industry at large because 80 per cent of all electricians in the UK are
trained via that scheme.
Following changes over the past few years, which included the scrapping of
the employers' contribution through the levy system, we now have find
ourselves having to negotiate for government support with not one central
body but with 82 Training and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales and
22 Local Enterprise Companies in Scotland.
This, in itself, is difficult enough but the employers, 80 per cent of which
are small companies, face immense bureaucratic procedures if they are to
benefit from government support. It is reaching a point where many of them
are simply refusing to take on apprentices. This, fuelled by the recession,
explains why this year's figure is likely to be 1,000 apprentices or less.
It goes some way towards answering the question which Mrs Shephard intends
to investigate - that is, why Tecs are failing to meet the guarantee of
training places available.
The answer clearly is the creation of a national agency which will allow us
to negotiate with one body. This will mean that our training advisers
throughout the country can get on with the job of training and ensure that
our apprentices achieve National Vocational Qualification standards. Rather
than applying themselves to such training, our advisers are spending
countless hours in negotiations with individual Tecs and on other
meaningless bureaucratic functions. I know that many Tecs share my view that
the system is overly bureaucratic and in need of reform.
The electrical contracting industry will continue to train apprentices but
to do so we work in place. Given the predicted reduction in apprentices, it
is not over-egging the pudding to say that the existing framework could be
brought into question and our ability to continue to train apprentices will
be jeopardised.
This can only result in yet more 16- and 17-year-olds hanging about on
street corners. I want them properly trained so that they can become
valuable members of our society.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Letter: Real reason for going wigless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HENRY VON BLUMENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I do not know Louis Blom-Cooper, but as his neighbour for many years I
have passed him on the stairs both with and without his wig. On balance, I
should say his features are improved by it, for the wig is a handsome piece
of design ('Dear Lord Chancellor. . .', June 29).
Anachronism is a dangerous word to use out of the context of art and
literature. I do not see how the recognised badge of the barrister, worn
daily by thousands of people here and by many court officials in countries
as far away as Africa can be called anachronistic. If it is, so is the
collar and tie or any garment which was worn as long ago as last week.
Nor is it fair to class the protagonists as rationalists and
traditionalists. Some of the anti-wiggers' arguments are fatuous. Who ever
was intimidated by a wig? Traditionalism is rational, and it is natural that
in a legal system substantially based, like the constitution, upon
precedent, lawyers should wear the ancient badge of their trade. Others do.
Why has this campaign against the wig started now? Partly, I suspect,
because the 1960s generation has grown up into high office but is still bent
on chucking away our past. I fear a more sinister, if unconscious, motive.
For years, British Rail's solution to falling standards has been an
advertising campaign and a new image, in the belief that the public can be
tricked. The legal profession has never before faced such a collapse in
public confidence. The solution? Abolish the wig. While they are at it, why
not start referring to clients as 'my customer'?

FT  04 JUL 92 / Letter: Pensions thinking at odds with working patterns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms TRUDY COE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report on June 30 ('Pension age for women may rise') that the
government is moving in favour of equalising the state pension age at 65; a
flexible decade of retirement has apparently been ruled out.
You discuss the options solely in terms of benefits - or losses - to the
exchequer. This is precisely a reflection of the narrowness of government
thinking. The state pension age is critical in influencing individuals'
retirement decisions. A fixed state pension age encourages employees to
think in terms of an arbitrary and absolute end to their working lives. This
is at odds with the trend in working patterns, where flexibility is
paramount. A flexible decade of retirement would allow and encourage
employees actively to think about a range of options rather than
perpetuating the damaging belief that full-time work should end at 65.

FT  04 JUL 92 / A head-on collision over rules of the road: The French
government is in reverse because of its tough, new driving regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The burly Lyons lorry driver barely flinched at the sight of the riot
police. 'We're not looking for a fight, but if the police come we'll do what
we have to,' he said. 'The same goes for the Belgians and the Dutch. No
one's tougher than the French truckers."
For the past four days the roadblocks erected by the Lyonnais and his fellow
truckers have been causing chaos throughout France. At first the television
images of lorry drivers munching baguettes beside their roadblocks seemed
almost comical. But the situation swiftly became more serious as supplies of
food and fuel ran short in many cities, factories laid off workers and
thousands of foreign tourists were trapped behind roadblocks.
The dispute could scarcely have come at a worse time for the French
government, which is desperately trying to improve its poor performance in
the opinion polls in the approach to the Maastricht referendum in September
and next year's general elections. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister,
yesterday summoned ministers to an emergency meeting to try to end the
dispute this weekend. Even if the roads are cleared, the government will be
left assessing the long-term damage of the protest.
The crux of the dispute is the government's apparently laudable attempt to
reduce France's frighteningly high rate of road accidents. There were nearly
9,600 deaths on French roads last year, twice as many as in the UK and at
least 2,000 more than in Germany. A new driving licence system was
introduced on Wednesday as the linchpin of the government's campaign to curb
dangerous driving.
Under the new system all drivers are allocated six points on their licences.
If they commit an offence they forfeit a number of points - three for
drunken driving or two for speeding. Once drivers lose six points they
forfeit their licences for at least six months. Similar systems have already
been introduced - without controversy - in Germany, Britain, Japan and some
US states. But it has caused a furore in France.
The truckers have made the biggest fuss. They argue that they should be
awarded extra points, because as professional drivers they run a higher risk
of losing their licences and their livelihoods.
They have been grumbling on and off for months. But this week their protests
began in earnest. Roadblocks were erected on most of the main motorways. The
cities of Lyons and Toulouse were virtually inaccessible for four days.
Since Wednesday, there have been reports of petrol rationing and food
shortages across France. On Thursday a Peugeot factory was forced to lay off
1,200 of its 2,200 workers because of a parts shortage.
But the lorry drivers are not alone. Paris taxi drivers staged a one-day
strike against the new system last month. Their counterparts in Lille held a
protest yesterday. The usually sedate motorists' association also opposes
the system, which differs from those of some other countries in that drivers
could lose their licences through parking offences alone. When a television
chat-show host asked his studio audience whether they approved of driving
points, the answer was a resounding 'non'.
At first glance the protest seems surprising. France is a highly
centralised, very bureaucratic society. The logistics of the points system
pale beside the complexity of renting an appartment or qualifying for a
driving licence.
But France is also a country where macho motoring is a way of life. Jumping
traffic lights, parking cars on pavements and overtaking from either side of
the opposing car are commonplace. Motorway cafes are crammed with drivers
knocking back their lunchtime plonk. There are so many crashes around the
Arc de Triomphe in Paris that accidents there are not covered by most
insurance policies.
The government is running a public information campaign to spell out the
consequences of this cavalier approach to road safety, but apparently with
little effect. Although the French may not agree with the detailed demands
of the lorry drivers - the motorists' association has threatened to erect
its own roadblocks if the government caves in to the demand for extra points
 -there is general sympathy for the central theme of attacking the points
system.
As a result, the truckers' dispute, which coincides with farmers'
demonstrations, dockers' protests and airline strikes, has not stirred up
much ill-feeling in France. Some French newspapers have even buried the
story on their inside pages. This is not the case in other countries. The
Daily Mail newspaper in Britain slapped 'Fed up with France' across its
front page on Thursday. There were similar, if less overtly francophobic,
headlines in the German, Dutch and Belgian press. The British Embassy in
Paris has issued the type of travel warning usually reserved for war zones.
The French government has been left in an embarrassing position. Mr
Beregovoy has offered a string of concessions to the truckers. He has even
set up a committee to review the points system. He has also threatened to
revoke their licences unless they disperse.
By yesterday morning some barricades had come down and many roads,
particularly in the north, were cleared. Ministers hope the rest of the
roadblocks will be taken down by Monday. The transport ministry has
dispatched regional representatives to remonstrate with the militant
truckers. By early afternoon yesterday enough roads had been cleared to give
the government the confidence to suspend the usual weekend ban on
heavy-goods traffic to speed up the distribution of supplies to shops and
factories.
It may take longer to mop up the political mess. Mr Beregovoy has been at
pains to avoid controversy in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum. This
week he even postponed a potentially tricky piece of medical expenditure
legislation until after the vote.
Last weekend Mr Beregovoy was basking in the reflected glory of President
Mitterrand's flight to Sarajevo. He will spend this weekend counting the
cost of a week in which France - and its government - has virtually been
held hostage by a bunch of truckers.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your report ('Whitehall aims to protect tea ladies', July 2) that Mr
William Waldegrave is to publish a table showing how far government
departments 'have met the targets for market testing their functions' is
most curious.
On June 2, at a meeting with civil service union general secretaries, Mr
Waldegrave repeated and categorically denied that any such targets existed.
The official minute of the meeting confirms that denial. The minister said
that not only were there no targets but confirmed that neither he nor any of
his officials had given an off the record briefing that there were. Surely,
in the name of the open government that the minister has repeatedly said he
supports, he should make it clear whether they exist or not. We have asked
him to deny the existence of targets as openly to the press as he did to us.
We await developments.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J R S EGERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The increase in the savings ratio to 11.5 per cent for the first
quarter is not perhaps as depressing as at first sight it might appear
('Boost to savings ratio, July 1).
Many home owners are now making substantial reductions in their mortgages by
failing to reduce monthly payments in line with falling interest rates. This
voluntary early repayment of principal in the building society sector may
now be running at approaching Pounds 2bn a year, in the order of 1 per cent
of building society mortgages and 0.5 per cent of personal disposable
income. And the amount increases with each cut in mortgage interest rates.
Since the dead weight of debt is a major cause of low turnover and falling
house prices, reductions in indebtedness are helping to create the
conditions for recovery in the housing market.

FT  04 JUL 92 / The light fades at the end of the tunnel: Inflation is under
control, but hopes of a post-election recovery in the UK are crumbling fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Thursday Mr Tim Congdon, a leading City economist, rose at a
stockbroker's seminar to speak on the subject 'When will the recovery
start?'. His opinion was short and to the point. 'With present policies and
interest rates the UK economy will never recover,' he said.
Until recently Mr Congdon, a monetarist, might have been regarded as having
a maverick view. But not any more. Within the past few weeks hopes of a
post-election economic revival have been crumbling fast.
Consumer spending has been disappointing, bankruptcies have continued to
plague the business sector and house prices, after showing signs of
stabilising in the spring, have apparently begun to sink further. This week
the Nationwide Building Society reported a 0.5 per cent fall in the average
house price in June and a 6 per cent drop over the past year.
The London stock market has tumbled by nearly 10 per cent since hitting an
all-time peak in May. Investors are being forced to abandon their hopes of a
profits revival this year as they face a series of chairmen's warnings,
dividend cuts and failed new issues. Economic figures published this week
appeared to show that both the personal and business sectors have been under
pressure. The personal sector's savings ratio rose to 11.5 per cent of
disposable income in the first quarter of the year, the highest level since
the last serious recession 10 years ago.
People are worried about their jobs and income levels. They are also in many
cases burdened by debts. Personal indebtedness is now twice as high in
relation to income as it was in 1982.
As for companies, the improvement in their financial position visible
through 1991 appears to have stalled in 1992. The company sector's financial
deficit jumped to nearly Pounds 4bn in the January-March quarter, and there
are doubts about the ability of many companies - including some as notable
as BP - to continue paying the high dividends which have helped to keep the
stock market relatively buoyant through most of the two years of recession
so far.
Nevertheless the government can claim one significant success for its
economic policies, a sharp fall in inflation. When the UK entered the
European Community's exchange rate mechanism in October 1990 inflation was
more than 10 per cent. Now it is only about 4 per cent. Some economists
think it may sink to 2 or 3 per cent next year.
But is the recession a price worth paying? Many people may find the squeeze
on their incomes intensifying over the next few months. Real personal
disposable income was slightly higher in the first quarter, in spite of the
continuing contraction of the economy, and the increase in average earnings
in nominal terms was surprisingly high at just over 7 per cent year-on-year.
There appear, however, to have been some exceptional payments of bonuses to
beat possible Labour government tax increases. In any case, wage rises are
likely to be very hard to come by in the second half of the year.
The public sector will fully share in the agony. Before the election there
was a wave of pay handouts as the government sought to win favour. But if
the economy fails to produce the 1 per cent growth officially forecast for
this year and the 3 per cent assumed for the first half of next year, the
already formidable levels of budgeted public borrowing will swell still
further.
If next year's public sector borrowing requirement looks like climbing
towards Pounds 40bn (against Pounds 31.5bn forecast), the axe may hover over
public-sector pay and possibly over social security benefits. Tax increases
seem inconceivable, but are they?
However, there is good news for consumers too. Price inflation for many
manufactured goods has all but stopped. The American strategy of devaluing
the dollar is making many imports cheaper, whatever the impact upon the
competitiveness of British companies.
And these are good times for older people free of mortgage worries. Pensions
are little affected by the economic downturn. The real squeeze is being
suffered by people in younger age-groups trapped in houses in which they
have little or no equity, and are losing more value all the time, and by
workers in volatile industries such as construction where wage levels have
actually been tumbling.
People with money to spare are being rewarded. True, the stock market has
weakened, but National Savings and government gilt-edged securities are
paying attractive rates as the authorities press ahead with financing the
deficit. Even those in short-term savings accounts at banks and building
societies are earning comfortably more than the inflation rate.
The other side of the coin, though, is that borrowers are being hammered.
Bank base rates are still 10 per cent, and have fallen only half a point
this year. With the Bundesbank still struggling to bring excessive German
monetary growth under control, short-term prospects for interest rate cuts
are bleak.
The small business sector is being crippled. Property is a disaster area.
The British reliance upon asset-based borrowing, developed over long years
of inflation, is posing serious solvency problems as unprecedented price
falls hit both the commercial and residential property sectors.
Yet the country seems extraordinarily calm. There are no riots by
repossessed homeowners. The army of unemployed is growing but is quiet. The
electorate has just returned the Tory government to power for five more
years, seemingly in approval of its economic policies.
But what if the British economy never recovers?

FT  04 JUL 92 / Man in the News: Ulster's big man lets himself go - Sir
Patrick Mayhew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Usually urbane and upright, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary,
has this week been restless and in peculiarly good humour.
He chuckled before television cameras with Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign
minister. In Winston Churchill's old Admiralty room, now occupied by the
Northern Ireland Office, he cannot sit still.
Only three months in the job, after nine years' service as solicitor-general
and then attorney-general, the former barrister has a mischievous
confidence. 'I never wanted to be a law officer . . . I came into politics
to get away from the law,' he laughs.
His cheer is understandable. Northern Ireland's wretched politics has taken
a rare step forward. On Monday, Unionists, nationalists, and the Irish and
UK governments will gather in London for the most wide-ranging discussion on
the province's future since partition in the 1920s.
The breakthrough is, in large part, Sir Patrick's achievement. His
predecessor, Mr Peter Brooke, constructed a complex talks programme that
nine weeks ago allowed nationalist and Unionists to return to the conference
table.
But Sir Patrick has this week cajoled the recalcitrant and suspicious
participants to agree sufficient common ground for the Irish government to
enter the negotiations. A chink of brightness has crept beneath Northern
Ireland's gloomy history of failed political initiatives and unceasing
terrorist killings.
Whitehall insiders wonder whether Northern Ireland politics has entered a
new chapter. UK Prime Minister John Major is not passionate over the
direction Ulster should take; but he is determined to find a negotiated
solution and has a warm relationship with Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime
minister.
Sir Patrick is more a pragmatist than a visionary. He is unusual among Tory
Northern Ireland secretaries in having expressed to an interest in the
position before his appointment. Oppressive personal security and the
intransigent politics usually deter thrusting ministers.
But Sir Patrick has a strong sense of duty and propriety. During the
'Westland crisis' in 1986 he demanded a full inquiry into the leaking, by
the Department of Trade and Industry, of advice he sent to Mr Michael
Heseltine, then defence secretary. Law officers' advice had to be
confidential, he insisted.
Colleagues report that he is a courteous, straight-backed English gentleman.
He chooses a hard chair to fidget on, not the soft-leather settees in his
office. His first press conference as Northern Ireland secretary was taken
standing up.
Sir Patrick describes Northern Ireland's politicians as 'engaging' - not an
adjective that springs immediately to the minds of many Westminster
politicians. Aged 62, the patrician air is enhanced by a rounded face,
swept-back silver hair and his height. His national service army paybook
said 6ft 4 3/4 in - two inches taller than the Rev Ian Paisley, the
rumbustious leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and hitherto undisputed
'big man' of Ulster politics.
The voice is polished but Sir Patrick is not pompous. His first instruction
at meetings this week with the participants in the talks was to take off
their jackets. He is businesslike, responding to flippancy with a drawn-out,
condescending 'yeeaaas'. He is strongly Christian, but believes religion and
politics have to be kept apart.
In spite of his 'Paddy' nickname, Sir Patrick fears his Irish background is
overplayed. His mother came from an Anglo-Irish Protestant family, which had
been based in County Cork since 1263. But he was born in Berkshire, England,
educated at Tonbridge School and Oxford. As MP for Tunbridge Wells, Kent,
since 1974, he did not make a speech on Northern Ireland before taking
office and first visited the province in the 1980s.
More significant than his national identity, perhaps, is his family's
familiarity with public service, which helps Sir Patrick fit into a job once
described by Pravda as a 'colonial pro-consul'. A great grandfather was a
first lord of the admiralty; a grandfather had a ceremonial post at the
British viceroy's court at Dublin castle.
His Irish roots have led to confusion among participants in the talks about
his attitudes to Northern Ireland - a fog that may perversely have helped in
recent weeks and which he has shown little inclination to clear.
Irish diplomats were initially sceptical. As attorney-general, he presided
over fierce rows between the UK and Ireland over extradition, and upset
nationalists by refusing to prosecute Royal Ulster Constabulary officers for
alleged 'shoot to kill' offences.
But his appreciation of Irish history has forced a reappraisal. 'He may be a
southern Irish Unionist but, first and foremost, he is a Cork man,' says one
Irish official.
Unionists have similarly mixed feelings. They like his dedication but are
not convinced of his motives. Southern Ireland Anglo-Irish families 'are the
sort of people who run up the Union Jack one day and then the Irish
tricolour the next', says a Unionist MP.
With the current round of Northern Ireland talks intended to be private, Sir
Patrick wants to limit public utterances. Yet he says that ultimately the
Northern Ireland secretary has to work himself out of existence. 'My job is
to relieve the people of Northern Ireland of the indignity of having their
local affairs governed for them by Westminster ministers. It is an
indignity, it is an affront and I also think it is an absurdity.'
He is also surprisingly ambitious about what might be achieved by political
talks, apparently rejecting any suggestion that Northern Ireland could be
ruled like any other part of the UK.
Since 1972, when the Unionist-dominated Stormont parliament was dissolved,
the UK government has tried to enable Northern Ireland to become
self-governing, 'to the extent at least that it was when Stormont had
jurisdiction'.
It is probably too much to expect Sir Patrick to get that far. Only a month
is left before the time set aside for the talks expires. A new political
settlement - if one can ever be achieved - will almost certainly require a
fresh set of talks later this year. And, probably, another after that. Sir
Patrick's high spirits will be tested.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The troubles of the G7
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. It is only by
comparison with Boris Yeltsin, the proud beggar whom they will meet next
Wednesday, that the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries seem
kingly. By most other standards their state is much reduced.
US president George Bush, leader of the 'sole remaining superpower' must
wonder whe-ther he will even be at the next summit. Last year's victor over
Saddam Hussein is reduced to hoping, against reasonable hope, that the
Germans and Japanese will do enough to help the Federal Reserve purchase the
votes of the American electorate. After the jump in the unemployment rate to
7.8 per cent last month, hopes are less bright. The response of the Federal
Reserve, another half a percentage point cut in short term US interest
rates, is unlikely to make a timely difference.
Mr Bush will not find rescue abroad. Mr Miyazawa, the Japanese prime
minister, is still more enfeebled than Mr Bush. The Japanese stock market
has declined by 60 per cent from its peak, the economy has slowed sharply
and sluggish growth means that the controversial current account surplus is
likely to be close to Dollars 100bn (Pounds 52.3bn) this year.
All Mr Miyazawa could do is arrive with a carefully packaged fiscal
initiative of Y7,000bn (Pounds 29bn) to Y8,000bn for later this year. At
around 2 per cent of gross domestic product, the boost seems substantial,
but there is less new stimulus than meets the eye. Even if not too little,
for Mr Bush the package comes far too late.
Germany will be no more helpful. The German federal government this week
announced a tight budget for 1993, along with a plan for limiting the
increase in its spending over the next four years to 2 1/2 per cent a year
in money terms. But the implied promise of steadily falling public spending
in real terms is barely credible.
The German government hopes its budget will open the way to lower interest
rates. But Mr Waigel, the German finance minister, can only propose; the
Bundesbank disposes.
Wage increases
Yesterday, Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, pointed
discouragingly to excessive German wage increases and the rapid growth of
D-Mark M3, the broad money aggregate that the German central bank targets.
Monetary growth must first fall, he insisted, if interest rates are to be
cut.
The other European leaders can only hope that the US succeeds in persuading
the Germans to relax monetary policy. Their chances are poor. If German
interest rates do not fall quite soon, however, the malady of the Italians
is likely to become critical, that of the British chronic.
What a fall from grace this has been for those who appeared only two years
ago to be masters of the universe. The world economy is struggling in the
toils of private sector debt deflation. The European economy is struggling
in the toils of German unification. The UK, with that astuteness for which
it has long been noted, is struggling with both: German interest rates and
American indebtedness, a combination to sadden the heart of chancellor
Norman Lamont.
Structural deterioration
When the world runs out of creditworthy private borrowers, it makes sense
for the public sector to put itself forward. Over the last three years,
public sectors have certainly not been backward in coming forward. But one
can have too much of a good thing.
According to last week's OECD Economic Outlook, the fiscal stance of every
G7 country, bar Canada, has shown either no improvement or a structural
deterioration since 1989. In Japan, France, Italy and the US that structural
deterioration has been less than 1 per cent of GDP. In the case of Germany,
the deterioration of more than 4 per cent of GDP has the good excuse of
unification. Once again the UK is the dunce, with a structural deterioration
of almost 2 per cent of GDP.
With debt deflation making low real interest rates essential and fiscal
deterioration helping to keep long term real interest rates up, prospects
for strong recovery are modest. Low short term real interest rates are
necessary. But not only do they not appear to be enough; in Europe they are
not even available.
Little then can be expected from the gathering in Munich of weak leaders,
presiding over feeble economies. This does not mean that the meeting will be
entirely useless. A gesture in the direction of Mr Yeltsin can at least be
expected.
Unhappily, the leaders of the G7 have built up a reputation for
ineffectiveness where they ought to have been effective. Mr Helmut Kohl has
said that the summit should increase investor and consumer confidence. As
the leaders knew when they met in Houston in 1990 and in London last year,
the best way to increase confidence would to ensure agreement in the Uruguay
Round of multilateral trade negotiations. If they are unable to deliver on
their promises where they are in direct control of the outcome, it would be
foolish to expect more on overall economic performance, where they are not.

FT  04 JUL 92 / Slovaks block Havel's re-election
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S President Vaclav Havel failed yesterday to win re-election
to the federal presidency, as Slovak parliamentarians blocked his candidacy
in the federal assembly.
The popular playwright-turned-president, whose election to the federal
presidency after the 1989 revolution moved enthusiastic crowds to tears, was
quietly eclipsed by a handful of Slovak members of parliament who failed to
give him the required majority of votes in the Slovak side of the federal
assembly.
According to an amendment to the 1968 constitution, a presidential candidate
must receive a majority of votes in both the lower chamber of the federal
assembly and in the upper chamber, where Czech and Slovak parliamentarians
vote separately and have equal weight.
This constitutional set-up, which Mr Havel once described as 'a Swiss cheese
full of holes', gave a virtual power of veto to the members of the Movement
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the nationalist group led by Mr Vladimir
Meciar which won 37.2 per cent of the vote in Slovakia in last June's
elections.
Mr Meciar had pledged to block the re-election of Mr Havel because the later
called on voters not to support candidates with 'dictatorial tendencies' - a
thinly veiled reference to the Slovak politician.
Mr Havel will stay in office until October 5 unless another presidential
candidate is elected by then. A second round of voting is planned for July
16 and potential alternative candidates have until then to come forward. In
theory, Mr Havel could run again in subsequent rounds if no other candidate
has yet been elected.
Members of the Civic Democratic party (ODS), the Czech party led by Mr
Vaclav Klaus, the Czech premier, will equally be able to block another
candidate, however. Mr Klaus has repeatedly said that he will not support
another candidate for the federal presidency.
Failure to elect a president will plunge the fragile Czechoslovak federation
deeper into a post-electoral crisis which threatens to pull the Czech and
Slovak republics apart. According to a recent agreement between ODS and
HZDS, the Czech and Slovak parliaments have until September 30 to decide on
the future of the federation.
The political life of Mr Havel, who enjoys the loyal support of most Czechs,
may not be completely over. The new Czech parliament, meeting for the first
time last week, promptly said it would prepare a Czech constitution
providing for a president. Mr Havel, refusing to allow for a quick burial of
the 74-year-old federation, has refused to comment on the possibility that
he may eventually become president of an independent Czech republic.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST round of men's fashion collections kicked off in Paris yesterday
against the gloomy backdrop of the fragile world economy and the news that
the sales of the top Paris fashion designers fell last year for the first
time in more than a decade.
The latest figures from the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, which
represents the designers, show a decline in sales of 11 per cent to
FFr3.24bn (Pounds 330m) last year from FFr3.65bn in 1990. This fall follows
a decade of uninterrupted growth for the Paris designers who, despite the
rise of other fashion centres such as Milan and New York, still dominate the
international fashion scene.
However, the Paris designers have been hit, like other areas of the luxury
goods industry, by the US recession and Europe's economic slowdown. The US
economy is now recovering, but the fashion houses are being further
threatened by financial worries in Japan, another big market.
This weekend's collections are an important test of market conditions. The
shows started yesterday morning when Dirk Bikkembergs, a young Belgian
designer, unveiled his collection for spring next year at an art gallery in
the Bastille area.
True to the tradition of designer fashion, the show began nearly an hour
late with empty seats as many buyers had not yet arrived from Milan, where
Giorgio Armani held his show on Thursday.
The mood of the men's collections is restrained. Thierry Mugler has stopped
holding shows and displays his men's collection in his showroom. Comme des
Garcons does not use professional models. Its show, yesterday, featured
amateurs such as actor John Hurt.
Despite the downturn the fashion houses are still expanding their menswear
ranges. Yohji Yamamoto is launching its Ys line, a cheaper range already
available in Japan, in Europe this autumn. Celine is introducing its first
male line this weekend, as is Leonard.

FT  04 JUL 92 / UK shares rise on hopes of rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices in London rose yesterday on speculation that Britain might cut
base rates next week around the time of the world economic summit.
While the market rumours led to renewed buying interest in equities, they
led some investors to switch funds out of sterling, the weakest member of
the European exchange rate mechanism.
The FT-SE 100 index recovered some of its losses of earlier in the week,
closing up 21.0 at 2,497.1. But the pound fell back three-quarters of a
pfennig against the D-Mark to finish at DM2.895, down 1 3/4 pfennigs on the
week.
Given the pound's weakness, an early move by Britain on base rates, held at
10 per cent since May 5, is considered unlikely.
Government officials, in a briefing ahead of next week's summit of the Group
of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich, said they did not expect any
immediate commitments at the meeting to reduce interest rates.
A technical manoeuvre in the money markets by the Bank of England - which
shaved by  1/32 of a percentage point its rates on long-maturing bills - was
responsible for the expectations about a cut in base rates.
Any such move would follow Thursday's cut in US interest rates, and might
stimulate Britain's flagging economy. It would win the support of many
industrialists and politicians.
But a decision by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to reduce borrowing
costs would risk sterling falling close to the bottom of its ERM band. The
manoeuvre might be deemed especially hazardous, given that base rates are
only  1/4 point above the equivalent short-term rates in Germany.
With many traders in the money markets less than confident that Mr Lamont
was about to take the plunge, the three-month interbank rate - a good
reflection of sentiment about the future level of base rates - fell by just
 1/16 of a point to 9 27/32 per cent.

KURDISH separatists killed six villagers in attacks on two villages
yesterday.
The villages came under attack for their apparent loyalty to the Turkish
government, according to local officials quoted by news agencies.
The attack adds to the escalating violence in recent weeks and follows last
week's decision by the Turkish parliament to extend the state of emergency
in the Kurdish region. The vote, 222 to 36, is clear backing for the
security forces on policy towards the country's Kurdish minority and puts
paid to prime minister Suleyman Demirel's reform programme aimed at winning
back moderate Kurdish opinion.
Mr Demirel's approach envisaged a diplomatic and military offensive against
the rebel Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), at the same time as economic and
social reforms for the impoverished south-east region. On both counts,
western diplomats say the prime minister is behind.
His first 200 days in office have seen an increase in the number of deaths
in police custody and an unprecedented escalation in the fighting.
According to Mr Unal Erkan the super vali, the senior government official in
charge of 10 emergency provinces, in the last two months more than 200 PKK
rebels have been killed in clashes. Over the same period, around 90 security
personnel have died.
On paper, this corresponds to the highest monthly death toll since the
troubles began in 1984. But the military has an interest in inflating the
casualty figures. Firstly, by exaggerating the rebel threat the military
serves to justify its own heavy handed tactics. In addition the generals may
have their eyes on a number of key military procurement contracts for
helicopters and night-sighting equipment.
The military also has a stake in seeing the government's human rights reform
delayed. The draft currently awaits President Ozal's signature. Legislators
have already made a special case for the south east where a 16 day maximum
detention period is to be applied for those suspected of terrorist crimes,
twice the period elsewhere.
Human rights activists have long urged a reduction in the detention period
as a way to combat the problem of torture, seen as a blight on Turkey's
image abroad.
The government takes heart from having thwarted a popular uprising which the
PKK threatened following Newroz the Kurdish New Year. But the repression
that ensued had its cost.
According to local officials in Sirnak, where the PKK came close to
overrunning the town, around 5,000 people have fled since the disturbances
either to join the rebels or across the border into Iraq.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: A Winter's Tale - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adrian Noble's new production of The Winter's Tale at Stratford comes close
to perfection. The play has always had its detractors, saying that it was
good only in parts. In the 18th-century there were versions which omitted
Leontes, the jealous king of Sicily, and his injured wife, Hermione,
altogether. Recently I saw a version which cut out the part of Leontes' son,
Mamillius.
Such cutting and carping have always seemed to me to be wrong. Noble's
production proves that they are wrong on stilts. Nothing is omitted.
Everything that has ever been seen to be good in the play is there: it comes
out as a perfect whole. The attention to detail, without distracting from
the wider piece, is remarkable.
It is often said that Leontes' jealousy when he decides that his wife is
enamoured of Polixenes the king of Bohemia, comes on too suddenly and is
therefore not credible. Here, as played by John Nettles, Leontes has all the
marks of a man close to insanity. He drinks heavily at the opening
reception, his speech becomes slurred and his behaviour violent and
irrational. Quite clearly he is having a nervous breakdown.
This initial burst of realism does not undermine the play's subsequent
magic. On the contrary, it reinforces it. If Lear retreats into madness,
Leontes backs out of it as the young lovers take over. Essential to the
romantic shift are the designs by Anthony Ward. These rely heavily on the
use of balloons: sometimes balloons galore as when Autolycus (Richard
McCabe) descends from the flies using them as a slow-moving parachute,
sometimes balloons restrained. Seven-year-old Mamillius plays on his own
with a red balloon in a scene reminiscent of a famous short movie. Instead
of the chorus spoken by Time to indicate the passing of 16 years, a paper
arrives attached to another balloon.
Perdita, the missing daughter of Leontes, is played by Phyllida Hancock, who
has grown up with a rural accent in common with the setting. But the old
shepherd also picked up a lot of gold when he stumbled across the abandoned
infant. The sheep-shearing party is not just a bunch of rustics. There is
enough money about to pay for decent entertainment.
Between the court and the shepherds we have had the storm scene and the
dumping of Perdita. Here is one of Shakespeare's strangest stage directions:
'Exit Antigonus, pursued by a bear.' Here the bear, like the back legs of
the pantomime horse, ought to be credited. He has human characteristics in
that he bends down and kisses the foundling before seeing Antigonus off.
Towards the end we return to realism. When Polixenes discovers that his son
is about to marry a shepherdess, he unmasks himself and forbids the wedding.
It is a reminder of Leontes' behaviour at the start, but there is a
difference. This is genuine anger, not the act of someone approaching
madness.
The final statue scene is done with Hermione at the front of the stage, her
back to the audience. so that the audience watches the amazed faces of the
court rather than wonders if Hermione will betray herself by twitching the
odd muscle before time. But the rest of the production has been so good that
the statue scene is less a dramatic climax than a fitting end. The ultimate
pleasure, as always, is in seeing Paulina, delightfully played by Gemma
Jones, betrothed to an equally urbane Camillo (Benjamin Whitrow).

FT  03 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed fall after Wall Street opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORM CLOUDS over the US economy overshadowed the UK stock market yesterday,
and a rally from bearish pressures in the new issue sector was abruptly
reversed after Wall Street and the US dollar began to slide.
London responded well at first to the overnight strength of other world
markets, and the Footsie 2,500 level was quickly recovered, albeit in thin
trading. The shine was taken off share prices, however, when it was
confirmed that the issuing price for MFI, the furniture retailer created by
a management buyout from Asda, had been sharply reduced in view of
conditions in the UK stock market.
An early gain of 12 points on the Footsie disappeared, but the market was
holding steady until mid-afternoon when London heard the news from across
the Atlantic.
The Federal Reserve Board's decision to cut the discount rate by  1/2
percentage point to 3 per cent, in the face of the rise in US unemployment
to 7.8 per cent of the workforce in June, was widely seen as an act of near
desperation rather than of reliable economic stimulus. Traders said London
was particularly unsettled by the political implications for President Bush
of the new signs of US economic weakness.
London's nervousness increased as Wall Street turned from a gain of 17 Dow
points to a net drop of 25 points early in its new trading session.
Meanwhile, the fall in the US currency was swiftly feeding through to
dollar-orientated stocks in London and the Footsie fell sharply. Downward
pressure was emphasised by a setback in stock index futures. At the day's
low, the FT-SE Index was down by 22.7 but a rally took the final reading to
2,476.1, a net loss of 17.8.
The fall to below 2,500 has left the Footsie suspended nervously in thin
air, with no visible support above the 2,436 area recorded on the eve of the
UK general election in April; on the day after polling, the index jumped 132
points.
However, market turnover was light again with Seaq volume at only 394.5m
shares. On Wednesday, when equities suffered badly, turnover reached 495.1m
shares, but Stock Exchange statistics show that retail, or customer,
business in equities was worth only Pounds 982.7m, not an exciting total
even by recent standards.
The reduction in the planned issue of MFI from an expected worth of Pounds
750m to only Pounds 669m was seen as a further indication of the problems of
the new issue sector, and of the UK stock market as a whole.
Fund managers are currently apprehensively regarding the short-term outlook
and will only put new cash into equities at discounts to market levels. The
Pounds 3bn offer for sale by Wellcome closes at the end of this month, and
there have also been hints of impending rights issues from other leading
companies.
Most of yesterday's losses came in the US-orientated stocks. ICI sharply
extended an early fall and BOC, Reckitt &amp; Colman, BAT Industries and Reuters
all suffered for their Wall Street associations. However, shares in BP
continued to steady, against the market trend, as investors tried to assess
the dividend prospects.

FT  03 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP retreat of Wall Street yesterday afternoon led to a big sell-off
in stock index futures in a session once again noted for its volatility,
writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened firmly at 2,522 on the back of
the good overnight performance in New York. However, independent traders who
had taken on long overnight positions led the selling of September, sending
the contract into retreat.
Bargain hunters curtailed further falls around lunchtime but the respite was
short-lived; the release of worse than expected US employment data once
again sent the contract falling.
The contract picked up ahead of Wall Street's opening but then reacted to
the US selling which followed the Federal Reserve's discount rate cut. The
falls on Wall Street put paid to any hopes of a further rise and the
contract closed at 2,489, down 29 from the previous session and around 10
points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover
reached 8,493 lots.
The uncertainty in the markets saw turnover in traded options once again
reach high levels. A total of 46,520 contracts were traded, with the FT-SE
option having 18,164 lots dealt. Marks and Spencer was the busiest stock
option on 2,173 contracts.

FT  03 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Generator stocks wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN and National Power were the best performers in an otherwise
demoralised Footsie index, with the former given a strong boost by
US-sourced buying interest.
Senior executives from PowerGen are currently visiting US investment
institutions and analysts in New York. Hints relayed from these
presentations suggest that, when the current deal between the power
generators and British Coal ends in 1993, the UK generator companies will be
allowed to sharply reduce their coal purchases and negotiate lower prices.
PowerGen climbed 9 to 261p on heavy turnover of 7.1m shares, while National
Power added 7 at 249p on 2.7m. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was
believed to have been a heavy buyer of the generators, especially PowerGen.
Offer worries
The regional electricity stocks reversed Wednesday's gains yesterday amid
suggestions that the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer) is about to
turn its attention to the pricing policies of the National Grid Company
(Gridco). This is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies, who derive
10 per cent of their profits from their holdings.
Stock market hints yesterday were that Offer may be about to restrict
Gridco's future price rises to inflation minus 5 points and to threaten
that, if Gridco resists, it will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The worst performer in the sector was Eastern, which dropped 19 to 275p,
while falls of 17 were registered by Northern, 341p, Norweb, 351p, and
Seeboard, 330p. The Electricity Package lost 145 to Pounds 3245.
Glaxo struggles
News of a joint agreement with a Japanese company and a recommendation from
a US brokerage house were not enough to shield Glaxo from the general
setback in Wall Street-influenced stocks yest-erday.
Glaxo said it had agreed with Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical to jointly develop a
treatment against osteoporosis, a condition which affects the bones, mostly
of women aged over 55.
Also, Merrill Lynch, in recommending the stock, said investors buying at the
current weak level could expect a 15 per cent gain in the share price.
Glaxo shares were marked up at the opening and reached 670p. However, the
surprise early downturn by the Wall Street market sent the stock sharply
into reverse to end a net 5 off at 653p after 5.1m shares traded.
ICI still weak
There was no respite for ICI, which fell a further 18 to 1170p, making a
slide of 50 since the start of the week. The latest data on one of the
chemical giants' high-earning drugs added further impetus to a sharp profits
forecast cut by one securities house earlier this week.
May prescription figures in the US for Tenormin, ICI's beta blocker for
treating hypertension, were down by 42 per cent compared with the same
period last year. The drug earned the company Pounds 1.18bn world-wide last
year and Dollars 400m (Pounds 216.2m) in the US. However, the US patent ran
out at the start of this year and sales have declined much faster than
previously expected.
ICI's tumble has prompted the market to indulge in what one analyst
described as 'indiscriminate bashing' of the rest of the sector. BOC
weakened 11 to 631p and Yorkshire Chemicals declined 12 to 320p.
BT was one of the handful of Footsie stocks to close higher on the day,
responding to its inclusion in County NatWest's prestigious County 30 list
of best buys.
The 'old' shares settled 1 1/2 up at 334 1/2 p and the partly-paid 2 1/2
firmer at 234p. County highlighted BT as a resilient, highly-rated stock
with good dividend prospects. 'BT looks cheap as well as safe,' said County.
British Gas overtook British Petroleum as the most heavily traded stock in
the oil and gas sector. The former made strong progress early in the session
and touched 254p, boosted by its joint deal with Italy's Agip to develop the
Karachaganak oil and gas field in Kazakhstan.
But a growing realisation that the development of the field would involve
Gas in a capital expenditure programme in the region of Dollars 3bn took the
shine off the share price, which ran back to close only a fraction ahead at
250p. Turnover in Gas topped 18m shares.
In addition, Energy specialists said that if Offer adopted a stringent
regime on Gridco, then it would strengthen the hand of Ofgas, the gas
watchdog, to impose a low rate of return on Gas's pipeline system, in the
event of a break-up of Gas's various interests.
A volatile session in British Aerospace saw the shares move sharply ahead by
12 to 261p in early trading, on press reports that the company was
discussing a regional aircraft joint venture with Taiwan.
The positive sentiment, however, received a sharp knock after a widely
predicted sell note from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew finally landed on investors'
desks. The stock came back to end just a penny up on balance at 249p after
volume of 1.4m.
T &amp; N firmed 6 to 142p after a US court dismissed a substantial asbestos
claim against the company. Shares in TI Group, which last night held a
presentation for investors at Kleinwort Benson, were in demand, adding 8 at
345p. US buying helped British Steel buck the market trend and firm 3 to 62
1/2 p in trade of 8.6m.
Two big lines of stock in Owners Abroad left the holiday group's shares
looking queasy, 1.9m being traded at 67p and 1.25m at 66 3/4 p. The stock
retreated 5 to 69p. Rival Airtours tumbled 27 to 227p.
The effect of a buy recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing earlier this
week helped paper and packaging group Arjo Wiggins Appleton to firm 2 to
228p.
Brewery and hotel group Bass wilted in the face of a broker's downgrade and
renewed worries about the performance of its Holiday Inns chain in the US.
Strauss Turnbull snipped its profits forecast for this year by Pounds 20m to
between Pounds 545m and Pounds 550m.
Analysts returned this week from a US presentation where Bass said it did
not expect an 'acceptable return' from Holiday Inns until 1995-96. Bass
shares ended 10 off at 548p.
Elsewhere in the drinks sector, Scottish &amp; Newcastle firmed 6 to 454p ahead
of results due on Monday, but Guinness tumbled 11 to 534p after BZW followed
County NatWest in downgrading the group.

jobs data

Wall Street
FOLLOWING a hectic trading session, US share prices ended lower yesterday
after an extremely weak June employment report had proved a bigger influence
on market sentiment than the reduction in interest rates that it inspired,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.81 down at 3,330.29, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.11 to 411.77 and the Nasdaq composite lost
5.64 to 563.35. New York SE turnover amounted to 220m shares.
The morning started firmly as investors welcomed the Federal Reserve's
decision to cut the discount rate from 3.5 to 3 per cent in the wake of some
extremely bearish jobs data. The June employment report showed that the
civilian unemployment rate had risen from May's 7.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent
in June - its highest since 1984 - and that non-farm payrolls had fallen by
117,000 in the month.
The figures shocked the market, which had expected a rise in payrolls and
little change in the headline jobless rate, and confirmed that the weak
economic recovery is having no effect on labour conditions, which continue
to deteriorate.
The initially positive reaction to the rate cut soon gave way to pessimism
about the state of the economy and the outlook for corporate earnings.
Moreover, the Dow had risen more than 70 points earlier in the week, so the
rate cut had already been discounted. Even a jump in bond prices failed to
cheer the equity markets.
Banks were a rare bright area as investors bought in anticipation that the
new lower bank prime rates (which were reduced from 6.5 to 6 per cent after
the Fed's move) will boost earnings. Chase Manhattan gained Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 28 3/8 , Citicorp Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 3/8 , Chemical Dollars
1 to Dollars 38 7/8 , JP Morgan Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 , Banc One
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 and BankAmerica Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 46 1/4 .
Other financial issues were also higher on hopes that lower interest rates
will boost business, including Federal National Mortgage, Dollars 2 stronger
at Dollars 64 3/8 , Salomon, Dollars 2 1/2 ahead at Dollars 37 5/8 , and
Merrill Lynch, Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 51 7/8 .
On the way down were IBM, Dollars 1 3/8 lower at Dollars 96 7/8 , Minnesota
Mining, Dollars 2 1/2 weaker at Dollars 96, and Walt Disney, Dollars  5/8
off at Dollars 36 1/8 .
Advanced Micro dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 7 3/4 in turnover of 2m shares
after warning that price pressure on its 386 microchip line will leave
second-quarter revenues 15 per cent below the first quarter.
Canada
TORONTO closed higher, as the market was influenced by Wednesday's advance
on Wall Street, having been closed that day for the Canada Day holiday. The
US Fed's rate cut added a positive tone to the market, but had already been
largely discounted.
The TSE 300 index put on 20.4 to 3,408.1, while advances led declines by 302
to 216 after volume of 24.8m shares.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Rates soften
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERIOD interbank rates eased marginally on the UK money markets yesterday
after the  1/2 percentage point cut in the US discount rate affected
traders' sentiment.
A trader commented: 'I think the Fed rate cut has brought home the pure
frustration of the fact that UK rates are far too high for the UK economy at
the moment.'
The key three-month interbank rate finished at 9 29/32 per cent, down from a
previous close of around 10 1/32 per cent, while six-month money declined to
the same rate.
The easing was encouraged by a comment from Mr Horst Kohler, Germany's
sherpa to the G7, that he was confident the government would create the
conditions necessary for an early cut in German interest rates.
Mr Kohler said government budget measures, the July 1 expiration of the
solidarity tax, and a positive development in wage settlements had created
the impulse needed for a slow-down in the rise of inflation.
Sterling futures contracts were traded actively. The September contract was
squeezed back up to levels last seen 2 1/2 weeks ago. It opened at 90.16,
against Wednesday's 90.13 close, and rose in heavy trading to end 11 basis
points ahead at around 90.27.
This suggests the market is looking for another half-point cut in base rates
sometime over the next 2 1/2 months. The December contract closed 11 basis
points up at around 90.49.
Money market operations with the Bank of England were relatively quiet. The
shortage was eventually taken out, although traders were a little reluctant
to part with too much paper, forcing the overnight rate to creep up to
around 10 1/4 per cent.
The Bank's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 950m but this was
revised to Pounds 1bn in the early afternoon. The Bank operated once in the
morning, buying bills totalling Pounds 42m. Later it purchased Pounds 275m
of bills and provided late assistance of around Pounds 350m.
The Federal Reserve added temporary reserves to the banking system with
four-day system repurchase agreements. Economists said the action signalled
a 50 basis-point reduction in the Federal Funds rate target to 3 1/4 per
cent following the half-point discount rate cut earlier.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar dealt double blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR made a remark-able recovery in late European trading yesterday
after being dealt the double blow of dismal US employment data and a cut in
the Federal Reserve's discount rate, writes Emma Tucker.
The US currency fell nearly two pfennigs to a 16-month low of DM1.4995 on
the news that non-farm payrolls dropped 117,000 in June, confounding market
expectations of a 90,000 rise.
However, a combination of rumours that the Fed was intervening and the fear
of going too short with the currency at such low levels rescued the dollar
from further losses. It ended in London at DM1.5135, after Wednesday's close
of DM1.5170.
Dealers said the dollar's resilience indicated that the bad news had been,
to a certain extent, anticipated. But the dollar later slipped in New York
to a DM1.5075 finish.
The sharp drop in employment was spread broadly across the economy, apart
from a small rise in government employment, and followed a string of poor
economic data last week.
Within an hour of the employment news being released, the Fed announced a
half-point cut in discount rate to 3 per cent, its lowest level since the
summer of 1963.
Most of the big banks followed the Fed governors' unanimous decision to
lower the discount rate by cutting their prime rates  1/2 point to 6 per
cent. Some analysts said they now expected the dollar to head towards its
all-time low of DM1.4460, set in February 1991.
Mr Nicholas Stamenkovic, an economist at DKB International, the Japanese
Bank, said: 'The Fed will probably respond to further weakness with more
rate cuts, so the dollar is likely to go even lower - it could even go into
free fall.'
However, others said they thought the US currency would find support at
DM1.50.
Mr Gerald Holtham, chief international economist at Shearson Lehman, said:
'There is an incredibly strong feeling in the market that the dollar is
fundamentally cheap at these levels, and people do not want to be too short
when the inevitable rally comes.'
With the dollar hogging most of the attention on the foreign exchanges,
there was little scope for action on the EMS currencies. In the morning the
Italian lira came under pressure as rumours of a devaluation swept the
market. One trader said the lack of confidence overseas was increasing.
The currency was also affected by the weakness of the dollar and worries
about the political and economic outlook in Italy. Dealers said the Bank of
Italy had intervened to temper downward pressure on the currency.
The pound had a good day, although it remained at the bottom of the EMS
grid. It edged above DM2.90 to finish at DM2.9025.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iranian oil minister attacks
carbon tax plans

A GRAVE warning of heightened political instability in the Middle East if
'carbon taxes' planned by several countries including the European Community
were to get the go-ahead is to be given by Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's
petroleum minister, in a speech today to delegates at a two-day ministerial
conference here on energy.
The carbon taxes would be imposed on fuels giving off emissions of carbon
dioxide, the gas mainly responsible for the so-called greenhouse effect.
Dr Subroto, secretary general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, yesterday rejected the rationale behind carbon tax proposals and
called instead for the elimination of subsidies to coal producers and
farmers. He also suggested that taxes be levied on chemicals used by 'We
believe that the proposed tax is yet another form of excise tax intended to
raise government receipts (from oil revenues) which, in some countries, are
already more than three times the petroleum export revenues of the
developing oil-producing countries,' Dr Subroto told conference delegates.
The informal meetings, taking place at a heavily-guarded, secluded seaside
resort outside the Norwegian west coast city of Bergen, are intended to
promote a dialogue between oil producers and consumers. But they are not
expected to yield any formal accords between the 25 countries represented.
In a speech prepared for delivery today Mr Gholamreza calls for oil prices
to double so that Middle East producers can regain their 1974 purchasing
power, which he says will help ensure political stability in the region. He
warns that a carbon tax - which he believes will lead to lower oil prices -
will seriously affect producers' plans for meeting global demand through
increased production.
'It will disrupt the market mechanism due to introduction of uncertainty. .
. our trade relations will suffer. . . (and) most important of all our
economic development and that of our future generations will be endangered.'
'Downward pressure on oil prices must come to an end at all costs if leaders
of the industrial world want to have a realistic policy for long-term supply
security,' the minister warns.
With the greatest part of the world's oil and gas reserves belonging to Opec
and the Gulf Mr Gholamreza stresses that these areas' political security is
inseparable from the rest of the world's energy security.
'Ever since 1975, oil producers' real income has drastically decreased due
to industrial states' policies. This poverty threatens the oil producers'
political stability.'
Mr Gholamreza questions whether consumers have benefitted from lower oil
prices or if oil products actually reached them at higher prices because of
to heavy taxation.
He supports his argument by pointing out that the six leading industrial
nations, through taxes, are at present earning twice the petroleum revenue
of the six main Opec producers.
Mr Guiseppe Guarino, Italy's industry minister, called yesterday in Bergen
for environmetal concerns to be taken into account more fully in
consideration of energy policy.
He urged a reassessment of the contribution of non-traditional energy
sources and in particular nuclear energy.
'The present (energy) workshop can be a great success if we will be able to
go from declarations of principles to concrete actions,' he said. This could
be achieved by a fresh approach to the relations between producer and
consumer nations.
The minister added that amendments to the Iinternational Energy Agency
statutues might have to be considered to enable it to play a constructive
role in reconciling security of energy supply with protection of the
environment. 'This broader vision requires an institutional forum where the
much needed initiatives can be developed and become a reality,' he told
delegates.

<TEXT>
DANISH PIG farmers have set up an extensive system of controls to prevent
any contamination of their herds by imported pigs. The system is a reaction
to the introduction from July 1 of free trade in live animals across borders
between European Community countries.
The Danes are the biggest EC exporters of pigmeat to non-community
countries, especially Japan and the US, which set stringent veterinary
conditions. The US will not permit the import of any Danish pigmeat if it
includes as much a single pig imported to Denmark from other EC countries,
said Mr Bent Sloth, chairman of the Association of Danish Slaughterhouses.
The slaughterhouses' and pig farmers' organisations, in co-operation with
the government and with the authorisation of the European Commission, have
imposed a system by which all imported animals must be ear-marked and no
pigs can be sent to slaughter from any herd containing an imported pig.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries go through the roof as Fed cuts
interest rates

US TREASURY prices rocketed yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut interest
rates in response to an extremely poor set of June employment figures.
When the market closed early in mid-afternoon for the approaching July 4
weekend holiday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 13/32 at 104
9/32 , yielding 7.626 per cent. The two-year note was also sharply higher,
up  15/32 at 100 13/16 to carry a yield of 4.552 per cent.
Prices rose sharply soon after 8.30am, when the Labor Department announced
that the civilian unemployment rate rose from 7.5 per cent in May to 7.8 per
cent in June, the highest level since 1984, and that non-farm payrolls fell
by 117,000.
Forecasts had centred on a rise in payrolls and little change in the jobless
rate, and analysts described the figures as terrible. It was no surprise,
therefore, when soon after the data was released the Fed announced it was
cutting the discount rate from 3.5 per cent to 3 per cent.
Then, at 11.30am, the central bank lowered its target rate for Fed funds
from 3 3/4 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent by engineering a big round of system
repurchase agreements in the credit markets.
Although the markets had been expecting a Fed ease all week, the
unemployment figures really shocked investors, and contributed more to the
price rises than the interest rate reduction.
UK government bond prices surged by more than half a point yesterday due to
the combination of a stronger pound and the US Treasury bond rally.
The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 116 31/32 to 117 9/16 ,
while the most recent auction stock, the 9 per cent gilt due 2012, rose from
36 1/32 to 36 23/32 as dealers reported further buying interest at the long
end of the yield curve.
'Talk of further company growth downgrades is helping to enhance the
attractiveness of the gilt market over equities right now,' said one dealer.
Traders suggested the Bank of England may announce further issuance in the
form of tap stocks today if the gilt market remains firm.
EUROPEAN government bond markets jumped on news of the 0.5 percentage point
cut in the US discount rate and the US Treasury bond rally.
German government bonds, which had started the day on a dull note, showed a
strong rally in the afternoon. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened
at 87.86, reached a high of 88.16 after the US interest rate cut, but ended
the day at around 88.14.
The market had expected to hear further news on the question of a
withholding tax on interest income yesterday, but a group of
parliamentarians failed to reach a compromise on the proposed 25 per cent
tax. The meetings are due to continue next week.
The government's proposed tax package would require banks to withhold 25 per
cent of the interest payments on bonds and other investments.
French government bonds also picked up on the US news, but traders said the
market's gains were held back by yesterday's auction. A total of FFr5.75bn
of 10-year bonds was sold at an average yield of 8.77 per cent, a total of
FFr4.21bn of the bonds due 2023. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the
September bond futures contract closed at 107.66, up from 107.34 on
Wednesday.
THE Italian government bond market suffered another turbulent day as
devaluation worries persisted, but the rise in the US market helped to lift
Italian bond prices in the afternoon.
The futures contract, which opened at around 95.00, fell to a low of 94.15,
but recovered some of the losses and traded at 94.73 by late afternoon.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied in London trading as the US Federal
Reserve's decision to cut the official discount rate by a half point
yesterday raised hopes that the Bank of Japan may soon follow suit.
The government bond market rose in Tokyo trading on hopes of an easing in
the US, although heavy profit-taking by investors later in the session wiped
out the gains. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.22 per
cent and moved to 5.21 per cent before closing at 5.25 per cent in Tokyo.
However, once news emerged in London that the US discount rate had been cut
from 3.5 per cent to 3.0 per cent, Japanese government bonds rallied again
and the yield on the No 129 moved to 5.18 per cent.
Dealers said market expectations of a cut in Japanese interest rates ahead
of the G-7 meeting next week are strong, despite warnings from Finance
Ministry officials that a cut in US rates may not have an immediate
influence on Japanese monetary policy.
Separately, the Finance Ministry accepted bids of Y373bn in its sale of
20-year bonds with a coupon of 5.9 per cent yesterday.
Deutsche Terminborse, the German options and futures exchange, will change
the specifications on its bund futures contract, allowing bonds issued by
the Treuhand privatisation agency to be deliverable into the futures
contract.
Treuhand, the government-owned institution charged with reorganising and
privatising the former East German state-owned assets, has not yet issued
any long-term debt but is expected to start borrowing long-term in the
international capital markets.
Liffe, the London-based futures exchange which also trades a bund contract,
has not yet altered its contract specification to allow delivery of Treuhand
bonds. However, Liffe said yesterday that it is currently reviewing its
March 1993 bundfutures contract specification. Daewoo Group of South Korea
plans to set up a joint venture securities house in Hungary by the end of
this year, Reuter reports from Seoul. The venture will be capitalised at
Dollars 2m and will be South Korea's first securities house in eastern
Europe.

46m charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third-biggest pharmaceuticals company, is
to take a pre-tax charge of Dollars 46m in the second quarter following its
agreement to settle an anti-trust lawsuit involving claims that the company
conspired to rig the prices of infant formula.
The company's Indiana-based Mead Johnson division, which makes the infant
formula, yesterday denied the charges, but said it had agreed to pay Dollars
38.76m to settle a class action lawsuit brought by wholesale and retail
distributors who made the accusations about price rigging.
The decision to settle was made in order to avoid the burden and expense of
protracted litigation, the company said.
The Dollars 46m pre-tax charge will include the amount being paid to settle
the lawsuit as well as the estimated value of donating infant formula to a
US government agency as part of a separate settlement agreed last month with
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
The FTC had charged Bristol-Myers and two other infant formula makers -
Abbott Laboratories and American Home Products - with price rigging and
other improper trading practices.
All three companies denied any wrongdoing, but American Home Products and
Bristol-Myers agreed to settle, while Abbott said it would contest the
charges.
Yesterday, Bristol-Myers shares closed Dollars 1 off at Dollars 66.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Thomson likely to shelve bid for
LTV missiles side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF, the state-owned French defence group, is reportedly close to
withdrawing its Dollars 300m bid for the missile operations of US steel
group LTV in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the US government from blocking
the deal.
The French group is expected to shelve its bid temporarily to give itself
more time to find a US partner willing to run the missile company on its
behalf. Thomson hopes that such an arrangement, which would leave it as only
a passive investor in the missile operation, will assuage US fears that
foreign ownership of a key US arms contractor compromises national security.
Three US companies - Northrop, Loral and Raytheon - have been approached as
possible partners for Thomson, but none have so far agreed to join the
acquisition.
Thomson has had to move quickly because a high-level US government committee
set up to review the deal is believed ready to recommend to President George
Bush on Monday that the acquisition be blocked on security grounds.
The committee met for the final time earlier this week, and sources in
Washington said yesterday that it was highly unlikely that Thomson would be
able to clinch a deal with a US partner in time to persuade the committee to
reverse its recommendation.
Congressmen and US defence chiefs have let the committee know their concern
about allowing LTV's missiles operations to fall into the hands of a company
controlled by a foreign government. Thomson is 58 per cent owned by the
French state.
The committee has also looked into allegations that the French group broke
US and French export laws when selling arms to Iraq during the 1980s. Only
yesterday, the US Customs confirmed it was investigating whether export laws
were violated in a 1985 sale of Thomson lasers to Iraq. Thomson denies ever
breaking US or French export laws.
Although Thomson's withdrawal of its bid would only be temporary, the latest
development has cast a shadow over LTV's attempts to sell its assets and
emerge from six years of bankruptcy proceedings. Two months ago, a New York
bankruptcy court gave Thomson the right to buy LTV's missiles unit over a
rival, but higher, joint bid by Martin Marietta and Lockheed.
Unions representing 14,000 steel workers employed by LTV yesterday rejected
demands for cuts in wages and benefits and voted to authorise a strike if
the company rejects its labour contract.
LTV broke off negotiations with the unions two weeks ago and asked
permission from a US bankruptcy court to terminate its labour and pensions
agreements with the union. A court hearing on the company's request is set
for July 13.
If LTV recieves court approval, and goes on to reject the contract, the
unions say they will go out on strike. The steelworkers are prohibited by
law from striking until LTV breaks the contract.

Pounds 1.7m

<TEXT>
CREST NICHOLSON, the Surrey-based housebuilder and property developer,
reduced its loss before tax from Pounds 33.9m to Pounds 1.69m for the half
year to April 30.
Last time the group made Pounds 21m of provisions against falling land and
property prices.
The interim dividend is passed. Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, said it
would be restored as soon as prospects improved.
Losses per share fell from 30.68p to 2.87p. Net assets per share declined
from 116p to 85p. At the October 31 year end the value was 91p.
However, the company reported operating profits of Pounds 2.04m (Pounds
6.66m losses) on lower sales of Pounds 120m (Pounds 126m).
Mr Callcutt said: 'We now feel our house is in order and we are operating in
a stable, if rather unexciting, market. We remain cautious about the future
although we are hopeful of further growth.'
After reviewing the company's assets no further write-downs were required.
The lower interest charge of Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 6.24m) was due to the sale
of Pounds 50m worth of commercial property. Borrowings declined from Pounds
104.1m to Pounds 54.5m, reducing gearing to about 50 per cent.
The group felt confident enough to spend Pounds 13.5m acquiring land for
nearly 700 units at 23 sites.
On the residential side the company made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.1m
compared with Pounds 10.4m before provisions. Sales of 570 houses at an
average price of Pounds 76,000 compared with 549 houses at an average price
of Pounds 81,000.
Commercial property continued to suffer from economic uncertainties and
reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2m compared with Pounds 3.3m before
provisions.
Construction improved from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 2.55m. The division had
orders in excess of Pounds 50m which, while below the level planned for,
were well ahead of the corresponding period.
An extraordinary Pounds 2.36m charge related to the sale of the lossmaking
En-tout-cas, the sports surface and leisure business.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: National Grid charges may be cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFER, the electricity industry watchdog, is likely to force the National
Grid Company to cut its charges to electricity consumers.
The company may protest to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if the move
goes ahead.
Reports that Offer planned to penalise the company, which owns and operates
the electricity network of England and Wales, by tightening the regulatory
formula that governs how it can increase its charges, were circulating in
the City yesterday.
This prompted falls in the share prices of the 12 regional electricity
companies, which between them own the grid company.
One analyst said that National Grid's profits could be trimmed by at least
Pounds 10m a year if Offer did cut the charges.
Exactly how much profits fall will depend on how much Offer tightens the
formula, which at the moment allows the company to increase its charges -
which are paid by all customers taking power from the system  - in line with
inflation.
Every 0.5 per cent below inflation meant another Pounds 10m off the
company's bottom line, the analyst estimated.
Offer, which has been reviewing the Grid's charges since late last year, is
due to announce its decision shortly. 'I believe the price cap will be
negative (or below the RPI index),' one analyst said.
The pressure for the regulator to cut the National Grid's charges is
considerable, because many large electricity users, and regional electricity
companies, believe the Grid's charges are pushing up the price of
electricity unnecessarily.
Earlier this week, some members of the Major Energy Users Council, which
represents large industrial electricity consumers, suggested that one way to
help provide British industry with competitive electricity prices was to cut
the Grid charges.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Imminent issues may face lack of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH less than three working days left before the close of the share offer
for Anglian Group, the double-glazing company, there is little to suggest it
will attract strong public support.
The failure on Wednesday of The Telegraph Group's public offer,
three-quarters of which was left with underwriters, did not help sentiment.
Nor have the decidedly soggy stock market conditions.
But the signs were there once Kenwood Appliances, the kitchen equipment
maker, managed only a 1.2 times subscription of its offer in early June,
when the market was relatively buoyant. Despite the advantage of a famous
brand name, public demand was modest.
Tuesday's pricing of the Anglian flotation at 210p - some 20 per cent below
the level at which advisers NM Rothschild had been seeking only a fortnight
earlier - suggests underwriters were aware of this weak retail demand.
Realising they were likely to be left with a large portion of the retail
offer, they appear to have played hard-ball. The 210p was, therefore, a
price at which they will be happy to be left with stock.
Lack of enthusiasm from retail buyers has tended to obscure the underlying
qualities of the Anglian offer. At 210p, Anglian is on a relatively high
historic dividend yield of 5.5 per cent and is at 12.2 times historic price
earnings - a multiple that in more stable market conditions, might be
considered generous.
For Taunton Cider, the west country drinks company that is next to price a
flotation, the pricing decision for its advisers, Samuel Montagu, is also
difficult. But the cloud over this issue comes from yesterday's pricing of
MFI's share offer at 115p.
Taunton is one of the few new flotations where a sensible comparison can be
made with an existing quoted company in the same sector. Unfortunately for
Taunton, so was MFI. The 115p price fixed yesterday represents a 15.3 times
historic earnings per share multiple, which is a substantial discount to
other stores companies and was struck even though institutions are keen
believers in the company.
Taunton would like to be compared with Bulmer Holdings, the UK's other large
cider company, although arguably it could be rated alongside Guinness, the
drinks group. Like Anglian, it is a well managed company and has expanded
during recession in a segment of the drinks market that is growing at the
expense of the brewers.
As Samuel Montagu approaches its price decision over this weekend, it will
be painfully aware that such fundamental questions about Taunton's business
and prospects may cut little ice.
If MFI's flotation price is a guide, Taunton may have to accept a float at a
discount to the sector.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Dr Pepper scraps Dollars 600m offer
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DR PEPPER/SEVEN-UP, the third largest soft drink manufacturer in the US, has
pulled out of its plan to go public in a Dollars 600m (Pounds 320m) stock
issue because of unfavourable market conditions.
The company took the decision to pull the issue late on Wednesday when it
realised it could not sell the stock at its original target price of between
Dollars 20 and Dollars 23 a share, or even at its revised price of between
Dollars 17 and Dollars 18 a share.
The issue of about 38m Dr Pepper shares was part of a refinancing plan that
involved using new low-interest bank borrowings of approximately Dollars
714m and Dollars 143m of cash in hand to sharply reduce the company's debt
load.
That plan has also been shelved, but Dr Pepper said it would try to revive
the issue, and with it the refinancing plan, when market conditions improve.
The Dr Pepper flotation is the latest in a line of recently-cancelled US
stock issues, all prompted by concern about the outlook for equity prices
and realisation that investors are becoming more selective about the prices
they pay for new stock and the companies they are willing to invest in.
Potential corporate issuers have also been scared by the experience of some
companies that have recently floated stock, but seen the value of their
shares fall well below the offer price.
Although proceeds from stock issues, both new and secondary, reached a
record Dollars 41.3bn in the first half of this year, new stock activity
slowed appreciably in the second quarter as the pricing environment
deteriorated. Of the 140 initial public offerings (IPOs) that came to the
market in the second quarter, 60 were offered at a price below the filing
range. One such was Lasmo's Dollars 495m float of its Ultramar North
American operations.
Many stock issues, especially IPOs, have also been withdrawn at the last
minute because of the poor state of the market. Of the 250 IPOs filed so far
this year, 53 have been postponed or cancelled, including a Dollars 404m
offering from GPM Gas.
The new issues slump has also hit foreign companies. Banacci, the Mexican
financial group, cancelled its planned Dollars 1.4bn stock offering, part of
which would have been in the US.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Delors says he is EC scapegoat: UK's budget rebate under
threat, warns Commission president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS last night protested at the way he had been blamed for the
problems surrounding the Maastricht treaty and professed confidence that the
treaty's goals would be achieved on schedule.
In an interview with the Financial Times, the European Commission president
said: 'I have become a scapegoat now. But when everything works people
forget about me.'
Mr Delors predicted that the 12 EC states would only be able to reach
agreement on future Community financing on the basis of his compromise plan.
He strongly pressed the case for a large increase in aid for poorer EC
countries to boost growth and help avoid a 'deflationary' run-up to monetary
union by the end of the decade.
This was one of two key elements in his compromise, which would have let
richer states stretch out a 30 per cent increase in overall contributions to
the EC budget over a longer period, provided they fulfilled their particular
commitment to the less well-off countries. The absence of this commitment at
the Lisbon summit sparked anger from Spain and led Mr Delors to withdraw his
compromise. Although Mr Delors said his proposals at Lisbon were not final,
he said he saw little alternative to the next summit in Edinburgh in
December agreeing a deal along these lines. 'I don't see how it (a deal) can
be done otherwise.'
In a move likely to discomfit Britain, Mr Delors said the Commission would
publish proposals this month on revising the UK budget rebate, which London
has clung to ever since it was agreed in 1984. He said the German
government, under its own budgetary pressures, insisted that he should no
longer delay plans to revise the scheme by which Britain gets Pounds 2bn a
year back on its EC contribution.
He said the Community needed the resources to match its ambitions, including
the desire for a more active external policy. 'If one accepts our proposals,
the EC budget would represent in 1997-99 a maximum of 3 per cent of all
public spending in the Community. Is this unreasonable, in a Community which
will then have a single currency, macro-economic co-ordination and a common
foreign and security policy, even if that progresses slowly?'
He suggested that Britain was unlikely to succeed in its efforts to bring
the planned European central bank to London.
In Lisbon, he said, the Community had lost 'a good moment' to decide the
sites of its institutions when Britain prevented agreement on the central
bank going to Bonn. In the overall understanding on monetary union, there
was 'a balance' between the Germans accepting a date for the start of Emu
and their need for 'assurance' on the central bank site.
He voiced his confidence that a single currency would come into being by
1999. But he warned that slow growth across the Community was, by depressing
budget revenue, jeopardising countries' chances of reaching the Emu criteria
for fiscal deficits. Growth of more than 2 per cent was necessary, he said.

FT  03 JUL 92 / BR plans may lead to small private networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMMINENT white paper on the privatisation of British Rail is expected to
pave the way for a re-creation of historic private railway companies such as
the Great Western.
The plans partly take on board the desire of Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to see a revival of the pride and loyalty associated with the four
regional railway companies which existed before the 1948 nationalisation.
But the white paper should also reflect current realities by basing the
division of the passenger railway on the 19 so-called profit centres
recently established by BR as part of its restructuring.
The result of this smaller sub-division of the network will be to take the
structure further back in history to the days of the smaller companies
before the regional companies were created in 1923.
The private sector will be invited to bid for franchises to run the services
now being operated by the profit centres.
Examples of main line franchise areas include the former Great Western lines
from Paddington to the south-west, and the former London Midland &amp; Scottish
Railway lines from Euston to the north-west.
On Network SouthEast, south of the Thames, the three franchise areas are
expected to coincide almost exactly with the routes once operated by the
London &amp; South Western Railway, the London Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway
and the South East &amp; Chatham Railway.
Ministers acknowledge, however, that privatisation is on a slow track,
particularly in the wake of the big losses announced this week by British
Rail. Only a minority of passenger services are expected to be franchised
within the five-year term of the current government.
The lines likely to be franchised first are those where substantial
investment has taken place, such as Network SouthEast's Thames and Chiltern
services. Others awaiting investment are likely to stay in the public sector
indefinitely.
Ministers acknowledge that uncertainty over the prospects for privatisation
will linger beyond the summer because the coming white paper will not tackle
how private train operators will be charged for the use of British Rail's
tracks.
Instead, track charges will be the subject of a separate report later this
year. But ministers indicate the government will not be prepared to
subsidise them.
On the other hand, subsidies for socially necessary train services will
continue. Commuter fares will also remain subject to political control, with
the government compensating operators for loss of potential revenue.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Personal View: Why Emu's critics are wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danes has reopened the debate
on European Monetary Union, not just in the UK, but elsewhere too.
Sixty eminent German economists recently claimed that a hasty move to
monetary union 'will create strong economic tensions within Europe and
threaten to lead to political disruption, consequently threatening the
ultimate aim of a successful integration'.
The sceptics claim that the locking of exchange rates and the eventual
introduction of a common currency will condemn some regions of the European
Community to slow growth and high unemployment for the foreseeable future.
The only way to contain the resulting pressures, they argue, will then be
through the formation of a strong federalist political union for which
Europe is not yet ready.
Critics of monetary union point to the post-unification German experience as
a graphic illustration of the dangers. Locking the Ostmark to the D-Mark at
an unrealistically high rate has, they claim, simply priced great swathes of
east German industry out of business. But would things have been very
different if a rate of, say, 10 Ostmarks to the D-Mark had been chosen? East
German industry might have been viable, but only at the unsustainable low
real wages that exchange rate implies. The consequence would have been
unrest in the east and massive pressure for wage increases.
Germany's problem is that east German workers want the same real living
standards as their Western counterparts, but east German industry is
presently incapable of sustaining such levels. This fundamental difficulty
would ultimately have emerged at whatever exchange rate currencies were
locked. The key point is that while the exchange rate may in some
circumstances be useful as a weapon of short-run economic adjustment, it is
not essential because companies and wage-setters ultimately respond by
changing prices and wages to reflect the new economic conditions.
Of course, giving up domestic monetary policy as a weapon of macroeconomic
adj-ustment means that a greater burden will be placed on fiscal policy, but
this seems to be all to the good. Monetary union would thus force
governments to make explicit the choice about who should bear the burden of
adjustment and would also prevent the attempted correction by monetary means
of flawed fiscal policies. This is something which should add to rather than
detract from the democratic process.
But if more active fiscal policy will be necessary under a monetary union,
will it be feasible so long as there is no political union? The obvious
comparison would seem to be with the US. Could one really envisage keeping
the dollar, but having all decisions on taxes and government spending
devolved back to the individual states?
The federal tax and social security scheme provides an automatic mechanism
that redistributes resources from richer states to poorer ones. If this did
not exist, a state in decline would be faced with the prospect of either
cutting spending or raising taxes, either of which would encourage people to
migrate to other states with a less harsh fiscal climate. This in turn would
further accelerate the decline.
Aside from the fact that these arguments about fiscal policy have nothing to
do with monetary union per se - the same tensions due to divergent economic
performance would still eventually arise even if the individual states had
their own currencies whose parity they could change - the parallel with
post-1992 Europe is misplaced. Despite efforts to remove barriers to
migration of labour within the Community, linguistic and cultural
differences mean that labour mobility between nations will still be much
lower than in the US. Consequently, there will still be room for the
European nations to pursue their own fiscal policies.
Of course, this may change in time as workers become increasingly willing to
move throughout the Community. However, in that case, the politics as well
as the economics of Europe would have altered fundamentally, because once
cultural and linguistic barriers have been eroded to such an extent that
people feel happy living anywhere in the Community, the idea of a European
'nation' would make much more sense than it does today.
Monetary union could nevertheless turn out to be a mistake if the new
European Central Bank (ECB) conducts monetary policy badly. German critics
are worried that it will be pressurised by European governments into being
soft on inflation. Yet the statutes of the new institutions safeguard their
independence from political influence as zealously as the current statutes
of the Bundesbank. Indeed, the hand of the ECB will be, if anything,
stronger since it will be faced with 12 different national governments whose
interests will rarely coincide.
Finally, it is important to bear in mind the alternatives. Now that most
controls on the movement of capital within the Community have been removed,
it is highly questionable whether the current exchange rate mechanism could
be sustained indefinitely, because currencies will now be much more open to
speculative attacks. Thus, the only long-term alternative is likely to be a
more flexible regime of (possibly managed) floating.
Such a regime might work perfectly well, but only if the temptation for
individual countries to try to make beggar-my-neighbour devaluations or
revaluations could be held in check. If this did not happen the afflicted
countries would be tempted to respond by seeking ways to protect their
domestic economic interests, with all that this implies for intra-Community
trade and mobility. The lessons of the 1920s and 1930s in this regard should
not be forgotten.

FT  03 JUL 92 / France's boy-next-door finds himself offside: The publicity
is turning sour for Bernard Tapie, the unusually popular businessman and
politician
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past few weeks it has been difficult to find a French newspaper or
magazine which does not feature the suntanned, smiling face of Mr Bernard
Tapie.
The smile was Mr Tapie's signature during his rise in the 1980s as one of
France's most flamboyant businessmen and politicians. It now seems out of
place, given the gloomy nature of the latest round of Tapie news. There was
a barrage of publicity last month over his resignation from the French
cabinet, and another this week about the problems of Bernard Tapie Finances
(BTF), his ailing business empire. And there will be another stream of
stories after a French commercial court today considers the fraud charges
brought against him by Mr Georges Tranchant, his former business partner.
On any objective analysis it is extraordinary that Mr Tapie should attract
so much attention. He styles himself as a successful entrepreneur. But BTF
is struggling for survival. He is also presented as a crusading politician.
But his political record has been distinguished mainly by the rarity of his
appearances at the National Assembly and by the brevity of his seven-week
cabinet career.
Why then does the chairman of a middle-sized company with a short stint as a
junior government minister generate so much publicity? The answer is that Mr
Tapie is a populist and populists are rare in French business and politics.
'He is the boy next door who has made it to the top,' says Mr Michel Gonod,
political editor of Paris Match, one of France's biggest selling weekly
magazines. 'Bernard Tapie is brash. He has a big mouth. He speaks the same
language as the blokes in the local bistro.'
Mr Tapie, 49, has played his 'boy next door' ticket for all it is worth. He
is the son of an engineer who was raised in a small house - no hot water, no
inside loo - in the insalubrious Paris suburb of Bourget. He made his
fortune in the 1980s as a wheeler-dealer by buying bankrupt businesses and
quickly selling them, until in 1990 he bought Adidas, the German sporting
goods group.
At the time Adidas looked like the coup of Mr Tapie's business career. It
may yet prove the death-knell. Mr Tapie bought Adidas for FFr2.2bn (Pounds
223m) funded by short-term loans. He has since had to sell a string of
Adidas subsidiaries, a chunk of his own holding and most of BTF's original
businesses to pay off the loans.
Mr Tapie is about to make the final FFr615m payment for Adidas. But BTF
still has its own long-term debt - which stood at FFr3.64bn at the end of
last year. It is questionable whether Mr Tapie can afford to hold on to
Adidas. Under his ownership it has been racked by industrial disputes and
has failed to regain its lost momentum in a competitive market. It reported
a fall in profits from DM90m (Pounds 31m) in 1990 to DM44m in 1991. There is
no shortage of suitors: BTF is considering three offers for its 55 per cent
controlling stake.
His political career is also in the doldrums. He entered politics in 1989,
standing as an independent but siding with the Socialists. He made his mark
at the end of that year by trading insults in a television debate with Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the pugilistic head of the extreme rightwing National
Front. This media success sealed Mr Tapie's friendship with the French
president and Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, both of whom championed his
cabinet appointment.
Mr Tapie has now left the cabinet because of the Tranchant court case. The
case itself is relatively minor: it is a civil, not a criminal suit. But it
gave Mr Tapie's Socialist critics the excuse to squeeze him out. They
dislike him for the same reason the people like him - his personal style.
Mr Tapie revelled in his fame. He appeared on television crooning with Mr
Sacha Distel, the veteran singer. He bragged about his business exploits in
a book entitled Gagner] (Winning]). He became chairman of the Olympique
Marseille football club in 1986. He posed for the press, a gold medallion
gleaming on his chest, beside his Porsche or on his yacht. In short, he
behaved as Mr Gonod's 'blokes in the local bistro' would if they were
millionaires.
Such behaviour is unremarkable in the US or UK, where self-made men are
common in corporate and political life. But in France it is difficult for
outsiders to get to the top.
One reason is the preponderance of family-controlled companies. Many of
France's most famous corporations - Michelin, Peugeot, Pernod-Ricard and
Club Mediterranee - are in family hands.
Another factor is the influence of the state, which not only controls many
of the biggest companies but also appoints their chairmen. The appointees
tend to have had a classic civil servant's education at the elite grandes
ecoles, notably the Ecole Nationale de l'Administration (ENA). Ms Leslie
Mitchell de Quillacq, writing in Powerbrokers, her recent book on the French
financial elite, found that half of the 124 most powerful people in French
finance went to ENA, and two-fifths attended one of three Parisian lycees.
The personalities of France's top businessmen reflect their backgrounds. The
role models include Mr Michel Albert, chairman of the AGF insurance group,
who has published philosophical treatises on the future of French
capitalism.
Even the handful of self-made men, such as Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of
the LVMH luxury goods group, and Mr Francois Pinault, architect of the
Pinault distribution company, conform to type. Mr Arnault likes to stress
his interest in classical music. Mr Pinault is fond of quoting his
philosopher friend, Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, in interviews.
Such traits may help them to make themselves acceptable to the French
establishment. But a mainstream magazine like Paris Match is more interested
in Mr Tapie's football triumphs, than Mr Albert's ideas on capitalism.
Mr Tapie stands out in the political sphere for the same reasons. A string
of senior socialists went to ENA, including Mr Laurent Fabius, Ms Elisabeth
Guigou and Mr Michel Rocard. Almost all the rest come from the public sector
or the professions. Mr Tapie is a rare businessman.
'There is no tradition of mixing business with politics in France,' says Mr
Serge Raffy, senior editor of Le Nouvel Observateur, the weekly news
magazine. 'Politics is seen as something clean and classical, which should
be as remote as possible from the grubby world of business.'
The Socialists fall into two camps: the bohemian gauche caviare, led by Mr
Jack Lang, the arts minister; and the austere Enarchs, the graduates of the
ENA, typified by the cerebral Mr Fabius. 'They are so elitist, all from the
same bourgeois background and the grandes ecoles,' says Mr Gonot of Paris
Match. 'Mr Tapie does not fit in. That is why the French people like him.'
Mr Tapie seems aware of this. A few weeks ago he went to give a speech at
Saint Cloud country club on the outskirts of Paris. The club's staff asked
him to leave, because he was not a member. He roared with laughter, saying
the incident proved that he was not, and probably never would be, a member
of any club.

The Insider pub just off Zurich's Paradeplatz is about to see its last
gathering of gnomes. This weekend the city's Bourse, Switzerland's
pre-eminent stock exchange, is moving to new premises a few hundred yards
away from the building it has occupied since 1930, which has the pub on its
ground floor.
But the gnomes' joy at escaping their cramped old quarters will be mixed
with bitterness about the long battle they've had to achieve the move. The
exchange's first application for a new-building permit was sent to the city
authority the whole of 14 years ago.
Worse, with change to electronic trading due within a year or so, the
spacious new trading floor will soon be redundant. And, to top it off, the
cantonal government that owns the building forbids tenants to fit air
conditioning in their offices.
Enter the summer of the steaming gnomes.

The rump, unrecognised new Yugoslavia of Serbia and Montenegro is much
smaller than the old Yugoslavia. But its new leaders still think big.
First there is Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic's vision of a Greater
Serbia. Next is Dobrica Cosic, 'elected' president of the new Yugoslavia
last month. He drew the blueprint for a greater Serbia in the 1980s when
Milosevic was rising to power. Now there is Milan Panic, 62, just chosen as
the first prime minister.
A US citizen as well as erstwhile cycling champion of the old Yugoslavia,
Panic is not one to hold back his fantasies. Among other things, he has
tried to promote an anti-Aids drug through his Californian company ICN
Pharmaceuticals, and bought a chunk of Hoffmann-La Roche only to sell it
again.
When not harassing western companies, Panic works out of Belgrade, where ICN
flogs pharmaceuticals to eastern Europe through the Galenika company. Guess
who is one of Galenika's representatives? William Scanlon, former US
ambassador to Belgrade.
That may seem a somewhat uncomfortable position, especially now America's
policy on the area has changed.

Rumours that advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was about to be signed up

Saatchi's US media-buying arm has just clinched a deal with the Bush-Quayle

party sent observers to the UK's recent general election, where Saatchi
worked for the Tory winners.
The big question, of course, is not how many millions of dollars Bush will
pay. It's that, given Saatchi's record, will Perot now throw in the towel
without trying?

Whatever next? Not only has the normally staid Royal Institute of
International Affairs burst into glossy colour with its pamphlet to mark
Britain's EC presidency, but there's a cartoon on the very front page.
Captioned 'Multi-Speed Europe? The Community Beyond Maastricht', it shows
European leaders roaring down the road away from the once little-known Dutch
town.
Helmut Kohl's Mercedes hogs pole position hotly pursued by Francois
Mitterrand, whose Citroen is slipstreamed by John Major's Rolls. Other
member-states follow in a huddle, except Denmark which has slewed off the
road in a cloud of steam. Way back, still approaching Maastricht, is a
minibus marked Efta, while far in the rear rumbles eastern Europe, an
ancient lorry belching noxious fumes.
The glitzy brochure comes courtesy of RTZ, neighbour of the institute
(familiarly known as Chatham House) in St James's Square.
At a meeting there to mark the presidency, Chatham House members were warned
by Niels Ersboll, secretary general of the EC Council of Ministers, that the
Danish No-vote was a problem that 'can only be solved by Danes', who, he
said, 'must reflect on what it could mean, and come forward with proposals'.
Since Ersboll is himself Danish, his job could well depend on the outcome.

PRESIDENT FW de Klerk's speech last night may well prove to be as momentous
as his landmark address in February 1990. On that historic occasion, he set
the stage for the release of Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African
National Congress, and Mr de Klerk's subsequent partner in South Africa's
transition from apartheid to democracy. Some 2 1/2 years later, it seems
that the partner has become the adversary. Over the past few days, both
sides have thrown down the gauntlet: the ANC when it launched a mass action
campaign designed to force Mr de Klerk to concede in the streets what he
will not concede at the conference table. Last night, it was Mr de Klerk's
turn. He understandably rejected an ANC takeover by street power, but failed
to recognise that, wherever the blame lies, his government has within its
means the capacity to tackle the violence that scars South Africa. The old
battle for power is rejoined and, unless both sides step back, only a
pyrrhic victory can be the outcome.
It may now be too late for the two sides to come together to talk. The point
has perhaps been reached where South Africans need to be saved from
themselves. The offer of mediation made by the UN secretary-general, Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, should be picked up.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Leading Article: A cut too late
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SOME months now, Wall Street has been treating bad news as good news.
Anything suggesting that the economy was weak would bring forward yet
another rate cut, and that must be good for stocks. On Wednesday, the news
of an unexpectedly weak survey from the National Association of Purchasing
Managers was greeted in just this spirit. Yesterday, came the news of
employment, and an actual cut in the official discount rate, which is the
Federal Reserve's wordless admission that it is worried; but this time, the
markets decided, after an initial Pavlovian rise, that the news really was
forbidding, and fell again.
Even if it is not sustained, this was a telling break in bull market
psychology. The bad news is partly economic, though the evidence here is not
conclusive, and partly political. Whether or not the renewed weakness of
orders and employment is a sign of a triple-dip recession, as New York
pessimists now believe, it is undoubtedly bad news for President George
Bush. The odds are now against an economic revival strong enough to revive
the president's weakening popular support before the November election. The
market, which is vulnerably high after its strong showing in recent months,
now faces political as well as economic uncertainty.
Both the Fed and the market were right to attach the greatest importance to
the employment figures rather than to orders or survey results - let alone
the still-rising official leading indicator. The Fed's latest rate cut will
no doubt be denounced as too little, too late - privately by the
administration and publicly by some of its supporters. But with short rates
now low even by historic standards (well under half the European norm), and
with the dollar drastically undervalued, it is hard to believe that an
earlier cut, or a slightly bigger one, would have made very much difference.
Rate cuts and devaluation have marked attempts to pull the economy up by its
own boot straps, assisted by an effort to export recession. The new figures
suggest that the boot straps are now too short to grasp, and that recession
is being re-imported.
US growth is being hampered by a debt work-out, which limits capital
spending both by companies and individuals, by defence cuts and by the
stagnation of real average earnings. The downturn has been intensified by
the efforts of employers to cut costs, which has dampened employment even as
output has been recovering.
Any hope of faster recovery has rested first on net exports, which have
accounted for more than half the economic growth of the last five years, and
on a revival of job growth, and thus of consumer income and confidence. The
latest figures disappoint both these hopes. Export order growth turned down
sharply in the NAPM survey, and now payroll employment and working hours
have turned down.
None of this means that the US economy is in renewed recession; the British
government would give its eye-teeth to be able to report a similar picture
of rising output with near-zero inflation. But the staying power of this
slow revival is now in question; the downturn of nearly 1 per cent in
non-military order books, excluding aircraft, is especially suggestive.
The American news is bad enough to be bad for all its trading partners, who
had been looking to US demand to revive their own economies. President Bush
may get an unusually sympathetic hearing when he calls for stimulus at
Munich next week; but sympathy will not be enough, and the Fed's example
remains a lonely as well as a cautious one.

no fraud or conspiracy behind the worst losses at the insurance market. The
bad news is the list of unedifying or unwise practices contained in his
committee's report on the business in which those losses arose, the LMX
reinsurance market.
Some of those practices make one's hair stand on end. Inexperienced
underwriters were writing reinsurance while in the dark about the risks
further down the 'spiral' of contracts. Instead of dispersing risk, the LMX
spiral served to concentrate it, but no one at Lloyd's seemed to worry.
Though LMX business looked very profitable, enticing unwary Names into
syndicates, it was persistently underpriced in view of the risks. The
regulator's principal risk-monitoring tool, a limit on the premium income
which Names can accept, exaggerates the impact of market swings rather than
dampens them. To the extent that people thought it more effective than it
actually was, a form of moral hazard was created.
Brokerage commissions appear to have been unrelated to the scale of effort
and risk involved for the broker. Working members in general did steadily
but modestly better than outside Names, and some categories of market
insiders in some years obtained a degree of preferential performance that
was 'more than modest, which was immodest'. Underwriters on profitable
syndicates routinely offered membership to brokers who could bring in
business, but denied it to outside Names.
Some members' agents seem to have taken 'a very lax view of their fiduciary
duties'; adopted a cavalier approach to Names; ignored their instructions;
failed to appreciate LMX risks or pass on warnings about them; failed to
assess the suitability of those risks for their Names; and may have put
their own interests ahead of their duty to Names. Members agents were not -
and are not - sufficiently attentive to Names. Standards for registering
members' agents were insufficiently rigorous.
Some managing agents failed to supervise their underwriters properly.
Lloyd's started examining the performance of managing agents too late in the
day. The market view that one or more major LMX underwriters were
inadequately protected from a major catastrophe did not reach the
regulators. Lloyd's has been a passive regulator, not a pro-active one.
Worst of all, without changes to Lloyd's, 'the committee do not have
confidence that problems of the kind experienced with LMX business could not
recur'.
The committee thus proposes detailed recommendations for reform, some of
which - such as the introduction of risk-weighted underwriting limits - are
sweeping. The Lloyd's council should introduce them without delay, along
with the separation between regulation and market leadership recommended by
Sir Jeremy Morse's committee.
Does the failure by the Lloyd's authorities to prevent these practices
justify a wider sharing-out within Lloyd's of losses incurred? It is hard to
make such a case in relation to Lloyd's failure to spot the business
misjudgments of managing agents and underwriters. There is a stronger case,
however, when considering those affected by the lax practices of members'
agents.
That is not how Lloyd's sees it. It is offering only hardship assistance,
and is leaving its members to sue managing agents and members' agents where
they think they have a claim. Suing Lloyd's itself has been made more
difficult by yesterday's decision in the Oakeley Vaughan case that Lloyd's
owes no legal duty of care to Names. In the light of Sir David Walker's
report, it should consider seriously whether it owes a moral one.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Where the bus stops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Conservative government was re-elected on April 9 it was put about,
with no resistance from Downing Street, that bliss was it in that dawn to be
alive.
We were, it was said, about to enter a period of everlasting prosperity and
near-zero inflation. A wave of confidence, previously held back by fears of
a Labour victory, would wash over the economy. The British presidency of the
European Community would crown the year. A mere 85 days later, it all seems
to be going wrong. Mr John Major is struggling to save his European
strategy. The economy has failed to resurge. The recession is beginning to
look endless.
In such moments of gloom, politicians' thoughts turn to the ancient question
 -who would become prime minister if the incumbent met with an accident,
political or otherwise? The charming English way of putting it is, 'who is
the bus candidate?' - who gets the job if the prime minister is run over by
a bus? For the moment, I suspect, it is Mr Kenneth Clarke. Do not mistake
me. Mr Major is performing well, perhaps never better than under fire in the
Commons this week. It is exceedingly unlikely that he will be brought down
by either the recession, or Maastricht, in spite of Lady Thatcher's
onslaught yesterday afternoon. Yet his twin strategies of dovishness on the
EC and hawkishness on inflation could fail. What then? His two immediate
lieutenants, the foreign secretary and the chancellor, are direct
accomplices, so rule them out as bus candidates.
We are back to Mr Clarke. He has the look of a man who was slightly
bewildered when he found on April 10 that he was home secretary. He was
still busy shaking up the health service when, late in the summer of 1990,
the then Mrs Thatcher moved him to education. He recovered from that. Then
education needed turning upside-down. He knew how to do that, too.
The Home Office is more complicated. In continental Europe, it would be a
ministry of the interior; in the US, the Justice Department. In Britain,
neither model is acceptable. US federal law is an alien concept. The
overriding powers of an interior ministry are regarded as un-English. Mr
Clarke's office is a rag-bag, taking on what other domestic departments
decline. It handles petitions to the Queen, grants licences for scientific
experiments on animals, and supervises cremations, burials and exhumations.
Mr Clarke is putting the electoral boundaries bill (the bill to create
between 15 and 20 more Conservative seats) through the Commons now and will
doubtless one day be saddled with a Sunday trading free-for-all bill. He has
a good track record for handling troublesome measures of this kind.
Some of the organisational mess has already been tidied up. Responsibility
for the press and broadcasting has gone to Mr David Mellor's new ministry
for having a nice day. Mrs Gillian Shephard's employment department now
looks after the Equal Opportunities Commission. The administration of
magistrates' courts has been transferred to the lord chancellor.
What the public expects of Mr Clarke, however, is safe streets, punished
criminals and no immigrants. As to the latter, he believes strongly that
tight controls on immigration are an essential prerequisite for good race
relations. I think laws to keep blacks out encourage racialism, but, alas,
this view does not prevail. The English capacity for pretending that
immigration laws are non-racial is infinite. Mr Clarke, whose view of the
law is that it should be genuinely colour-blind, will extend the remit of
the asylum bill that was withdrawn when the election was called. He agrees
that racialist attitudes among immigration officers must be curbed, but
asserts that would-be illegal migrants try on so many dodges that it is
little wonder that officials are jaded. Whatever he does is likely to cause
a row.
Crime is even more tricky. Since 1980, the Tories have spent Pounds 1bn on
new jails. The new criminal justice act is designed to keep non-violent
offenders out of them. Yet prisons will still be overflowing in the year
2000. Mr Clarke sees an inconsistency in a Tory government cutting the
prison population for reasons of economy. He has to live with this. But he
may try to economise by privatising more prisons. He will appoint a
quasi-independent chief executive to manage the public part of the service,
whose administration is due to move to its own premises. The police will be
reorganised into larger units and may be diverted from non-core tasks, such
as supervising football matches and writing traffic tickets. Police
authorities will be reformed, he knows not yet how.
All this should endear Mr Clarke to the rightwingers who are beginning to
set their sights on Mr Major. They should beware. The home secretary is
loyal to the prime minister. He is also a convinced European, favouring the
EC, European Union, Emu, single currency and all. That should stop their
bus.

FT  03 JUL 92 / A move away from meltdown: Next week's G7 summit will seek
ways of reducing the threat from Soviet-designed nuclear plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing alarm about the defects of Soviet-designed nuclear reactors has
prompted western leaders to draw up a wide-ranging emergency programme,
intended to make the plants safe before there is another Chernobyl-type
catastrophe.
The Group of Seven summit meeting in Munich next week is expected to approve
a short-term action plan, which would involve spending several hundred
million dollars on the 25 most hazardous reactors - in Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and three former Soviet republics: Russia, Lithuania and
Ukraine. This could lead to a more extensive long-term programme, with cost
estimates running between Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) and Dollars 20bn, to
bring all reactors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union up to
western safety standards.
Although the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had shown the shortcomings of
Soviet-designed nuclear plants, the awesome scale of the problem only became
apparent as the Soviet bloc unravelled during 1990. That enabled western
experts to examine the reactors in detail.
Soon after German reunification, the government in Bonn closed down the four
Soviet-designed pressurised water reactors (PWRs) it inherited at Greifswald
on the Baltic coast. Then, early in 1991, the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) urged the Bulgarian government to take immediate action to
improve safety at four similar PWRs at Kozloduy. Quite apart from the basic
design defects, notably the absence of an emergency cooling system and
containment to enclose the reactors in an accident, IAEA inspectors found
that management and workers were too demoralised and incompetent to run the
plant properly. Even the basic operating manuals and plant drawings had been
lost.
Kozloduy itself is a safer place today. A team of 20 nuclear specialists
from western Europe has been working there for almost a year, with funding
from the EC and technical co-ordination from the World Association of
Nuclear Operators (Wano), to improve the management and operation of the
plant. But no one has started to tackle the fundamental flaws in the Soviet
VVER 230 reactor design.
Elsewhere in eastern Europe and the CIS, there still has been virtually no
practical action to solve even the most urgent short-term safety problems.
The past 18 months have seen countless visits to Soviet-designed power
stations by different western organisations - nuclear utilities, equipment
manufacturers, regulatory bodies, and international organisations - all
looking for research and commercial opportunities and often working at cross
purposes.
Mr Morris Rosen, director of the IAEA nuclear safety division, says the
initiatives are unco-ordinated and often dictated not by need or importance
'but solely by the desire of donors to participate. Representatives of east
European countries question whether assistance is focused on their needs or
on donor research and commercial interests'.
'Up to the present time, the west has shown no inclination to improve the
safety of Russian reactors,' says Lord Marshall, former head of the UK's
Central Electricity Generating Board and now Wano's chairman. 'They have
only shown an inclination to analyse safety from their own point of view.'
Meanwhile potentially serious accidents continue to occur. Mr Viktor
Sidorenko, Russia's deputy atomic energy minister, said in Moscow this week
there had been two incidents last year and two more in the first half of
1992 that were rated at level 3 on the 7 point international scale of
nuclear accidents ('serious fault involving loss of protection or heavy
pollution or radiation of personnel').
A radiation leak last March from one of the four Chernobyl-type RBMK
reactors at Sosnovy Bor near St Petersburg gave western governments a new
sense of urgency. The outcome is the emergency programme drawn up for the
Munich meeting next week, which is intended to provide both co-ordination
and substantial non-commercial funding. Most of the Dollars 700m to Dollars
800m required will be provided by the G7 members.
The programme will concentrate on the 10 VVER 230 reactors (in Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and Russia) and 15 RBMKs (in Russia, Lithuania and Ukraine)
which have the most serious design defects. The remaining 32 Soviet-designed
PWRs are more modern and come closer to meeting western standards.
Most of the work in the programme is expected to be completed within two
years. It is intended to provide:
Improved operational safety through better staff training, management
procedures, technical manuals and so on.
New hardware such as back-up diesel generators, computerised control rooms
and fire walls.
Nuclear regulators, independent of the plant operators, with powers to
inspect reactors and shut them down if necessary.
An overall energy strategy, which will enable each country to assess its
need for nuclear power in relation to other energy sources.
The organisational details will not be settled until the G7 leaders meet
next week. The EC countries favour a genuinely multilateral programme run
from an office in Brussels, while the US and Japan prefer bilateral
assistance - with a co-ordinating mechanism to ensure that all the necessary
work is done without wasteful duplication.
In the discussions running up to Munich, the UK government has been
particularly keen to divorce emergency assistance, which it sees as a
non-commercial safety precaution, from the commercial issue of upgrading the
more modern Soviet-designed reactors to international standards and building
new ones to operate well into the next century.
'Investment in such stations should await the results of the energy studies
and the introduction of economic pricing,' said Mr Timothy Walker, head of
the atomic energy division at the Department of Trade and Industry. 'The
decision on which and how many should be upgraded needs to be made on an
economic and commercial basis in the light of alternative ways of meeting
energy demand.'
So the G7 meeting will point out the need for a long-term upgrading
programme - and may ask the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to work out a way of funding it through
commercial loans - but the seven leaders are in no mood to commit the west
to spending the Dollars 10bn required.
Mr Andrei Konoplyanik, deputy minister for fuel and energy, made it clear
this week that the Russians too are wary of grandiose proposals whose 'major
benefits will be received by western producers of nuclear energy equipment'.
They know that western manufacturers, starved of orders from their own
nuclear-shy utilities, are looking forward to a feast in the east. Siemens
of Germany, Framatome of France and Westinghouse of the US have been
particularly active.
But Mr Konoplyanik, who will be accompanying President Boris Yeltsin to
Munich, says Russia would be prepared to accept western assistance with a
long-term energy programme involving the closure of the RBMK and older VVER
reactors over the next decade, expansion of non-nuclear generating capacity
and 'joint creation of a new generation of highly safe nuclear power
stations on the basis of Russian R&amp;D'. He estimates its total cost at
Dollars 24bn over 10 years.
Even the G7's emergency programme may be unacceptable to the Russians. The
west does not want Russia to use its assistance to keep dangerous reactors
going indefinitely. But if it demands a firm commitment to decommission the
RBMKs and VVER 230s as quickly as possible, the Russian atomic energy
ministry, new home of the old Soviet nuclear establishment, will object.
Mr Sidorenko made it clear that, while Russia has no plans to build any more
RBMKs, it is not ready to close the existing plants. And it is going ahead
with the construction of three new VVERs.
Even the most zealous anti-nuclear campaigners accept the region is too
short of electricity to close down the most dangerous plants immediately.
The power shortage is most acute in Bulgaria, which relies on Kozloduy for
35 to 40 per cent of its electricity. Its vulnerability was underlined last
February when faults shut down two of the reactors - and consumers
throughout the country had their electricity cut off for two hours in every
four.
Elsewhere, the nuclear share of electricity generation in 1991 was 51 per
cent in Hungary, 45 per cent in Lithuania, 28 per cent in Czechoslovakia and
25 per cent in Ukraine. (The comparable figure for the UK was 20 per cent.)
In Russia as a whole, nuclear plants generated 12 per cent of electricity,
but the share is considerably higher in the industrialised European part of
the country - where there is no spare non-nuclear generating capacity.
However, Greenpeace maintains that all 15 RBMK reactors in the former Soviet
Union could be phased out of operation within five years, by building new
gas-fired power stations and persuading consumers and industry to waste less
energy. Energy prices are still well below world levels and most Russian
households have neither electricity meters nor thermostats.
The atomic energy ministry admits that Russians waste a lot of electricity
but says the country lacks the technical resources to increase efficiency
nearly as fast as Greenpeace claims is possible.
Most Russian nuclear engineers remain proud of their achievements - and
reluctant to admit that the RBMK has the fundamental design flaws identified
by their western colleagues. But they recognise that its demise is now
inevitable.
Entek, the R&amp;D Institute for Power Engineering in Moscow, now believes the
best way to maintain an active Russian nuclear industry is to develop a
'radically new nuclear technology - one that is capable of resolving the
fuel and power problems the whole world will face in the next century'.
Entek's favourite candidate is a 1000MW fast reactor cooled by molten lead,
which its scientists say could be developed within a dozen years. For anyone
concerned about the present generation of Soviet-designed plants, that may
sound an alarming proposition, but the engineers insist the lead-cooled
reactor would be safer than anything on offer from the west.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: Do I Hear a Waltz? - Musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The film Summertime is a regular in the repeat slot on television and it
came around again not so long ago. There, amid the ravishing backdrops of
sun-soaked Venice, are Katharine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi, embarking on a
summer romance that we know will end with smiles shining through the tears.
It is less well known that the same book also spawned a musical. Richard
Rodgers's Do I hear a waltz? opened on Broadway in 1965 and ran for 220
performances, a short run by his standards. It was felt that the show failed
because of the jaundiced view it takes of Americans on holiday, who are
shown setting out with a couple of Italian phrases on their lips and little
but a quick vacation romance on their minds.
This is the satirical cutting edge, aided by Stephen Sondheim's lyrics,
which is brought to bear on what might otherwise have been a stickily
sentimental plot. Still, there are some good tunes, too good to have been
forgotten certainly; and Martin Connor's production for the Guildhall School
of Music students caught nicely the intimacy of a show, which has no really
big numbers but spends its time sending romantic duos echoing along the
canals of Venice.
Among the travellers is Leona Samish, a thirtysomething single woman, not a
loser, but not much money and no man, always alone in a crowd. Rodgers's
music has given her romantic dreams, while Sondheim typically chips away at
the pain within. Alice Macdonald did better by Rodgers, although by the end
she had also won sympathy for a woman tricky to play in her very
ordinariness.
Most of the big singing goes to the lead man (Sergio Franchi impressive on
the original cast recording). Renato Di Rossi works in a tourist gift shop,
though what he is best at selling is his affections. He loves Puccini,which
Zubin Varla found a tall order; but he too made a success of a difficult
role by catching the sincerity, the middle-age experience, the Latin charm
of the man.
The caricatures of the other tourists, all 'generous, never-fuss' Americans,
are a gift. Elizabeth Chadwick and David Curtiz were the bright young
couple, working hard at some ambitious choreography by David Toguri.
Melanie Ramsay and Charles Edwards were spot-on as the older pair, him in
business, her the gawky wife. Polly Moore made her mark as the owner of the
pensione who scavenges on stray husbands among her guests.
In retrospect, what makes this musical worth seeing again is the unique
match of its composer and lyricist. Just when Rodgers is indulging in
ballads which melt too easily in the mouth, Sondheim is there, ready to turn
hope into disillusion, relationships back into loneliness.
Performances continue until July 9 (Box Office 071-638 8891)

FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: As You Like It - Ludlow Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As always, the heart of the Ludlow Festival is the open-air Shakespeare in
the ruins of the Castle. This year, Alan Cohen's direction gives As You Like
It a notably contemporary look. Designer Claire Lyth, with Adrian Gwillym,
has provided costumes of our own day, with a touch of the military in the
Duke's Court. Orlando's odes and elegies, duly spiked all over the plenteous
greenery, are written on A4 sheets. Orlando himself (John Gordon-Sinclair)
is a pleasant young man, faintly Scottish, whom you might see any day in a
high-class soap.
It feels as if the audience has spilt on to the stage and carries on there
as it does elsewhere in town. Maybe Shropshire's country copulatives would
end up with fewer marriages, but they might be as well satisfied with Hymen
in charge as the local Sir Oliver Martext. The emotions are, deliberately, I
would say, not explored deeply. The talk between Celia and Rosalind prior to
their leaving for Arden is kept mainly to their usual jokey attitudes.
Victoria Wicks, an enchanting Rosalind, need only put a cap on to turn
herself into a boy, for (since the days when she could only be a boy) no
one, not even Orlando, has seriously had to believe that she is one.
Celia (Wendy Morgan) should have told Touchstone not to bring his golf-clubs
with him, but Sylvester McCoy makes him whole-heartedly comic - most
unlikely to give a speech about quarrelling by the book, so he didn't. Bald,
reserved Jaques (Ken Drury) would never learn real clowning from him, and
chose better to join the converted Duke, who at least was never trivial.
Alex Hardy's Duke is in fact very positive; he might almost have been
commanding UN troops in mid-Europe. His exiled brother (Robert Arnold) also
likes to get things done, but more patiently. He was specially patient with
Amiens, who sang Michael Gregory's awful settings of the well-known songs
with appropriate lack of sympathy.
Such small matters never lowered the general feeling of comic
do-as-you-please for long, and Victoria Wicks's delivery of the epilogue
aroused proper enthusiasm.
There is more than Shakespeare in the Festival. There is a evening with
Seamus Heaney, one with Simon Brett, one with Brian D. Barnes (as Pepys).
There are organ, piano and violin recitals, concerts. Bach's Mass in B minor
will be sung in the parish church, and so will Madam Butterfly. There are
fringe theatre and jazz. There is, above all, the lovely little town on the
Teme, in the heart of the Housman country.
The Festival runs from June 27 to July 12, sponsored by national and local
businesses and individuals. (0584) 872150

FT  03 JUL 92 / People: Time Products turns the clock back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Langdon, one of the City's veteran company doctors, is signing off
from another of his former patients. He has handed back the chairmanship of
Time Products to Marcus Margulies (right), whose family has been involved
with the company for many years.
While Time Products, Britain's leading watch distributor, was never in as
serious a financial condition as FNFC, another of Langdon's patients, it has
benefited from his conservative touch at the helm. A former senior partner
of accountants Spicer and Pegler, he took over the Time chairmanship in 1984
after the company had reported a big loss and cut its dividend following an
ill-judged expansion into Hong Kong.
The 49-year old Margulies, a well known figure in the international watch
industry, had been chairman of the company for seven years before Langdon
was recruited. He said yesterday that Langdon had transformed his family-run
company into a proper business. Although it is suffering like the rest of
the watch industry, it has Pounds 20m of net cash, and its strength now lies
in brand marketing and distribution rather than manufacturing, the cause of
many of its previous problems.
Langdon, who is 73, has been shedding several of his directorships including
the chairmanship of FNFC and deputy chairmanship of Chemring. However, he
will remain a non-executive director of Time. Meanwhile, Frank Frame, a
recently retired deputy chairman of Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corporation, has been appointed deputy chairman, and Keith Brooks, who has
been responsible for building up Time's Sekonda brand, has been promoted to
joint managing director. Roger Tsui, managing director of Remex, has
resigned from the board following Time's decision to dispose of its Hong
Kong trading operations.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Technology: Reflections of an electronics pioneer in Silicon
Valley - Bill Hewlett talks to Louise Kehoe and Geoffrey Owen about building
his company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and GEOFFREY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We had a good education and there weren't a lot of jobs around, so (we
thought) why not try to start a business. So we did any work that we could
get. We built a foul line indicator for a bowling alley, and a clock drive
for a telescope, and just whatever came in the door.
In these words Bill Hewlett recalls the early days of the Hewlett-Packard
Company, one of the oldest surviving West Coast electronics companies.
Today, Hewlett-Packard is a Dollars 14.5bn company, with nearly 90,000
employees; a leader in Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) technology;
one of the top manufacturers of computer printers; and to this day, a
company that retains its roots in the electronic instruments business.
Now 79, Hewlett can still be found several days each week in his office at
HP's Research Laboratories, only a few miles from the rented garage in which
as young engineers he and David Packard set up shop in 1938.
As technology entrepreneurs, Hewlett and Packard set a trend that during the
past half century has created, in California, the world's largest complex of
high technology companies. They also established, from the beginning, a
corporate philosophy based on openness and respect for the individual that
has had a strong influence on the character of what is now known as 'Silicon
Valley'.
Bill Hewlett explains in simple terms: 'We didn't want to have a 'hire and
fire' company. Both Dave and I were products of the Great Depression. We had
observed its effects on all sides, and of course it had a strong effect on
us. It could not help but influence our decisions on how a company should be
run.'
While layoffs have now become commonplace in Silicon Valley during periods
of economic recession, the ideal of valuing employees' contributions above
short-term profits remains. A pragmatist, Hewlett acknowledges that 'certain
times you have to be that way, but we just didn't want that kind of a
company'. The kind of company that Hewlett and Packard did want gave
employees a stake in the company's success. In the early days, they
initiated a production bonus plan. 'The same percentage was paid to the
janitor as to the top manager,' Hewlett recalls. Being egalitarian ensures
that communications within the company are open, he believes.
Openness was another important tenet of the 'HP Way'. Hewlett chuckles as he
remembers inviting a German competitor to visit the HP plant. When Hewlett
returned the visit, he recounts, 'he had to show me through his plant. He
obviously had never shown a person through the plant in all his life and he
didn't know what to do]' That started a policy which HP still adheres to and
which has become a distinct characteristic of Silicon Valley. 'You show
competitors what you are doing - they will learn soon enough. Just don't
tell them what you are thinking]'
In contrast to today's entrepreneurs, Hewlett and Packard were determined
not to 'operate on borrowed money'. 'We started with a very small amount of
money (Dollars 538) and we operated, as much as possible, on a pay-as-you-go
basis, that our growth be financed by our earnings and not by debt.'
Neither did Hewlett and Packard start out with a 'grand vision', nor even
the idea of commercialising a technology breakthrough, like many of their
modern-day counterparts. 'We just took on odd jobs,' Hewlett recalls.
Some were odd indeed. They included developing an optical device to
automatically flush a urinal, as well as an automatic lettuce thinner,
designed to thin out rows of vegetable seedlings. Before long, however, HP
found its niche with a device invented by Hewlett during his post graduate
studies at Stanford University.
The 'audio oscillator', for measuring sound waves, gave HP its first
commercial success. 'We sent out flyers to some of the universities and to
our surprise we got an order or two back, so we sent out more flyers and we
got more orders and it looked like a good field to go into so we branched
out into related instruments. So that is really how we got started.' HP's
first 'big' order, for eight oscillators, came from Walt Disney for use in
the production of the film Fantasia.
'Originally, electronics - that word had not yet been coined - radio
engineering, we called it, consisted of the phonograph and the recording
industry, the telephone industry, the talking pictures, and geophysical
work. It was in those fairly narrow fields that we found our customers, as
well as the universities.'
The second world war interrupted Hewlett's career, but it did not stunt the
growth of his company. 'I had a reserve commission. When I went into the
Army, we had 17 employed, and when I came out I think we had about 250.'
Although HP took on very little 'war work', the company flourished on the
growing awareness of the importance of electronics. 'What the war did do for
us - it made it evident that electronics could be applied in many provinces.
So all of a sudden you found it appearing all over. And we shared in this
growth directly, because if you make something, you've got to measure it.'
The war years established David Packard as the 'manager' of the company,
while Bill Hewlett took on the 'engineering' role.
However, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this half century partnership
is that throughout it the two men have remained friends as well as business
associates, spending holidays together as recently as last year, and always
regarding their roles at the company as interchangeable.
In 1969-1971, when David Packard went to Washington to serve as deputy
secretary of defense, Hewlett readily took over the management of the
company until his partner's return.
It was in the mid 1960s that Hewlett-Packard took its first cautious steps
into the computer business.
'Our customers were getting more sophisticated and a lot of them wanted to
have something to control instruments and to take data from the instruments.
'This obviously meant a computer, so we got into the computer business, not
for data processing per se, but really as a controller for instruments.
Later, HP researchers came up with the idea of a desktop calculator.
It really was a computer, but we didn't want to call it a computer, because
every company had a computer guru and all they wanted was IBM.'
Even now that computers represent the lion's share of HP's revenues, Hewlett
seems to remain sceptical, although he is enthusiastic about HP's laser
printers, 'one of our most successful products'.
He also remembers clearly and makes no secret of the ones that did not prove
to be winners. 'We tried to make a watch, a computer watch, and we sold it
for Dollars 700. That was a disaster. It was a nice watch, you know, but we
just couldn't make it for what our competitors could make it for.'
But what of HP's future? Where will HP be five years from now? 'I can't tell
you,' Hewlett states firmly.
'The longest planning period we've ever had was three years. We had a five
year plan and didn't pay any attention to it. Three years is as far ahead as
we could see. That says a lot about this industry. It's very hard - it's not
like making railroad cars. You have to be flexible and roll with the
punches.'
'But I can tell you that I think we are in a strong position. We've got a
good work staff, we've got good management and a good financial position. So
unless we screw it up, I think we're in good shape.'
Despite his advancing years, Hewlett remains very much involved in the
company, albeit in an unofficial capacity these days.
'Dave (Packard) and I know enough people so we can find out what's going on
when John (John Young, HP chief executive) may not know it. And we bring
these to John's attention. Boy, he hops to it,' says Hewlett with a grin.

FT  03 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Glimmer of northern light on Tyne -
Vanessa Houlder on regenerating Newcastle's inner city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinging to the steep slopes of the river bank, just downstream from the
Tyne Bridge in north-east England, is Newcastle's most spectacular
development site.
In spite of the grandeur of the setting, the East Quayside area exudes a
melancholy air of neglect. After decades of decline, the river banks are
today home to dilapidated warehouses and ballast heaps.
But East Quayside has now received a potential shot in the arm. Last week,
AMEC, a construction, engineering and development group, signed an agreement
to build 123,500 sq ft of offices on the western edge of the site.
This is the first phase of a Pounds 180m scheme which could lead to the
construction of 200 flats and houses, a five-star hotel, 324,000 sq ft of
offices and 135,000 sq ft of shopping on the 25-acre site over the next 10
years.
The development has attracted its fair share of criticism and praise. Local
politicians say the master-plan is misdirected in terms of the overall
regeneration of the area, while the Royal Fine Arts Commission has described
the scheme as 'an examplar for other city regeneration schemes'.
The signing of the deal last week, in a restored sailors' chapel on the
site, was described as an 'historical moment' by Mr Alastair Balls, chief
executive of Tyne and Wear Development Corporation (TWDC). Mr John Redwood,
UK minister for inner cities, said of the scheme: 'A vision of the future .
. . taking Tyneside into the next millennium.'
Besides dwelling on the scheme's development potential, Mr Redwood also
acknowledged that the project must have a social dimension. 'It must work
for the community as well. There must be jobs and training for people who
live nearby.'
Mr Redwood's comment touched upon an issue which is dominating the national
debate about urban regeneration: namely how to ensure the social as well as
physical regeneration of an inner city area.
The problem was summed up by the House of Commons employment committee in
1988. 'Urban development corporations cannot be regarded as a success if
buildings and land are regenerated but the local community is passed by and
does not benefit from regeneration.'
The government's opponents believe that its urban regeneration strategy has
failed that test. 'The problem has been that the policy is entirely based on
property development rather than investment in the residents of the areas
concerned or in creating businesses,' says Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's
environment spokesman.
Since 1987 urban development corporations have spent Pounds 2bn throughout
the UK on what critics describe as 'worthless flagship projects' that have
done nothing to regenerate the country's manufacturing base. There is also
little evidence, they add, to support the idea that the wealth created by
bringing offices or tourism to a run-down area 'trickles down' to local
communities.
Newcastle provides a vivid illustration of the challenge facing those
concerned with the problem of urban regeneration in the UK. Indeed the need
to improve the lot of the residents of run-down areas was underlined by the
riots last September in the west end of Newcastle and the Meadow Well estate
in North Shields.
Many of TWDC's development sites are surrounded by some of the most deprived
housing sites in Newcastle - a fact which graphically reminds the
corporation of its social responsibilities. The TWDC has had some success in
creating manufacturing jobs. At the Royal Quays, a large development site in
north Tyneside, Twinings, a tea packaging company, has put up a 90,000 sq ft
plant, which will employ 270 people when it opens in the summer.
But elsewhere, some of the projects undertaken by the TWDC provide little
suitable work for the local workforce. Historically, a third of Tyneside's
workforce has been employed in the coal, steel or shipbuilding industries.
The manual skills associated with these industries do not transfer well to
service industries. The difficulty for the corporation is that it is easier
to attract office users than industry to inner cities.
In the absence of new manufacturing employers, the work of the TWDC
therefore risks underlining the divisions between the haves and have-nots.
St Peter's Basin, a marina project developed built by Barratt at a cost of
Pounds 27m with an Pounds 11m contribution from the TWDC, is a case in
point. The corporation argues that this development, on an old industrial
site, helped change the image of the river-side. However, St Peter's Basin
has been described by locals as an anomalous enclave of prosperity sitting
in the shadow of one of Newcastle's roughest estates.
Consider also the case of Newcastle Business Park, which is situated on a
landscaped development built on the former Vickers armaments factory site on
the bank of the Tyne. The TWDC sees the park as an 'outstanding success'
having let 95 per cent of its space in 18 months. Yet the park is still a
short distance away from a housing estate where unemployment is rife and
which has secured little in the way of new jobs as a result of the park.
The corporation realises that something has to be done for local
communities. And it has acted. It is helping to fund social housing to
provide more than 600 homes. It also gives grant aid for community schemes
and provides funding to retrain people formerly employed in the shipping and
coal industries.
However, as the TWDC's Mr Balls says, the increasing emphasis on the social
dimension of urban regeneration should not distract from the need for
investment and jobs. Empowerment of local communities, he says, has little
meaning without the prospect of jobs.
This view is shared by North Tyneside council. It has put in a bid to win a
share of the Pounds 750m available under the government's City Challenge
urban regeneration scheme to rebuild the Community Centre on the Meadowell
estate and install infrastructure on an adjacent industrial estate.
According to Mr John Foster of North Tyneside Council, the two elements -
social and employment - must be combined. 'Our view is that one without the
other has been tried without success since the 1970s,' he says.
The lesson of urban regeneration in the 1980s is that merely attracting
private investment to inner cities is not enough, if it does not create the
right type of jobs. In spite of the partial success of the 1980s in
transforming inner cities, urban regeneration is likely to remain as big a
problem in the decade ahead as it was in the decade past.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith intends to update Labour's
values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, plans to present a paper at Labour's
annual conference in Blackpool this autumn spelling out an updated
reinterpretation of the party's core aims and values.
The paper, now under discussion in the Smith camp, will draw strongly on the
strands of Labour thinking that deal with the liberation of the individual
in society and play down the role of the state as manager and social
engineer.
While the contender for Labour party leadership has taken pains not to
appear to be pre-empting his certain victory at the electoral conference on
July 18, planning is already well under way for his first 18 months. The
10,000-word discussion document, which will be drawn up in consultation with
close colleagues, is likely to be put to the national executive committee
for approval as a catalyst to spark a year-long public debate on the party's
future. Mr Smith has already let it be known he is anxious to avoid any
headlong rush back to policy planning before an intellectual framework for
the future has been developed.
He is determined to use a year of debate to highlight the party's history of
progressive thinking and achievements in an effort to build confidence and
counter the doomsayers disparaging Labour as wedded to a discredited
philosophy.
Senior figures close to Mr Smith stressed yesterday that its aim was to
broaden Labour's objectives. It is intended to expand debate well beyond the
parameters outlined in a similar 'aims and values' document written by Mr
Roy Hattersley in 1987.
The Smith paper is expected to seek a balance between the state's role as a
propagator and promoter of the interests of society at large and its duty to
act as a watchdog of individual liberties.
It draws in part on a discussion of the role of community. The paper is also
expected to stress the seams of Labour philosophy that deal with the
liberation of the individual rather than the role of the state.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher calls for rethink -
Debates in the Lords and Commons strengthen the attack on the government
over Europe and the Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S attempt to find a way through the difficulties over the
Maastricht treaty came under fire from Baroness Thatcher yesterday as she
used her first speech in the House of Lords to urge the Community to 'think
again'.
She said: 'Searching for a definition of subsidiarity is not a way forward.'
She added that it appeared to be being discussed on the basis that the
Community had the power which it then parcelled out to the member states.
'It should be the member states that exercise all powers except those
specifically and legally granted to the Commission,' she said.
Her own proposal was for the government to press for a formal and binding
restatement of the Luxembourg compromise - under which a vote is postponed
until agreement can be reached if a country feels that a vital national
interest is at stake. She said the move, though limited, would 'go some way
to restore people's confidence in the Community'.
Lady Thatcher's renewed call for a referendum on Maastricht received some
support from Lord Callaghan, a former Labour prime minister. He acknowledged
the force of her point that because the policy of the three main parties'
was to ratify Maastricht, the British people have had no way of expressing a
view on the matter in the election.
Lord Callaghan said he believed the treaty should be ratified and the
government should argue the case for acceptance in a referendum after the
bill had been passed.
Although maiden speeches are conventionally uncontroversial, it was clear
that peers had been looking forward to an occasion billed as being anything
but. Crowded in the doorways and seated on the steps of the throne, they
listened intently throughout the 25-minute speech, in what would normally be
a routine debate on developments in Europe. A huddle of Euro-sceptic MPs
looked down from the gallery, joined by Mr Graham Bright, the prime
minister's parliamentary private secretary.
Lady Thatcher warned that as EC ministers spent more time in each other's
company they became out of touch with their electors. 'Justifiable
scepticism is on the increase. People feel that their governments have gone
ahead too fast, so that now the gap between governments and people is too
wide,' she said.
She rounded on the message that had been coming from government loyalists,
that the powers transferred to the Community under the Maastricht agreement
were comparable with those transferred in the Single European Act which was
approved during her premiership. Any comparison was, she said, misplaced,
and she drew particular attention to the assurances given by Lord Howe of
Aberavon, then Sir Geoffrey Howe, and Baroness Chalker - the foreign office
ministers at the time - about the restrictions on the extended use of
qualified majority voting to bring about the single market.
Lady Thatcher also supported the government's efforts towards swift action
on enlarging the Community, underlining the importance of bringing in the
eastern European countries to help sustain their democracies and economies.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor firm on DM revaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OPPOSITION call for the D-Mark to be revalued against other currencies in
the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was last night derided as a U-turn by
chancellor Norman Lamont.
He charged Mr John Smith, his Labour opposite number, with backing away from
his one firm pre-election commitment.
Mr Lamont's attack came after he had endured a difficult time at the hands
of Tory backbenchers concerned that Britain's readiness to accept a
Community-wide minimum rate of value added tax might restrict the
government's future room for manoeuvre.
Sir Peter Tapsell, Conservative MP for Lindsey East, warned that with less
control over indirect taxation on the one hand and exchange and interest
rates on the other, future chancellors could easily find themselves 'boxed
in.'
Mr Smith's call for 'an upward revaluation of the D-Mark' against other ERM
currencies including sterling came in a speech advocating a European
strategy for growth and employment.
The revaluation should be considered in a bid to secure 'co-ordinated
interest rate cuts in every member state,' the probable winner of the
current Labour leadership contest continued. It was worth weighing whether
'the highly unusual circumstances of German unification' did not justify
such a step, he said.
Arguing that Ecofin - the council of economic and finance ministers - should
have 'the determining role' in the shaping of overall economic policy, he
advised against confining the objective of the proposed European central
bank to 'an exclusive concern with price stability.'
Flanked by Mr Michael Portillo, his Treasury lieutenant, Mr Lamont rebuffed
his Tory critics by insisting his preparedness to accept a 15 per cent
minimum EC-wide VAT rate for a limited period would not constrain the
flexibility of the government's tax policy.
Since the domestic minimum was currently 17 1/2 per cent, it was not
'realistic' to expect a cut to below 15 per cent to be implemented in the
next three years, he said. He remained, however, 'highly sceptical' that a
minimum VAT rate was necessary for a single market.
Conserving his attack on Mr Smith's revaluation proposal until the final
moments of his speech, he said that the shadow chancellor had 'told us again
and again' before the election that he did not want to see the pound
devalued.
Opening the debate earlier, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had said
the government would not make a decision until the autumn on whether MPs
should be asked to proceed with the bill ratifying the Maastricht treaty.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM seeks to calm backbench jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night sought to calm the nerves of backbench Conservative
MPs with a prediction that the government's economic strategy would deliver
permanent control of inflation.
Acknowledging the unease among some of his supporters, the prime minister
admitted that the pace of economic recovery had been disappointing. But he
warned that a relaxation of the government's anti-inflationary stance would
jeopardise the prospect of 'stable prices' during the present parliament
He underlined also his anger with those Tories - including Baroness Thatcher
 -who believed that Britain could reject the Maastricht treaty on European
economic and political union.
Setting out his domestic policy objectives, the prime minister promised
'radical' legislation to tackle the problems of inner-city schools and a
campaign to spread the benefits of the Conservative 'revolution' to the less
affluent.
He called for a determined efforts by the party to capitalise on Labour
disarray by rebuilding support in those areas - including Scotland, Wales
and the south-west - where it had failed to win majorities at the general
election.
For the short term, however, Mr Major warned that the sharp rise in public
borrowing foreshadowed a 'tough and difficult' round of public spending
negotiations.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Belgian collection exceeds estimate: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WELL-TRAVELLED collection of work by the Belgian poet-turned-artist Marcel
Broodthaers caused a sensation at Christie's yesterday.
The nine objects of 1965-66 were all acquired directly from the artist by
the vendor and are witness to Broodthaers' highly developed sense of the
absurd.
Elements of everyday life - mussels and egg shells are particular favourites
 -are combined as puns or ironic comments on the economic and political life
of the period.
Lot after lot soared way over its estimate, realising a total of Pounds
1.28m. 'Armoire Blanche et Table Blanche', which presents a kitchen table
covered in egg shells and the cabinet above packed full of them, achieved
the top price of Pounds 396,000, paid by dealers Berggruen &amp; Zevi on behalf
of a private client. It was estimated at Pounds 80,000-120,000.
The company also secured a 'Panneau de Moules' for Pounds 88,000, while a
punning moule casserole fetched Pounds 176,000 (estimate Pounds
15,000-Pounds 20,000). Various bidders had hoped to secure the entire
collection to keep it intact.
British contemporary art fared less well during the day. Lucien Freud's
painting of a naked girl asleep was bought in at Sotheby's at Pounds
300,000. In the afternoon at Christie's, his portrait of a man in a sports
shirt tipped the bottom estimate, realising Pounds 275,000. His 'Woman in
Profile' also failed to reach the reserve.
The sale's star lot, a small Francis Bacon portrait, did sell - but
substantially below target. London dealer Thomas Gibson bought it for Pounds
110,000. It was Bacon's last portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne, a favourite
model who had also sat for the likes of Picasso, Epstein and Giacometti.
Sotheby's top price of Pounds 319,000 came from Lucio Fontana's pierced
egg-shape 'La Fine di Dio'.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Talks may answer Ulster question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Face-to-face talks between leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland
and the British and Irish governments are expected to start in London next
week. The latest series of political talks started in April but are based on
a programme agreed by the partici-pants in March last year. The structure of
the talks is highly complex, reflecting the sensitivities of the province's
politics. Ralph Atkins answers fundamental questions about progress so far.
What exactly has been agreed this week?
So far the talks process has been on 'strand one' in which local politicians
discussed devolution in Northern Ireland with the UK government. Now
agreement has been reached to move to 'strand two' when the Dublin
government will enter and discussions will turn to relations between north
and south Ireland.
How significant is it?
Perhaps the most momentous development is the broadening of discussion on
Northern Ireland's future. No unionist has negotiated with the Irish
Republic since the 1973 Sunningdale conference.
This time the talks with Dublin will include the Rev Ian Paisley, hardline
leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, making it the first negotiations in
which all shades of unionist opinion have been represented since partition
in the early 1920s.
However, it is still only an agreement to talk, and there is less than a
month before talks are supposed to end. If Unionists had fears about
starting 'strand two' they may have been encouraged by knowing that time
will almost certainly run out. With Northern Ireland's 'troubles' descending
from centuries of conflict, few expect a lasting settlement to emerge in
days.
Why are there three 'strands'?
To reconcile unionists' and nationalists' mutual distrust. The Ulster
Unionist party and the DUP believe the government of Northern Ireland is of
no concern to a 'foreign' government such as that in the Irish Republic. But
they recognise a need for good relations with neighbours. The nationalist
Social Democratic and Labour Party argues Northern addressing the 'totality
of relationships' within the British Isles.
Last year Mr Peter Brooke, then Northern Ireland secretary, agreed with
unionists, nationalists and the Irish government that discussions in the
three 'strands' would be phased. Nothing would be formally agreed until
everything was agreed but 'strand two' would start 'within weeks'. Mr Brooke
failed to get beyond 'strand one' but paved the way for talks to restart in
April this year before being replaced by Sir Patrick Mayhew.
This time, amid continuing unionist suspicion, it took informal meetings in
strand two and three 'formation' over the past two weeks before a formal
start to strand two could be agreed.
Strand three, between the UK and Irish governments and on relations between
the two countries, is also about to start. This is regarded as particularly
significant by unionists because the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement - which they
oppose because of the role it gives Dublin - and the republic's
constitutional claim on the province are now on the negotiating table.
Is the talks process likely to make much more progress?
Sir Patrick admited on Tuesway further to go'. But developments so far have
already surprised some commentators who argued that unionist and
nationalists could never work together. Talks could be re-started later this
year.
Are the unionists and nationalists moving towards each other?
Hardly. The process is more about finding political structures to reconcile
their conflicting aspirations. Mr Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, unionist
leaders, would not be able to sell to their supporters any deal which gave
nationalist undue influence. Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, will not allow a
return to the old unionist hegemony of Ulster. How much agreement on issues
been reached so far?
It is hard to tell. An agreement not to disclose the content of discussions
is holding apart from some selective briefing. There looks to be some
agreement between the two unionist parties and the non-sectarian Alliance
party on a devolved structure with a controlling 'panel'.
But the SDLP's proposals for six commissioners including three appointed by
London, Dublin and the European Community is unacceptable to unionists.
How big are the differences between the UK and Irish governments?
Unlike the worst years of the 1980s there is little 'megaphone diplomacy'
but there are still considerable tensions that should not be underestimated.
Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign minister, has raised the stakes by saying
that, if his country's constitution is to be discussed, so too should the
1920s UK legislation which led to partition. Sir Patrick has played a
'neutral facilitator' role and has never made speeches on his vision of
Northern Ireland. But he is seen as a friend of the Union.
Why has the talks process been time-limited?
Unionists refused to talk while the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement was in
operation - including the regular inter-government conferences. The Irish
government refused to abandon it but agreed to a suspension of its workings.
After a conference meeting in April a 'gap' was agreed until the end of this
month. The Irish government has indicated, however, that it will be flexible
 -possibly allowing an extension if talks are making progress.
Why has Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, been excluded?
The UK and Irish governments refuse to talk to Sinn Fein until it renounces
the use of violence. Unionist leaders would walk out if allies of the IRA
joined negotiations.
Will the terrorist killings stop?
No - at least not in the foreseeable future. The IRA wants British troops
and politicians out of Northern Ireland. But if a lasting political
settlement is found the terrorists' strongest argument - that politics has
failed in Northern Ireland - will have been undermined. As long as the IRA
exists, loyalist terrorists will arm themselves.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major backs school inspection
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yester-day defended the government's reform of the schools
inspection system, arguing that the use of lay people would be better for
producing independent reports reflecting what parents wanted to know.
Pressed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, during prime minister's
questions, Mr Major said the government believed independent inspection by
'people not related to the education profession' was 'a better way of
ensuring we get reports that are fully independent.'
Mr Kinnock, in one of his last appearances as opposition leader, asked
whether Mr Major would be satisfied if his children's schools were to be
inspected by 'anyone who had nothing more than a few days' training'. He
asked when the prime minister would acknowledge that the 'privatisation' of
the inspectorate had 'absolutely nothing to do' with solving deep-seated
education problems.
The two also clashed over class sizes, with Mr Major stating there had been
a reduction, while Mr Kinnock claimed the number of primary schoolchildren
in classes of more than 30 was more than 1m and rising.

MR Shaun Woodward, the Conservative party's director of communications, said
yesterday that he was to stand down. He said he had 'received offers' from
City firms and academic institutions but wanted to consider his options
before making a decision.
During the general election campaign he faced criticism over the Tory
effort, but yesterday won praise from Mr John Major and Sir Norman Fowler,
Tory party chairman.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DENNIS Skinner, the outspoken Labour backbencher, was ejected from the
Commons yesterday for the eighth time in 13 years. This followed his refusal
to withdraw remarks addressed to Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister.
It was the first time Ms Betty Boothroyd had used her powers to ask an MP to
leave the Commons since she became Speaker earlier this year. The row came
as the Bolsover MP called for a public inquiry into the level of dioxins on
agricultural land in his constituency.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley pledge over pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES to the pension age would not affect anyone expecting to retire in
the next few years, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, emphasised
yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
With the consultation period on the equalisation of the state pension age
just ended, Mr Lilley said that no decisions had yet been taken, and that
all the 3,000-plus responses would be fully considered.
The expectation has been that a flexible decade of retirement has in effect
been ruled out, and that the costs of lowering the retirement age for men to
60 would be too great, leaving the raising of the retirement age for women
as the most likely option.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gordon Brown and Tony Blair to run
for Labour's national executive committee
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN and Mr Tony Blair, the twin dauphins of the Labour party,
are to run for the national executive committee - their first electoral test
in the party's national arena.
With nominations for the national executive elections closing today, their
decision to run - undoubtedly taken jointly - will prove an intriguing
measure of their popularity in the country at large and the mood of
activists in the party.
Meanwhile, Labour's women MPs have fiercely denied a report in the Financial
Times that they have informally discussed taking a common stance on the
forthcoming shadow cabinet elections.
A senior party official said leaders of the recently-formed parliamentary
women's group had deliberately avoided any such debate.
In Labour's parliamentary elections at Westminster yesterday, Mr Derek
Foster, the chief whip, comfortably saw off a challenge from Mr John Evans,
an NEC member and MP for St Helens North, by 158 votes to 90.
The first round in the contest for the chairmanship of the parliamentary
Labour party saw Mr Douglas Hoyle, a veteran leftwinger, top the poll with
85 votes.

FT  03 JUL 92 / More of the same for BR: Little upheaval will result from
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY it is becoming clear why Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail,
has been looking so relaxed recently about the prospect of rail
privatisation.
Sir Bob - who has never been a great privatisation enthusiast - has a
fortnight to wait for the government to publish a white paper setting out
its plans for transferring BR to the private sector. However, he must by now
have a good idea of what the white paper contains: and what he knows is that
BR is to survive remarkably unscathed.
The bare bones of privatisation were set out in the Conservative election
manifesto. BR is to be reorganised into two separate bodies: one owning the
tracks and charging for their use, and the other operating the trains. Once
this has been done, the aim is to get BR's train operations into the private
sector by selling the freight services outright and inviting the private
sector to bid for franchises to operate the passenger services.
Separately, would-be train operators such as Mr Richard Branson, chairman of
the airline Virgin Atlantic, will be allowed to run their own passenger or
freight trains on BR's tracks. An official regulator will resolve arguments
over track charges and access.
In theory, it all sounds quite revolutionary. But in practice, the most
striking feature of the privatisation may be how much is to stay the same.
The choice of routes for the passenger service franchises, for example, may
appear to be a fascinating throwback to the golden age of rail: but in
reality the franchise areas reflect the so-called profit centres into which
BR has been subdivided over the past two years in an extensive management
restructuring.
From BR's point of view, one of the biggest potential dis-advantages of
privatisation was that it could cut across this reorganisation, thus
throwing staff into demoralising turmoil just as they were coming out of it.
Choosing the profit centres as the basis of the franchises will leave BR's
management structure intact.
So much for BR. But what about the passengers? As the manifesto has already
made clear, the whole track infrastructure including signalling is to remain
in BR's ownership. That means that private-sector train operators will
continue to be at BR's mercy when it comes to many of the most common causes
of delays, such as signal or point failures and congestion.
Further, it now emerges that companies wanting to run their own trains on
BR's tracks could find it difficult to get access because BR and its
franchisees will enjoy 'grandfather rights' to all train paths in the
existing timetable. This means that any slots left over for independent
train operators such as Virgin will almost by definition be the least
desirable ones.
The biggest scope for change therefore appears to be offered by the plan to
franchise out BR's passenger services. Ministers say there is plenty of
behind-the-scenes interest in bidding for the rights to run BR's trains.
Ministers hope to encourage these bidders to come forward by placing on them
as few requirements as possible about minimum service levels. The
opportunities for innovation, it is believed, will do the rest. Franchisees
with experience of the bus industry, for example, might hope to make more
money out of suburban lines by running bus feeder services to connect
passengers with commuter trains or shoppers' specials.
But it is also acknowledged that it would be impractical in the vast
majority of cases to expect franchisees to buy their own fleets of trains.
Instead, the franchise for any given service will come complete with the BR
rolling stock necessary to operate it, to be returned to BR when the
franchise ends.
One consequence is that, with BR continuing to own the trains as well as the
tracks - and for that matter, supplying most of the staff - franchisees may
have little scope to introduce significant changes beyond improvements in
station and on-board services. Another consequence is that a state-owned BR
will remain responsible for the vast majority of railway assets for the
foreseeable future - meaning that the government will continue to exercise
its relentless grip on the sums available for investment.
In any event, as ministers acknowledge, the franchising of BR's services
will take many years to complete. This is because the only franchises likely
to attract any interest from the private sector are those for routes which
have already benefited from heavy investment.
Thus, on mainline services it is possible to imagine that someone may be
interested in taking on the east coast franchise because BR has just
finished upgrading the line and buying new trains for it at a cost of Pounds
500m. The worn-out west coast main line, conversely, is likely to attract
little interest because it needs an Pounds 860m upgrade.
Even the modernised lines may not necessarily attract much interest.
Everything will hang on how much franchisees have to pay for access to the
tracks, and this information will not be available until later in the year.
But with ministers making it clear that track charges will not be
subsidised, franchisees may need to be persuaded that there is any money to
be made from running trains - particularly after the heavy losses reported
by BR this week.
What seems increasingly likely is that the main impact of privatisation will
fall on freight services rather than passenger ones. The government remains
committed to moving these into the private sector as quickly as possible -
though, again, its chances will hang on the question of what charges freight
operators are required to pay.

FT  03 JUL 92 / ICI increases offer to 5.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has agreed to raise the pay of 19,000
hourly-paid employees by 5.1 per cent in the latest of a series of
above-average settlements at chemicals companies this year.
Union leaders and members had rejected a previous offer of 4.5 per cent  -
about the average in UK manufacturing. The deal raises the possibility that
employees will receive more than 11 per cent this year.
In a framework deal last year the company and unions agreed that local deals
on changes in working practices would trigger a 36-hour week and payments
equivalent to 14 per cent of salary, starting with 6 per cent on
implementation and a further 4 per cent in each of the following two years.
The 14 per cent would be in addition to any annual pay rises. However, talks
on working practice changes have taken longer than expected.
The company had been hoping local deals would start to come through by the
end of last year, but so far agreements covering fewer than 100 workers have
been negotiated.
Incomes Data Services, the pay research organisation, said ICI's pay deal is
at the higher end of manufacturing settlements, but compares with 6 per cent
at Yorkshire Chemicals and the Wellcome Foundation.
The Chemical Industries Association, which negotiates on behalf of more than
200 companies, settled at 4.3 per cent from April 1.

FT  03 JUL 92 / CBI steps up pressure on Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday renewed its calls for a new
era of co-operation between government and manufacturers on the eve of an
announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, of plans
to make the DTI a more effective champion for industry.
Sir Alistair Frame, chairman of the CBI's national manufacturing council,
said UK manufacturers were unlikely to achieve their targets of winning an
extra 1 per cent of world trade and of boosting manufacturing exports by
Pounds 10bn a year without positive government support.
Speaking after a meeting of the council in Coventry, Sir Alistair said
manufacturers were asking not for government handouts or subsidies but for
the ability to compete on an equal footing with their international
competitors. He said many competitors had the advantage of cheaper
electricity costs, better export support and enhanced investment allowances
for new technology, pollution control and energy-saving equipment.
'Unless the government addresses these problems as a matter of urgency it
seems inevitable that the competitiveness of British exporters will continue
to diminish,' Sir Alistair added.
He called on Mr Heseltine to champion industry by giving leadership in
international trade and by encouraging easy and direct access for industry
to ensure effective consultation with the government.
Mr Heseltine will today unveil plans to improve the effectiveness of the DTI
as industry's sponsoring department. They are expected to include the
creation of at least 12 groups to represent their industries' views in
Whitehall.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Retail pay deals halved in value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE PAY settlements in retailing and distribution have more than halved
in value in the past year and are below the average for the whole economy,
according to a report.
Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group,
found in a survey of 100 pay reviews in the four months to April that the
median was 4.2 per cent against 8.5 per cent for the corresponding period
last year and 4.4 per cent for the whole economy this year.
Thirteen of the 100 organisations had implemented pay freezes or deferrals
of up to 12 months.
However, where general freezes are in operation, it has been common for
low-paid employees to receive an award as companies comply with
wages-council orders.
The report identifies a trend by companies to stretch pay budgets through
profit-related pay.
For example, Robert Dyas, the ironmonger, has a six-month pay pause in
operation to be reviewed at the end of September.
However, the company has also introduced a profit-related pay scheme which
it says will give some 80 per cent of its 570 retail and management
employees net increases in pay of between 5 per cent and 6 per cent - with
no additional costs incurred on the paybill.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Court overturns ruling on ex-MEP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LESLIE HUCKFIELD, the former MEP for Merseyside East accused of fiddling
his parliamentary expenses, can be tried in the English courts, the High
Court ruled yesterday.
The court reversed a ruling by Mr Justice Morland at Manchester Crown Court
last September quashing the charges against Mr Huckfield and two
co-defendants on the ground that the case would infringe the sovereignty of
the European parliament.
Lord Justice Leggatt said member states were entitled to prosecute an MEP
for dishonestly obtaining expenses from the Strasbourg parliament. The issue
involved was dishonesty which was capable of being tried in a national
court.
The court refused to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg for a definitive ruling. Mr Huckfield said he would seek leave to
appeal to the House of Lords.
The High Court's decision will bring it into conflict with the president of
the European parliament, Mr Egon Klepsch.
Mr Klepsch claims that questions relating to MEPs' expenses are a matter for
the 'internal functioning' of the parliament and that any review by the
criminal courts of a member country conducted without the parliament's
consent would 'constitute an interference'.
But the High Court rejected this argument. Lord Justice Leggatt said he had
great difficulty understanding how prosecution by a national authority could
be said to be unwarranted or improper when there was no provision in
community law which exempted an MEP from criminal liability and there was no
way in which the parliament itself could take criminal proceedings against
him.
Mr Huckfield, a former Labour junior industry minister who served as MEP
from 1984 until he was deselected in 1989, was accused on one count of
obtaining by deception a cheque for Pounds 1,522 relating to a pensioners'
conference on Merseyside in 1987 and with obtaining Pounds 1,007 allegedly
relating to poster and advertising costs, by deception in 1986.
The director of public prosecutions' office said it would now consider
whether to launch a new prosecution.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCCUPANCY rates at English hotels were lower in the first four months of
this year than in the same period of any year since 1980, according to a
survey by the English Tourist Board and Horwath Consulting, the leisure
consultants.
They found average monthly occupancy rates were as much as 9 percentage
points below those of the same period last year, when the Gulf war severely
depressed tourism.
The survey found that London occupancy rates improved slightly in April to
62 per cent from 59 per cent a year before. In England as a whole occupancy
was only 45 per cent - 4 percentage points lower than a year before.
Mr Geoff Parkinson, a Horwath director, said the decline in the industry
began in September 1990, four months before the Gulf war, and had been
caused mainly by the recession. Hotels in all price ranges were suffering,
and many were trading at a loss.

THE administrators to Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project in London's

complex were slipping, Vanessa Houlder writes.
In a letter to tenants, Mr Alan Bloom, one of the joint administrators from
Ernst &amp; Young, said there had been no cuts in maintenance staff.
It was inevitable that at any particular time there would be items of
maintenance outstanding. Tenants should inform the administrators if they
considered there had been any shortfalls of performance, he said.
Criticisms about the state of the project have included cracked paving slabs
and operating problems with the fountain and doors.
Mr Bloom said the administrators were in discussion with potential occupiers
for more than 1m sq ft of office space, Potential tenants include government
departments and Tower Hamlets Council, which is looking for space for 1,000
headquarters staff.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Receiverships down again
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of receiverships and administration orders last month was down on
the same time last year for the fifth consecutive month, according to
figures collated by accountants Touche Ross and issued yesterday.
There were 412 appointments in England, Wales and Scotland for June,
compared with 483 in June last year, the statistics from the official London
and Edinburgh Gazettes show.
The number of appointments rose from 358 in May, the fourth consecutive
month in which the figures had fallen and the lowest number for 18 months.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
said that the trend was undoubtedly a sign of increased business confidence,
and showed that the clearing banks were being more supportive of their
customers.
He said if the trend continued he expected business failure rates to fall by
up to 15 per cent for the whole of this year compared with last year.
The total number of appointments for the first six months of this year was
2,718 compared with 2,915 in the corresponding period last year.
Receivership appointments rose slightly last month in London and the
south-east, and for the hotel and catering and wholesale and distribution
sectors.
BRITAIN'S gold and foreign currency reserves fell by an underlying Dollars
14m last month, the Treasury said yesterday. The overall level, which
includes debt repayments under the exchange cover scheme, fell by Dollars
104m to reach Dollars 45.7bn on June 30.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Fall in headhunting underlines recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in headhunting of senior managers in industry, shown up in
figures released yesterday, has added to fears of a stalled recovery.
According to a survey by InterExec, a recruitment consultancy, the number of
top industrial jobs for which headhunters were seeking candidates fell 12
per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period
last year.
The study also indicates that overseas companies are boosting recruitment of
executives based in Britain, taking advantage of the slack jobs market.
The figures apply to jobs at director level with an average salary of Pounds
50,000. Efforts to fill such positions through 'executive search' methods
are considered a good indicator of companies' sales prospects.
Although the year-on-year change may have been distorted by the large
increase in recruitment in the second quarter of last year after the end of
the Gulf war, they will heighten anxiety that the upturn is running out of
steam. In the first quarter, vacancies showed a 14 per cent year-on-year
increase.
The survey is based on information collected from about 1,000 employers and
recruitment agencies. InterExec believes the study covers between a third
and a half of all vacancies being filled by non-advertising techniques.
The survey says that between April and June companies based in Britain were
trying to fill 1,307 vacancies by headhunting compared with 1,480 in the
corresponding period last year. Vacancies in the first half totalled 2,834,
0.7 per cent more than the 2,812 recorded in the first half of last year.
The number of overseas vacancies for which UK-based managers were being
sought climbed 40 per cent to 274 in the second quarter.

start paying for the Pounds 304m Sky/BBC five-year deal with the Premier
League. But it is now clear that Sky plans to start charging for individual
matches in two years' time.
A summary of the potential of pay-per-view football was set out in a report
to the Premier League as part of the successful bid to take top-league
football away from ITV.
In the document Sky looks at the financial impact of charges running from
Pounds 1.50 to Pounds 5 a match.
The net revenues, given expected growth in the number of UK satellite
dishes, range from Pounds 8.9m in 1994 for 30 games at Pounds 1.50 with a
take-up of 10 per cent of subscribers to Pounds 697.4m in the year 2001
given a 30 per cent take-up, 60 games and a Pounds 5-a-match charge.
BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - will
develop pay-per-view as a 50-50 joint venture with the Premier League. The
league will have to agree the number of games and the price structure.
Sky has decided to introduce pay-per-view gradually. As the number of games
covered by individual payments increases, the monthly charge for the Sports
Channel will fall. From August 1 a Pounds 5.99-a-month charge for the
channel will be introduced. BBC Enterprises plans to be involved in as many
as five satellite television channels within three years.
Announcing a fall in pre-tax profits for 1991-92 to Pounds 5.4m from Pounds
6.1m, Mr James Arnold-Baker, chief executive of BBC Enterprises, the BBC's
commercial arm, said talks had begun with a number of potential investors.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Lloyd's professionals welcome reports: Inquiry seen as
vindication of market views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSIONALS in the Lloyd's insurance market yesterday welcomed the
findings of the Walker and Morse inquiries and endorsed their
recommendations for reform.
Many were still digesting the contents of the reports which were released in
the morning after newspaper leaks over the previous two days. Most
concentrated on the report by Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities
and Investment Board, which concluded that there was no evidence of fraud in
the operation of the market. They saw it as a vindication of their own
views.
Those working in the market conceded that the standards of some individuals
and companies had fallen below acceptable levels.
Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman of Merrett Holdings, the underwriter, said: 'It
has been more apparent how much the market is damaged by the actions of a
few.'
Mr Robin Warrender, managing director of London Wall Holdings, an agency
group, said: 'Manifestly some agents' standards of competence have been
woefully inadequate.'
Mr Terry Hayday, chief executive of Sturge Holdings, the managing agency,
said: 'We are pleased there was no evidence of fraud. It's a relief to all
of us. The conclusions drawn are the right ones.'
He supported the recommendations. 'They will be welcome,' he said. 'They can
do little else than improve the professionalism in the market. I fully
expect the pendulum of regulation to swing from a relatively relaxed regime
to a much tighter one.' But he added: 'We have to ensure that the commercial
and entrepreneurial skills of the market are not killed.'
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association, said
the allegations of fraud 'were always a nonsense'. He criticised the
reaction of some groups of Names - individuals whose assets underwrite the
market - which had called the Walker report a whitewash. 'That really is a
joke,' he said. 'Sir David has the utmost integrity.'
Mr Archard said he strongly supported the calls in the report for peer
review and echoed Walker's conclusions that the standards of some
professionals were too low. 'It would be ludicrous after the 1989 results to
say otherwise than that some people fell below the highest standards,' he
said.
Mr David Rowland, who chaired the task force into the governance of Lloyd's
which reported earlier this year, said: 'I make no secret of the fact that
the best (professionals) are very good and the bad ones are bloody awful.
Walker's conclusions come as no surprise.'
Of the Morse report, he said it was 'inconceivable that a sensible man could
think otherwise' than to separate governance of the market from its
management.
At Westminster, where MPs had the opportunity of questioning Sir David in a
45-minute meeting, there was a mixed reaction to the reports.
Mr Richard Page, a member of the Conservative backbench trade and industry
committee, said it was important that all proposals could be implemented
without the need for new legislation which would not have been enacted until
1995. The approval in principle of the Lloyd's Council - the market's ruling
body - was 'a marvellous step forward'.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's voice on City affairs, criticised Sir David for
accepting a brief that did not address the most serious problems, but said
the report's conclusions indicated the failure of the present regulatory
structure.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Walker demands tough action to improve standards: 'Lax'
approaches attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID WALKER, who was described by Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of
Lloyd's, as 'so white that snow-white looks dirty', has delivered his
verdict on the insurance market.
Although Sir David's 68-page report clears Lloyd's of any conspiracy or
fraud, it provides an extensive list of shortcomings and is seriously
critical of the market's professionalism and regulation.
It also calls for far-reaching reforms to usher in greater disclosure, more
pro-active regulation and more professional business practice.
About half the report is devoted to a searching examination of the LMX
spiral reinsurance market - in which Lloyd's syndicates and other companies
reinsured each others' catastrophe losses.
Losses from about a dozen spiral syndicates have left Names facing some of
their heaviest losses, but the committee 'did not in its own investigations
form a view that there was any fraud or conspiracy to disadvantage
particular groups of Names or to advantage others'.
Corporate reinsurers also lost substantial sums from spiral business, says
the report. The development of the LMX market was not improper and was
'wholly explicable in terms of commercial factors and judgments'.
The committee found 'no basis on which LMX spiral business would sensibly be
regarded as other than insurance business' and the report rejects
allegations of 'churning' - some LMX contracts being agreed merely to
generate brokerage commission.
'The committee believe that active underwriters on several of the
loss-making syndicates were heavily influenced by LMX brokers. But, in the
absence of any evidence of impropriety on the part of these brokers, the
committee believes that responsibility rests - and should continue to rest -
with active underwriters.'
However, the report says the level of brokerage commission is 'quite
unrelated to the scale of effort and risk involved'.
The report is highly critical of 'standards of professionalism, care and
diligence on the part of a number of members' and managing agents and active
underwriters' which were 'materially below best practice'.
The approach to fiduciary responsibilities, in the case of several members'
agents, is described as 'lax, with an unattractive appearance of
preferencing of brokers and of members' agents themselves in some cases'.
Equally, the report says, 'we were unimpressed by standards of performance
achieved by some managing agents and believe that what proved to be
seriously flawed underwriting judgments might have been constrained if
active underwriters had been subject to more effective control by their
managing agents.'
The committee found that 'certain aspects of regulatory policies' were 'at
any rate with hindsight, insufficient to identify shortcomings in
performance and concentrations of exposures in a timely way'.
Premium income monitoring - under which Lloyd's places a limit on the amount
of premiums a syndicate can underwrite - was inadequate to constrain the
high-risk exposures underwritten by spiral syndicates, says the report.
Syndicates specialising in catastrophe business became too highly 'geared',
with their potential liabilities far outstripping the size of their capital
base.
The committee found evidence that insiders had obtained better returns than
outside Names. Insiders - Names with jobs with agencies and brokers on the
market - had 'tended overall to fare better than external Names', though not
'in general and in most years, on an immodest scale given (their) inevitably
superior market knowledge'.
Working Names, and in particular directors of Lloyd's brokers, have a
greater share of the capacity of more profitable syndicates than their share
of total Lloyd's capacity, says the report.
New capacity has been allocated similarly, in part reflecting the relative
ease of access of existing Names on a syndicate to new capacity sought by
that syndicate.
In contrast, working Names were proportionately under-represented on the 10
LMX syndicates which have suffered the worst losses.
Overall, directors of members' agencies have enjoyed better returns -
particularly in 1989 - than the external Names represented by their
agencies, although this was not the case for all members' agents.
Sir David recommends 18 reforms. Among the most important proposals are:
Lloyd's should take a pro-active regulatory stance, setting tougher
standards for agencies and underwriters and ensuring that regulatory
breaches are pursued more vigorously. Compliance standards should be more
adequately monitored. In the LMX market in particular, closer regulatory
attention should be paid to syndicates that are regarded in the market as
writing 'soft' business.
Lloyd's should make more use of its powers to register and deregister
agencies. There should be tougher registration requirements for members'
agents, possibly introducing limited-term registration reviewed annually.
Increasing the onus on members' agents to ensure fairness in syndicate
allocation and to promote standards of advice and protection for Names
comparable with those for private investors under the Financial Services
Act.
Mandatory provision for peer group review through managing agents of the
plans, policies and performance of every active underwriter. It says these
proposals 'go with the grain' of existing best practice to be found in the
market. 'The challenge for Lloyd's is to ensure that the standards of the
rest are consistently brought much closer to the standards of the best'.
Improvement in the quality of information held centrally by Lloyd's, with
data published annually on syndicate performance and changes in syndicate
capacity by category of Name 'on the following minimum breakdowns' -
directors of group boards and managing agents; directors of members' agents;
directors of brokers; other active working Names, retired working Names;
relations of Names in all these categories and non-working Names.
Syndicates to publish annually changes in participations by directors of
agencies. Members' agents should not accept offers of new capacity to them
or to any of their Names unless that capacity is to allocated equally among
all their Names. New ways to assess the risk. 'We believe there is room for
Lloyd's to develop techniques in this respect in line with developing
management practice among leading corporate reinsurers.'
Limits on the proportion of high-risk business a Name can write.
Lloyd's should commission a 'volatility analysis and risk assessment aimed
at the development of a set of risk weights for different categories of
business'.
An upper limit on the proportion of the total capacity of individual Names
that might be written in specified high-risk categories.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Morse urges smaller council: Tripartite governing structure
proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMITTEE headed by Sir Jeremy Morse proposes a new tripartite
governance structure for Lloyd's, with the ruling council cut from 28 to 14,
a 14-member regulatory board and a 16-member market board handling business
decisions.
To maintain its pre-eminence in the insurance world and grow in size and
strength, Lloyd's needs to handle more businesses centrally, says the Morse
report.
It says there is insufficient focus on one forum and too little sense of
ownership by the market practitioners of the executive bodies acting on
their behalf.
The report says the council needs revised terms of reference which
explicitly require it to safeguard the interests of Names and policyholders.
The terms of reference would cover only functions it cannot delegate, such
as legislation, discipline and special meetings of members - along with some
overall budget responsibility.
The reshaped council should have six working members, four nominated members
and four external members and should meet less often than at present, says
Morse. External members of the council should be paid about Pounds 15,000 a
year.
All business issues should be debated and decided by a Lloyd's market board
which would take business decisions and absorb the role of the Business
Issues Committee. Morse also says that:
Board members should be elected by the market.
The board would lead the market, decide on central business strategy issues,
decide on major investments in new trading methods, set standards and
maintain the capital base.
The board would have a full-time chief executive officer leading a team of
executives.
Market associations for different sectors would continue, but a single
market association should be set up which would nominate members to the
Lloyd's Board.
The market board should act in consultation with representatives of Lloyd's
brokers.
The report recommends that Lloyd's regulatory council should be distinct
from the bodies serving the business interests of the market.
The market board would be responsible for recovering costs from the market,
but its proposals on central charges on members would go to the regulatory
council for final decision.
The report says the full restructuring of Lloyd's could take several years,
but a transitional structure is recommended as a matter of urgency.
The present post of chief executive should be succeeded by two posts, the
chief executive office of the Lloyd's market board and a head of regulation
for the regulatory council.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Few bets placed on a new Nigerian political order: This
weekend's elections, says Julian Ozanne, are the biggest test yet for
promised return to civilian rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA goes to the polls tomorrow, marking thecritical penultimate step in
a precarious return to civilian rule for black Africa's most populous
country.
Nationwide elections for the 91-member Senate and 589-seat House of
Representatives will be the greatest test so far for the transitional
programme to democracy put in train seven years ago when General Ibrahim
Babangida seized power in a military coup. The process is designed to end in
a formal hand-over to a civilian president in January and the inauguration
of the so-called Third Republic.
However, hopes that the programme would usher in a new political order free
from the corruption and ethnic and religious tensions which have plagued
Nigeria's post-colonial history have disintegrated. Most Nigerians feel
remote from the artificial two-party system imposed on the country by army
decree and from elections which have been overshadowed by some of Nigeria's
most violent religious and anti-poverty riots. The subsequent heavy-handed
arrest of five popular pro-democracy activists, released on bail on Monday
after 42 days' detention, has further sidelined Saturday's elections.
To make matters worse, the National Electoral Committee announced only a
week ago that 32 candidates were disqualified and that the two parties, the
Social Democratic Party and the National Republican Convention, had four
days to present new names. No reasons were given.
The growing body of vocal pro-democracy critics seized on the
disqualifications as yet another in a list of fundamental flaws, which, they
say, include the government's decision four months ago to wipe 20m names off
the voters' register, the imposition of the two-party system, the absence of
ideological differences in the party manifestos drawn up by government
officials, and the use of draconian detention powers.
'We want the right to form our own political parties and vote for the
policies and leaders we like,' said Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, one of the
released activists. 'We don't want to be told what to do by generals. We
want the right to have the kind of democratic freedoms you have in Britain.'
Dr Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Campaign for Democracy, wants the programme
suspended and is trying to mobilise support for establishment of a sovereign
national conference of all political groups to decide the country's
political system and constitutional future.
However, unless the democracy movement can organise mass action, Gen
Babangida will not meet their demands. Many Nigerians also believe that
calls for a national conference, or any disruption of the established
process, could give Gen Babangida and his military clique the opportunity to
extend their rule again.
We know the 'programme is a complete sham and is thoroughly undemocratic,'
said one senatorial aspirant. 'But as long as Babangida continues to head
towards the 1993 hand-over, then we're prepared to play ball, no matter the
costs. We've got to make sure he can get out if he really wants to. Many
soldiers want their turn at power and money and are just looking for an
excuse.' The pro-democracy movement argues that, unless the proposed
transition is changed, any regime which takes over will lack a democratic
base and popular support, inevitably implode and lead to another coup. They
say that, with the return of many former political heavyweights from the
discredited previous civilian regime and the re-emergence of bitter
political squabbling and 'money politics', the prospects for a credible
political system are slim.
Some even suggest that Gen Babangida has designed and manipulated the
programme to ensure that a Third Republic would start life with a poisoned
pill.
Even those who believe Gen Babangida will honour his promise to step down in
January are looking not to tomorrow's elections but to the 1996 polls as the
first opportunity to build a democratic system.
Questions are also being raised about the kind of economic situation a
civilian regime would inherit. A standby agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) is now almost impossible before year's end, given Gen
Babangida's repeated rejection of an increase in the domestic price of
petroleum and the government's apparent unwillingness to rein in rampant
spending. Failure to come to terms with the IMF rules out the possibility of
a Paris Club rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 31bn (Pounds 16.7bn) external
debt and will probably mean the accumulation of arrears on this year's
Dollars 5.4bn debt-service payments. Any incoming administration will
immediately be faced with severe internal and external indebtedness.
'Babangida's grand dream to retire gracefully to his home in Niger State and
leave behind a new political culture and a sound economy is now a ridiculous
fantasy,' said a western diplomat. 'He's messed it up, probably not
deliberately, through incompetence and the greed of his army cohorts.'
It is with great uncertainty, therefore, that Nigerians will cast their
votes - an uncertainty compounded by the silence on how the 19-man Armed
Forces Ruling Council, Gen Babangida's legislative body, will function
alongside the National Assembly until next January. Nobody seems to be
betting on how the next six months will unfold, probably not even the
nation's military rulers.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Algeria attempts to fill leadership void
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S military-backed rulers yesterday named Mr Ali Kafi - a prominent
veteran of the war of independence against France - as the new head of
state, replacing the assassinated Mr Mohamed Boudiaf.
They also said a six-man team today would start work to uncover the
'authors, instigators and masterminds' of Mr Boudiaf's murder. The
investigators must produce their first findings within 20 days and these
will be made public.
The 64-year-old Mr Kafi, who was already on the five-member High State
Council, now becomes its president.
This body, Algeria's collegiate presidency, includes General Khaled Nezzar,
the influential defence minister.
The council appointed a new member to fill the vacancy left by Mr Boudiaf's
death: Mr Redha Malek, a signatory of the Evian Agreement by which France
granted independence to Algeria 30 years ago.
The two appointments are a sign of continuity and so are likely to be
welcomed in western and Arab capitals.
Mr Malek's appointment is as important as the promotion of Mr Kafi because
he is widely respected for the skill and determination he showed in
Algeria's successful efforts to release US diplomats held hostage in Tehran
in 1981. He has had a distinguished career as ambassador to Paris, Belgrade,
Washington and Moscow.
With these moves, Algeria's military chiefs have acted swiftly to fill the
void left by the shooting of Mr Boudiaf as he delivered a speech in the town
of Annaba on Monday.
In less than six months since being recalled from 28 years' exile, Mr
Boudiaf did more than many previous leaders to confront the country's ills.
Economically, Algeria's crisis could not have come at a more sensitive
moment as it is seeking fresh backing from international lenders and oil
companies.
Politically, Mr Boudiaf had just begun to tackle corruption, to liberalise
the rigidly state-run economy, and to establish a dialogue with younger
people who make up the bulk of the population and provide most of the
popular support for the now banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).
The speed with which he moved might have contributed to his assassination.
Mr Boudiaf upset powerful interest groups that had much to lose from his
policies.
Despite assumptions abroad that his death was the work of Islamic
extremists, it is hard to find ordinary Algerians who blame the FIS, despite
the fact that one of the two killers, now under arrest, was said to have
cited religious motives.
Many people instead point the finger at a mafia of politicians who lined
their pockets during the previous quarter of a century of single-party rule
under the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN).
Mr Boudiaf's death places even greater responsibility on Gen Nezzar, the
most powerful member of the collegiate presidency. The army is now the only
source of authority which has avoided becoming enmeshed in the country's
religious, regional and tribal conflicts.
Gen Nezzar is said not to relish the role of national policeman and has
tried to ensure stability without dominating the government.
That is why he and his colleagues recalled Mr Boudiaf after cancelling last
December's election - Algeria's first multi-party poll - and ousting the
discredited President Chadli Bendjedid. The FIS was set to win the election
and the military wanted a respected civilian to avert fundamentalist rule.
The need to fill the power vacuum is especially urgent because Algeria is
delicately poised to reform an economy burdened by debt charges equivalent
to 75 per cent of foreign revenues. It is in the middle of negotiations for
a third standby loan from the International Monetary Fund crucial to
confidence of foreign commercial and state lenders.
The uncertainty also casts a shadow over promising negotiations with
international oil companies for production and exploration. Further violence
could jeopardise this important source of cash.
The new head of state derives his legitimacy for the post as a respected
figure in the struggle for independence. His later position as
secretary-general of the war veterans' organisation gave him wide influence.
In his first televised address to the nation last night he promised to
follow Mr Boudiaf's path 'whatever the price and sacrifice.'

FT  03 JUL 92 / S African workers ponder role as shock troops: Philip Gawith
looks at the strengthsof the unions asthey defy thePretoria government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROAR of approval swept through the crowd as the slim figure on the
platform denounced President F W de Klerk and pledged an unprecedented
campaign of 'mass action' to bring about majority rule.
If the enthusiastic response in Boipatong on Monday to Mr Jay Naidoo,
general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu),
was anything to go by, Mr de Klerk's days may be numbered. But there are
several reasons for believing that South Africa's white government will be a
tougher nut to crack than Mr Naidoo and his audience at the funeral for
victims of Boipatong's massacre last month may believe.
As an alliance partner of the African National Congress and South African
Communist Party, Cosatu is lending its enthusiastic support to their mass
action campaign aimed at speeding the transition to democracy.
Indeed, with its 1.3m membership spread across 17 affiliates - mining,
metalworkers, food and clothing and textiles are the largest - Cosatu is
pivotal in the plan to bolster the alliance's position at the negotiating
table through people-power on the street. The high point of this campaign
will be a Cosatu-led general strike, as yet of unspecified duration, set for
August 3.
The extent to which unionised workers are ready to be used as political
shock-troops, however, is unclear. Few doubt Cosatu's ability to organise a
short-term mass stayaway. In July 1990 and again in November last year, more
than 3m workers heeded such a call. But many doubt whether an extended
national strike is possible. Mr Brian Allen, a director at Andrew Levy and
Associates, a labour research group, says he is 'doubtful there will be a
genuine national strike' which would last more than 'a day or two'.
The youth and the unemployed among the crowd who cheered Mr Naidoo so
enthusiastically can be expected to lend their support to protest
activities. For unionised workers and their leadership, however, the
equation is more complicated. With an estimated 40 per cent unemployment
rate in South Africa, unions now represent an elite constituency, only too
aware of the perils of joblessness. Many have already been involved in
strikes this year and will be wary of politically motivated action which
almost certainly lays them open to dismissal.
Attitudes among employers to political strikes have hardened. This is partly
because of violence which often accompanies such events - about 100 people
died in violence following November's stayaway in protest at the taxing of
staple foods with the introduction of VAT - and partly the weak state of the
economy. The Reserve Bank noted in its quarterly bulletin last week that
gross domestic product decreased at an annualised rate of nearly 2 per cent
in the first quarter.
Mr Bokkie Botha, human resources director at the chemical group AECI, says:
'It is absolutely clear that some employers will be forced to dismiss
workers if their businesses fold. There simply isn't the sort of slack we
had in the past.'
The level of industrial action is already high. Figures from Andrew Levy
show that 650,000 working days were lost in the first half of the year
compared to 375,000 in the same period in 1991. Ongoing strikes at the South
African Broadcasting Corporation, in the state health service and at Toyota,
the local assembler of Japanese cars, remain unresolved. The National Union
of Metalworkers, is also balloting for strike action.
There is quiet optimism in the mining industry, however, that wage
negotiations will be settled without resort to strike action.

<TEXT>
THE US must maintain armed forces in the Pacific as a 'stabilising factor'
for the peace and prosperity of the region, Japanese prime minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said on his first state visit to Washington.
In a speech yesterday, Mr Miyazawa sought to shift the spotlight from
contentious trade issues to US-Japanese economic and political partnership
in the region.
He said the most pressing regional concern was a reduction of tension on the
Korean peninsula, where a North-South dialogue for reconciliation must be
supported by China and Russia as well.
Mr Miyazawa hoped to settle his differences with Russia over Japan's former
Northern islands with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
'I can easily imagine how the Russian people, who have long been taught that
these islands are Soviet territory, may face a strong psychological block in
coming to terms with the return of these islands to Japan,' he said.
'However, for our two countries to act as if the problem did not exist would
only complicate the matter further.'

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Daley, mayor of Chicago, has declared the project to build a
third big airport in the city 'dead'.
The Illinois Senate defeated legislation to allow work on the Dollars 10.8bn
(Pounds 5.8bn) airport proposal, for which Mr Daley has fought for nearly
three years. It was to have been the largest public works project in the US,
creating 200,000 jobs.
Many believe, however, that Mr Daley, who often expresses his frustration in
public, is likely to take the project up again in the legislature's autumn
session. Mr Jim Edgar, Republican state governor, favours the airport and
hopes Mr Daley, a staunch Democrat, will not give up.
In a reference to the powerful political machine once run by Mr Daley's
father, who as mayor from 1955 to 1976 was the last of America's big city
political bosses, Mr Edgar said: 'You just don't make a phone call any more
and have these things happen.'
Mr Edgar was unwilling to spend all his political capital rallying his
party's senators behind the airport.

Davy McKee, part of the engineering division of Trafalgar House, and Fluor
Daniel of the US have been awarded a contract for the engineering and
construction management of a new Dollars 600m (Pounds 324.3m) copper smelter
in Utah, writes Andrew Baxter. The client is Kennecott, owned by RTZ of the

PRESIDENT George Bush will meet Mexico's Carlos Salinas in San Diego,
California, on July 14, as the two countries - along with Canada - head into
the final stage of negotiations on a North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta).
But Mr Bush yesterday dismissed speculation that a Nafta deal would be
concluded during Mr Salinas' quick visit. 'It is not a scheduled event,' Mr
Bush said.
Mr Salinas said in an interview that 'in the next weeks (the treaty) should
finish and be initialled'.
According to US law, the treaty can only be signed by Mr Bush 90 days after
he has notified Congress of this intention. Mr Salinas said that at the
moment the plan was to sign the treaty and present the agreement to the US
Congress before the November elections.
But the Mexican government has consistently underestimated the time it would
take to complete negotiations.
Rumours persist that the free trade agreement will not be initialled until
October.

THE US does not expect next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Munich
to finalise a new Uruguay Round trade agreement under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
A senior US Treasury official said yesterday there had been 'substantive
changes' in the agricultural policies of both the US and the European
Community, and he held out the hope of a settlement in the months ahead. 'We
will bang on with this, and it will get done,' he emphasised.
But he warned against 'a political papering over' at Munich of the real
differences between the two sides. It would also be 'not realistic' for the
US to enter into an agreement that could not be sold to the US Congress. He
noted that the EC had not yet served the US with its final proposals. He
conceded there was 'a perceptional problem' in the continued inability of
the US and the EC to break the Gatt logjam. But he insisted summits were not
the right forum to settle highly technical problems.
Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: The German government is determined that the
summit should not become a negotiating forum over fine details of the
Uruguay Round. But officials are still convinced a deal can and will be done
to resolve the US-EC agricultural trade conflict.
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary at the finance ministry, said yesterday: 'I
am confident that the Gatt theme will be concluded. Whether it is at Munich,
before Munich or after Munich, I don't know.'

<TEXT>
HOPES are fading of reaching agreement at next week's G7 world economic
summit on a special Dollars 700m emergency aid fund to make safe 57
Soviet-built nuclear reactors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Instead the seven industrialised nations are expected to decide on pressing
ahead with bilateral programmes co-ordinated through the Group of 24 in the
OECD, with a commitment to set up a joint programme only if all aspects of
nuclear safety cannot be covered by bilateral contracts.
The bilateral action will be co-ordinated on the basis of the single action
programme drawn up by a G7 working group. This should go some way to meeting
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's desire for 'concrete action' to tackle what is seen
in Germany as the single greatest threat to humanity from the collapse of
the Soviet empire.
A G7 working group had recommended Dollars 700m to close, overhaul or
re-equip a total of 57 Soviet-built nuclear reactors in operation, and a
further 23 under construction.
The most urgent action is required at 15 Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors, and
10 VVER 440/230 reactors, all of which 'should be shut down as soon as
possible,' according to the recommendation to the G7 leaders.
Upgrading should be feasible at 32 more modern pressurised water reactors.
The fund foundered on strong US and Japanese resistance to a joint exercise,
and doubts in Washington about allowing the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development to co-ordinate it.
A senior US official said Washington 'wants to get this going bilaterally,
because it will get money flowing. It would take a year if it were done in a
bureaucratic way.' Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary at the German finance
ministry, yesterday outlined the 'phased programme' of support for Russian
economic reform to be offered to President Boris Yeltsin at the G7 summit.
In the first phase, the club of western creditors would agree on debt
rescheduling, and the IMF would advance a first Dollars 1bn credit tranche,
in exchange for 'an agreement or a declaration of intent' from the Russian
government on precisely how it intended to reduce its budget deficit and
bring inflation under control.
The second phase would involve the full IMF standby programme, which would
inevitably take longer to negotiate. Only once that was in place would the
west make available the promised Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund as a
third phase.
Soviet nuclear plants, page 16
The Russian authorities have finally decided to stick to their initial plan
of letting market forces determine a unified exchange rate for the rouble,
writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
The change of heart - which follows last-minute arguments within the
government and with the International Monetary Fund - strengthens the
government's campaign to reaffirm its commitment to market reforms ahead of
President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with G7 leaders next week. It also clears
the way for an agreement with an IMF team, currently in Moscow, for a
Dollars 1bn loan, for which a unified exchange rate was a condition.

LORD Carrington, chairman of the European Community's sponsored peace
conference on Yugoslavia will today travel to the besieged Bosnian capital
of Sarajevo where he will hold talks with representatives of the republic's
three ethnic communities. Moslem, Serb and Croat leaders had agreed to a
meeting to discuss the possible resumption of peace talks, he said.
Officials said Lord Carrington would meet separately President Alija
Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serb irregulars who
have besieged Sarajevo for the past 88 days, and unnamed Croat
representatives.
Sporadic fighting was reported in the capital yesterday as the first of
1,000 Canadian peacekeeping troops arrived to secure the airport.
The Pentagon announced that US military cargo aircraft would begin
humanitarian flights from Germany to Bosnia today, joining an international
relief effort for the besieged capital.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, said some 1,500
French, Egyptian and Ukrainian troops would be sent to secure Sarajevo
airport and take part in other peacekeeping activities in the Bosnian
capital. Mr Boutros Ghali, speaking after a meeting in London with Lord
Carrington, said the troops would eventually replace the Canadian forces,
which would return to Croatia where they are part of the UN's peacekeeping
force.
In Vienna, Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, called for more UN
troops to reinforce peacekeeping efforts in former Yugoslavia and for
increased humanitarian aid to the besieged Bosnian capital.
The European Commission promised a further Ecu120m (Pounds 85m) in aid to
help refugees in the Yugoslav civil war, and said that by the end of this
month it would have stockpiled nearly 6,000 tonnes of food in Zagreb for
eventual transport to Sarajevo.
Meanwhile, an American businessman born in Belgrade yesterday confirmed that
he would return to Yugoslavia to become prime minister. Mr Milan Panic, the
chairman of the ICN pharmaceutical company in the US, said in Washington
yesterday that 'his first goal was to stop the fighting in his homeland and
work for lasting peace'.
In Belgrade last night tens of thousands of people gathered in front of the
state-controlled television centre to demand the resignation of Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, the Serbian president, in the fifth day of anti-government
protests. Twelve Serbian Orthodox nuns headed a column of some 80,000
protesters who marched through the city centre to the television building,
which was protected by a police cordon three deep.
Some 1,000 policemen in full-combat uniform stood in the neighbouring park,
backed up by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons. Meanwhile
the nearby federal parliament building, the site of the five-day protest,
was scarcely guarded. This signalled the extent that Mr Milosevic depends on
control over television to win popular support. Chanting 'Resignation', the
crowd jeered at Belgrade television, demanding the 'fall of the Bastille'.

FT  03 JUL 92 / French lorry blockade worsens

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday stepped up its efforts to end the lorry
drivers' dispute as many main roads remained blocked, causing shortages of
food, fuel and medical supplies across the country.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, warned the truckers, who are protesting
against new rules to curb dangerous driving, that their licences would be
suspended unless the road blocks were removed.
Peugeot, the car company, blamed the dispute for its decision temporarily to
lay off 12,000 workers at a factory in Sochaux-Montbeliard, because of a
parts shortage.
In Britain, Peugeot Talbot, its UK subsidiary, said it had been forced to
cancel a day's production at its two assembly plants near Coventry because
of serious disruption in the supply of parts from France.
Some 2,000 workers on last night's and today's shifts were told to stay at
home on full pay. The company said production was expected to resume on
Monday.
In France, petrol rationing started at some filling stations in Paris,
Toulouse, Saint-Etienne and Lyons. Hundreds of tourists were trapped at
Channel ports and the borders with Spain, Italy, and Germany.
Seven police and one protester were injured when police charged a
demonstration by truckers and other workers at Cherbourg.
The government is today launching a special committee of inquiry into the
new rules, whereby French motorists are awarded six points on their licences
and lose points if they commit driving offences. Any driver losing all six
points automatically forfeits his licence. The truckers say they should be
allocated extra points because, as professional drivers, they spend longer
on the road.
Mr Beregovoy said the lorry drivers could make their case to the committee,
providing the protest stopped. 'We cannot negotiate while millions of
tourists and millions of French people are being held hostage,' he said.
However, the government yesterday made a concession by saying that the
information on speed and driving time contained in the 'black boxes'
installed in their cabs would not be used as evidence for driving offences.
The authorities had limited success in persuading the lorry drivers to
remove road blocks. A barricade of 800 lorries on the A6 motorway south of
Paris dispersed during the morning, and roads in Brittany were clear by
lunchtime.
But the truckers stepped up the dispute in other areas by concentrating on
specific targets such as petrol depots. Two of the biggest depots in the
Paris region, at Val d'Oise and Gennevilliers, were sealed off by lorries.
Britain's Freight Transport Association described it as the 'worst blockade
ever experienced', and said it was 'concerned that drivers are being lured
into blockades by the action of motorway toll attendants, or through lack of
adequate information in English'.
'There are reports of French nationals tampering with vehicles, turning off
refrigeration motors,' said Mr John Hix, of the FTA's international
department. 'My advice to drivers who are stuck is to keep calm.'
British holidaymakers were yesterday still being advised to keep away from
French motorways, but Europ Assistance, the emergency recovery organisation,
warned drivers to check their holiday insurance before cancelling a holiday
outright. Around 50 per cent of insurance companies would not pay out for
holidays cancelled only because of the threat of delays, it said.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Tokyo looks for closer relationship with a stronger Europe:
On the eve of tomorrow's Japan-EC summit in London, Mr Tomohiko Kobayashi,
the Japanese ambassador to the EC, gives his personal view of relations
between the two
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Mr TOMOHIKO KOBAYASHI

<TEXT>
JAPAN and the European Community are both searching for a world role, and in
this quest there is much they can do jointly to help each other.
This is the broad background to tomorrow's summit in London between Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, Prime Minister John Major, the new president of
the European Council, and President Jacques Delors of the European
Commission.
The EC is, in timely fashion, heading towards its 'single market', and with
the Maastricht treaty, towards a real economic and monetary union, as well
as the embryo of a political union enabling possible common foreign and
security policies.
The road to this goal may be arduous and full of ups and downs, as Denmark's
recent rejection of Maastricht clearly showed. But the EC has no choice but
eventually to succeed in its titanic enterprise.
We Japanese are confident that, in spite of the strong reservations and
sensitivities on the part of many Europeans about abandoning their
respective national sovereignties, most of Europe's political, economic and
intellectual leaders know this road is the realistic way of coping with
serious challenges in the world of today and tomorrow.
They surely know that, only with the unification of Europe, can they be
responsible leaders in managing world affairs and contributing to the
stability and prosperity of others as well as their own.
This explains why so many European countries (even, most recently,
Switzerland) have applied to join the Community.
Japan, too, is in search of a new role to play in this rapidly changing and
highly unstable world. In the Asia-Pacific region, Japan intends to be a
political stabiliser and stimulator of the regional economy. Worldwide, she
is actively joining with her partners in the Group of Seven (G7) to manage
major economic and political problems. Japan is even giving aid to Russia,
which still continues illegally to occupy part of her territory.
But we know very well that, however economically powerful she may have
become, Japan alone cannot assume heavy leadership responsibilties.
In economic affairs, the world system rests essentially on a triangle
described by the EC, Japan and the US. We definitely need active
co-operation between these three major poles.
But we have to recognise that one side of this triangle - the EC-Japan
relationship - is, or at least used to be, much weaker than the other two.
Fortunately, both the EC and Japan have awakened to the need to change this.
So, they agreed on July 18, 1991 to a joint declaration, inaugurating
formally the new era of 'sound competition and constructive co-operation'
between the EC and Japan.
Since then, we have stepped up our dialogue with the EC in many areas
ranging from nuclear energy, science, technology, telecommunications,
industrial management, to development aid and protection of tropical
forests. Of increasing importance is our 'political dialogue' with the EC,
in regular meetings between foreign ministers and their leaders. Tomorrow's
meeting will be the second of what are now to be regular annual summits.
Indeed, we need to consult each other more, not only on aid to Eastern
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States but also in other areas.
Japan welcomes the EC's growing political role in the world, and wants to
impress on the EC the need to consider the problems of security world-wide,
paying more attention to North East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. The EC
should understand that, while communist totalitarian regimes have
disappeared in Europe, remnants of Stalinism are still strongly present in
Asia, as evidenced by continued Russian occupation of our northern
territories.
We wish to see the EC more involved in our region, and as a first step we
welcome the EC's involvement in our efforts to arrange international help
for Mongolia and Cambodia.
Noticeable progress has been made in promoting business co-operation between
the Keidanren and Unice, the employers' federations of Japan and Europe, as
well as at a sectoral level in consumer electronics and cars.
Two-way investment is increasing, particularly by EC companies in Japan,
though it is still small (Dollars 3.5bn at end-1990) compared to Japanese
investment in the EC (Dollars 59.7bn by mid-1991). Japanese manufacturers
are doing their best to become welcomed as 'corporate citizens' of Europe,
contributing to employment and technological progress.
But one serious problem remains - the trade imbalance. After marked
improvement in the late 1980s, the EC's trade deficit with Japan began to
increase again, mainly due to Japan's economic slowdown and Germany's
unification boom.
In 1991, the imbalance amounted to around Dollars 30bn, although Japan
imports more per capita (Dollars 260) from the EC than the Community buys
per capita (Dollars 180) from Japan.
In the conclusions recently adopted by the EC Council of Ministers, the
European Community has placed this problem in a balanced global context. Our
headache is that, with the best of intentions and efforts, we cannot find
any quick and short-term remedies to what is largely a structural problem.
The Japanese government is doing its utmost to ease the problem - by taking
fiscal measures to boost domestic demand, by introducing new incentives for
foreign investors and traders in Japan, by enhancing competition policy to
give newcomers easier access to the market. We strongly hope these measures
will bear fruit. In the meantime, we are ready to make every effort not to
hurt, unduly, our European competitors - the 'car arrangement' is just one
example. We want a really 'harmonious symbiosis' with the EC economy. At the
same time, we hope for the disappearance this year of some 49 humiliating
quotas applied by certain EC states specifically against Japanese products.
Our relations with US are of vital importance to us both. But in this
turbulent world, the EC and Japan which share the same value system of
democracy, human rights and market economy need to strengthen ties of active
co-operation with each other.

The mood in Madrid threatens to undermine Britain's efforts to salvage the
Pounds 20bn project, whose future was thrown in doubt on Tuesday when
Germany decided not to go ahead with production preparations next year.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, is said to have expressed
'understanding' of Germany's decision when he met Chancellor Helmut Kohl
privately at the EC summit in Lisbon last month.
Further evidence of Madrid's concerns about the EFA came yesterday in a
statement from the Defence Ministry, which said that while Spain was
contractually obliged to complete the development stage of the aircraft, 'it
supports a reduction in the costs of each aircraft by way of cutting
technical specifications and the total cost of the project.'
The government would need a great deal of persuading to proceed with Italy
and Britain on producing the original aircraft, officials suggest.
Spain may try to mediate between the remaining partners and Germany over a
compromise that cuts costs significantly.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, has proposed a lighter and simpler
version.
The Spanish Defence Ministry said that while it sympathised with industry's
interest in the project, budgetary considerations were paramount.
A sharp clash is now certain with the state-owned aerospace company, Casa,
which has vowed to build EFA with its two remaining EFA partners, even if
this increases Spain's 13 per cent share of the project.
But Madrid, facing economic slowdown, a 55 per cent rise in its budget
deficit for the first five months of 1992, and a 60 per cent rise in its
current account deficit, is urgently reviewing spending plans.
Mr Gonzalez believes Spain has not been involved in the most sophisticated
parts of the EFA, and participation in a cheaper aircraft would not greatly
undermine Spanish companies involved in the project.

FT  03 JUL 92 / MFI price of 115p lower than planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT falls in London share prices have forced MFI Furniture Group, the
kitchen and bedroom furniture retailer, to set a 115p price for its
flotation, far lower than it had originally hoped.
There will also be fewer shares on sale than had been intended.
The price puts a market value of Pounds 669m on the company against earlier
estimates of Pounds 750m or even Pounds 800m. The market value compares with
the Pounds 718m price when the company did a management buy-out in 1987.
Mr Derek Hunt, chairman of MFI, said yesterday: 'We gave ground on the price
for obvious reasons. It was underwritten and that is what matters.'
But he and fellow directors decided against selling any of their own shares.
'I am not selling at that price,' Mr Hunt said. He has 521,000 shares, worth
Pounds 600,000 at the issue price.
Like the share issue for The Telegraph newspaper group earlier this week,
there are initial indications that private investors are showing little
enthusiasm for MFI's offer. Originally up to 10 per cent of the MFI issue
was to be placed with regional stockbrokers, to sell to their clients. But
they found demand for only 1 per cent of the issue.
A quarter of the issue is being sold through a public offer, to meet Stock
Exchange requirements for flotations. The other 74 per cent has been placed
with institutions. The price was fixed around 2am yesterday after a meeting
lasting several hours at County NatWest, the merchant bank sponsoring the
issue.
People who attended the meeting said that the possibility of cancelling the
issue was not considered seriously. Mr David Barclay of County NatWest said:
'Pulling an issue is always an option but it is a nuclear weapon, not to be
used lightly.'
The investors who backed the buy-out are selling fewer shares than planned,
only just realising their original investment. Asda, the supermarket group
which had owned MFI until the buy-out, is selling the whole of its 25 per
cent stake, realising Pounds 73m.
MFI will receive the planned Pounds 545m before expenses, enabling it to
repay much of its Pounds 500m of debt, repay Pounds 183m of preference and
convertible shares and pay an Pounds 11m bonus to management.
The price puts the shares on an historic pro forma price/earnings ratio of
15.3, which compares with a stores sector average of about 18. MFI said it
would have paid a 3.75p dividend in its last financial year if it had been a
public company, giving a yield of 4.4 per cent at the issue price.

FT  03 JUL 92 / De Klerk accuses ANC of sabotaging talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN President F W de Klerk last night accused the African National
Congress of sabotaging the peace process in a nationally broadcast speech
that dashed hopes of an early resolution of the country's political crisis.
Mr de Klerk, delivering the government's response to ANC demands for
resuming the stalled constitutional negotiations, accused the ANC of
'fabricating an artificial crisis'.
The confident tone of Mr de Klerk's speech suggested he may have reached a
turning point in relations with the ANC.
Earlier, he met leaders of other black political parties, including Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party with
whom the government has an informal alliance. This revived speculation that
Mr de Klerk sees the alliance as the basis of a future government.
He said the ANC's reasons for withdrawing last week from negotiations for a
post-apartheid constitution were 'completely unconvincing'.
The ANC's withdrawal, sparked by the massacre last month of 42 people at
Boipatong near Johannesburg, was in protest against government intransigence
in talks and continuing violence.
Mr de Klerk said the ANC wanted to achieve seizure of power through mass
mobilisation. He said the government would not tolerate such efforts and
would 'take all steps necessary for preventing the country from sliding into
anarchy'.
But Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, said later the government had
not at this stage considered imposing a national state of emergency.
Mr de Klerk renewed an offer of talks with the ANC and Inkatha in an effort
to find common ground on ways to end political violence, the issue that led
to the current stalemate.
Mr Roelf Meyer, constitutional affairs minister, said that although certain
ANC demands had already been addressed bilaterally and at the Convention for
a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the constitutional negotiating forum,
these 'can and should be further addressed'.
There was no immediate response from the ANC, but it had rejected an earlier
offer of talks.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Lloyd's pledges reforms after criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday pledged to introduce a number of reforms in the
wake of the publication yesterday of two critical reports on its regulation
and management.
In his report, Sir David Walker, former chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board, the investment watchdog, was fiercely critical of the
professionalism and competence of many of the insurance market's agencies.
Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, proposed a framework to manage
and regulate the troubled market, which would separate regulation from
administration and daily business planning.
The reports were commissioned by Lloyd's earlier this year in an effort to
restore confidence in the market, which has been hit by heavy losses and
mounting criticism over its operations.
The Walker report focuses on the controversial spiral reinsurance system -
in which syndicates and companies trading in London reinsure each other's
exposures to catastrophe risks - and how market insiders have avoided some
of the worst losses.
A number of spiral syndicates have run up heavy losses, accounting for
nearly half the Pounds 2.06bn deficit recorded by Lloyd's in 1989, a result
which was announced in the course of last week.
Although his report cleared Lloyd's of fraud or conspiracy to disadvantage
particular groups of Names, Sir David said his criticisms of professionalism
and competence at the market were intended to be 'very serious'.
It said standards of professionalism, care and diligence of some agents had
fallen below best practice.
Several members' agents had taken a lax approach to their fiduciary
responsibilities. Lloyd's own regulatory policies had also been insufficient
to identify shortcomings in the market.
Sir David suggested the regulatory board, which Lloyd's pledges to create,
must set tougher standards and monitor compliance more vigorously, adding
that standards of disclosure to Names - individuals whose assets provide the
market's capital base - must be improved.
Separately yesterday, Lloyd's won a landmark decision in the High Court in
the Oakeley Vaughan case. Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled Lloyd's had no 'duty of
care' in the case brought by 33 plaintiffs facing losses as members of
syndicates formerly managed by the Oakeley Vaughan agency. The Names blame a
failure of regulation by Lloyd's.
Meanwhile Mr David Coleridge, the market's chairman, ran into a barrage of
criticism at the annual meeting of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the
organisation which represents over 9,000 Names, for suggesting that people
unable to attend the market's extraordinary general meeting on July 27 were
unlikely to be able to vote by postal ballot. Dissident Names have
introduced a vote of no confidence in the market's council.

FT  03 JUL 92 / US discount rate cut after sharp rise in jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve responded swiftly to fresh signs of economic weakness
yesterday by cutting the discount rate by half a percentage point to 3 per
cent, the lowest level since 1963.
The move came shortly after the Commerce Department reported an unexpectedly
sharp rise in the unemployment rate last month - from 7.5 per cent to 7.8
per cent, the highest level since 1984. The rise in the jobless rate could
be a severe political embarrassment for President George Bush, who welcomed
the Fed's move but conceded that the recovery was not as robust as he had
hoped.
The Fed also signalled a half-point cut from 3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent
in the overnight federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each
other. Leading commercial banks reacted by cutting their prime lending rates
from 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent, the lowest level in nearly two decades. The
prime rate influences the cost of a wide range of consumer and business
loans.
Bond prices surged on Wall Street. By early afternoon the 30-year long bond
was up by 1 13/32 points, pushing the yield down to 7.626 per cent. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average, after rising sharply in previous days, retreated
23.81 to 3,330.29, reflecting dismay at the poor employment figures.
The employment news initially pushed the dollar down by 2 pfennigs to a
16-month low of DM1.4995. It later recovered in European trading to close in
London at DM1.5135 before slipping back in New York to DM1.5075.
The Fed move followed intense lobbying by the White House, with both Mr Bush
and Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, making public calls for lower
interest rates.
The timing of the rate cut - just ahead of next week's Group of Seven
economic summit in Munich - was particularly convenient for the Bush
administration, which intends to stress the importance of co-ordinated
measures to stimulate global growth.
The Fed move was part of a 'major commitment on the part of industrial
countries towards growth', a senior US Treasury official said yesterday.
The three biggest G7 nations have now signalled steps which they believe
will promote non-inflationary growth in the world economy in the medium
term.
On Wednesday, the Bonn government announced a tough 1993 budget and
four-year savings plan that is supposed to pave the way for lower German
interest rates.
Although the Bundesbank yesterday left its key interest rates unchanged, the
German economy is due to receive a short-term DM12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) boost
from the discontinuation this week of a special 7.5 per cent income tax
surcharge levied for the past year to help finance the absorption of the new
states of the former East Germany.
In Japan, the ruling Liberal Democratic party has proposed a wide range of
pump-priming measures, including a large-scale supplementary budget that
would probably be introduced in September. LDP officials have suggested the
package could be worth between Y6,000bn and Y10,000bn (Pounds 25bn-Pounds
42bn).
Taken together, these moves represented a 'very substantial change' in the
policymaking climate, the US Treasury official said. World leaders, he
indicated, had begun to recognise that the main challenge was sustaining
growth rather than fighting inflation.
The Fed, however, justified the discount rate cut in purely domestic terms.
It followed 'sustained weakness in credit and money growth, continued
movement toward price stability and the uneven progress of the economic
recovery'.
The seven Fed governors voted unanimously for the cut, the first since
December and the seventh since the recession began nearly two years ago.
The employment numbers were bad enough to draw the sting from charges that
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, bowed to political pressure for lower
interest rates. Financial markets had expected no change in the unemployment
rate and a rise in non-farm employment.
The actual figures were much worse. After months of gradual improvement,
employment fell by 117,000, with sizeable falls in manufacturing,
construction and the service sector. The unemployment rate - politically the
most sensitive number - jumped to 7.8 per cent.
The employment figures followed other poor economic indicators pointing to a
slowdown in growth in recent months. Most forecasters believe the economy is
still growing sluggishly but at a slower pace than the 2.7 per cent annual
rate recorded in the first quarter.

FT  03 JUL 92 / PM scorns Thatcher views on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR dismissed Lady Thatcher's views on Europe last night as those
of 'little England' after she used her maiden speech in the House of Lords
to launch another attack on the Maastricht treaty.
His harsh words came in a speech designed to rally Tory MPs behind the
government on Europe and the economy.
The prime minister admitted that he shared their concerns about the sluggish
pace of economic recovery. But he said the government had secured the
prospect of an 'end to inflation' during the present parliament.
Mr Major, who had earlier faced a direct attack from Lady Thatcher over his
determination to press on with ratification of Maastricht, said he would
keep Britain at the centre of decision-making in the Community. In what was
taken as a sharp rebuff to his predecessor, he said: 'I do not want us to be
little England, impoverished, sour in isolation, bereft of hope, languishing
on the sidelines of Europe, on the sidelines of history.'

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (15): Scarcity of
stock fuels vibrant sector - Real estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP HUDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTMODED technology, dubious management and changing demand means that east
European state enterprises can often be marginal investments at best. By
comparison, a scarcity of hotels, offices, shops and good quality housing
and rising western demand has created a vibrant real estate sector.
Rents are often higher than in western capitals and companies are prepared
to pay for accommodation in hard currency. As a result, property development
is often the subtext of privatisation and the scent of asset stripping hangs
in the air.
As company privatisations grind on, the importance of real estate is
becoming clearer. Like the UK in the 1980s, state companies and local
authorities find themselves short of cash resources at a time when their
most attractive assets are in land.
The result is a scramble to sell, or more often, create joint ventures with
western companies to release the capital tied up in their real estate
assets.
The process has not always been smooth.
Armed with the experience of UK privatisation in the 1980s, UK based
accountants initially swept into the vacuum created by the fall of
communism. It was not long before real estate problems checked their
progress.
In 1990, a celebrated deal was struck for the privatisation of Hungar
Hotels, the Hungarian state hotel chain. On instruction from the then
inexperienced and recently formed State Property Agency (SPA) the chain was
valued by a western consulting company as a going concern.
However, the suggested price led to a furore about alleged asset stripping
by foreigners after Quintus, a Swedish-Dutch company paid the requested
Dollars 90m for a 50 per cent stake in the chain. The courts rescinded the
deal after the public outcry. This and similar early deals involving former
communist managements lead to a tightening up of evaluation and sales
procedures. Hungary now has possibly the most rigorous monitoring policy in
real estate disposal with the SPA vetting all disposals.
Privatisation, once hailed as a universal panacea for the East's economic
ills, is now under more careful scrutiny as the novelty of change wears
thin. It is no longer enough to slap a privatisation label on a transaction.
Concern about exploitation by western property developers and investors has
led to a new emphasis on competition. However, in practice, the new rules
often act act as a deterrent to competition with western developers being
put off by the terms of open competitions where the costs of competing are
not matched by the chance of success.
Arguably the single most successful privatisation policy in the UK was the
sale of council houses to their tenants. The scope for this is enormous in
eastern Europe as virtually every town and city is surrounded by vast
pre-cast concrete estates. The risk of delinquency and social unrest cannot
be overestimated in the period of hardship stemming from the economic
transition.
In the UK, proprietorial pride following sale to tenants is transforming the
estates, sometimes reversing their degeneration into virtual ghettos.
Repeating the process in the East however requires setting up building
societies and other credit systems.
The World Bank has responded to this issue and has taken up a pioneering
position in Poland.
It is contributing Dollars 200m to a mortgage fund expected to total some
Dollars 570m. The Polish government is to match the World Bank sum, Polish
banks are expected to contribute Dollars 100m with a further contribution
expected from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Initially the fund will provide credits for both construction and purchasing
but the emphasis will be on new low-rise buildings at the top end of the
Polish market.
In the face of high inflation the fund is expected to utilise a novel
repayment formula which utilises a repayment ceiling derived from the
difference between wage and price inflation. When the ceiling is reached the
term of loan is extended.
Local authorities and state companies in the UK became increasingly
sophisticated in their dealings with developers during the 1980s and this
would appear to be the pattern for privatisation in the East. Preferential
tax environments, joint ventures, small business encouragement and
development corporations are just a few of the routes ahead.
There is wide scope to make more of inner city sites which include prime
office, hotel and retail locations.
Such sites give local authorities the opportunity to attract the development
skills necessary to access the variety of funding sources needed for urban
renewal. Schemes which integrate commercial elements with provision for
small local business and housing are likely to build a political momentum of
their own in the tough environment which is expected to continue for some
time.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (16): Breaking
free of the rouble zone - Baltics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT the Baltic states privatisation is a key element in overall
economic, financial and monetary policies designed to ensure their full
independence from Moscow which still maintains over 100,000 troops in the
region. All three states wish to break away from the rouble zone and
establish their own currencies. Estonia took the lead by issuing the first
Estonian Kroon last month and both Latvia and Lithuania are planning similar
steps.
All three were tightly integrated into the former Soviet economy and
privatisation, which is partly aimed at attracting foreign investment, is
seen both as a means of reducing the former Russian influence and turning
all the economies of the region in a westerly direction.
With foreign investment in mind the Baltic trio are in the process of
setting up Natiuonal Investment Banks in their respective capitals on the
lines of the Nordic Investment bank. KPMG, are acting as management
consultants for the project which is being financially backed by the EBRD
and the European Communty's Phare fund.
Lithuania, the largest and most populous of the trio, has moved fastest in
the area of housing privatisation with the creation of investment vouchers
for the purchase of apartments and other property. Its Land Reform Act of
July 1991 provides for private ownership of land and compensation for those
expropriated after the Soviet invasion.
Latvia has the largest ethnic Russian population.
As elsewhere in the region many of the plants to be privatised are the
result of all-Union investments, financed largely by Moscow.
Most are managed by ethnic Russians who also make up a large proportion of
their workforce. While work is far advanced on drawing up a large volume of
privatisation-related legislation the reality on the ground is rapid
'spontaneous' privatisation, especially of small shops, agricultural land
and other property, but slow progress in the industrial area.
Estonia with its close linguistic and ethnic links with Finland is also
banking on foreign investment to help both privatise and modernise its
industrial base, especially the highly polluting oil shale industry.
It has been the first to cut its links with the Rouble zone by issuing its
own currency- but like the other states still has the bulk of its savings
and hard currency deposits frozen in Moscow.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (13): Rules and
beyond - Avoiding the legal pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL ARBESS

<TEXT>
BUILDING A legislative framework for inbound investment is one of the most
important tasks facing the post-communist governments of eastern Europe.
Foreign investors demand transparency and need to know not only the rules
for investment but the rules of the process by which their capital is
admitted.
They also need to know which criteria are used by those involved in
reviewing privatisation proposals to differentiate between good and
unacceptable proposals.
These are the necessary basis both for commitments from foreign investors
and the warranties and indemnities given by the selling state authority.
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovkia have made the most progress in all of
these areas, but they all have some way to go.
All three have eliminated the key early legal hurdles to foreign investment,
namely, 'who owns the property?' and 'how do we get our money out?' Their
privatisation laws spell out the nature of state ownership and who is
entitled to sell property on the state's behalf. Profits can be repatriated
thanks to foreign exchange laws that allow for easy convertibilty of
domestic currencies into foreign exchange.
Poland and Hungary have been criticised by some foreign investors for
limiting investment opportunities by adopting a 'top down' approach to
privatisation, in which companies or industrial sectors are hand-picked by
the government for privatisation one at a time. Czechoslovakia, on the other
hand, requires all state enterprises to prepare their own privatisation
projects by June This 'bottom up' innovation has now been borrowed by Russia
and important elements are being considered by the Poles and the Hungarians.
The Czech Ministry of Privatisation has also helped smooth the entry of
foreign capital by developing standardised positions on key legal and
environmental issues. Environmental indemnities are of crucial importance
given the 'production at any price' philosophy of the old regimes.' The fear
of inheriting responsibility for environmental sins of the past has emerged
as a considerable deterrent to inbound foreign investment throughout the
region.
The Czech republic has addressed the problem by creating a tough but clear
legal framework for environmental responsibiltiy. Current policy says the
state will reimburse foreign investors only to the extent of their initial
share purchase price, and then only for the legally mandated cleanup of
conditions which could not have been disclosed prior to signature of the
deal.
The Czechs are also limiting to a bare minimum the warranties which will be
given to prospective investors about the financial and business condition of
the companies they will be buying. These are tough positions, but they are
nevertheless welcomed by foreign investors for their certainty.
Even in Czechoslovakia foreign investors complain about the length and
uncertainty of the project review process. Foreign investment proposals must
be reviewed by at least two ministries and the Czech cabinet, then finally
negotiated with a state fund that becomes the selling shareholder. With
differing mandates and priorities, these stakeholders, and their advisors,
rarely speak with one voice. This results in points understood as 'agreed'
by one government party occasionally having to be re-negotiated to suit
others who become involved later in the review process. Foreign investors,
who are used to 'one-stop shopping' when negotiating corporate
acquuisitions, often find this bewildering and frustrating.
Another complication arises from the absence of transparent guidlines from
the supervising authorities involved in the review of foreign investment
projects. Such guidelines would put all sides on notice as to what
considerations, apart from price, will be given priority. Although
investment bankers to the Ministry of Privatisation have evidently been
applying a set of their own criteria, so far these have not been published
or widely distributed. This means that foreign investors and target company
management generally do not know what the reviewing minstires will be
looking for as they prepare their proposals. It also allows losing bidders
to allege that obtuse or non-commercial factors, like personal preferences
and the nationality of prospective investors, affect the decision-making
process.
With thousands of companies in the privatisation pipeline, Czechoslovak
authorities are now grappling with the next major issue: how to govern,
restructure and encourage foreign investment in the companies slated for
privatisation. Foreign investment, technology and know-how will be essential
for the oversized and inefficient state enterprises struggling to survive
privatisation. But it is an open question whether all this will be allowed
to enter quickly enough.
Initial delays might be caused by the fact that the companies will continue
to be owned by a state fund at least for the next several months until
voucher 'bidding' ends. It is not yet clear whether the boards of these
companies will be allowed to negotiate deals in the interim. If not, it
remains to be seen whether the fund will be an active owner and make timely
decisions.
After voucher privatisation holders to sort out the companies' strategic and
investment strategies. These shareholders will have to overcome their own
inexperience and the virtual absence of Western means of corporate
governance such as proxy voting. Such problems might have been fatal were it
not for the fact that most of the 8.5m voucher books issued to Czech and
Slovak citizens have been deposited with a handful of institutionally
managed investment funds Nevertheless, recent regulations prohibiting funds
from owning a controlling stake in any single company mean that some
shareholders will have to consult and agree before decisions can be taken.
How serious the resulting delays will be remains to be seen. Also unclear is
whether secondary markets will develop quickly enough and will be robust
enough to allow foreign buyers to buy control through the exchange.
The fate of thousands of companies and possibly Mr Klaus' voucher programme
itself hinge on the answers to these questions.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (14): A bitter
cherry - Case history / Caola of Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN western executives go cherry picking in eastern Europe, they look for
state companies like Hungary's Caola cosmetics producer.
However, these east European consumer goods companies, such juicy targets
because of their market share, are also the most perishable, for the same
reason. For their market shares are generally as perishable as they are
large.
Trade liberalisation has brought floods of western consumer goods imports
into eastern markets, and many local companies have found their markets
disappear as consumers defect to the new competitors. Without customers,
such a company's worth to a potential foreign or domestic buyer can
disappear just as fast.
That gives eastern Europe's privatisers - never in a very strong position -
an extra handicap. The authorities and the investment banks acting on their
behalf can find themselves with all the bargaining power of a stall owner
trying to get rid of a load of rotting fruit. Cherries indeed.
Caola illustrates the point. Once the Hungarian monopoly supplier of
personal care products such as toothpaste and a dominant producer of
household chemicals, Caola still held about 80 per cent of the market in
1990.
The company appeared to be the key to a market of 10m people whose demand
for cosmetics had been suppressed during decades of communist emphasis on
productive industry. Caola was a desirable property for the western
multinationals which began to sniff around in 1990. Then disaster struck. At
the start of 1991, Hungary liberalised imports on most consumer goods and
Caola was floored by western competition.
Caola's share of the cosmetics and household chemicals market, has fallen to
about 40 per cent from near-monopoly two years ago. Turnover has fallen in
parallel, the 1992 forecast of Ft4.3bn represents a 50 per cent fall since
1990.
Caola's technical and research expertise impresses western competitors. But
the company, which as a state monopoly had no need to compete in a market,
started with a handicap when it comes to marketing, advertising or
packaging.
While Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate Palmolive and Unilever are among Hungary's
top 10 advertisers, Caola spends so little that its toothpaste adverts do
not even register on surveys of media profiles.
Nor do Caola brands inherit such strength that they can afford such neglect.
Most are better described as names than brands. Not much attachment can be
felt to a brand of washing-machine powder called Bip after the initials of
the factory.
Older Hungarians may remain loyal but Caola is losing a whole new
generation. Colgate meanwhile is catching toothpaste users young with
Colgate bunnies on children's television and educational programmes in
schools.
Mr Tihamer Gedeon, Caola's managing director, recognises that the only hope
is to come under the protective wing of a western company with the
financial, technological and managerial capabilities to revamp the Hungarian
company's tired products.
The cruel twist is that just as Caola's growing weakness makes privatisation
imperative, so it also makes a sale more difficult. Indeed, the Hungarian
company may have missed its best chance.
Colgate-Palmolive bid for Caola last year but then pulled out, saying that
the company's market share was vanishing.
The State Property Agency reportedly held out for Dollars 50m, close to the
asset valuation of Caola, while Colgate was prepared to pay about Dollars
35m, much of that in investment commitments, a figure closer to the
estimated market valuation.
This tension is a classic one in eastern Europe. Market value is necessarily
nebulous because there has been no capital market. Moreover local officials
are still often stuck in a mindset inherited from the communist past, when
physical assets and production were deemed to have value independently of
what anyone was prepared to pay.
It is difficult enough for buyer and seller to hit on a mutually acceptable
price. When perishable consumer goods companies are concerned, they face the
added difficulty that they are trying to hit a target which is moving around
with the falling value of the company.
Government officials say they responded flexibly to Colgate's position. But
they do not seem to have responded so flexibly to Caola's falling worth.
Officials at the State Property Agency even played down the failure to agree
with Colgate saying that they could get a better price by waiting.
Caola is looking for a buyer, drawing up an offer for sale and hoping for
completion by late summer. But industry executives, far from thinking that
Caola is worth more, doubt even that the SPA can attract any bids for the
whole of Caola's business.
The western multinationals have certainly not hung around. They have been
busy further eroding Caola's market share, poaching its best executives and
withdrawing from joint licence agreements. Beiersdorf, the German
manufacturer has taken back distribution of Nivea and other products which
had been licensed by Caola.
Ominously, Caola most dynamic executives are voting with their feet. Mr
Tamas Suto, Caola's go-ahead marketing head, now works Colgate-Palmolive.
Western multinationals have built up local sales and distribution
organisations to the extent that they do not really need Caola.
Ironically, Colgate is considering producing locally to save on import
tariffs. The US company may contract out manufacturing to Caola.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (12): Slow starter
that is struggling to catch up - Bulgaria The preliminary stage of the
privatisation programme involves the transformation of state enterprises
into joint stock companies whose shares can eventually be sold off to the
public
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bulgaria was the last of the former Soviet satellites to throw off communist
rule and the slow pace of political reform is reflected in the equally slow
pace of privatisation. Ironically it is one of those countries which needs
privatisation the most.
It was long the most slavish copier of the Soviet model and its Dollars
12.2bn foreign debt is one of the most onerous per capita burdens in the
region. Geographically it is one of the furtherest away from western
markets, although relatively close and easily connected by sea to the Middle
East.
Leaving the vast bulk of industry and most other assets in the hands of the
former communist nomenklatura for so long provided a vivid example of the
danger of delaying change. In the spring of 1991 the Bulgarian Socialist
(former communist) party government introduced a 'small privatisation law'
which had to be repealed a few months later. It proved to be a conduit for
managers of state enterprises to abuse their positions by widespread
asset-stripping.
As Hungary and other former socialist countries found in the early days of
privatisation the temptation for the managers of state assets to usurp the
privileges of ownership and hive state assets off into private companies
owned by them or their political allies is enormous in the absence of
effective legislation and other safeguards.
Since then the situation has improved substantially. The non-communist
government which emerged after the October elections under Prime Minister
Filip Dimitrov placed a high priority on privatisation. It called in
officals from the European Community's Phare Fund and other western advisers
and also asked privatisation experts from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland
to share their experience.
The net result was a privatisation law which was approved by parliament on
May 8 this year. The law benefited from the experience in privatisation
accumulated elsewhere in the region over the last three years but still
needs further implementary legislation to come fully into effect.
Bankers familiar with the privatisation process say that Bulgaria has moved
fast in recent months to draw up vital complementary legislation in the
foreign investment, company law, competition, banking, insurance and other
fields designed to attract much needed foreign investment. At the same time,
many of the former monolithic state enterprises have been restructured prior
to privatisation.
Progress in all these areas improves the prospects both for an eventual debt
reduction agreement on Polish lines and approval of credits from the IMF,
the World Bank and other institutions. The need to attract foreign
investment was underlined by the 27 per cent drop in industrial production
last year. Heavy investment is needed not only to improve efficiency but
also to reduce the levels of environmental pollution, including the danger
of nuclear contamination from the country's big Soviet designed nuclear
power station.
Until recently foreign investors have tended to shy away from Bulgaria
although recently the Rover Group, the UK car manufacturer, negotiated a
joint venture with the Defence Ministry to assemble cars, Land Rovers and
pick-up trucks at former military plants.
Earlier this year Mr Dimitrov spent 10 days in the US hoping to drum up
investor enthusiasm for privatising important sectors such as
telecommunications and modernising the countries extensive, but largely
obsolescent electronics industry. Other sectors with foreign investment
potential; which were slated for privatisation included tourism and
agro-business. The Bulgarian-American enterprise fund has Dollars 55m
available to finance such projects over the next three years.
The first stage of the privatisation programme involves the transformation
of state enterprises into joint stock companies whose shares can eventually
be sold off to the public.
At least 20 per cent of the shares of privatised enterprises will be
retained by the government and placed in an investment fund.
This will be used to finance social security funds and limited compensation
for former owners who were illegally expropriated.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (11): The back of
the pack - Romania In spite of the adoption of an ambitious privatisation

state sector which still accounts for more than 90 per cent of industrial
production.

Romania lags well behind its central European neighbours in starting
privatisation. In spite of the adoption of an ambitious privatisation law
last August, the country has yet to privatise a single company in the state
sector which still accounts for more than 90 per cent of industrial
production. The private sector which contributed 24 per cent to gross
domestic product last year is concentrated in trade and tourism.
Although an inheritance law has been re-established and over 70 per cent of
agricultural land is now in private hands, the government has yet to decide
whether private residences expropriated by the former communist regime
should be retained by tenants or restored to their previous owners.
Nor has parliament, which has been locked in acrimonious in-fighting over
the election laws for several months, completed the legislation needed for
the six ownership funds which form the basis of the country's privatisation
scheme.
In spite of the political problems, the National Privatisation Agency (NPA),
the government body responsible for organising privatisation, has
accelerated the process since January and begun to implement existing
legislation. It has initiated a pilot privatisation scheme involving 30
companies, begun to auction assets and started to distribute ownership
certificates to the public.
Under the privatisation law, Romanian citizens will receive, free of charge,
30 per cent of the capital of commercial companies which will be held in
five Private Ownership Funds (POFs), or mutual funds.
The remaining 70 per cent, earmarked for foreign and private investors, will
be transferred into a State Ownership Fund (SOF). The SOF, loosely modelled
on the German Treuhand, will be responsible for carrying out privatisation
and for restructuring larger enterprises. The law stipulates the SOF must
sell-off 10 per cent of its equity every year.
An important element of the Romanian scheme is the 'commercialisation' of
the state sector ahead of privatisation. In July 1990, 6,200 state
enterprises became either joint stock or limited liability companies. These
companies, which represent 55 per cent of state equity, will be sold-off
under the privatisation scheme. The remaining 45 per cent will be taken up
by 330 regie autonomes, state corporations, concentrated in strategic areas
such as power, transport and telecommunications, which the government will
retain with the right to sell them off directly.
The NPA, which in the last financial year received nearly Dollars 5m from
the European Community's Phare programme, admits there have been serious
delays in starting privatisation but insists there is some justification.
'Our situation is entirely different to Hungary or Poland,' explains Mr Doru
Tiberiu, the agency's general manager. 'Prior to 1989, Romania had the most
highly-centralised command economy outside the former Soviet Union. Our
reforms will therefore take much longer and we also need to place more
emphasis on educating the population about the transition.'
There are other reasons for stressing education and training. Romania, more
distant from European Community markets and with a reputation for political
instability, has not attracted much foreign investment. At the end of April,
foreign investment since January 1990 was less than Dollars 350m.
Delay in starting reform has held up foreign aid and loans, depriving the
country of the funds it needs to undertake economic restructuring. Even with
promised foreign credits of more than Dollars 1.5bn this year, Romania is
still short of funds for privatisation.
The POFs and SOFs will only receive three months of start-up advice from
Lazard Freres, the French bank, before being left to manage their portfolios
alone.
However, western business consultants involved in the pilot privatisation
scheme point to advantages in being a late starter.
'The transition of the former communist countries is a lot more complicated
than we first imagined,' says Mr Nicolas Pelletier of Paribas, the French
bank, which helped formulate Poland's Mass Privatisation Plan.
'Romania has taken the time to work out a good mechanism for privatisation
and can draw on the experiences of the other countries. In the long term,
this is far more important,' he adds.
With the system still several months away from full operation, it is too
early to evaluate comprehensively privatisation in Romania. At the same
time, general elections and a political shake-up loom. The NPA may be
pressing ahead but privatisation remains a contentious issue.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (9): Prepared to
consider alternative approaches - Russia The important thing is that after
months of agonising over how to start privatisation, Russia has at last

Before it was privatised, the windows of Moscow's Gastronom number 44 were
decorated with empty cartons for milk which it rarely sold. Now that it has
been privatised and renamed Ukraine Trading Firm, the cartons remain and
there is still no milk for sale on a regular basis.
This is the meagre result of a mass privatisation of the capital's shops by
virtually handing them over to their workers for a nominal price by Mr
Gavril Popov, the capital's former mayor. His aim, he said was 'smashing
state property at any cost' to reverse 75 years of socialism.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation minister, argues that such
transfers of assets to workers for an extremely low book value are 'socially
unfair, economically ineffective and politically dangerous'.
However, he also admits that the task of taking out of state hands an
economy which is 97 per cent state owned is 'so great that one should not
forbid or exclude alternative approaches'. Mr Chubais's biggest worry about
his approach is that there wil be insufficient demand for enterprises that
will be offered for sale.
The important thing is that after months of agonising over how to start
privatisation, Russia has at last begun the process which all reformers in
the former Soviet Union agree is essential to moving towards a market
economy. The next headache is how to progress from small privatisation to
the privatisation of big enterprises, most of which badly need painful and
costly restructuring, and many of which are so obsolescent or so polluting
that they need closing.
While some republics have gone further in some directions - Armenia, for
example, has privatised most of its farming land - others, such as Belarus
and the central Asian republics have not even begun taking the economy out
of state control.
For the small-scale privatisation which Russia is trying to achieve this
year, Mr Chubais favours auctions to dispose of shops, restaurants and small
enterprises in those parts of he country over which he has some control.
The extent of his authority falls far short of the formal borders of the
Russian federation which stretches from St Petersburg to Vladivostok and
everything in between.
Moscow, for example, has special permission to use its own approach with the
city boundaries. The autonomous republics within Russia, such as Tataria,
simply do not obey the government, while everywhere else the rules are
frequently broken by acts of so-called nomenklatura privatisation. This is
the process wherebye state-owned assets are transferred, usually at nominal
prices, to private companies owned by friends or family of the managers
involved, defrauding both the state treasury and ordinary citizens.
Earlier this year the untypically enlightened local authorities of Nizhny
Novgorod, east of Moscow, teamed up with the World Bank to conduct a model
auction of shops, which was a big success. Using this politically useful but
rare example Mr Chubais, in his welcoming speech, underlined that collective
or state owned enterprises need the shock of competition, and the experience
of having to pay real money for their acquisitions, in order to change their
behaviour.
Although Moscow provides impressive statistics for the creation of property
owners, there is little incentive for a change in habits. There is no danger
of going bankrupt because there is no law on bankruptcy, there is little
competition, and for the time being shops are simply passing increased costs
on to the beleaguered consumer.
'There is a big political danger that Muscovites will read the newspapers,
and hear that trade has been privatised but then when they go to the shops,
they'll see nothing there,' Mr Chubais warns.
Mr Chubais believes his method is the least prone to corruption, while Mr
Popov, a man of older years, says corruption is inevitable, and indeed
desirable.
That there should be few practical benefits from the privatisation conducted
so far in Moscow is also a sign of how much more needs to be done in the
rest of the economy.
There is no wholesale system to speak of - just an inefficient
state-controlled distribution system and virtually no competition. While
Gastronom 4 bought pineapples from a local hard currency store and sold them
for a big rouble mark up, it rarely has basic items such as milk (other than
extremely expensive long-life milk from Italy). This is a consequence of the
poor supply, storage and transport facilities which blight all aspects of
the economy.
The need to think of the entire food chain as one long, series of unbroken
links stretching from the field or dairy, through to the wholesaler or
processor and on to the eventual consumer is the principal lesson which the
British Food Consortium, consisting of the UK's biggest food and
distribution companies, has been emphasising. It sees it as part of the
uphill struggle to improve and privatise food supply in Russia and Ukraine.
For the privatisation of large enterprises, which is due to start next year,
Mr Chubais believes that the Czechoslovak system of distributing vouchers to
the population is the most promising route for Russia to follow. Just back
from a trip to Prague, he noted that 420 investment funds set up to manage
shares had appeared spontaneously.
The Russian government plans to launch its own voucher distribution scheme
this autumn - after sorting out practical details such as whether they
should be given out for free or paid for, and who would receive them.
The situation in Russia is complicated by the fact that it was born out of
the Soviet Union's collapse.
In the absence of Russian citizenship laws, the government had to find an
effective criteria for supplying vouchers to Russians only. Not all the
inhabitants of Russia are Russians, while a lot of Russians live outside
Russia.
For this reason the government will be declaring a deadline for Russians to
return to Russia in order to receive vouchers, while everybody who is
permanently resident in Russia will receive vouchers even if they are not
Russian.
The government is also in the process of sorting out what to do about
foreigners. Having dropped plans for a special exchange rate for foreigners
(to prevent Russians from being squeezed out of the race by an extremely
weak rouble), the government is casting around for an alternative system of
giving its own nationals equal opportunities.
The suggestions it has come up with so far - setting aside special
enterprises for foreign investors or multiplying the price of assets bought
by foreigners by special coefficients - are all difficult to operate in
practice. Mr Chubais claims to prefer avoiding any special practices for
foreigners on the grounds 'that the more foreign investment there is the
better'.
In the absence of a bankruptcy law on which is a prerequisite for closing
down inefficient enterprises and a threat for those which fail to
restructure, privatisation of large enterprises is likely to remain a
limited for some time to come.
The government has ordered them to turn themselves into joint stock
companies in preparation for possible privatisation starting next year, or
earlier if they are ready.
Attempts to attract foreign investment to big enterprises show this is
likely to continue to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. But foreigners
are reluctant to buy into enterprises which are heavily overmanned and over
which they are unlikely to have control.
What is more likely is that there will be a prolongation of the present
system where joint ventures are limited to those assets which foreign
investors are interested in. These are then hived off from the rest of the
enterprise in order to insulate them from the inefficiency of the complex as
a whole.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (10): Nation that
is building the apparatus from scratch - Ukraine As yet, the privatisation

The bitter dispute between Russia and the Ukraine over control of the Black
Sea Fleet in recent months underlined, in an extreme way, the problems
attached to establishing ownership rights in this part of the world.
After several months of increasingly tense negotiations and stand-offs Mr
Boris Yeltsin the Russian president and Mr Leonid Kravchuk his Ukrainian
counterpart, agreed at their Black Sea resort meeting last month that the
fleet would be divided between the two states.
They discussed the basic ground rules for future trade and other relations
following Ukraine's decision in principle to leave the rouble zone and issue
its own currency.
While weighty issues such as these were still pending it proved difficult
for the Ukrainian authorities to move ahead with important economic reforms,
such as implementing the privatisation process for which most of the
legislation is in place.
Ukraine, the largest of the new states to emerge from the break up of the
Soviet empire with over 50m inhabitants and an area greater than France, has
virtually had to build a state and government apparatus from scratch.
Both the president and Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister, are former
communist apparatchiks and there is a dangerous lack of experienced
personnel to staff the new ministries and the institutions needed to
transform an economy based on heavy industry, mining and large scale
collective grain farming.
All these problems particularly the shortage of competent staff, are common
to the entire area, but in Ukraine with its ambitions to become a fully
developed European state after centuries of subservience, the scale is
bigger because the country is so big.
For this reason, Ukraine is a good place to observe the inter-connectedness
of the privatisation process with economic and financial reform in general.
During a recent visit to London, Mr Volodymyr Lanovoi, the privatisation
minister, sought to attract foreign investment by explaining the new foreign
investment law, which has now approved by parliament, within the broader
context of plans to privatise 65 per cent of its nearly 10,000 large and
medium-sized enterprsies within five years.
As yet, privatisation has hardly begun and foreign investors are holding
back until the authorities can show that they are able to run an independent
currency.
Hambros Bank is advising the government on monetary and privatisation issues
and Sir Michael Butler, who formerly headed the UK permanent mission in
Brussels and is one of the leaders of the Hambros team, emphasises that
Ukraine's top priority must be to establish its monetary and fiscal
credibility and above all tackle the problem of fast mounting
inter-enterprise debts.
Without tight control of monetary policy and a serious effort to curb
enterprise indebtedness Ukraine risks hyper-inflation which would destroy
the credibility of its a planned new currency at the outset and make it
virtually impossible to proceed with privatisation.
Ukraine is getting similar warnings from the IMF and World Bank.
On a recent visit to Kiev, Mr Larry Summers, the World Bank's chief
economist warned that 'without more rapid reforms a new currency would be a
very perilous undertaking'.
What was needed he said was 'the familiar trinity of stabilisation,
liberalisation and privatisation'. But privatisation existed 'only on
paper'.
To underline the point Mr Lanovoi recently threatened to resign unless the
present government, staffed largely by former communists, was re-organised
and a new committment shown to putting privatisation and other reforms into
practice.
An example of the kind of problems which lie ahead as the economy moves to
market methods came last month when Germany decided top withdraw from the
Krivoi Rog iron ore project on which several hundred million dollars has
already been spent by Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania as well
as Ukraine.
Designed to supply iron ore to the steel industries of all the partners, the
application of western accounting methods demonstrated that the ore was too
poor and production costs too high to compete with imports.
On the same basis, a high proportion of Ukraine's coal, engineering and
chemical production will also find it difficult to attract new investors and
compete in world markets.

Hungary's privatisation has passed straight from troubled infancy to
mid-life crisis. Just three short years ago Hungarian companies were in the
vanguard of eastern Europe's leap into the brave new world of private
ownership. Since then, Hungary has undertaken what officials claim is the
fastest privatisation in the history of the world.
The region's pioneer privatiser is facing the aches and pains of maturity.
So soon after starting the disposal of state-owned assets, Hungary is fast
running out of companies to sell. Significant industrial sectors, including
cigarettes and tobacco, distilling, brewing, vegetable oil, sugar,
confectionary, bread, newspapers, paper, refrigerators, cement and glass are
largely in the hands of western multinationals.
Recent events have shown there are are built-in limits to western cherry
picking of prime national assets. First, Hungarians are no longer quite so
convinced that they want western investors to dominate privatisation to the
extent that they have. With nine out of the top 10 privatisations last year
trade sales to western multinationals and 85 per cent of proceeds from
foreign investors, some political backlash was virtually inevitable.
A poll by the Szonda-Ipsos public opinion pollsters showed only a small
margin of 7 per cent between those who favoured privatisation of industry
and those opposed. A nervous government is responding with a subtle move
away from reliance on foreign investors.
The lopsided foreign focus on consumer goods industries is also
unsustainable. A host of companies is still available forprivatisation, but
the best of the state's portfolio is exhausted.
'The major eye-catching areas, they are done, they are gone; there are still
some gems out there but you have to look hard for them,' says Mr Christopher
Perrin, an investment banker at GZIZ, the central European investment
banking subsidiary of Austria's Girozentrale. Consumer goods companies have
been the first to be privatised for three main reasons. First, they were the
natural target for multinationals searching for market share, the main
attraction which drew western multinationals to eastern Europe in the first
place. Second, many had close trading and licensing relationships with
western companies which thus became natural privatisation partners. And
lastly, title to property is clearer than in the case of, say, hotels.
The flipside is that the most difficult privatisation prospects have been
left till last. 'Some of the early ones went pretty easily, what is left
will be more difficult,' says Mr Perrin.
What remains in state hands, tends to remain there for good reason. Hungary
is coming up against political and economic constraints on privatisation,
which implies a likely hiatus in the process.
Hotels, banks and utilities are next in line for privatisation and each
sector is potentially attractive to investors. But privatisation in each
sector is proving fiendishly complicated. Their common feature is that the
government impinges far more than in the trade sale of a manufacturing
company.
In any country that is a recipe for delay and disruption. In a country such
as Hungary, where democratic and efficient administration is developing
painfully and falteringly after four decades of communist dictatorship, this
creates bureaucratic impasse.
There is little doubt that the hotels, banks and utilities will survive to
be privatised and the government will eventually get around to creating the
necessary legal and administrative framework. The real problem lies with a
third category of companies so financially unattractive that western
investors will never bid for them on any conceivable terms.
Western advisers say part of the fault lies with the government's inflexible
negotiating practice and inattention to its own ultra-liberal privatisation
rhetoric. The SPA says that it accepts whatever price the market determines
for a company - with the proviso that there be competitive bidding.
However, the agency, sensitive to attacks from the political right for
selling out the country, has never explicitly declared that it would accept
a zero purchase price if the market dictated that and has never announced
any such deals.
In practice, western companies say, the SPA pays too much attention to
meaningless asset valuations rather than market worth which drives
investors' calculations. That is not so much of a problem when the subject
is a profitable consumer goods company. But, for many industrial companies
which remain and languish in the SPA's portfolio, asset valuations are a
poor guide to what an investor would buy. This often makes for a gap between
the two sides' negotiating positions. Most Hungarian companies are not
interesting to western investors in their present form, whatever the price
and however flexible the authorities. The challenge in these cases is to
find owners for the parts of the Hungarian economy that western investors
cannot reach. Recently Hungary has responded to this imperative with a
highly empirical cocktail of privatisation measures. These include:
A commitment that domestic investors will be preferred over foreign
companies in the case of similiar bids for a company.
Further help for domestic investors who cannot afford to buy a state company
outright through concessional leasing, payment by instalment or option
arrangements.
The government has also said that it would make more of an effort to divide
up state companies before sale, partly to stimulate competition but also to
make them more digestible for local entrepreneurs lacking the financial
clout of western investors.
In recent weeks Hungary has given a nod to Czechoslovak schemes to spur
domestic ownership by distributing rather than selling state property. The
government is to hand over state assets to institutions such as
universities. But wholesale distribution to the public through a voucher
scheme is not on the agenda.
Alongside the new initiative, the government is expanding a decentralised
privatisation scheme for companies which are too small to have attracted
interest from western investors and have generally lagged behind in
privatisation. The decentralised scheme basically allows the management of
the state company to privatise itself, with the help of a consultant.
One other route for state companies into the private sector of increasing
importance is through liquidation, which is growing as Hungary's bankruptcy
law bites. Western advisers such as Price Waterhouse are particularly
enthusiastic about the possibilities.
Liquidation allows an investor to reduce the acquisition's debt burden, to
pick and choose which part of the state company to buy, and to bypass the
authorities and deal with the creditor banks which are the effective owners.
There is a limit to what privatisation policy can do. Economic upturn
matters far more. If interest rates continue downwards and profits recover,
investors are expected to put their money in privatisation issues rather
than in bonds or bank deposits. The ultimate accolade for privatisation is
that the companies in private hands are those most strongly tipped to lead
that recovery.

The lions and other animal acts performing in Polish circus arenas this
summer will be privately owned, for the first season in over 40 years.
It may not seem much to get a trained seal off the state's books. But the
state circus occupied a special place in the communist propaganda armoury
and its change of status is a landmark of sorts on Poland's faltering path
to a market economy.
In past months such landmarks have been few and far between as the previous
government headed by Mr Jan Olszewski dithered and allowed the process to
slow.
The new government will have to appoint a strong political personality to
head the privatisation ministry and give his programme top priority if the
lost time is to be made up.
Mr Jan Ledochowski from SG Warburg, the London-based merchant bank, which is
the main adviser to the Polish government on privatisation says that the
legislation for mass privatisation and the creation of investment funds to
manage the newly privatised share portfolios is ready and awaiting a
government decision.
The main problem is that forming a government could still be a lengthy
process, and even after government approval the legislation could still face
a possibly lengthy and tormented passage through parliament.
The most successful part of the privatisation drive has been through
liquidation. This is the process under which the ZPR circus, for example,
was privatised last autumn. Since 1990, some 540 state sector businesses
employing 180,000 people have taken this path. In essence, it marries a
leveraged management buy-out with an employee equity stake and sometimes an
outside investment from small private business.
The snag for the government is that most of the 540 privatisations under the
liquidation scheme are small units such as industrial design bureaux where
capital equipment requirements are low and the value lies in the expertise
of the staff.
This illustrates the general rule that privatisation has gone quickest
wherever capital requirements have been low and skills developed in the past
could be easily redeployed. This explains the speed with which domestic and
foreign trade has been privatised.
Some 80 per cent of the country's retail outlets are in private hands, most
of them family businesses in premises rented from local councils. Some
wholesale sectors have been privatised. For example, 80 per cent of domestic
trade in steel products and 40 per cent of all registered imports were run
by private traders. The main difficulties concern sales of industrial assets
especially the large factories.
Initially, it was thought that speedy disposals could be achieved by sales
of shares through public offers to domestic investors and trade sales to
foreign companies. But investor interest has waned in line with a steady
decline of share prices on Warsaw's stock exchange and the failure of most
of the 13 quoted companies to pay a dividend this year.
Foreign investment last year trickled in through a succession of trade sales
which raised about Dollars 150m and transferred relatively modern plants
such as Pollena Bydgoszcz, a detergents plant, to Unilever or domestically
recognised brand names such as Wedel, a chocolate manufacturer, to PepsiCo
foods.
This year, however, the upheaval at the Privatisation Ministry which
accompanied the change of government last January delayed talks on further
sales with foreign investors. Prospective clients held off to see how the
situation would develop.
At the same time, Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, the new minister instituted a network
of consultation procedures down to the shop floor which delayed sales
decisions.
Meanwhile, opinion polls show that opposition to privatisation is growing.
In September 1990, CBOS, the government's own polling unit, reported that 43
per cent of the population said privatisation would serve the interests of
the economy. Last month a mere 18 per cent were still convinced.
Against this background, privatisation through foreign investment this year
has been meagre. ABB, the Swiss Swedish power plant producer, bought 51 per
cent of the equity in the Elta transformer factory in Lodz for Dollars
10.4m, and CPC, the US company which produces Knorr and Marmite, bought
Amino, a dehydrated foods processor in Poznan for Dollars 8.8m.
The biggest deal to date has been Fiat's Dollars 2bn stake in the FSM plant
in southern Poland. FSM produces Fiat's new Cinquecento model and the latest
deal should bring in further foreign investment by Fiat's own suppliers keen
to have a cheaper production base from which to serve the Cinquecento
assembly line.
Several large deals are in the pipeline and ministry negotiators remain
optimistic.
'Most of the 30 trade sales we were expecting in the first half of this year
are going to happen,' says Mr Michal Rusiecki.
He points to pulp and paper, power engineering, edible oils and possibly
telecommunications as areas where sales are expected.
All this will not be enough to achieve the target of placing most of the
economy in private hands by the middle of the decade.
Hence the need for the ambitious mass privatisation plan which aims to put
some 400 companies representing 25 per cent of industrial sales under
western management through a framework of investment funds.
The funds could well be established in the autumn according to Mr Jerzy
Thieme, at the Privatisation Ministry who with help from SG Warburg has
designed the plan.
Mr Thieme reports that interest by prospective western managers is still
there and initial financing has been promised by the World Bank and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
However, the scheme could be subjected to a reappraisal by the incoming
government as well as delays from the most unexpected quarters.
President Lech Walesa, a keen advocate of privatisation, has his own plan
which includes a projected 10-year interest-free loan worth Dollars 10,000
to every citizen in the form of coupons which would be repayable after 20
years in cash.
The president, apparently unaware that there is a shortage of funds to cover
such a loan, recently suggested that the sum should be increased five fold.
His aim is to lift the privatisation programme as well as bolster his
support in the country. But if he persists the most likely net result would
be to hold up the mass privatisation programme on which so much time and
ingenuity has already been expended.

learning curve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The privatisation process throughout eastern Europe has involved a steep
learning curve and frequent changes of course, writes Nicholas Denton. The
following chronology of Hungarian privatisation traces the development of
privatisation in one country.
December 1989: Majority stake in state-owned Tungsram lightbulb producer
sold to General Electric of the US for Dollars 150m, in the first large
privatisation deal.
March 1990: State Property Agency set up to supervise privatisation in
response to accusations of corruption when companies 'spontaneously'
privatised themselves. Democratic elections produce a conservative
government which is suspicious of communist managers safeguarding their
positions through privatisation and pushes for tighter control.
June 1990: Ibusz, the national travel agency, privatised by public offering
and floated on the newly founded Budapest Stock Exchange. The price rises
sharply after the launch but then falls well below the issue level, leaving
investors with heavy losses and discrediting the stock market route for
privatisation.
September 1990: Hungary launches First Privatisation Programme, a closely
controlled scheme by the authorities for model privatisations of 20
attractive companies.
March 1991: 100 per cent of Lehel, a refrigerator maker, sold to Electrolux
of Sweden in Hungary's first outright privatisation sale.
October 1991: Decentralised privatisation programme for small companies
under way, marking a move away from bureaucratic control.
November 1991: Flotation of Danubius, a hotel chain, cancelled after
last-minute changes to the company's tax position, effectively killing the
First Privatisation Programme.
December 1991: Spate of trade sales of state-owned consumer goods companies
to western multinationals give Hungary Dollars 500m in privatisation
proceeds in 1991.
January 1992: Mr Tamas Szabo appointed minister responsible for
privatisation, giving clearer political direction to the State Property
Agency after a year of damaging turf battles within the government over
control of privatisation.
May 1992: As figures show western multinationals dominating privatisation
and government unpopularity mounts, measures announced to stimulate domestic
participation in privatisation. They include easy payment terms for domestic
investors and discrimination in favour of them over foreign investors in the
case of similar bids.

The case of eastern Germany, once rated as the strongest economy in the
communist bloc, has given a valuable, if chilling, insight into the
difficulties confronting other east European countries trying to establish
market economies.
Treuhand, or the job-killer as Germany's privatisation agency is widely
known in the eastern provinces - is no model for them, insists Ms Birgit
Breuel, the agency's president. Nor is the German experience directly
applicable anywhere else.
The established social economy of western Germany provided the five new
states with a proven blueprint for their conversion. It also provided funds
at a level and a speed unimaginable further east, and extended a stable,
experienced government and a tested legal system.
The re-absorbed provinces had access to a ready supply of management and
supervisory skills and easy access to other western capital and know-how.
North-Rhine Westphalia has seconded 1,000 civil servants temporarily to
Brandenburg state to help set up a workable administration.
'These advantages are not available to other former communist countries.
Each one must find its own way to a new economic system,' Mr Theo Waigel,
finance minister, told a recent east-west conference in Berlin. 'But they
share many similar problems, and our experience with these can help.'
The common problems include rotting infrastructures and companies cobbled
together from hundreds of disparate elements. Such an organisation in the
former GDR might commonly have manufactured boilers, deck chairs, cutlery,
milk bottles and engine parts under one corporate umbrella. Other issues
common to all former socialist states include defining ownership of land,
buildings and other assets, corruption, the almost total ignorance of
meaningful book keeping, and over-manning at every level.
The German experience indicates that the first step is for the government to
state clearly at the outset the main elements in its restructuring policy.
Bonn did this only weeks after unification. The Treuhand, effective
controller of the whole of east German industry, was up and working before
it had proper offices, with a staff of just 50 people.
'Privatisation should begin as soon as possible with selected targets. The
people must experience quickly that changes are under way,' Mr Waigel said.
It took Treuhand just nine months to sell off 15,000 small businesses: snack
bars, kiosks, garages, restaurants and shops.
As for group structures similar to east Germany's Kombinaten, they should
first be unbundled or broken up into coherent business units to form the
basis of a configuration similar to the federal republic's Mittelstand, the
mass of small and medium-sized private companies on which national economic
success was founded.
The Treuhand has sifted enterprises into three groups:
Profitable and sellable
Unprofitable but salvageable
Hopeless cases.
Take the case of the east German textile industry. There were 330,000
textile workers when the Treuhand was set up 18 months ago. At the end of
this year there will be about 30,000. According to Mr Hermann Beck, head of
Treuhand's Potsdam branch, the situation is hopeless.
Not quite. Just as the former West Germany found new jobs for most of its
own 400,000 displaced textile workers, now it has come to the aid of those
cast adrift by the post-unification collapse of the industry in the east,
aggravated by the almost total loss of its markets in the former Soviet
Union. With training, early retirement, work creation schemes and the dole,
it has ensured that the personal economic suffering has been minimised.
There are even some companies, such as the Branka spinning works in
Brandenburg, considered still to have a chance. The company was singled out
at the start as fit for restructuring, in agency jargon.
Annual capacity has been more than halved and the workforce has dropped from
750 people to 145. The works doctor, dentist and physiotherapist have gone
freelance. The creche and kindergarten have been closed. The party hacks and
Stasi secret police spooks who used to manage the entire east German
spinning industry as a single Kombinat have disappeared. Even now, Branka's
relative disadvantages seem overwhelming.
It has no financial history, no profits, few customers. Its relative
advantages - restructuring, continuing management advice and investment at
the hands of Treuhand and at the expense of the west German taxpayer - may
save it. Like the 5,500 companies and 25,000 other properties still on the
Treuhand's books, all it needs is a buyer.
The difficulties, as the finance ministry points out, begin with the
decisions on which should be restructured and how; who takes responsibility
for old debts and who cleans up the mess left behind after decades of failed
or non-existent environmental policies.
Restructuring in east Germany has typically reduced company workforces by up
to 75 per cent. It has also strained management resources unused to such
monumental tasks. The past 18 months have shown that potential investors
consider that most of the dirty work is a matter for government or
government-sponsored agencies such as the Treuhand. Ms Breuel and her 3,500
team plan to wind up their activities by the end of 1994, acting on the
belief that the quicker privatisation is achieved the better.
After that, it is for private enterprise to take up the reins.
'Experience teaches that privatisation is the best form of restructuring.
The private investor takes over all the risks and opportunities when he buys
a company. He will try, through investment, modernisation and realisation of
market opportunities to increase the earning power of the business and with
it the job security for his employees,' says Mr Waigel.
'In this way the interests of the new owners tally precisely with the
overall economic interests of the country,' he concludes.

Last month's general elections in the Czech and Slovak republics illustrated
for the first time the vote-winning potency of privatisation - and the
divisive force of conflicting views over the need to speed up or slow down
the process.
For Mr Vaclav Klaus, clear victor in the Czech lands, determined
championship of mass privatisation through a complex voucher system proved
an electoral trump card. Nearly 80 per cent of the electorate went into the
voting booths as owners of a book of vouchers which they had bought earlier
for a nominal sum, equivalent to one week's average wages. This included
over 2m Slovak investors, many of whom opted to buy shares in Czech
companies.
The vouchers entitled the holders to shares in any of the nearly 1,500
state-owned enterprises involved in the first of two waves of mass
privatisation. With his signature on each page of the voucher book, Mr Klaus
made sure that voters had a stake in the reforms and that, in the Czech
lands at least, they identified their interest with his Civic Democratic
Party (ODS).
However, in Slovakia, nationalist fervour and resentment at high
unemployment and other negative side-effects of market reforms, proved
stronger than economic self-interest. This could mean that the second wave
of mass privatisation might only take place in the Czech lands, with a
different and possibly slower timetable for Slovakia.
Privatisation is expected to power ahead in the Czech lands where the ODS
won 30 per cent of votes while the communist party won only 14 per cent and
effectively lost the power to interfere.
Bidding for the future shares begun two weeks before the polls opened. On
May 18, over 8.5m citizens started using their vouchers to compete for a
share in the equity of Czech and Slovak enterprises. Only a quarter did so
individually. Confused by the complicated process and lacking basic
information, 72 per cent of voucher holders entrusted their vouchers to one
of the 436 private investment funds which sprung up earlier in the year to
benefit from privatisation.
Without these private funds, with their pledges to buy voucher books for up
to 10 times their purchase price after 12 months, the voucher scheme may
never have got off the ground. The first funds, led by the enterprising
Harvard Capital and Consulting Company, run by 28-year-old Mr Viktor Kozeny,
promised to take the risk out of the initial investment for millions of
potential investors who initially greeted vouchers with indifference.
Equity with a book value of Kcs299bn (Dollars 9.9bn) in 1,491 enterprises
has been put aside for voucher privatisation. This is about 60 per cent of
the book value of the assets being privatised this spring. A second wave is
being prepared for the autumn. The mechanics of the voucher programme
consist of a series of bidding rounds which are expected to last through the
summer.
The first round started on May 18 and was completed in mid-June. Enterprises
where the demand for shares outstripped the original valuation of the equity
on offer will be subjected to a second round of bids. Up to five rounds of
bidding are provided for at progressively higher prices in voucher terms
until supply and demand can be matched.
No fixed percentage of equity was set aside for voucher privatisation and
every enterprise involved was obliged to draw up its own privatisation plan.
Some enterprises have 20 per cent of their equity slated for vouchers while
others offer as much as 97 per cent. A minimum 3 per cent is set aside for
the restitution fund, formed to compensate those illegally expropriated by
the old regime.
Equity not involved in the voucher scheme can be privatised by a series of
other methods, including public auctions, restitutions and direct sales to
domestic or foreign investors. An estimated Dollars 2bn worth of foreign
investment has been committed to Czechoslovak companies and as much as
Dollars 3bn is in the pipeline, according to US advisers at the Czech
Ministry of Privatisation.
However, Czechoslovakia's recent political developments could easily darken
the prospects for the smooth continuation of the voucher programme.
Nationalists, who won the upper hand in the smaller republic of Slovakia,
have pledged to curtail the influence of the federal authorities in Prague
over their economic affairs.
In the short term, Mr Klaus's voucher scheme should not be endangered. The
new programme for the interim caretaker federal government, recently agreed
upon by Mr Klaus and Mr Vladimir Meciar, the newly-elected leader of the
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, states clearly that both sides are
committed to continue the privatisation programme.
Much will depend, however, on the intentions of the newly-elected left-wing
leaders in the Slovak republic. Strong voices within Mr Meciar's party have
criticised the voucher programme and have offered an ill-defined alternative
based on employees' ownership. But attracting foreign investment will remain
a priority for the small, cash-strapped republic.
To a certain extent, enterprises have restructured into Czech or Slovak
joint-stock companies as they prepared for privatisation. However, in the
rush to launch the scheme before the elections, federal authorities assumed
a lasting and unified equity market.
Ten per cent of Slovaks have given their vouchers to Czech investment funds
while less than 1 per cent of Czechs have placed their vouchers in Slovak
funds. But Slovak funds are bidding for the shares of Czech enterprises
which have better chances than their debt-ridden Slovak counterparts. Czech
enterprises have attracted 90 per cent of foreign investment to date.
Until shares are distributed, enterprises slated for the voucher
distribution are legally the property of the National Property Fund. If
prolonged, this status could paralyse enterprises, foreign advisers believe.
In the long term, there are positive aspects to a division of the two
republics. Western businessmen have often been hampered by the complexities
of dealing with both republican and federal bureaucracies. Many say that
dealing with just one government in each republic could facilitate foreign
investment in both.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (2): 'Like the
Foreign Legion' - Western advisers find the challenge exhilarating but
stressful

<TEXT>
FOR hundreds of western bankers, accountants, lawyers and purveyors of other
professional services, the opening up of eastern Europe introduced them to a
new Wild West.
The complexity of rebuilding capitalism has taxed their ingenuity and
patience, and taken many to hitherto secret locations in the farthest flung
reaches of the former Soviet empire.
It is a stressful area. 'Our people in eastern Europe are a bit like members
of the Foreign Legion, with more than a fair share of divorces and unhappy
marriages among them,' says the eastern Europe manager of one large
accounting firm, who wishes to remain anonymous. But it it is also a place
which attracts the young and the adventurous.
'You are in the forefront of history, you are trying to make privatisation
work, you are inventing things all the time - in a world without stock
exchanges or banks or even application forms,' explains Mr Arnold Shipp,
senior manager at Samuel Montagu which was one of the first UK-based
merchant banks to plunge into the new area.
City firms, were quick to spot the potential new markets, and were greatly
helped by the UK Know-How Fund, which finances a broad swathe of
privatisation-related projects from its Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m annual budget
for the area.
The greatest demand has been for accounting, auditing, evaluating, due
diligence and other services, which has led the big six international
accounting firms, and many smaller companies, to build up fast-growing
practices in all east European capitals and other leading cities.
According to a survey by Privatisation International, which specialises in
privatisation news worldwide, Coopers and Lybrand tops the list of east
European assignments, closely followed by KPMG and Price Waterhouse.
In spite of the rapid growth over the last three years, the virtually zero
starting point and desperate shortage of hard currency means that eastern
Europe still represents only a fraction of most companies' overall business.
'There is a widespread belief that eastern Europe is the biggest thing that
ever happened in the privatisation field. It isn't,' says Mr Richard
Gledhill, head of privatisation services for Price Waterhouse. 'In terms of
business and fee income the work generated by privatisation in Latin
America, south-east Asia and Australia is much greater. Out of 800 partners
worldwide only 10 or 11 are engaged full-time in eastern Europe which
represents only around 5 per cent of total fee income and time.'
'The three big markets for accounting and other professional services in
eastern Europe are governments, state-owned enterprises and potential
investors,' he adds.
While the area remains relatively small in global income terms for foreign
advisers of all stripes, demand for their services is growing fast.
The entire institutional and legal framework is having to be built up at the
same time as deals are being negotiated to transfer property from often
ill-defined 'state' ownership to private hands. This is the main difference
between privatisation in the former centrally planned economies and
elsewhere.
The scale of the needs is the reason why 'it is easier to get a mandate in
eastern Europe than most places, but 10 times more difficult to actually
close a deal,' according to Mr Alasdair Dundas of Bankers Trust, who advised
the Czech government on several early privatisation deals in the glass,
cement and other areas.
' We have to do a lot of hand-holding' adds Mr Dominic Hollanby of Andersen
Consultants, who is currently advising the Ministry of Privatisation in
Lithuania. 'Ministers and senior officials are often bright but
inexperienced and surrounded by men who ran the old system and want to
preserve their own jobs. The best combination of skills required by
management consultants in this area is a good accountancy background
combined with practical industrial experience,' he says.
One of the most difficult tasks is helping to bring about the revolution in
attitudes needed to transform the authoritarian, production-first mentality
of the old management structures.
'There are very few sales, marketing or finance people around to shift the
orientation from production to satisfying consumers. If privatisation is to
succeed power needs to be shifted from the production men and engineers to
managers with skills which as yet hardly exist,' says Mr Hollanby.
The influx of highly paid foreign advisers, accountants, lawyers and
consultants is not without stress for the newly-liberated host countries
either. Nationalist feelings are rising throughout the region. For some
local officials and resentful citizens, the western adviser has taken over a
similar role to that formerly played by the discrete but ubiqitous
KGB-linked Soviet advisers. For over four decades they sat in the important
ministries.
Critics of the Know-How fund, for example, say it is more a form of outdoor
relief for a London City financial establishment facing hard times than
genuine aid to the east. Often the complainants are academics or local
economists who are employed as sub-contractors, at low local pay rates, for
western companies who then charge up to Pounds 200 an hour for producing the
final product.
Substituting the beady eye of the accountant or lawyer for the tyranny of
the central plan is clearly not a painless process. The urgency of
transferring practical and organisational skills however is now widely
recognised, especially by governments.
Time and again, the weakness of banking systems, shortage of capital and the
uncontrollable increase in non-performing inter-enterprise debt emerge as
mines set to explode under SOE's on the privatisation menu. That is why the
World Bank, and other international institutions such as the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) or the European Community's Phare
fund place top priority on funding programmes to train a new generation of
central and commercial bankers.
With German banks deeply pre-occupied in building up their networks in
former east Germany other European, US and to a lesser extent Japanese
investment banks, are busy establishing bridgeheads and advising on a wide
range of privatisation issues.
Credit Suisse First Boston appears to be the most active, setting up
branches throughout the region to boost its agressive involvement in
privatisation issues.
CreditAnstalt is prominent among Austrian banks busily re-establishing their
presence in an area with long histroical links. Among City-based banks
Barclays de Zoete Weld has established offices in Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Poland while N. M. Rothschild, Samuel Montagu, Morgan Grenfell and SG
Warburg are among other active players in markets which are increasingly
perceived as requiring long term, and on-the-spot involvement.
Thus far competition is intense, costs are high and profits are small for
most western companies selling their skills in a crowded and poor market.
But without these skills it will not be possible to build the vital
inter-connecting tissue of long neglected services without which neither
privatisation nor a market economy is possible.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (3): Green fields
also beckon - Limits to privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION in all its many forms is the most important process at work
transforming economies and societies throughout the region. But it is not a
panacea.
Some potential foreign investors, having looked at the assets on offer, have
concluded it is easier to make a greenfield investment than battle with
bureaucrats in the various privatisation agencies, fight with the labour
unionsover large scale retrenchments or risk unquantifiable obligations to
clean up inherited environmental problems.
Significantly, most of the estimated Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn foreign equity
investment in the region to date has been geographically concentrated on the
three central European states - Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. It has
been focused on a narrow range of industries, mainly service, including the
media and hotels, or consumer goods, including foodstuffs, tobacco,
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Other targeted areas have been construction
materials, especially glass and cement, or the automobile and components
industries.
For the multinationals, the purchase of established consumer goods companies
gives them a convenient base from which to infiltrate their famous brand
names into almost virgin markets. In this way they extend their global
competition for market share to areas which are poor now, but will not
remain so.
This is of particular interest to the car and truck manufacturers operating
in otherwise saturated markets. They need low-cost production centres in
eastern Europe as much to improve competitivity in the West as to serve
demand in eastern Europe where the transition to capitalism has been
accompanied everywhere by steep falls in production and real incomes.
In effect, foreign investors are homing in on those sectors which were
always given the lowest priority for investment under the old regimes which
were obsessed with heavy industry. There are very few takers for the vast
engineering plants which frequently are the main or sole source of income
and support for entire communities.
Uncertainty over the future of thousands of plants such as these and
armaments and defence-related factories, hangs like a cloud over the
privatisation process. Many are surviving by extending loans to each other.
The accumulation of such non-performing assets is reducing their net value
by the day. Governments hope to include many such enterprises in the mass
privatisation programmes, in the hope that the onus of closing them down
will then rest on their new private owners.
Those that cannot be privatised in this way will either have to be openly
subsidised or reduced in size or closed down. What frightens governments
throughout the region is the risk that using the new bankruptcy laws to
close such factories will set off a domino effect.
This can only be avoided by large scale re-capitalisation of the banks, to
finance the inevitable write-off of bad debts, and provision of bridging
finance for those enterprises judged to be either potentially viable in the
long term of politically too sensitive to close. As yet, there is no clear
idea as to how such programmes will be financed.
Czechoslavakia, which recently set aside Kcs50bn to partially clean up bank
balance sheets from non-performing assets has made a start.
Poland has invented its own 'sectoral privatisation' scheme, with the aid of
foreign advisers, and hopes to tackle the problem by devising industry-wide
privatisation and investment programmes. These would be managed by the
proposed foreign-managed investment trusts. But the root of the problem is
the shortage of management talent needed to turn round the big, ailing state
enterprises and the shortage of domestic entrepreneurs able and willing to
take on the ownership responsibilities for SOEs.
They would much prefer to found and build up their own small businesses.
This is happening on a large scale throughout the region. The question is
whether they will grow fast enough to allow the withering away of the old
state enterprises to take place painlessly.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (1): Not as easy
as it looks - The fall of communist regimes in eastern Europe has opened the
way for largescale privatisation programmes and the promise of greater
prosperity. That is the theory. The practice is more tangled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DEPRIVATION of property rights was at the heart of communism's destruction
of civil society. So the fall of communist regimes throughout eastern Europe
(and much of Asia) has opened the way for privatisation of state-owned
enterprises and assets on an unprecedented scale. With it has come the
promise of greater prosperity but above all the chance of creating a
property-owning middle class to underpin democracy and guarantee the
irreversibility of the escape from totalitarianism.
At least, that is the theory. The practice is a much more tangled tale. The
earliest attempts at privatisation soon revealed the extent of the Stalinist
system's perverse success in destroying the institutions, habits and above
all the mental processes required for a private enterprise, market system to
function.
With the exception of Czechoslovakia, and to a lesser extent the other east
and central European countries 'liberated' by the Red Army in 1944-45, this
was a poor and relatively underdeveloped part of Europe before the Second
World War. Capitalism existed mostly at a rather primitive and backward
level. But at least the post-war Soviet satellites only endured 45 years of
Soviet control. Vestiges of private enterprise and memories of markets
remained.
However, once inside the former Soviet borders one enters a zone where even
the memory of capitalism had been virtually eclipsed. Where capitalism
survived it was largely as a criminal sub-culture of fixers with vast scope
for mafia-like corruption arising from the party nomenklatura system which
made party, factory and farm bosses little Tsars.
Judged against this background the privatisation process has made
extraordinary strides. But the first pilot scheme largely funded by the UK's
Know-How Fund to privatise selected Polish companies in 1990 showed the
differences between privatising in a capitalist environment and attempting a
similar process in a socialist desert.
The pioneers found this meant operating without an established legal
framework, without functioning banks or stock exchanges - let alone any of
the myriad specialised services such as security printing or financial
advertising.
Since those early days fledgling stock exchanges and other institutions have
been formed and much has been done to create a legal framework, usually
closely based on European Community standards, covering crucial areas such
as property rights, bankruptcy procedures and banking.
At the same time, the vexed question of profit repatriation has been greatly
simplified in the three historically most advanced countries,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, whose currencies are now internally
convertible. Russia is also about to make the rouble internally convertible
as part of its drive to attract foreign equity investment. The eventual
extent of the rouble zone remains unclear as the Baltic states, Ukraine and
other republics are preparing to issue their own currencies.
Uncertainty shrouds the future of Czechoslovakia, with all indicators
pointing to the split up of the federal republic into two separate states
with separate currencies and privatisation plans.
Progress with privatisation and the accompanying legal, institutional and
cultural changes diminishes as one moves further south and east. Recent
World Bank funding for Romania and Bulgaria reflects awareness of the need
to support the privatisation process in the Balkans. Civil war in former
Yugoslavia is destroying the economic as well as political and social
fabric, leaving only Slovenia to press on with privatisation and the
cultivation of its links with Austria and Italy.
One of the main benefits from the privatisation process in eastern Europe
has been the way practical needs have identified the priority areas where
changes are needed to make not only privatisation but economic reform work.
The leading accounting firms, international legal practices and banks have
established offices, often with large staffs, in the cities. Hundreds of
trade sales of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to foreign multinationals have
created a fast-growing core of often highly visible privatised companies
which are both competitors and role models for state-owned enterprises still
awaiting nationalisation.
Cherry picking by the multinationals has underlined one fact - that
relatively few SOEs are really attractive takeover propositions and that
privatisation of the rest is likely to get more difficult as time goes on.
Hence the need for ingenious and unconventional mass privatisation
programmes designed to help create capitalism without capital.
Poland was the pioneer in this. But three changes of government, the
difficulty of retaining experienced staff in an over-bureaucratised
privatisation structure, as well as the blocking powers of an unholy
alliance between communist-era managers and Solidarity-dominated workers
councils, have slowed down the pace.
Political developments in Czechoslovakia threaten to distract attention, at
least in the short term, from a coupon mass privatisation programme, which,
if successful, could well become a model throughout the region, including
Russia.
The political victory scored by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader, in last
month's elections, has underlined the political significance of the
privatisation programme.
He insisted that the first stage of the coupon scheme should be implemented
before the elections. This ensured that 8.5m voters, both Czechs and
Slovaks, went to the polls as owners of vouchers enabling them to acquire
shares in 1,700 SOEs on offer in the biggest and quickest privatisation sale
ever seen. Dismantling the federal structure will ensure that privatisation
in the Czech lands at least will be pursued with renewed vigour. The outlook
for privatisation in a sovereign Slovakia is more problematical.
Slovakia is not the only country whose over-sized, technologically
obsolescent factories are virtually unsellable. There is growing awareness
that a greater effort is required to restructure and improve the management
of those SOEs which cannot be privatised in the short term but which cannot
be allowed to collapse for social and political reasons.
At both government and enterprise level original assumptions about the value
of these assets have been reduced. One management consultant always
introduces his lectures on how to privatise against the background of a
poster reading 'an asset is worth what somebody will pay for it and nothing
else'.
One consequence is that governments, or the various national privatisation
agencies set up by them, have changed their priorities. Privatisation,
especially that involving purchase by foreign investors, is no longer seen
primarily as a means of raising hard currency to bolster inadequate budget
revenues, although that remains an important consideration.
What is looked for is the best commitment to future investment in
restructuring and the biggest transfers of technology, management and
marketing skills. The best deals are those which guarantee both the highest
number of secure jobs and the fastest integration of the newly-privatised
enterprise into the global economy as a hard currency earning asset.
Until now trade sales of the family silver to foreign companies, and auction
sales, or restitution to former owners, of small scale assets such as shops,
restaurants and houses have been the most successful forms of privatisation.
But with many of the best assets privatised, especially in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, and domestic savings low or non-existent, the future will
see greater attention paid to mass privatisation. Nevertheless, governments
will still have to improve the economic performance, or close down, the
industrial monuments to a failed system which can be neither privatised nor
revamped.

FT  03 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on interest
rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONGER yen and lower short-term interest rates spurred hopes of an
imminent easing in monetary policy, and the Nikkei average advanced 2.6 per
cent, gaining for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index rose 432.56 to 16,757.63 on active buying by investment trusts,
pension funds and dealers. It dipped briefly to the day's low of 16,239.76
in early trading on arbitrage-related selling, but climbed steadily in the
afternoon to a high for the day of 16,802.79.
Volume expanded to 350m shares from 219m, with dealers active in speculative
'theme' stocks. Domestic institutions, waiting to take profits, placed
selling orders at higher levels.
Rises overwhelmed falls by 923 to 79, with 78 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks moved ahead 32.71 to 1,291.69, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 6.01 to 1,026.72.
The dollar's fall against the yen, higher bonds and lower short-term
interest rates encouraged dealers. Hopes that a US easing would prompt the
Bank of Japan to cut the official discount rate added to the enthusiasm.
Investors were also comforted by assurances by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, that additional economic measures will be implemented to support
the slumping Japanese economy. During his meeting in Washington with Mr
George Bush, the US president, Mr Miyazawa suggested that an additional
economic support package could be presented this autumn.
Some traders, however, said the market's rebound was technical, as investors
and dealers moved to square short positions ahead of the Munich summit.
'Real demand' by institutional investors remained absent, they added.
High-technology shares with high export ratios rose on the US economic
recovery theme. Ricoh, the most active stock, put on Y29 to Y569, while KOA
jumped Y58 to Y908. Citizen Watch, a speculative favourite, advanced Y37 to
Y896.
Taiyo Fishery forged ahead Y80 to Y461 on reports that the company would
start breeding blue-fin tuna. Nippon Formula Feed, which has announced
similar plans, climbed Y100 to Y772. Aids-related issues were once again
firm on short-term buying by dealers. Meiji Milk Products gained Y8 to Y963
and Morinaga Milk Industry Y10 to Y839.
In Osaka, the OSE average surged 635.51 to 19,449.25 in volume of 12.7m
shares.
Roundup
DOMESTIC factors influenced trading on the Pacific Rim. Kuala Lumpur and
Jakarta were closed for holidays.
HONG KONG ended sharply lower after a day of volatile trading marked by
rumours of a HKDollars 3bn rights issue by Sun Hung Kai Properties. The Hang
Seng index retreated 61.01 to 6,073.74 in turnover of HKDollars 4.51bn,
against HKDollars 4.43bn.
Sun Hung Kai receded HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 34.50 and other property
shares lost ground, Cheung Kong slipping 40 cents to HKDollars 25.80 and
Henderson Land also 40 cents to HKDollars 19.40.
TAIWAN suffered a steep fall as disappointed investors dumped shares on
expectations that the stock transaction tax would not be reduced. The
weighted index finished 69.73, or 1.5 per cent, down at 4,454.08 in turnover
of TDollars 21.37bn, after TDollars 18.45bn.
AUSTRALIA scored its biggest daily rise in seven weeks on hopes of an early
interest rate cut. The All Ordinaries index closed 14.0 higher at 1,661.7.
News Corp led the way, surging 64 cents to ADollars 21.74 in line with
overnight strength in the US market.
Banks fared particularly well. NAB appreciated 11 cents to ADollars 7.89 and
Commonwealth 9 cents to ADollars 7.29. St George, however, Australia's
newest bank, which was listed yesterday, slipped from its ADollars 6.40
listing price to ADollars 6.16, down 22 cents from its last trade on the
unlisted market.
Queensland Cotton, the day's other new stock, closed 47 cents above its
issue price, at ADollars 2.37.
NEW ZEALAND finished at its best level for two weeks on optimistic buying
ahead of the budget speech, due after the close. The NZSE-40 capital index
added 19.35 at 1,541.41 in thin trading.
SEOUL dropped to a 53-month low as South Korea's trade shortfall widened to
Dollars 310m in June, compared with an Dollars 85m surplus a year earlier.
The composite stock index shed 3.70 to 548.28, the lowest level since
February 1988. Turnover decreased to Won154.98bn from Wednesday's
Won189.59bn.
MANILA closed lower for the second day on continued profit-taking. The
composite index declined 10.52 to 1,513.57.

INVESTORS gave a lacklustre welcome to the Stock Exchange of Thailand's
(SET) new afternoon trading session, with turnover reaching only Baht 4.43bn
and the SET index closing 4.51 lower at 746.94.
SET officials say the extended hours - from 10am to 12.30pm and 2.30pm to
4pm - will allow Europeans to pay more attention to Thai stocks because
trading hours now overlap. But foreign interest remains muted following the
violence in May. Dr Asavin Chintakananda, SET executive vice-president,
said: 'We do not expect the volume to increase significantly in the near
future.'
'It hasn't really galvanised investor enthusiasm,' commented a broker,
noting that most foreign investors were institutions who do not follow
Thailand minute-by-minute.
Local speculators, who used to gamble on the market in the morning, and do
other business in the afternoon, were also unenthusiastic.

FT  03 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent dances to a
transatlantic rhythm
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES danced to overseas tunes yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. With
the painful exception of Milan they rose on overnight performance on Wall
Street and in Tokyo, kicked up further on a good start for the Dow
yesterday, then subsided as the Americans took a slightly harder look at
their own problems.
FRANKFURT was strong in the pre-bourse, higher at the close with an apparent
accent on dividend plays, and showed some strength in the afternoon on a
strong bond market before the fall on Wall Street brought prices back again.
Institutional investors were slow to move, but turnover climbed from DM5.5bn
to DM6.5bn as the FAZ index rose 4.41 to 699.74 at midsession, and the DAX
put on 12.35 to 1,768.61 at the close.
The apparent dividend plays were Volkswagen and Mannesmann, up DM102.0 to
DM388.50 and DM9.80 to DM302 at the close. VW went ex a DM11 dividend after
hours and fell to around DM374 in the post-bourse; Mannesmann, which does
not go ex until Monday, held its ground.
However, Ms Barbara Altmann of B Metzler observed that earlier weakness in
VW this week had also been blamed on the dividend - that foreign
shareholders did not want it since a tax credit makes it more valuable to
German shareholders - and said that yesterday's rise was also merited on
yesterday's slightly higher first-half profits, and the prospect of cost
reductions in the second half.
The other headline stock of the day was Deutsche Bank, up DM9.10 to DM706 at
the close, DM709 in the early afternoon on bond price gains and back to
DM704 later as Wall Street took its toll.
PARIS had a volatile day, breaking above 1,900 momentarily on news of a cut
in US interest rates which sent the bond market sharply higher. But Wall
Street's equally fast drop sent share prices spiralling down by the close.
The CAC 40 index closed 7.40 lower at 1,873.52 in improved turnover of
FFr2.96bn.
Generale des Eaux was the most active issue of the day, rising FFr14 to
FFr2,229 in 290,480 shares. A block of 200,000 shares was crossed at
FFr2,190. Elf, ex dividend, dropped a net FFr8.60 to FFr351.50.
Paribas gained FFr5 to FFr349.90 on news that it would make a profit from
the sale of its stake in Matra Communication.
The luxury goods group, LVMH, continued to fall, losing FFr18 to FFr3,761,
as investors were worried about the gloomy outlook for the industry.
MILAN continued to slide as domestic investors continued to sell, worried by
the weakness in the bond market and by growing currency devaluation fears.
Dealers also reported residual foreign selling, and spoke of a 'crisis of
confidence' in the stock market. The Comit index fell 6.24 to 444.51, its
lowest since February 1988, in turnover estimated at L90bn after L99.3bn.
Fiat dropped L125 to L5,090 at its official close and fell to L5,045 later
on. Italgas lost L3 to L2,799 in spite of notes from several brokers
reassuring investors that gas supplies from Algeria were unlikely to be
disrupted. The stock sank to L2,765 later.
ZURICH rose on active demand for chemicals, and insurers on hopes that Swiss
interest rates would follow those in the US. The SMI index closed 9.3 higher
at 1,854.6.
Ciba-Geigy led the active list on foreign buying, the bearers rising SFr14
to SFr679; Roche certificates added SFr30 to SFr3,370. Insurers were led
higher by Zurich certificates, SFr21 firmer at SFr874.
AMSTERDAM was unable to resist the downward pressure coming from Wall Street
and surrendered most of its early gains. The CBS Tendency index closed up
0.2 at 122.8.
The brewer Heineken was the day's best gainer, closing Fl 1.40 ahead at Fl
168.70 but volume was thin.
MADRID held on to close 0.60 higher at 236.05. Constructions stayed weak
according to Mr Peter McGahan of Schroder Securities, banks offered a little
encouragement with both rises and falls, and the mainstay was Telefonica
which ended Pta25 better at Pta1,090.
Asturiana Del Zinc was quoted Pta275 higher at Pta2,125 after Wednesday's
apparent Pta800 fall, but Mr McGahan said that the latter move was due to
the company going ex-rights.
STOCKHOLM decided that it was technically oversold and the Affarsvarlden
General index rose 10.5 to 917.4 after several days of decline in low
turnover and waning interest.
Skandia, the insurer, a poor performer in the first six months of this year,
recovered SKr4.50 to SKr103, compared with Monday's low of SKr94, on rumours
of an imminent solution to the prolonged issue of the Norwegian company,
Uni-Storebrand's stake in the Swedish company.
OSLO slipped to a new 1992 low, depressed by continued concern about
interest rates in Norway and weak corporate earnings. The all-share index
fell 2.7 to 393.2 in turnover of NKr174m. Uni Storebrand A shares remained
weak, losing NKr1 to NKr30.
ISTANBUL slumped in heavy profit-taking after eight days of gains which
brought the index close to its five-month high. The 75-share index ended at
4,244.66, down 197.94.

Base metals ended a generally active LME session mixed, with NICKEL below
earlier four-month highs. Dealers said three-month nickel's early advance to
a peak of Dollars 7,700 a tonne was largely made on speculative buying once
a move through Dollars 7,600 triggered buy-stops. COPPER closed at its
highs, aided by news that a strike could start at Poland's KGHM combine on
July 20. This helped the market to shrug off overnight news that Asarco had
settled with its unions. Comex copper contracts were setting successive
lifetime highs following the cut in US interest rates. This sparked
speculation that the US economy might soon recover. London's robusta COFFEE
futures gained up to Dollars 28 on fund buying, while COCOA made small
losses as the recent rally ran out of steam. 'Coffee has potential for more
upside, but don't expect it to go anywhere in a hurry,' one trader said.
'Then again, I suppose Dollars 20-odd is almost a rally in London.' New York
raw SUGAR futures were firm at midday as short covering ahead of the US
Independence Day holiday continued to underpin prices. Traders cited
sentiment that the price drop of the last two sessions might have been
overdone.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan in forefront of CIS
energy rush - Neil Buckley and Haig Simonian explain the republic's appeal
to foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS WESTERN oil companies stream into the former Soviet Union in search of
reserves, two significant deals in less than two months have propelled the
central Asian republic of Kazakhstan to the forefront when it comes to
attracting foreign investment.
Chevron, the fourth largest oil company in the US, finalised an agreement in
May to develop Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield, with recoverable reserves
estimated at between 6bn and 9bn barrels of oil, ranking it alongside some
of the bigger fields in Saudi Arabia. The deal is worth Dollars 1.5bn over
the next three years, and could be worth as much as Dollars 20bn over the
expected 40-year life of the field.
This week, British Gas and Agip, the Italian state oil company, won
exclusive negotiating rights to develop the Karachaganak field, with 20
trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas, and another 2bn barrels of oil
and condensate. It beat competition from a consortium of BP and Statoil, the
Norwegian state-owned oil company, and hopes to reach final agreement by
next summer on a deal involving Dollars 6bn investment in the first ten
years.
The former Soviet Union, with the biggest gas reserves and among the biggest
oil reserves in the world, has become a magnet for oil companies seeking to
improve their reserves/production ratios.
Deals have been few, however. Fears about political instability, the
remoteness and difficulty of developing reserves in some regions, and
sometimes their sheer size - as well as local bureaucracies unaccustomed to
doing business with western companies - have all played their part in
limiting the number of agreements signed.
Kazakhstan has been conspicuously successful, partly due to its sizeable
reserves and the fact that these are within reach of Europe. But Mr Robert
Gray, country manager for the former Soviet republics at JP Morgan, who
advised on Chevron's Tengiz deal, also points to the influence of Mr
Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president.
'Mr Nazarbayev is genuinely committed to economic reform and attracting
western capital. The political system is also relatively simple, with muted
opposition,' Mr Gray says.
Mr Nazarbayev has exerted a personal influence on the Tengiz negotiations,
through Mr Kalyk Abdulayev, deputy prime minister and head of the republic's
economics committee, who heads the Kazakh negotiating team. The president
himself signed the final agreement with Mr Kenneth Derr, Chevron chairman,
in Washington.
The break-up of the Soviet Union has also helped disengage the brakes.
'Previously you had to negotiate with a production enterprise, a local
government, a republican government, and the Soviet government. Now the
Soviet ministry layer has been removed, and the republican governments tend
to have a more direct line to the enterprises,' Mr Gray says.
The Karachaganak deal is a good example of the potential benefits to all
parties of deals with the former Soviet republics.
Kazakhstan is set to become an important oil and gas exporter by the end of
the century. While staffing levels are not yet certain, the development will
provide employment, as well as housing and other facilities, for Kazakhs.
British Gas says the deal will double its worldwide reserves. Moreover, it
will play an important part in achieving the stated aim of Mr Robert Evans,
chairman and chief executive, of increasing the proportion of total earnings
coming from exploration and production from 15 per cent to 40 per cent by
the year 2000.
This will reduce the company's reliance on its UK marketing operations,
where it must surrender 50 per cent of its share of the industrial market by
1995 and may face competition in the household market as early as next year.
Karachaganak may also help dispel the doubts of analysts who have been
looking for proof that British Gas can achieve the growth it is looking for
in exploration and production.
BG says it regards Karachaganak as a low-risk development, and pipeline
infrastructure already exists that would allow the export of both oil and
gas to Europe, although some new construction may be necessary. At its peak,
the field should produce 2bn cu ft of gas a day - similar to the UK's
biggest gas field at Morecambe Bay, and 200,000 barrels of oil. The contract
could last for 60 years.
The deal also has profound implications for Italy, which relies heavily on
oil and natural gas imports, and where the government has since the early
1970s been promoting the use of natural gas over oil for both household
consumption and electricity generation.
Natural gas accounts for about 26 per cent of Italy's total energy needs,
compared with a European average of 16 per cent. Italian usage has been
reinforced by the 1987 referendum vote blocking the nuclear programme.
Having risen from just 9 per cent in 1970, the share of gas in overall
energy consumption should reach around 33 per cent by the end of this
century.
The country has been keen to diversify its gas supplies, currently running
at about 50bn cu m a year. About 60 per cent of supplies come from Algeria
and Russia, with Holland accounting for a further 19 per cent.
At a press conference in Rome, Mr Gabriele Caglieri, chairman of the state
owned ENI energy and chemicals group, which owns Agip, said Karachaganak
alone could meet Italy's current consumption for 11 years. The field will
increase ENI's oil and gas reserves by 50 per cent.
'It is the most important contract ever signed between ourselves and another
country,' said Mr Caglieri.
He stressed that the estimates for the field's reserves probably represented
a minimum, based on current extraction technology, and could be revised
upwards in the light of technological advances.
With a population of about 17m and rich reserves of oil and gas, as well as
gold, silver, copper, lead and chromium, some observers say it may not be
too much of an exaggeration to suggest that Kazakhstan could become the
Saudi Arabia of central Asia.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nervous platinum market climbs
to 13-month high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLATINUM price yesterday continued the rise prompted by renewed
political tension in South Africa, which accounts for about 70 per cent of
world production. Platinum's performance and an unexpected cut in the US
discount rate helped push gold through an important technical resistance
point, Dollars 345 a troy ounce.
Since Monday, fears about possible strikes at the South African mines have
lifted platinum in London by Dollars 20.65 an ounce or nearly 6 per cent.
Yesterday the metal closed in London up another Dollars 3.90 an ounce at
Dollars 387.90, its highest level since May last year. On the New York
Commodity Exchange (Nymex) July platinum reached Dollars 400 an ounce
yesterday morning.
Analysts suggested a South African miners' strike was unlikely but it was
too risky to go short of platinum during the present rally. Platinum in the
past has moved up Dollars 50 to Dollars 100 an ounce in a matter of weeks,
they pointed out.
Mr Jeremy Coombes, analyst at Johnson Matthey, the world's largest platinum
marketing organisation, said that platinum might move to Dollars 400 an
ounce more quickly than he previously expected and a sustained move above
Dollars 400 could trigger renewed interest by US investors. However, Mr Andy
Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, suggested the market was not
taking account of weakening Japanese economic activity.

decision

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMINCO HAS again put off a decision on the future of its troubled lead
smelter at Trail, British Columbia, to give the German engineering group
Lurgi more time to correct flaws in the plant.
At the same time, the Vancouver-based base metals producer disclosed that
should it abandon Lurgi's QSL technology, the most likely alternative is the
Kivcet process used by smelters in Italy and Kazakhstan.
Earlier this year, Cominco retained Snamprogetti of Italy to prepare
engineering and cost estimates for converting the facility to the Kivcet
process. Cominco said it is now considering commercial-scale tests at the
Kazakhstan smelter. It expects to decide either late this year or in early
1993 whether to persevere with the QSL system or convert the Trail smelter
to the Kivcet process.
The CDollars 135m (Pounds 60m) Trail plant, designed to produce 160,000 lb
of lead a year, was shut down less than three months after being
commissioned in December 1990. The main problem has been in the reduction
chamber of the 40-metre long reactor, where natural gas has replaced
pulverised coal as the reducing agent. Lead operations have continued using
the old, high-cost smelter that the QSL facility was designed to replace.
Production totalled just over 87,000 tonnes last year.
Lurgi remains confident that the QSL process, with some modifications, is
suitable for Trail. Cominco says however, that it remains concerned about
'the rate at which the plant would have to be driven to achieve the
production required by Trail'.
The Canadian company has set up a committee of independent directors to
consider the legal ramifications if the QSL smelter cannot be started
satisfactorily.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Study dents gold price hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES THAT a fall in production from the world's mines will help to
stimulate a revival in the price of gold are dented by the latest study from
the Gold Institute, an international trade association based in Washington.
This shows the gold industry is forecasting that production world-wide will
increase by nearly 5.5 per cent from 67.254m troy ounces last year to
70.929m in 1995.
While a substantial fall in output in South Africa, the biggest gold
producer, is predicted during this period - by 6.5 per cent from 19.224m
ounces to 17.972m ounces - this is more than compensated for by dramatic
growth in other countries such as Chile, China, Ghana, Guyana and the
Philippines.
The study, covering the 68 countries in which mine or expect to mine gold,
was produced with the help of 235 mining entities which supplied the
Institute with their reports and projections.
The institute cautions, however, that 'earthquakes, floods, accidents,
strikes or unexpected declines in market prices will cause the actual
production to be less than the projections'.
It also points out that countries outside the former eastern bloc expect
annual gold output to rise by only 1.3 per cent a year on average for the
next four years compared with an average of 8 per cent in the past ten
years.
One assumption made by the study that will cause some debate is that annual
gold production from the Commonwealth of Industrial States, the world's
third-largest producer, will remain constant until 1995 at 7.78m ounces.
It suggests that China's gold output will rise by 21.5 per cent, from 3.537m
ounces last year to 4.299m in 1995. Other predicted substantial increases
over the period are in Chile, up 39 per cent to 1.286m ounces in 1995; the
Philippines, up 38 per cent to 1.187m ounces and Ghana, up 97 per cent to
1.234m ounces.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese slump leads to
European job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading securities houses, hurt by the domestic stock market slump
and the sharp decline in underwriting business, have been discreetly
reducing personnel at their European operations.
In the latest of the moves, Daiwa Securities is considering local staff cuts
at its Swiss subsidiary and a reorganisation of its warrant trading desk in
London. This follows personnel reductions at European operations of other
three leading brokers, Nomura Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi
Securities.
The sharp fall in overseas underwriting by Japanese companies, together with
the fall of the Tokyo market, has prompted Japanese houses to refocus on
their domestic operations.
Over the past few months, Nomura has cut some 20 of its local staff at its
Swiss operations, Yamaichi and Nikko have reduced Japanese staff at their
London subsidiaries.
Cost-cutting at the Japanese brokers' European operations has been prompted
by the plunge in overseas equity-linked financing by Japanese companies. Due
to the sharp falls in the Tokyo stock market, overseas equity-linked bonds
issued the year ended last March fell 56 per cent from two years ago, to
Y4,215.7bn (Dollars 33.7bn)
Nikko said its overseas Japanese personnel had been reduced since its
domestic operations needed to be strengthened. Nomura said a further 10 per
cent in costs would be cut at its Swiss subsidiaries, including
rationalisation of back office operations at its Geneva, Basle and Zurich
operations.
Japan Securities Dealers Association has ordered Daiwa Securities and Cosmo
Securities to pay penalties for illegal tobashi deals (the shuffling of
stocks from account to account to avoid the booking of losses), Reuter
reports. Daiwa is to pay Y10m and Cosmo Y5m by July 10.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Turbulent conditions keep new issue
business on hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURBULENT conditions following yesterday's cut in US interest rates kept
most potential issuers away from the international bond market yesterday.
However, syndicate officials predicted a flurry of Eurodollar bond issues
next week as borrowers moved to lock into lower dollar interest rates.
The next major issuer is likely to be the World Bank, which is preparing to
launch its seventh global bond issue. The bank's financial year ended this
week, enabling the supra-national lending agency to start a fresh borrowing
programme. It has raised Dollars 9.5bn from global bond issues - which can
be traded in both domestic and international markets - since the first deal
was launched in September 1989.
An issue of at least Dollars 1.5bn is expected, although the maturity and
pricing of the deal have yet to be decided. Most firms were expecting a
five-year issue, priced to yield 5 to 7 basis points over US treasury bonds.
However, if the US bond market continues to rally the World Bank may opt for
a 10-year issue.
One negative factor is the persistent weakness of the US currency on the
foreign exchange markets. Yesterday, the dollar stabilised at around DM1.52,
from DM1.68 in March, but remains vulnerable to further decline. Some
currency analysts are predicting the dollar will fall towards DM1.45 and its
lowest ever levels.
Elsewhere, Volkswagen launched a DM400m five-year issue wholly underwritten
by Commerzbank. The issue continues the recent heavy supply in the Euro
D-Mark sector. In the first six months of the year, borrowers raised Dollars
14.8bn equivalent by issuing D-Mark Eurobonds, up from Dollars 9bn in the
first half of 1991.
Yesterday's issue was considered fair value by other banks but likely to
appeal mainly to domestic investors. From an issue price of 100.05, the
bonds traded down to 99.50 bid, comfortably inside fees. At this level the
bonds yield 42 basis points more than German government paper of the same
maturity.
Overseas demand for D-Mark bonds remains buoyant, but it is unclear whether
Eurobonds will be affected by the introduction of withholding tax in
Germany. Yesterday, a cross-party committee met to draw up new proposals for
the re-introduction of the tax.
Electricite de France, the state-owned utility, had yesterday received 71.8
per cent take-up of its offer to buy back three sterling bond issues,
according to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, purchase agent for the transaction.
On Wednesday, the company offered to buy back three bond issues: Pounds 75m
12 1/2 per cent bonds maturing 2008; Pounds 75m 11 3/4 per cent bonds
maturing 2009/2012; and Pounds 100m 10 1/2 per cent bonds maturing 2009.
Each of the issues is trading significantly above par redemption value. The
2008 paper was trading earlier this week at 125 per cent of face value.
Investors are offered higher prices under the buy-back offer, since EDF is
buying back bonds at a yield spread of 15 basis points over UK government
paper. In the secondary market the bonds were trading at a yield spread of
30 to 40 basis points.
Banca Commerciale Italiana yesterday launched a Dollars 200m 15-year
subordinated issue in the US bond market. The deal, lead-managed by Lehman
Brothers, was priced to yield 116 basis points more than US Treasury bonds
of the same maturity.

HUNGARY has established a foreign exchange, ending the central bank's
official mono-poly and underpinning progress towards currency
convertibility.
Commercial banks begin foreign exchange trading among themselves this month,
freed of the obligation to sell hard currency to the state and to stick
precisely to the official exchange rate. With liberalisation, the banks have
also gained the right to make forward and swap deals.
However, the new interbank foreign exchange market exists within tight
contraints.
Exchange rate movements are restricted to within a narrow band of 0.25 per
cent either side of a fixed central rate. This may later broaden to 2.25 per
cent.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Managed funds industry seeks
its freedom - Barbara Durr on the US sector's efforts to have speculative
position limits removed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US managed futures industry is winning important ground in its battle to
persuade the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the futures
industry watchdog, to raise or eliminate altogether speculative position
limits.
The CFTC has given permission for the Chicago Board of Trade to remove
position limits on 30-year Treasury bonds and five and 10-year Treasury
notes, three of its most heavily traded financial contracts.
Since the commission's decision mirrors a similar ruling earlier this year
allowing the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to end position limits on a clutch
of currency contracts, the two moves mark an increasing accommodation of the
influential funds.
They also set the stage for a far more controversial step by the CFTC. The
exchange is now considering raising position limits on a number of
agricultural contracts, such as wheat, maize, soyabeans and cotton.
Speculative position limits are caps on the trading positions held by
participants who do not produce or use the underlying commodity and are
therefore considered speculators. They are meant to prevent price
manipulations, such as cornering and squeezing the market, as well as excess
volatility.
Managed futures, which in the past decade have gone from nowhere to
everywhere, have an estimated Dollars 21bn under management. They have long
pressed the CFTC and the US futures exchanges to either raise or eliminate
position limits.
They argue that position limits have pushed US traders overseas to foreign
futures markets where no such constraints exist. Some of the largest managed
funds place as much as 70 per cent of their money outside the US.
Spurred by the loss of business to foreign exchanges, the CFTC is reviewing
its stance on speculative position limits generally. So far, it has been
willing to act relatively quickly to remove position limits on financial
futures. These have always been relatively high, but the commission
concluded that they were unnecessary in contracts where the underlying
products - major foreign currencies and Treasury bonds, for example -
enjoyed deep, liquid and efficient markets.
CFTC officials said that two criteria have guided their decisions on the
cases so far: that the supply of the underlying products was adequate and
manipulations, and that traders conducted ample arbitrage between the
futures and the liquid cash instrument markets.
Managed funds, while happy that limits have been stripped from key financial
futures contracts, are especially eager to see position limits lifted on
traditional physical commodities.
According to Mr Peter Matthews, a partner in Mint Investment Management
Company, some of the industry's fattest returns have been in agricultural
contracts. Agricultural markets tend to be less efficient with wider bid-ask
spreads than financial futures markets.
Thus, when an agricultural future moves and a trader has the right position
it can yield big profits. As funds hit their position limits in agricultural
markets, however, they must move to financial futures, where the returns are
slimmer.
Fund managers contend that position limits restrict a fund's ability to
diversify so its performance is impaired. They claim that a smaller presence
of physical commodities in a trading portfolio reduces its value as an
inflation hedge.
Mr Morton Baratz, editor of Managed Account Reports, the specialised
industry newsletter, says that position limits affect managed funds as they
grow larger, particularly after they pass the Dollars 200m mark.
The stickiest issue for raising agricultural position limits is that there
is a finite supply of deliverable commodities for these futures (whereas
financial futures are generally cash settled).
The farm lobby is opposed to the CFTC's proposal to raise the limits on
agricultural contracts because they contend that this could subject farmers
and agricultural product distributors - who hedge their exposure - to
damaging price fluctuations as large funds pile in or out of a commodity.
The American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest US general farm
organisation, is also concerned that any change of limits could lead to
market manipulation by floor traders and brokers.
In order to handle large orders by funds, local traders might form alliances
with brokers who would be dividing up such orders, it said. They then may
lose interest in servicing small orders typical of many hedgers. This could
mean hedgers facing an increased bid-ask spread to entice broker groups to
execute them.
The CFTC has taken these concerns on board. But it says the last increase
(in 1987) in limits on agricultural products went smoothly. There was no
increase in volatility while the higher limits helped boost trading volume
and made the markets more liquid.
The period for public comment on the CFTC's April proposal on agricultural
position limits ran out on June 12 but was extended by 45 days to allow a
wider study of the proposal.
Ironically, it has historically been hedgers - not speculators - that have
been responsible for big squeezes and other market manipulations. Such ploys
are harder to execute with today's more sophisticated market surveillance
systems.
These factors aside, the combined forces of the managed funds industry and
the exchanges themselves - which sorely want the managed funds' business -
will continue to argue vehemently for greater regulatory accommodation.
Trading volume at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose 25 per cent to top
66.7m contracts in the first six months of 1992. CME futures trading rose 23
per cent while options recorded a jump of 33 per cent. Interest rate
products, including futures and options on Eurodollars, one month Libor and
90-day Treasury bills, set the pace with an increase of 69.6 per cent.
Agricultural contracts volume fell by 3 per cent.
Trading volume at the Chicago Board of Trade also rose but by a more modest
8.4 per cent during the half year. Trading of futures and options contracts
totalled 75.4m for the six months, up from from 69.7m a year ago.
The CBOT's largest contract, the 30-year Treasury bond, has been relatively
quiet, but trading in shorter maturity Treasury contracts rose
substantially. Futures volume on 10-year Treasury notes jumped 52 per cent
and options on the same rose by 169 per cent.
Futures on five-year Treasury notes rose 103 per cent, and options on the
five-year notes jumped 314 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for effective control of Foster's Brewing group, the
Melbourne-based international beermaker, is heading for the courts.
This emerged yesterday when the National Mutual Life Association (NML),
Australia's second-biggest institution, launched a court challenge to the
appointment last month of receivers to International Brewing Investments
(IBI), the Foster's group's main shareholder.
In the Victoria Supreme Court, NML claimed the appointment, made by BHP on
June 2, was unlawful and injurious to NML.
NML's action followed a request from Wardley Australia for payment by NML of
more than ADollars 105m (USDollars 78.9m) under standby commitments which
formed part of IBI's financing. The standby, known as the CLIF agreement,
also involves the HongKong Bank.
Wardley Australia manages the CLIF agreement on behalf of a group of banks
known as the Vextin syndicate, owed ADollars 1.2bn by IBI, with security
ranking ahead of BHP.
The moves are seen as the beginning of manoeuvring by IBI's creditors to
improve their position ahead of any asset sales by a receiver.
BHP has been negotiating since it appointed receivers to IBI to buy out the
Vextin syndicate. But speculation has increased that Vextin may opt to
appoint its own receivers. Yesterday's events threaten to further impede
already slow attempts to resolve the IBI/Foster's situation.
Both HongKong Bank, on behalf of the Vextin syndicate, and BHP said last
night they would vigorously defend the NML action which they described as
erroneous and without substance.
The action raises the possibility that IBI, controlled by Melbourne
businessman Mr John Elliott, could yet emerge from receivership.

SUN Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's largest property developers,
raised HKDollars 3.3bn (USDollars 426m) after expenses from a share
placement yesterday, to help fund the group's aggressive expansion into the
China property market, writes Simon Davies.
The group is one of Hong Kong's most conservative property developers, but
it has recently signed up a number of projects in neighbouring Guangdong
Province, after focusing on residential projects in the colony's New
Territories.
The company is also involved in a HKDollars 2bn commercial development in
central Beijing, and is examining some large infrastructural projects in the
Pearl River delta.
Sun Hung Kai's shares have risen 50 per cent this year. The company issued
100m new shares at HKDollars 33.25 per share.

television plan

<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government yesterday announced minor concessions to all three
leading groups battling for the right to offer more television to the masses
when it approved a new framework for television broadcasting in the colony.
The decision ends more than two years of confusion over the future of cable
and satellite television in Hong Kong. The three groups involved, Mr Li
Ka-shing's Star Television, the late Sir YK Pao's Wharf group and Sir Run
Run Shaw's Television Broadcasts (TVB), welcomed the fact that a decision
had finally been made; but all three had hoped for more.
Under the new proposals, Hong Kong should finally receive cable television
in the fourth quarter of 1993, four years after the licence was first handed
out to a consortium led by Wharf. The consortium folded in 1990, amid
internal squabbling and complaints about the government's policy on
satellite broadcasting.
A two-year government review followed. Wharf appears favourite to win the
latest licence, which will be awarded in January 1993. The government has
said preference would be given to consortia offering the fixed-fibre optic
cable system, which Wharf has strongly supported.
This enables the operator to provide value-added telecommunications services
such as home banking, in addition to television. The winning cable operator
will have a three-year 'exclusive' licence, after which it will be open to
unlimited competition.
Regional satellite broadcaster Star, 50 per cent owned by Hutchison Whampoa
and 50 per cent by the Li family, won some concessions after an aggressive
campaign to reverse a five-year ban on Cantonese broadcasting and
subscription income. With a population that is around 98 per cent Chinese,
the appeal of English language broadcasting is clearly limited in Hong Kong.
From October 1993, Star will be able to transmit three of its existing five
channels in Cantonese. From the same date, it will be able to levy
subscription on new channels, but these must remain non-Cantonese during the
cable operator's three-year exclusivity period.
Star described the government decision as 'a good way forward', but Wharf
was extremely guarded, expressing concern over the development of a
subscription satellite service. Wharf director Mr Stephen Ng said there was
only room for one pay television operator in Hong Kong.
TVB, the largest of Hong Kong's two existing broadcasters, claimed the
government decision failed 'to create a true 'level playing field' for all
operators in the industry'.
The government decided TVB should be allowed to bid for the cable licence,
though it would be unlikely to win. The television station's royalty
payments will be reduced and some advertising restrictions removed, but the
operating environment is going to become much more competitive.

<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong Committee on Takeovers and Mergers yesterday publicly censured
four former directors of Paladin, a listed property company, for failing to
disclose to shareholders sensitive financial information concerning bid
target New Zealand Equities (NZE).
NZE was acquired by Paladin in 1989 and went into receivership seven months
later. Paladin advisers Schroders Asia and Richards Butler were not
censured, but the report was highly critical of their actions.
Schroders is facing a HKDollars 101m (USDollars 13.06m) lawsuit from
Paladin, claiming damages for its role as financial adviser to its former
directors. Those censured yesterday were Mr Anthony Van der Linden, Mr Peter
Francis, Mr Avon Carpenter and Mr Peter Fredricson.
Messrs Francis and Van der Linden have already been censured by the
committee for acting in concert to consolidate control of Paladin; they have
also been banned from taking directorships in Hong Kong listed companies.
Schroders was also accused of breaching the code, while the report said
Richards Butler was not 'blameless' in a further breach. Schroders said the
committee's comments on its role were 'entirely unjustified'.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Toshiba, IBM share 'flash'
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, is making a bid to recapture
leadership in one of the hottest new products in the electronics industry -
'flash' memory devices - by means of a technology-sharing agreement with
IBM.
Toshiba invented flash memory - which stores electronic information in a
semiconductor chip even when power is switched off - in 1986. But Intel, the
leading US semiconductor maker, captured 85 per cent of the market by
designing a product that was simpler to manufacture and cheaper than the
original Toshiba design.
The agreement, announced yesterday, pits a Toshiba-IBM partnership against
an alliance between Intel and Sharp, the Japanese electronics group,
announced earlier this year.
At stake is a market which Dataquest expects to be worth Dollars 1.5bn by
1995, compared with about Dollars 130m today, and which should continue
growing rapidly afterward. Flash memory cards - about the size of a credit
card - will start replacing small disc drives in portable computers this
year. They store data just like a hard disc, but since they are solid state,
they contain no moving parts.
Flash memory cards use less electricity and are much lighter, making them
ideal for portable uses. They allow almost instant access to data, thus
eliminating the delay when computers have to go back to the disc to retrieve
information.
Flash memory also poses a threat to some parts of the market for dynamic
random access memory chips since they process information in a similar way
to D-Ram chips, at slightly slower speeds. Unlike the D-Ram chip flash does
not lose what it is working on when the power goes down.
The Toshiba Nand (no-and internal logic) technology has always in theory
been better than Intel's Nor (no-or) circuit design. Nand allows manufacture
of a smaller, more highly integrated chip that is more powerful than the Nor
technology.
Nand chips also use five volts for both erase and write functions, while the
Intel designs requires two voltages, 12 and five volts, making them more
power-hungry.
Intel, however, says its chip has succeeded in the market because the
Toshiba design required more complex external control circuitry which
eliminated the theoretical advantages of the basic chip.
Toshiba is hoping to overcome this obstacle by means of the link with IBM.
Toshiba has agreed to share its flash memory technology with IBM, while IBM
will share technology under development for a controller device allowing
high-speed read and write operations. The two will separately manufacture
and market the devices.
IBM's decision to link with Toshiba is a powerful vote of confidence in the
basic technology.
Intel joined forces with Sharp earlier this year for two reasons. First, the
Japanese company had the technology and the resources to develop and
manufacture the next generation of more powerful flash devices. Second,
Sharp had the experience, which Intel lacked, in the consumer market with
devices like electronic diaries, portable computers, and audio-visual
equipment.
By the time the IBM/Toshiba alliance results in new products - probably a
matter of years from now - Intel and Sharp hope to have already created a
large enough demand for their own product to allow for cheap, mass
production.

46m charge

<TEXT>
BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third-biggest pharmaceuticals company, is
to take a pre-tax charge of Dollars 46m in the second quarter following its
agreement to settle an anti-trust lawsuit involving claims that the company
conspired to rig the prices of infant formula.
The company's Indiana-based Mead Johnson division, which makes the infant
formula, yesterday denied the charges, but said it had agreed to pay Dollars
38.76m to settle a class action lawsuit brought by wholesale and retail
distributors who made the accusations about price rigging.
The decision to settle was made in order to avoid the burden and expense of
protracted litigation, the company said.
The Dollars 46m pre-tax charge will include the amount being paid to settle
the lawsuit as well as the estimated value of donating infant formula to a
US government agency as part of a separate settlement agreed last month with
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
The FTC had charged Bristol-Myers and two other infant formula makers -
Abbott Laboratories and American Home Products - with price rigging and
other improper trading practices.
All three companies denied any wrongdoing, but American Home Products and
Bristol-Myers agreed to settle, while Abbott said it would contest the
charges.
Yesterday, Bristol-Myers shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 65 7/8 .

<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF, the state-owned French defence group, is reportedly close to
withdrawing its Dollars 300m bid for the missile operations of US steel
group LTV in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the US government from blocking
the deal.
The French group is expected to shelve its bid temporarily to give itself
more time to find a US partner willing to run the missile company on its
behalf. Thomson hopes that such an arrangement, which would leave it as only
a passive investor in the missile operation, will assuage US fears that
foreign ownership of a key US arms contractor compromises national security.
Three US companies - Northrop, Loral and Raytheon - have been approached as
possible partners for Thomson, but none have so far agreed to join the
acquisition.
Thomson has had to move quickly because a high-level US government committee
set up to review the deal is believed ready to recommend to President George
Bush on Monday that the acquisition be blocked on security grounds.
The committee met for the final time earlier this week, and sources in
Washington said yesterday that it was highly unlikely that Thomson would be
able to clinch a deal with a US partner in time to persuade the committee to
reverse its recommendation.
Congressmen and US defence chiefs have let the committee know their concern
about allowing LTV's missiles operations to fall into the hands of a company
controlled by a foreign government. Thomson is 58 per cent owned by the
French state.
The committee has also looked into allegations that the French group broke
US and French export laws when selling arms to Iraq during the 1980s. Only
yesterday, the US Customs confirmed it was investigating whether export laws
were violated in a 1985 sale of Thomson lasers to Iraq. Thomson denies ever
breaking US or French export laws.
Although Thomson's withdrawal of its bid would only be temporary, the latest
development has cast a shadow over LTV's attempts to sell its assets and
emerge from six years of bankruptcy proceedings. Two months ago, a New York
bankruptcy court gave Thomson the right to buy LTV's missiles unit over a
rival, but higher, joint bid by Martin Marietta and Lockheed.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PORTION of dividends paid by companies in which Olympia &amp; York is a
shareholder will be set aside to help the ailing property developer fund its
restructuring costs, a Toronto court was told yesterday.
O&amp;Y also said the company expected to finalise audited accounts for the
fiscal year ended last January within the next day or two. They are expected
to include a write-down of at least CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) on the
value of its real estate holdings.
The allocation of general, administrative and restructuring (GAR) expenses
among the lenders and the Reichmann family which owns O&amp;Y has been the focal
point of creditors' attention in recent weeks. These costs have totalled
about CDollars 9m since O&amp;Y filed for court protection in Canada in May.
Under proposals filed by O&amp;Y and its creditors, about CDollars 5m in
dividends due from the newsprint maker Abitibi-Price this month will be used
for O&amp;Y's general, administrative and restructuring costs. O&amp;Y owns 82 per
cent of Abitibi's shares. A contribution may also be made by Carena, a
Canadian property group in which O&amp;Y holds a minority stake. Carena's main
subsidiary is Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded property
developer.
O&amp;Y's shares in Abitibi, Carena and in Gulf Canada Resources, which last
week halted dividend payments, are pledged as collateral on some of its
CDollars 13.5bn debt.
An O&amp;Y lawyer said in an interview that the company's reliance on dividend
income for its restructuring should have no impact on the dividend policies
of Abitibi, Gulf Canada and Carena. O&amp;Y estimates that its dividend income
this month alone will be be CDollars 15 to CDollars 18m, several times more
than its GAR requirements.
Lenders to specific O&amp;Y projects and holders of marketable securities have
so far paid the bulk of the restructuring costs. Part of the costs to be
incurred over the next few months will also be met through sales of about
CDollars 70m worth of unencumbered assets, such as parcels of land and the
corporate jet.
Mr Steven Sharpe, an O&amp;Y lawyer, told the court yesterday that the company
was anxious to put the GAR issue behind it so that it could have 'some quiet
uninterrupted time' to negotiate its debt restructuring proposals which are
due to be presented to lenders by mid-July.

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK is poised to abandon its role in the sprawling Yerba Buena
commercial property development in San Francisco after defaulting on a
crucial Dollars 2m payment that was due this week.
In a separate development, Lazard Freres, the New York investment bank, was
hired yesterday by O&amp;Y's US subsidiary to try to raise capital for the
Canadian group's US operations.
The San Francisco project was originally supposed to be O&amp;Y's next big
showcase, involving a Dollars 1bn investment in three office blocks with
1.5m sq ft of space plus an entertainment complex.
Six months ago, the troubled Canadian developer lost its rights to all but
one of the office blocks because of missed payments.
According to the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency (SFRA), O&amp;Y has been
given until the close of business next Tuesday to make good its Dollars 2m
payment toward the purchase of land or lose all its rights as the developer
of the site.
The 750,000 sq ft office block that would be abandoned would have involved
an investment of around Dollars 250m.
Mr Edward Helfeld, director of the SFRA, said that if O&amp;Y failed to pay the
Dollars 2m by next week his agency would collect a Dollars 4.4m letter of
credit that is being held in escrow in New York.
He said O&amp;Y could also forfeit the Dollars 20m of instalment payments it has
made to the San Francisco agency since 1990 on the site.
'I find it very difficult to understand why they don't pay us the Dollars
2m, keep their rights and get another developer to take over the project,'
said Mr Helfeld.
O&amp;Y in New York said it believed the company would not make the Dollars 2m
payment. 'The company is conserving cash and it is highly unlikely that we
will make that payment,' a spokesman commented.
The San Francisco default is not expected to force O&amp;Y's US subsidiary into
a bankruptcy filing.
The US subsidiary, which is holding debt restructuring talks with its
creditors and is hoping to sell up to a dozen US office buildings to raise
cash, has thus far avoided having to seek protection from creditors in a
bankruptcy filing.
Lazard Freres said its O&amp;Y team in the US would be led by Mr Felix Rohatyn.
Mr Rohatyn who worked closely in the 1970s on the New York city financial
crisis with Mr John Zuccotti, the chief executive of O&amp;Y's US operations who
at the time was deputy mayor of New York.
The last time O&amp;Y employed Lazard Freres was in the autumn of 1990, when it
was retained to seek buyers for 20 per cent of the US property business. The
deal did not occur.
Among the top priorities for Lazard Freres will be the search for equity
investors who could acquire a shareholding in O&amp;Y' US subsidiary. O&amp;Y is
hoping to raise at least Dollars 100m by selling a minority stake to one or
more investors.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Continental in new legal bid to
balk Pirelli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, yesterday launched a fresh legal
initiative to prevent Pirelli exercising its votes on more than the 5 per
cent stake which it holds in the German company.
The appeal to the Hanover court marks a further deterioration in relations
between the two companies ahead of Continental's annual meeting today in
Hanover at which Pirelli will seek to have Continental's voting rights
restrictions lifted.
Apart from the 5 per cent stake, Pirelli has options to buy a further 34 per
cent. Today it will launch a second attempt to overturn the rule limiting
shareholder voting rights to 5 per cent, whatever the stake.
In its latest move, Continental wants the court to give a definitive ruling
that Pirelli should not be allowed to exercise more than 5 per cent of its
votes. This follows shortly after a demand from Continental that Pirelli
should pay back the dividend it received on its Continental shares last
year.
The companies abandoned merger talks in December last year. Pirelli
maintains that there is nothing sinister in its challenge today and that it
simply wants to maximise the value of its stake by having the restriction
lifted.
Continental, however, is treating today's vote as a barely disguised assault
on its independence. It and Morgan Grenfell, its merchant banking advisers,
have in recent weeks mounted an intensive lobbying campaign to persuade
shareholders to vote against the Pirelli motion.
The outcome of today's meeting is likely to turn on the question of whether
Pirelli is allowed to vote its entire stake, or whether its votes will be
limited to 5 per cent. The decision on this lies with Mr Ulrich Weiss,
chairman of the Continental supervisory board and a main board director of
Deutsche Bank.
Continental would not comment yesterday on the likely outcome of today's
meeting, except to say that proceedings would be 'exciting'. It is thought
likely that Mr Weiss will exercise his discretion and limit Pirelli's voting
rights.
Such a move would probably provoke legal action as Pirelli has maintained -
and reiterated yesterday - that its option rights over 34 per cent of the
German company's shares in no way violated Continental's voting rights
restrictions.
At special meeting last March, Pirelli won a motion to overturn the voting
right restriction, but the decision was not implemented pending an appeal to
the Hanover court. At the end of May, the court annulled the vote, ruling
that Pirelli failed to disclose last March that it spoke for more than 25
per cent of Continental.
Pirelli's stress on 'maximising the value' of its stake, presumably with a
view to its future sale, is understandable. Having taken a huge loss on its
Continental shares and the indemnities offered to the other Italian
companies in its shareholder pool, Pirelli's focus is on regaining some of
the money ploughed into the venture.
However, relations with Continental remain extraordinarily ambivalent. The
two companies are still discussing the sale of some of Pirelli's car
components operations put on the block as part of the Italian group's
restructuring programme.
Also on today's agenda is a motion allowing Continental to raise its nominal
share capital by DM150m.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Porz plant gives KHD new lease
of life - Andrew Fisher on prospects for the German diesel engine maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, the German maker of diesel engines, industrial
plant and farm equipment, the late 1980s were a corporate nightmare.
A disastrous move into the US agricultural sector led to heavy losses and
the company was forced to slash jobs and capacity. Those grim days are
thankfully over. KHD, whose origins go back to the first days of the diesel
engine, is now engaged on what Mr Werner Kirchgasser, the chief executive,
calls a process of 'strengthening from within'.
But there is still some way to go. Yesterday, he said at the annual meeting
that KHD would again make a loss in the first half of this year, though this
was because most business was done in the second half. He expected another
profit for the full year. Encouragingly, he said the new order inflow was 7
per cent higher in the first five months at DM1.6bn (Dollars 1bn), with a 22
per cent jump in industrial plant business.
Although the 'strengthening' process has succeeded to the extent of keeping
KHD in the black and stabilising turnover, Mr Kirchgasser admits: 'When
you're making a turnover of around DM4bn, a profit of DM10m (the net figure
in 1991) is insignificant'. In other words, KHD is still not far ahead of
break-even.
Nor is there much immediate prospect of a sharp upturn. Earnings will remain
low for the next few years, one reason being the slack world economy. As Mr
Kirchgasser told shareholders: 'No major improvements can be expected from
the economy in 1992. The phase of economic weakness in western industrial
countries is likely to be overcome only slowly.'
Last year, operating profits fell by 78 per cent to DM18m, though this was a
far cry from the DM402m loss of 1987. Mr Kirchgasser says the 1991 operating
result was depressed by DM100m because of weaker markets in its business for
standard engineering products. It had to resort to further capacity and
overhead cuts to offset some of this damage.
From 1995, however, Mr Kirchgasser expects KHD's fortunes to take a distinct
turn for the better. He has already forecast a renewed dividend for 1996 -
10 years after the last distribution - when operating profits should exceed
DM100m.
The reason for this optimism lies not just in the Herculean restructuring
efforts under Mr Karl-Joseph Neukirchen, who arrived in 1987 from SKF, the
ball-bearing concern, to overhaul KHD and return it to profit. It stems also
from another move by Mr Neukirchen, mow head of the Hoesch engineering
company which has been acquired by Krupp. That was the decision to build the
world's most modern diesel engine plant at a cost of DM600m in the Porz
district of Cologne.
Using all the latest manufacturing methods, KHD aims to increase
considerably its production of advanced fuel-saving, low-noise, and
environmentally-friendly diesels and attack new market segments. 'The
success of this investment will determine our future,' Mr Kirchgasser says.
'If it doesn't work, our forecasts will be out.' He is confident, however,
that the new Porz facility will give KHD a new lease of life. Roughly half
its turnover comes from diesels, though this division is currently in the
red as a result of the heavy spending at Porz.
KHD has developed several new engines for the plant, which will be operated
by its Deutz Motor unit and start production next January with an eventual
capacity of 150,000 engines a year. It aims to reduce delivery times to
three weeks from the present three months. Productivity will be much higher
than at its existing plant in Cologne-Deutz, which produces the same number
of engines with 1,800 people; Porz will have 600.
KHD's other diesel unit is Deutz MWM, based in Mannheim. While Deutz Motor's
products are designed for general industrial use and to be installed in
trucks, buses, and other vehicles (not cars), the larger engines of MWM are
used mainly for ships and energy production. The company's aim is to produce
around 200,000 engines a year from the mid-1990s compared with 150,000 at
present. Of these, more than half will be for industrial use, including the
construction industry. KHD also wants to raise the number of vehicle engines
from the present 10,000 to around 50,000.
Mr Kirchgasser does not expect much favourable news from the European farm
sector. It is in the engine division that the key to a more prosperous
future for KHD lies, and the new plant at Porz will be of crucial importance
in achieving that.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Von Pierer named as Siemens' new
chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPOINTMENT of Mr Heinrich von Pierer, the former junior tennis champion
of Bavaria, as the next chief executive of Siemens was confirmed yesterday
by the supervisory board of the German electrical and electronics group.
Mr von Pierer, 51, who has a law and economic education, was named as deputy
chief executive a year ago to Mr Karlheinz Kaske, the 64-year-old head of
Siemens who steps down from the top job on October 1.
It was understood that Mr von Pierer would become the next chief executive,
and the supervisory board decision has made this official.
Since Mr Kaske became chief executive at the start of 1981, the Munich-based
group's turnover has risen from DM32bn to DM80bn (Dollars 52bn). Under his
leadership, Siemens has sought to break out of its bureaucratic mould - it
employs 402,000 people - penetrate the US market more effectively, develop
its position in telecommunications and computers, invest in east Germany,
and move into the developing markets of eastern Europe.
Among its most recent challenges was the acquisition of Nixdorf, the ailing
computer company which is causing Siemens more problems than it anticipated.
Siemens will give details of its group performance in the first eight months
of its end-September financial year in Dresden on Monday. It has already
reported an 8 per cent gain in net profits for the first half to DM859m
(Dollars 521m).
Mr von Pierer's main experience before joining the board of Siemens was as a
director and then head of its KWU power station operation. He helped ensure
that orders were dominated by conventional rather than nuclear power station
business at a time when the latter was becoming increasingly controversial.
He also convinced the Prague government and the management of Skoda Pilsen,
the Czech engineering company, that Siemens was the best partner among the
several concerns vying for the joint venture in power generation signed last
year. This involved frequent trips to Czechoslovakia to cultivate
politicians and offset fears that Siemens intended to drop the Skoda name
and use Pilsen as a cheap production site.
Associates of Mr von Pierer, who helped finance his studies by working as a
local sports reporter near Nuremberg, say he has an open, easy going style
and makes his views and criticisms known clearly. He still plays tennis and
is senior champion of northern Bavaria, though his time on the court is
likely to be curtailed by his new responsibilities.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE of the problems besetting much of Israel's big defence industry
emerged yesterday when Israel Military Industries (IMI), one of the biggest
state-owned weapons producers, announced losses in 1991 of almost USDollars
240m and warned it was likely to incur a further Dollars 120m loss this
year.
The government also announced the appointment of a special team to assess
the viability of converting Rafael, a state-owned developer of weapons
systems, into an independently-run commercial company following several
years of heavy losses. At present, it is run directly by the Defence
Ministry, as was IMI until two years ago.
The defence sector is a stalwart of Israeli exports and its difficulties,
due in large measure to a decline in world demand for weaponry, contributed
to the country's poor export performance over the past 18 months. The lack
of export growth is worrying policy-makers because it is regarded as the key
to expanding the economy to accommodate mass immigration from the former
Soviet Union.
IMI, best known as the maker of the Uzi sub-machine gun, exports about 70
per cent of its production. Its sales fell in 1991 to Dollars 520m from
Dollars 670m in 1990. At the same time, it incurred huge costs associated
with a crash recovery programme, including a Dollars 84m write-off of
unsaleable stock.
Last year, IMI sales to civilian markets were just Dollars 30m.
The company is seeking government aid to help it complete a painful
reorganisation in which it plans to cut the workforce from 10,000 two years
ago to around 7,500.

<TEXT>
HAFNIA HOLDING, which controls Denmark's second-largest insurance group,
yesterday postponed trading in a new rights issue. The issue was intended to
raise DKr2bn (Dollars 344m) and is vital to the company's plans to
strengthen its financial base.
The postponement follows the revelation on Wednesday that through an options
deal, which Hafnia's board claims was unauthorised, the group has been
forced to take 73 per cent of the shares in Interbank, a small bank.
The options deal has cost Hafnia DKr288m.
Hafnia yesterday also said that it is looking into other possible
irregularities.
The group's board spent yesterday in discussions with the bankers and the
institutional investors which have guaranteed the new share issue.
Mr Holger Laveson, the chairman, last night said that the discussions have
gone satisfactorily but are not complete. A full statement will be made
today.
Meanwhile, Copenhagen brokers Carnegie, which is one of the brokers
establishing the options deal, said that in its view the deal was valid and
that it expected Hafnia to honour it.

FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: VW forecasts first-half gain as
sales buck trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest car manufacturer, estimated that first-half
group earnings would be 'slightly higher' than the DM433m (Dollars 274m)
earned in the same period of 1991. Mr Carl Hahn, chairman, said 1.8m
vehicles were sold in the six months, a rise of 5.4 per cent, based on
preliminary figures. Turnover was estimated at DM44bn.
Addressing the annual meeting for the last time before handing over at the
end of this year to Mr Ferdinand Piech, Mr Hahn said VW was on course to
sell 3.5m vehicles worldwide this year compared with 3.1m last year.
This was all the more noteworthy as sales in Germany had fallen by 1.3 per
cent in the first half because of weaker demand in the east.
Mr Hahn contrasted VW's results with those of most US and Japanese
carmakers, calculating that group earnings last year, adjusted for special
depreciation, were 3.7 per cent before taxes which were matched by few
others.
Sales this year will be boosted by the inclusion for the first time of
Skoda, in which VW has a majority stake. Sales of the Czechoslovak car were
expected to rise to 190,000 units from a low point of 110,000 last year.
Skoda was hit by plummeting domestic demand and a collapse of its east
European market but has since found new markets in the west with VW's help.
A Volkswagen spokesman said that with the help of the impending North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), VW aimed to boost sales of its cars
in the US by an additional 100,000 cars in coming years. This was the
rationale behind a planned doubling of the capacity of its Mexican operation
to 400,000 units.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurance group, has been allowed to retain
its 28 per cent stake in Skandia, Sweden's biggest insurer, for a further
year.
Uni, which recently acquired its NKr4bn (Dollars 673m) Skandia shareholding,
was granted the concession by the Finance Ministry so long as Skandia
disposed of Vesta, its Norwegian subsidiary.
Skandia has previously refused to sell Vesta. Under the terms of the
concession, Uni will be forced to reduce the 28 per cent shareholding to
below 10 per cent by the beginning of next July unless Skandia sells Vesta.
On Tuesday, Uni suffered a blow when its share price fell 15 per cent on the
Oslo bourse following a domestic media report alleging the company was
technically bankrupt.
Uni was forced to issue a clarification of its financial position and denied
the report. Yesterday, Uni's A-shares shed another NKr1 to end at NKr30 and
Free shares fell NKr1.50 to NKr32.50.
Gjensidige Skadeforsikring, one of Norway's biggest insurers, has paid
NKr365m for a 63.39 per cent stake in the Forenede group, in a preparatory
move to a full takeover by next August.
Approval for the deal by the Finance Ministry cleared the way after a long
battle with Codan, the Danish subsidiary of Britain's Sun Alliance group,
which had also pursued Forenede.
Forenede holds 10 per cent of the domestic insurance market.
The ministry favoured Gjensidige because the company plans to maintain its
operations in Trondheim.

quoted radio sector Allied had changed its year end to September 30.
Accordingly it was announcing pro forma six-month results for the main
trading subsidiaries, County Sound and Radio Mercury, and a three-month
period for Allied Radio.
He said that the company had significantly improved its trading position,
mainly through merger rationalisation. The cost reduction programme had
exceeded the original estimate and the disposal of non-core assets in the
previous Third Mile Investment was almost complete.
In addition, the relaunch of Radio Mercury on FM and County Sound on AM had
started well.
The pro forma pre-tax loss last time was Pounds 703,000. Group turnover for
the first half amounted to Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 2.52m) and operating losses
were Pounds 249,000 (Pounds 541,000). Losses per share came through at 0.85p
(2.06p).
To comply with Stock Exchange regulations Allied will announce results for
the six months to June 30 in due course.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Alba moves 20% ahead to Pounds 5.06m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of 'continuing difficult trading conditions', pre-tax profits of
Alba, the consumer electronics group, showed a 20 per cent advance in the
year to March 31.
The increase, from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 5.06m, was achieved on turnover
down just Pounds 257,0000 to Pounds 110.9m.
Mr John Harris, chairman, said that with the exception of Hinari Deutschland
all divisions within the group had shown improved performances on the year.
Excluding the results from the German offshoot - which was closed during the
year - trading profits were up by 73 per cent from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds
5.7m.
Strong performances were recorded from Alba, Bush and Hinari in the UK, said
Mr Harris, while he was particularly pleased with the 50 per cent sales
increase from Harvard Maritime and with the turnround into profits at the
French operation.
The final dividend is raised to 3.75p for a total of 4.75p (4.35p), covered
1.6 times by earnings per share of 7.79p (7.11p).

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Necessity for organic expansion - Gary Mead
on Aegis' future following the departure of its chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSIDERABLE doubt hangs over the short-term future of Aegis, the holding
company of Carat, the largest pan-European media-buying and planning group,
following the sudden resignation last Friday of Mr Peter Scott, its
chairman.
In the face of weak advertising volumes, the group must cut costs, learn how
to grow organically rather than by acquisition, and tackle in France - by
far its main market - a government inquiry into media buying practices.
Despite the suddenness of Mr Scott's resignation, his departure had seemed
inevitable to many people within Aegis. He was, it is said, better suited to
acquiring new businesses rather than rationalising them.
The culture of Aegis was already changing to reflect this as two main
shareholders began to exert more influence. They are Mr Gilbert Gross,
co-founder of Carat Espace, who has a 27 per cent stake in Aegis, and
Warburg Pincus, the US investment group, with 14.5 per cent.
Mr Scott built the group, then an advertising agency called WCRS, by
acquiring a handful of US, European and Asian agencies, but the turning
point came in May 1988, with his purchase of 50 per cent of Carat Espace,
the French media buying and planning group.
WCRS bought the other half of Carat in December 1989 and the group's
direction changed to concentrate on media buying. Between May 1988 and
December 1991, Aegis made 16 acquisitions, mergers and start-ups across
Europe, from Barcelona to Moscow, a rapid expansion which coincided with a
severe recession.
Carat now has legitimate claim to being a pan-European group, with 60
offices in 18 countries. It buys and sells advertising space for more than
4,000 clients across Europe, claiming that this year it will have a 12 per
cent share of the Dollars 53bn (Pounds 29bn) a year display advertising
market.
But that rapid expansion, coinciding with the severe downturn in advertising
revenues, has taken its toll. Last year Aegis saw pre-tax profits fall by 19
per cent to Pounds 55.2m on turnover of Pounds 2.1bn, the first decline
since the group went public in 1983. In the UK alone Aegis lost Pounds
10.2m. Operating costs rose from Pounds 87.2m to Pounds 121m in the period.
Some Pounds 19m of the rise came from acquisitions, mergers and new business
start-ups.
'The fundamentals of the business still look good, but Aegis is in a very
poor position for 1992 and 1993 is on trust,' according to Mr Guy Lamming,
an analyst with James Capel. If the group continues to cut costs, it could
bounce back in 18 months or so.
As part of the economy drive, many of Aegis's functions are moving to Paris
and its London operations are to shrink drastically. Rumours persist within
the company that Mr Scott was not invited to relocate to Paris.
That suggestion is firmly denied by Mr Charles Hochman, currently Aegis's
deputy chairman and who has taken over from Mr Scott as Carat's chief
executive. Mr Scott resigned because he was to unwilling relocate his family
to Paris, he said.
'As far as I am concerned that is the reason why Peter Scott resigned and
anything else is pure speculation. What's happening today is a moment in a
process which started a few months ago and is going to continue. We are in a
phase of getting the operation more profitable, controlling costs, and
making our operation more efficient.'
The importance of Paris to the group began to increase this spring following
the death in April of Mr Francis Gross, Aegis's co-chairman. He founded
Carat with his brother Gilbert and was personally close to Mr Scott.
Without the support of Mr Francis Gross, with whom Mr Scott had been the
architect of the expansionary drive, Mr Scott became more isolated on the
board, people within the company said.
Mr Gilbert Gross, who has a reputation as more of a trader than a builder of
empires, was appointed last Friday as Aegis's honorary president. According
to an Aegis executive, SFEC - a company through which Mr Gross controls his
Aegis holding of some 27 per cent - is due almost Pounds 50m in deferred
payments over the next four years.
Mr Charles Hochman, Carat's new chief executive, and Mr Giles Gobin, a non
executive director, have represented Mr Gross's views on the Aegis board. Mr
John Vogelstein, Warburg Pincus's deputy chairman, is an Aegis non-executive
director. Following Mr Scott's departure, Mr Gilbert Gross has become
honorary president of the Aegis board.
But although some City analysts initially took fright last Friday, depicting
the departure of Mr Scott as a 'French coup', the reality is that the Gross
brothers and Warburg Pincus have been powerful voices on the board for the
last two years. If there were a 'French coup', it happened much earlier than
last Friday, and without any publicly-expressed disapproval from Mr Scott.
His departure leaves the core businesses intact but facing the French
investigation into the nature of media-buying. The Conseil de la
concurrence, the French equivalent of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, has spent two years investigating the advertising industry in
France.
It is particularly concerned with the complete lack of transparency in the
media-buying business, where huge discounts obtained by media-buyers such as
Carat are rarely, if ever, passed on to advertisers. The Conseil is unlikely
to take action before April 1993, but its investigation hangs over the head
of all media-buyers, including Carat.
Carat is heavily dependent on the French market, estimated to be the fifth
biggest advertising market in the world. Despite its pan-European network,
more than 70 per cent of Carat's revenues are estimated to derive from
France. Analysts estimate its French margins are 4 per cent, which might be
cut to as low as 2 per cent this year.
Carat believes it is innocent regarding the alleged lack of transparency and
abuse of its quasi-monopolistic powers identified in a Conseil report. But
it could eventually lose some of the benefits it has enjoyed from high
volumes and big discounts - the very factors that underpinned the rationale
for creating a huge media buying group.
Given the turmoil in Paris, Mr Scott might be looking forward to family life
in London.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Increased package for Thames chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ROY Watts, chairman, and Mr Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of
Thames Water, saw their total emoluments fall last year after the company's
earnings per share growth did not meet targets set by the board for bonuses
to be paid.
However, their basic salaries increased by 8.5 per cent and 14.1 per cent
respectively, and both were granted substantial share options.
Sir Roy's total package fell from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 145,000, as
indicated when Thames last month reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 236.3m
for the year to March 31, an 11.3 per cent increase.
Total emoluments for Mr Hoffman, the highest paid director, fell from Pounds
209,000 to Pounds 199,000.
Thames also revealed it made a Pounds 50,000 contribution to the
Conservative Party as the board considered 'a Tory election win was in the
interests of the company and shareholders'.

MR EUGENE Anderson, chairman and chief executive of Ferranti International,
received a 20.8 per cent pay rise last year despite having described the
electronics and defence group's performance in the year to March 31 1992 as
'unsatisfactory'.
Mr Anderson, who joined from Johnson Matthey in 1990 following the discovery
of huge fraud in a Ferranti subsidiary, received total emoluments of Pounds
464,000 compared to Pounds 384,000 a year earlier.
The rise, however, followed a pay cut from Pounds 619,000 in 1990.
Last week Ferranti reported reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 39.6m (Pounds
98.1m) for the year to March 31.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Sims Food rises 13% to Pounds 9.3m -
Current year warning trims 25p from share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMS FOOD Group, the meat processor and supplier, yesterday tempered its
announcement of continued growth in profits and turnover in the year to
March 31 with the caveat that 'the opening weeks of our current year have
continued the disappointing trend seen in the final quarter of last year.'
The shares fell 25p to 250p.
Mr John Stone, chairman, said flat demand in the retail side, increasing
prices for livestock and supermarket-driven pressure on margins were all
factors in the downturn, although he expected the effect to be short term,
impacting mainly on the current first-half results.
Pre-tax profits for the year under review expanded 13 per cent to Pounds
9.31m (Pounds 8.22m) after exceptional charges of Pounds 403,000, relating
to compensation to three departing board members.
With turnover up 10 per cent to Pounds 251.4m (Pounds 228m) and operating
profits ahead 19 per cent at Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 9.54m), margins improved
from 4.2 to 4.5 per cent.
Consumption of meat was down, Mr Stone said, with volume purchases down 3 to
5 per cent, though the amount consumers spent on meat was up.
However, he warned that the recession was 'far from over'. The catering
division had suffered most with an organic decline in turnover of 12 per
cent as consumers ate out less.
Capital expenditure stood at Pounds 10m, but is expected to fall to Pounds
5m-Pounds 6m in the current year. Some Pounds 3.5m was spent upgrading
plants to meet the Common European Standard on meat production and
especially abattoirs, and Pounds 5.5m went on new capacity, particularly
dedicated plants for specific supermarket chains.
Following November's Pounds 13.5m rights issue, gearing fell to 22 per cent
(50 per cent) at the year-end and net debt to Pounds 8m.
Withdrawal from the chicken abattoir and food machinery agency businesses
led to extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.96m while earnings rose to 23.4p
(22.3p) per share. A final dividend of 8.25p is proposed, giving a total of
11.25p (10.25p).

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Statement lops 69p off Hi-Tec share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Hi-Tec Sports, Britain's biggest sports shoe supplier, yesterday
plunged from 175p to 106p on news that the company was suffering from heavy
discounting by overseas competitors such as Reebok and Nike.
Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman, told Hi-Tec's annual meeting that the
discounting, together with deepening recessionary conditions affecting
consumer spending, had adversely affected the UK market for a longer period
than previously expected.
He said: 'As a result, our UK results so far this year are significantly
below those achieved in the corresponding period of last year, and are below
our earlier expectations, and we are experiencing a sharper squeeze on
margins'.
The meeting was told that these factors would 'inevitably have a pronounced
adverse impact on our overall results for the first half of this year.'
The UK workforce has been cut from 130 to just over 100 and Hi-Tec said it
was keeping a tight control on working capital.
One reason for the market's sharp reaction to yesterday's profits warning
was that it was in marked contrast to the optimistic note sounded by the
company on May 9, when it announced a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 9.06m for the year to February 2.
Hi-Tec said yesterday that it had seen spending rise after the election and
when the good weather started, but that these 'false dawns' had proved
short-lived.
However, the group emphasised that its street hiking boots were continuing
to do well in the US and, while the situation in the UK remained uncertain,
it expected results in the second half of this year to show a recovery from
the first half.

FAREPAK, the USM-traded mail order distributor and food processor, reported
pre-tax profits up 31 per cent, from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 4.84m, on
turnover ahead 35 per cent to Pounds 62.8m for the year to April 30.
Turnover for the mail order business, responsible for the bulk of pre-tax
profits, rose by 23 per cent; the division's pre-tax contribution increased
44 per cent.
However, the small travel operation saw pre-tax profits down to Pounds
23,000 (Pounds 102,000) while food processing declined from Pounds 647,000
to Pounds 566,000.
Earnings per share improved 29 per cent to 14.3p (11.1p) and a recommended
final dividend of 3.55p brings the total to 5p (3.87p).
The net cash balance rose to Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 4.68m).
Mr Christopher Hulland, finance director, said the improved performance was
largely attributable to a widening of the network of its Christmas hamper
selling agents, up 10,000 to 50,000.
Farepak runs its hamper selling business as a joint venture with Fine Art
Developments.

GREENE KING, the East Anglia-based brewer, said yesterday that it had gained
control of 46.43 per cent of Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, and that it
was extending its offer until July 10.
The Bury St. Edmunds brewer launched its Pounds 101m bid for Morland seven
weeks ago after buying a 28.5 per cent stake and receiving pledges for a
further 14.9 per cent from the Whitbread Investment Company.
Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, Morland's chief executive, said yesterday that the
further 3 per cent acceptances so far gained by Greene King showed that
Morland's shareholders 'continue to treat the bid with disdain.'
He added: 'Greene King should recognise the reality of the situation and
withdraw its offer immediately.'
However, Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, said he was pleased with
support so far from private and institutional shareholders. 'Many
shareholders are waiting until they know that all the relevant arguments and
facts have emerged before deciding whether to accept our offer.'
If the Takeover Panel permits, Greene King's results for the year ended May
3, which will include an asset revaluation, will be published on July 9 - 24
hours before the next closing date for the offer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT FLEMING Holdings, the privately-owned merchant banking group,
yesterday reported a 59 per cent increase, to Pounds 76.6m, in pre-tax
profits for the year to end-March.
The sharp rise came after minority interests and transfers to inner reserves
and marks the first time the group has reported at a pre-tax level.
Mr John Manser, chief executive, said that the year had been 'satisfactory
without being brilliant'. Earnings per share rose from 68p to 116.1p and a
final dividend of 23p gives a 33p total, up 20 per cent.
Asset management again provided the bulk of earnings from the Pounds 27bn of
investments under management worldwide. Banking, including the loan book,
foreign exchange trading and leasing had a good year.
The capital markets and corporate finance area were also 'active', Mr Manser
said.
Securities broking was the one area of weakness, largely due to the group's
involvement in Japan, Mr Manser said. In Europe, improvements in the UK
stockbroking were offset by a decline in European operations.
Jardine Fleming, the Hong Kong-based investment bank jointly owned by Robert
Fleming and Jardine Matheson, increased post-tax profit by 14 per cent to
Dollars 84m (Pounds 45m) and shareholders funds by 21 per cent to Dollars
191m.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Asda 'delighted' to realise Pounds 73m from
sale of MFI shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain, yesterday said it was
'delighted' to have realised Pounds 73m cash from selling its 25 per cent
shareholding in MFI, having last year written down the value of the
investment to just Pounds 2m.
It also revealed that Mr Peter Monaghan, operations director of the B&amp;Q DIY
chain, would join the company as retail director, succeeding Mr Richard
Harker, who resigned earlier this week.
The appointment provoked some controversy after Isosceles, struggling owner
of the rival Gateway grocery chain, said it had already signed an employment
contract with Mr Monaghan offering him the post of managing director of the
Gateway stores business unit.
Given his action in accepting Asda's later offer, however, Gateway said it
no longer considered Mr Monaghan to be an 'appropriate' person to join its
senior management team and would not try to hold him to his contract.
Mr Archie Norman, Asda's chief executive, said he approached Mr Monaghan
with a job offer immediately after he learnt of his resignation from B&amp;Q.
The two men knew each other well during their time at Kingfisher.
Asda's cash inflow from the MFI sale will be used to reduce its borrowings
which analysts estimate still stand at about Pounds 700m in spite of an
emergency Pounds 357m rights issue last year.
The company will announce its full-year results on Monday, when it is
expected to take a substantial write-down on its property portfolio but will
outline a strategy for reinvigorating its business.
Although Asda received less money from the 'MFI lottery ticket' than had
been mooted in recent weeks, Mr Norman said it was still more than had been
considered realistic earlier this year. 'When I arrived at Asda we were
looking at getting only Pounds 25m from MFI,' he said.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: US court dismisses claim against T&amp;N
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US jury has dismissed a Dollars 75m (Pounds 39.2m) lawsuit brought by
Prudential Insurance Company of America against T&amp;N.
In a unanimous verdict, the jury found that the engineering group which in
the 1950s and 1960s used to supply fireproofing materials containing
asbestos, had no liability to compensate Prudential for costs which the US
company alleged it had incurred and would incur in removing the material
from the Prudential Center, built between 1959 and 1962 in Boston,
Massachusetts.
Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, said he was 'pleased, but
not surprised' by the outcome. He said that about 130 claims had been made
against the company. Of these, about 100 had been dismissed or settled,
usually without indemnity. Of the 30 outstanding, two were substantially
larger than the others - the Prudential Center and the New York headquarters
of Chase Manhattan Bank.
The two cases were 'similar, but not identical', because of different laws
in different states. So, although there was no 'direct' precedent, the
'dismissal without liability was significant'.
T&amp;N argued that the material used was in Prudential's specifications, and
the US company would have been as aware of the material's potential dangers
as T&amp;N.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Markheath hit by property write-downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX losses at Markheath, the property group 61 per cent-owned by the
Australian Adelaide Steamship Group, increased sharply from Pounds 4.08m to
Pounds 22.7m in the year to March 31.
The increase stemmed from a jump in exceptional provisions from Pounds 1.6m
to Pounds 21.6m.
The final dividend is omitted, leaving shareholders with 0.5p for the year.
Last year's final of 2p made a 4p total. Mr Michael Rendle, who a year ago
replaced Mr John Spalvins as Markheath chairman, said that the now
refinanced Adsteam was 'fully supportive' of the dividend move and that it
was an advantage to have a stable shareholder.
Turning to Markheath, Mr Rendle said: 'This has been a difficult year.'
However, the company had rearranged its revolving credit facilities 'on
satisfactory terms', and bank covenants had not been breached. During the
year net borrowings fell from Pounds 95.4m to Pounds 72.9m, though net
assets also fell to Pounds 55m (Pounds 78.9m) - equivalent to 45.1p (64.6p)
per share.
Mr Rendle said that Markheath's balance sheet and cashflow were 'now under
control' and the aim was further to reduce borrowings through asset
disposals and more cuts in operating overheads. Over the past two years
staff numbers have been cut from 145 to 33, mostly from the construction
side.
Of the exceptional charges, Pounds 15.5m related to property write-downs and
Pounds 4.98m to a provision for the 295p (390p) carrying value of the 13 per
cent stake in Frogmore Estates, which had a market price yesterday of 264p.
Turnover tumbled to Pounds 4.25m (Pounds 34.1m), because the company was now
'not forced into making distress sales'. Rental income was flat at Pounds
2.88m (Pounds 2.9m) and while the net interest cost was Pounds 7.9m (Pounds
13.6m), Pounds 5.5m was capitalised - 'a sensible amount in today's market'
 -leaving Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 7m) charged to the profit and loss account.
Losses per share increased to 18.86p (3.21p).

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Robert Horton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
We are asked to clarify Mr Robert Horton's role in the acquisition by BP of
the minority shareholding in Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) (FT June 30).
On his appointment as chairman of Sohio in 1986, Mr Horton relinquished his
BP directorship. Negotiations on BP's initial offer of Dollars 7.4bn took
place at arms length. The minority shareholders, some of whom referred the
bid to the court, were separately advised by a special committee, of which
Mr Horton was not a member, chaired by Mr Douglas Danforth, chairman of
Westinghouse.
Negotiations improved the original BP offer by Dollars 420m and the terms of
the final agreement were approved by the court.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Interest downturn leaves Gold Greenlees at
Pounds 4.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD GREENLEES Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, reported
pre-tax profits down by 19 per cent, from Pounds 5.02m to Pounds 4.09m, on
turnover off 12 per cent at Pounds 234.1m for the year to April 30.
The outcome included net exceptionals of Pounds 482,000 resulting from the
sale of subsidiaries, including Pavilion and 70 per cent of Media Solutions.
Investment income, however, was badly hit, falling from Pounds 1.73m to
Pounds 826,000, largely due to a final pay-out on an earlier acquisition and
lower interest rates, particularly in the US. Operational costs were reduced
to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 38.2m).
Earnings per share were 17.28p (19.16p). A final dividend of 5p maintains
the total at 8.3p.
Mr Michael Greenlees, chairman, said yesterday: 'In many ways we believe
that we have never been in better shape with only the poor economic
conditions spoiling an otherwise encouraging picture.'
The company has three offices in the US - in Texas, Minnesota and Georgia -
and 'all three offices are performing outstandingly' said Mr Greenlees. He
said that US pre-tax profits were up 64 per cent to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds
2.2m). 'We have really moved against the trend in North America,' he added.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Two Wiggins companies put into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wiggins Group, the property developer and housebuilder which ran into
difficulties as a result of its develop-ments in London's Docklands,
yesterday put two companies into administrative receivership.
They are Allison Homes and its subsidiary Allison (Contractors), part of the
group's housebuilding operations, which had a combined net asset value of
Pounds 500,000. They incurred a loss of Pounds 172,000 in the year to March
31. There were 12 redundancies.
Mr Stephen Hayklan, Wiggins chairman, said his board was not prepared to put
any more money into the companies, given the absence of any upturn in the
housing market. Wiggins has no guarantees outstanding in respect of either
of these companies and continues housebuilding through Wiggins Homes in the
south-west of England.
Mr Hayklan said the decision would not affect the rest of the group's
business, which now mainly comprises two industrial parks in Kent and
Oxfordshire.
Wiggins continued to trade within the constraints set by its banks following
a financial restructuring in 1990. Wiggins shares closed 1p down at 8p.
In May, South Quay, the developer of a 300,000 sq ft office block on the
Isle of Dogs, was put into administrative receivership.
South Quay was established in 1990 as a separate company as part of the
Wiggins restructuring.

FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Northern Electric surges to Pounds 98.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN ELECTRIC, the Newcastle-based regional electricity company,
announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 98.2m for the year to end-March 1992, a
42 per cent increase on last year's pro forma Pounds 69.3m.
The result was struck on turnover up from Pounds 774m to Pounds 813.7m.
Underlying profits, after adjusting for exceptional price rises in April
1991 and undercharging last year, rose by Pounds 19m, or 26 per cent.
Earnings per share improved 44 per cent, from 41.4p to 59.6p, and a final
dividend of 13p is recommended making a total for the year of 18.55p.
The bulk of the profits increase came from the main distribution business,
which turned in a 28 per cent advance from Pounds 71.2m to Pounds 90.8m,
while income from the supply business - which buys and sells bulk
electricity - fell 36 per cent from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 4.1m.
The company turned a Pounds 1.8m loss from the retail, contracting, and
other unregulated businesses, into a Pounds 3.3m profit overall, but cut its
contracting business, which is still loss-making, by half.
Some Pounds 12m of the underlying profit increase was attributable to normal
tariff increases, said Mr David Morris, chairman. Another Pounds 5m was due
to increased sales volumes, which improved by 1.7 per cent, as sales to all
classes of customers increased.
Net interest charges fell by Pounds 5.2m, and income from the company's 6.5
per cent stake in the National Grid Company grew by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds
10.2m.
Costs were cut across the business by some Pounds 6m as 240 jobs - 4.7 per
cent of the workforce - were lost.
The outlook for the company was good, Mr Morris said. He expected to cut the
contracting business by half again in the current year, down to 100 or fewer
staff. Costs will be cut by some 3 per cent again, and there should be
further savings from this year's staff cuts.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m, putting the company on
a prospective p/e of 6.2. The dividend is forecast to be between 20.5p and
20.8p.
COMMENT
Northern Electric must wonder what it has to do to get a re-rating from the
City. Analysts still don't rate the company's management - despite the fact
that Northern is doing everything the City usually asks from a utility. It
has no dubious diversification, an excellent consumer service record and
sales volume growth in its main business, and a small under-recovery in the
well-managed supply business, which the City generally regards as an ideal
position. It is getting rid of loss-making contracting, and making money in
retail. It also gave a positive, but not worryingly positive, dividend
statement. Perhaps the only cause for concern is the relatively high rate of
return and the relatively high tariff increase this year - which could alert
the regulator.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Flotations sail into choppy waters: New issues flop on both
sides of the Atlantic as investors lose their enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE MAY be happenstance, twice coincidence, but three times must be enemy
action. Merchant bankers, their clients and the underwriters must be
distinctly worried after two recent flotations have failed, and might be
forgiven for wondering whether there is a concerted buyers' strike against
new equity.
Last month GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, pulled its flotation
because of a lack of investor interest. This week, The Telegraph's flotation
flopped with retail investors.
The two might be coincidental. But a third failure would suggest that the
new issue market, which sprang to life after last month's general election,
has died.
The pricing of MFI Furniture Group's flotation yesterday at 115p - well
below earlier hopes and at a significant p/e discount to the stores sector -
showed the company's determination to ensure that the issue succeeded. But
in these uncertain markets, eight days between the issue of the prospectus
and the close of applications is a long time.
The situation is even worse for companies contemplating a rights issue,
where the gap between pricing and closing is typically three weeks.
Yesterday Marshalls, the building materials group, announced that only 27.8
per cent of its Pounds 20m rights issue had been taken up by shareholders.
When that issue was priced on June 9 at 75p, the existing shares stood at
97p. The company must have felt the discount was wide enough to be safe.
The MFI issue is a large one, raising Pounds 629m, making it a demanding
test for the market. But even that is dwarfed by the sale of shares in
Wellcome, the drugs group, to be completed by the end of this month. That is
still expected to raise around Pounds 2.8bn for the Wellcome Trust, which is
cutting its stake in the company.
Wellcome's shares have fallen from 1126p just before the Trust announced
early in March that it would sell a large part of its shareholding, to 856p
at yesterday's close, up 3p on the day.
The Trust seems committed to see the sale through. With three weeks to go,
and the formal tendering process not yet under way, it would seem premature
to pull the issue when so much work has gone into it. The size and price of
the issue can be adapted to suit demand and the Trust is planning to
reinvest the proceeds in a market which is getting lower by the day.
The fall in the London stock market has been sharp, with the FT-SE 100 index
losing more than 200 points, or more than 8 per cent, since the beginning of
June.
Fund managers note that bad news drives the market down, but good news fails
to pick the market up. Even so, they feel that the right company could find
buyers at the right price.
Whether the price that investors regard as right is acceptable to the
company is another matter. But any company contemplating raising equity will
think hard before going ahead.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Northern Telecom invests in Matra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom of Canada is investing FFr1.36bn (Pounds 138m) in Matra
Communications, the telecommunications division of Matra, the French defence
electronics group.
The Canadian group, which will emerge with an initial 20 per cent of Matra
Communications, is also negotiating to take a minority stake in the new
holding company which will merge Matra with Hachette, the French publishing
company, also controlled by the Lagardere family.
Matra Communications, which last year incurred a net loss of FFr17m on sales
of FFr5.9bn, has been seeking an international partner since last autumn.
The company, which employs 8,000 people, needed to grow to compete in the
international telecommunications market.
The Matra purchase is in keeping with Northern's recent shift of emphasis
from its core North American base to a more geographically diversified
business. Dr Paul Stern, chairman, who handled most of the negotiations,
said the alliance would help Northern develop markets in Europe and
elsewhere.
Under the terms of the deal, Northern Telecom will pay FFr700m for a 20 per
cent stake in Matra Communications and will also provide a FFr660m
convertible loan. The two groups are forming a joint venture to combine
Matra's radio technology with Northern's switching expertise.
Matra is also offering to buy out the minority shareholders in its
communications subsidiary. It has agreed terms to acquire the 18 per cent
stake held by Paribas, the French investment bank, for FFr295.70 a share in
a FFr612m deal. This is believed to represent a profit of FFr450m for
Paribas. The same offer has been extended to other minority shareholders
with 12 per cent of Matra Communications.
Meanwhile Northern, which last year staged a USDollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.3bn)
takeover for the UK's STC, plans to take up to 8 per cent of the new
Matra/Hachette holding company, which will come into force at the end of
this year. The creation of the company has been criticised in France due to
the apparent divergence of interests. However, Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, who
chairs both Matra and Hachette, has argued it will yield administrative
savings.

FT  03 JUL 92 / GPA drops plans to buy joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GPA Group has cancelled plans to buy in its joint venture companies to
avoid bringing Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 640m) of extra borrowings on to its
balance sheet.
This is the first sign that the aircraft leasing company's plans are being
affected by its failure last month to proceed with its planned Dollars 800m
flotation.
The company has more than Dollars 7bn of firm orders to acquire aircraft
from manufacturers over the next three years, and some of GPA's investment
bankers believe it needs to raise around Dollars 500m within six months to
avoid cancelling or deferring some of these orders.
According to one of its investment bankers, the company is considering
raising funds through the issue of debt securities in the capital markets,
the private placement of shares and a convertible preference share issue.
The group would only say that it is reviewing all its options before its
board meeting this month.
GPA's UK pathfinder prospectus, issued in May, spelled out why the group
wanted to buy the equity interests in its joint ventures.
It said: 'The company believes that much of the rationale for maintaining
many of the joint venture companies has diminished, particularly having
regard to the higher cost and complexity of managing such enterprises.'
Last year GPA's share of the profits from all of its joint ventures fell
from Dollars 83m to Dollars 56m.
A spokesman for GPA yesterday said: 'It is highly probable that we shall not
buy in the joint ventures because we do not want their borrowings on our
balance sheet.'
In the year to December the joint venture companies reported Dollars 1.2bn
debt and Dollars 1.9bn in assets.
The joint ventures which GPA had hoped to gain control of were GPA Airbus,
Irish Aerospace, GPA-ATR and GPA Fokker. As of March 31, GPA had contributed
Dollars 275m to the joint venture companies in the form of equity and
subordinated loans, and had guaranteed Dollars 178m of the obligations of
the companies and expects to provide more in the future.
GPA has already purchased equity interests in three former joint ventures -
GPA Rolls, GPA Aero Citra and Air Maple - for Dollars 92m.

FT  03 JUL 92 / VW calls on UK component makers to bid for contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest carmaker, has called on UK motor component
manufacturers to bid for more business with the rapidly-expanding German
group.
The move is another warning to the German components industry that the
country's high labour, social and other costs are making it increasingly
uncompetitive.
VW is planning investments of DM51bn over the next five years to lift total
vehicle production from 3.1m to 4.8m units a year. The
Wolfsburg-headquartered group includes Audi, Seat of Spain and Skoda of
Czecho-slovakia.
Mr Werner Svetlik, VW management board director with responsibility for
purchasing, told a meeting of some 100 component companies, industry groups
and government officials in Birmingham that VW is seeking a 'closer
partnership' with the UK industry.
He said there was the opportunity for large increases in the volume of
components bought by VW in the UK. These purchases totalled Pounds 86m last
year, up 15 per cent on 1990.
VW, like Opel, BMW and other German carmakers, is under mounting pressures
from rivals, particularly Japanese, which are benefiting from lower
component and assembly costs through global sourcing policies.
Mr Robert Stempel, chairman of Opel's parent, General Motors, has already
warned that GM is to introduce a global sourcing policy which could mean
lost business for suppliers in the US or Germany.
Mr Svetlik told the potential UK suppliers that the Birmingham meeting
marked the beginning of a 'new philosophy' of stronger co-operation, in
which suppliers would be closely involved in VW's product development and
would be awarded single-source, long-term contracts. 'The good reputation of
the British component industry is well deserved and I have no doubt that
British companies can meet our requirements,' he said.
VW has become more attracted to the UK components industry since several
hundred UK component makers became involved in supplying parts to Nissan,
Toyota and Honda 'transplants' in the UK. Meeting the Japanese cost and
quality criteria is accepted as having sharply raised the UK industry's
competitiveness.

FT  03 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: MFI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of the MFI flotation is going to be an interesting test of
investor psychology. On the one hand, the price has been slashed to the
point where it starts to look attractive on fundamental grounds. On the
other, the essence of a successful stagging operation is that shares should
be intercepted by retail investors on their way to the institutions. In
MFI's case, the almost total lack of demand from financial intermediaries
suggests little interest among wealthier private investors. Taken along with
the stunning lack of popular response to the Telegraph flotation, this
argues that whatever the British public is saving up for these days, it is
not equity issues.
It may therefore be a close-run thing whether MFI opens to a worthwhile
premium in a fortnight's time. That in turn could do much to determine
sentiment towards other new issues, since MFI is seen as one of the most
intrinsically attractive companies coming to the market. For the long-term
investor in MFI the simple approach is to take up the offer and let the
after-market take care of itself.

FT  03 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubtless aggrieved Names at Lloyd's will continue to insist that the well
publicised problems of the LMX spiral went beyond simple incompetence and
that the structure of governance is not the most fundamental issue. But
coming on top of Mr Coleridge's contrite performance at last month's AGM -
an occasion when the middle classes signally failed to riot - yesterday's
reports from committees chaired by Sir David Walker and Sir Jeremy Morse add
to an impression of Lloyd's gradually getting its house into order.
This must be healthy for an institution which relies on a reputation for
straight dealing. As a result, the meltdown theory is starting to look a
good deal less plausible, although backwoodsmen who believe that everything
will be righted with the turn in the cycle are equally guilty of wishful
thinking. Lloyd's should survive all right, but in a different form. In the
short term at any rate, it also seems destined to shrink. While forecasts of
a 20 to 30 per cent fall in capacity next year may be on the gloomy side,
1990 losses when they are announced in 12 months' time will inevitably shake
out more Names. There is strong evidence of improving rates, to be sure,
particularly in marine and aviation. But given the awful press of recent
months and the disappearance of major tax breaks neither new individuals nor
corporate members are likely to show up until clear proof can be shown of
renewed profitability.
Fears that Lloyd's may now lose control of some business sectors may be
overdone; much of the problem, after all, was irresponsible competition
within Lloyd's itself. That said, Lloyd's will have to concentrate its
expertise even more on complex risks and share its bigger deals with the
composites. A fully integrated London market - and a more Europeanised one -
looks inevitable in the long run.

FT  03 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market's response to Wall Street these days seems to be a kind
of reverse ratchet effect, whereby it falls along with Wall Street and does
nothing when it rises. The differential between the two markets is somewhat
stretched as a result. In particular, as Warburg points out, comparison of
the two market multiples leaves London looking more depressed than at any
time since the dark days of the mid-1970s. There are obvious distortions,
such as the fact that most UK companies do not yet charge closure and
rationalisation costs against earnings. If only for that reason, UK
companies do not have the same scope for a rebound in stated earnings in the
event of economic recovery.
But there is more to it than accounting conventions. On the one hand, Wall
Street's continued strength takes a lot of justifying. On the other, the
weakness of the dollar is unsettling. This may be irrational: the US
currency may recover, while some UK companies with dollar earnings have
better cash cover on their dividends than others which depend solely on the
UK economy. But the memory of what a Dollars 2.40 pound did to manufacturers
in the last recession is not calculated to steady nerves.

FT  03 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: The Fed cuts it fine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last US discount rate cut in December sparked off heavy buying of US
equities on the basis that rates were so low as to make vigorous recovery a
dead certainty. After that proved an illusion, it is tempting to shrug off
yesterday's further half point cut as likely to lead to further
disappointment. At some stage, however, the medicine will work. The problem
is that even the best of forecasters can only guess when.
Admittedly, one can exaggerate the degree to which the recovery has
sputtered to a halt. The Fed's move probably had some political content. It
equips the US to demand similar action from its G7 partners at next week's
Munich summit. June's unexpectedly large fall in non-farm payrolls may also
have been an aberration. But even if the Fed's response owes as much to the
approach of the election as to economic necessity, it could never have
contemplated acting so decisively had credit demand been stronger and money
supply growth on target. The fall in bond yields over the past couple of
months and their continued decline after yesterday's announcement indicates
a remarkable absence of inflationary pressure.
With a bit of luck, individuals and corporations may now resume debt
refinancing at lower rates. Their greater sense of well-being could generate
the confidence needed to boost the economy. An early sign of whether this is
happening will come from the figures for new car sales in July.
The currency markets seem prepared to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt.
After an initial sell-off, the dollar reacted to the cut with singular calm.
If US rates really have reached their low point, exchange dealers may soon
start discounting an eventual narrowing of the interest differential with
Germany and the dollar will recover. But that is still a big if. Meanwhile,
Wall Street risks losing both ways. The flow of retail cash from the money
markets could dry up while the recovery remains far from robust enough to
justify present equity prices.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Letter: Horton had no knowledge for 'right answer'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES MCDOWALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I believe Christopher Lorenz misses a point over the cultural changes
and Robert Horton's departure from BP ('Oil and troubled waters', July 29).
The comment of Horton's in Forbes magazine should not have been treated with
dismay because of the arrogance it displayed but because of the simple fact
that it was patently untrue within the context of the new BP culture.
Horton no more knew what was going on at the coal face than any other
director, so he could not get to the 'right answer' because he was not
endowed with the appropriate knowledge.
Within BP it is well understood among the converted that the new culture
requires wholehearted support for it to take root. Many very effective
managers with Horton's capacity and drive can be seen to bite their tongues
rather than disrupt the obvious benefits that the cultural changes are
bringing to the group.
Some of them are completely aware that their natural style does have the
power to bring the cultural changes to a grinding halt, or even
catastrophically to reverse them.
As the article said, it needed the mentality and drive of someone like
Horton to move the BP group to the much needed cultural changes (these had
in fact already been successfully started by the exploration business under
the leadership of John Browne). But the very autocratic drive that got BP
moving is also what the culture change had to eliminate. Drive is fine but
autocratic drive is not.
The new culture of empowerment says that executive management has the tools
to set corporate direction but the workers at the coal face know all the
problems and opportunities down there, so empower them to get on and exploit
them.
For many of us it is sad that we had to wait for so many years to see the
uncompromising leadership necessary to move BP in the way that Horton and
his colleagues have done. It is only a regret that the figurehead for the
group's cultural change could not achieve it for himself.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Letter: Alternative view of figures at BSkyB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER BLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Raymond Snoddy's passing remark about BSkyB in his article, 'BBC and
Sky talk on news service' (June 30), that BSkyB 'is now profitable, although
that has been achieved by writing off close to Pounds 1bn of excess costs'
cannot be allowed to go unchallenged. I find this new profitability
difficult to believe - unless, of course, you invent a new measure of
profitability that excludes the disagreeable bits, like interest.
The truth lies, as it should, in the published figures. According to the
accounts, BSkyB lost, excluding exceptional items, Pounds 294m in the 37
weeks to 30 June 1991, close to Pounds 8m a week. Its interest burden (which
cannot be written off or otherwise ignored) was Pounds 3m a week. BSkyB
appears certain to record another huge loss in the 52 weeks to June 30 1992,
which will further increase its Pounds 1.5bn cumulative deficit.
In addition, the accounts reveal a negative net worth of Pounds 1.3bn.
Future programme rights contracted (but not provided for in the accounts) of
Pounds 530m - increased since June 30 1991 by a further Pounds 420m to
Pounds 950m. It seems unlikely that these figures include the commitment to
pay the Premier League in excess of Pounds 200m during the next five years.
(Was the Premier League astute enough to ask for guarantees from BSkyB
shareholders?)
Additional shareholder financing available of Pounds 200m; all but Pounds
33m of this has already been drawn down, which suggests that cash has
continued to flow out at around Pounds 3m a week in the past 12 months.
Outstanding lawsuits pending or threatened by Tatung (UK), Ferguson, Oy
Nokia AB, Philips International and others, aggregating to a total of Pounds
100m. (These are not provided for in the accounts, and are being vigorously
resisted.)
Against this background, the directors' statement that 'the group will not
achieve significant net operating cash inflows or net operating profits
before 1994' seems entirely believable.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Letter: UK manufacturers must be given motive to invest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R P BULL and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government's declared intention of 'enabling' industry in its
expansion and contribution to the economy would seem to be seriously in
question. Such a view is illustrated by the continued run down of
manufacturing through the recession and the lack of confidence industry has
in the government's industrial policy.
Our association represents some 300 machine tool manufacturers and suppliers
in the UK in an industry which is at the very heart of the UK's
manufacturing base. Our point is that if the UK is to continue to have a
viable manufacturing industry we must provide the best possible environment
for industry to invest in the latest machine tool technology. This is
particularly necessary during a recession. Without investment we have little
hope of competing in world markets or of sustained economic recovery, and
the proposals we have outlined to the government would only ensure a level
playing field and would not constitute subsidy or the picking of winners.
We note that last week the Japanese government proposed a package of support
measures for small businesses and tax breaks for investment as a result of
the economy failing to reach its 3.5 per cent growth rate.
In spite of orders for machine tools in the UK having fallen by 50 per cent
in the past two years, and the OECD forecasting that in 1992 the UK economy
will grow at less than one third the rate of other G7 nations, there seems
to be little attempt to boost the confidence in UK industry or consumers.
We welcome lower interest rates and lower inflation but these on their own
are not enough. Manufacturing industry needs the motivation to invest and
the confidence to be able to take long term views and decisions. We call
upon this government to act immediately to create the right environment that
will enable UK manufacturing to play its essential role in the recovery of
the economy as a whole.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Letter: Macedonia by another name a step to avoiding
bloodshed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SPIROS V BRANIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer ('A Greek tragi-comedy', July 1) is badly frustrated by
the EC decision to recognise the Republic of Skopje provided it chooses a
name which does not include the term Macedonia. Mr Mortimer claims the
recycled communists who govern Skopje have given assurances for not
promoting irredentist claims and have even written them into the
constitution.
A careful look into its constitution proves the opposite:
Article 3: 'The territory of the R of M is indivisible and unaltered. The
existing borders of the R of M are inviolable. The borders of the R of M can
change only according to the constitution.'
Article 74: 'The Assembly decides for the change of the borders of the R of
M with a two-thirds majority of the total number of representatives. The
decision to change the borders of the R of M is adopted with a referendum if
it is voted for by the majority of the voters.'
These two articles together prove the expansionist nature of the Skopje
leaders. If current borders are inviolable and yet they can change, then
they could only be expanded. Could you imagine people voting to shrink their
country?
Article 49: 'The R of M cares for the status and rights of Macedonian people
in neighbouring countries as well as immigrants from the R of M; helps their
cultural progress and (develops) ties with them. The R of M cares for the
cultural and economic rights of its citizens abroad.'
This article sets the groundwork for the expansionism of articles 3 and 74.
Mr Mortimer should know that the neighbouring countries of Greece and
Bulgaria do not recognise the existence of so-called 'Macedonian' minority
on their land. Mr Mortimer should study more thoroughly the ethnic salad of
the Republic of Skopje. The name Macedonia cannot unify all the mutually
hostile groups, but represents an attempt of a small ex-communist
nomenclature to survive after the cold war with the facet of an irredentist
'Macedonian nationalism'.
Acceptance of ethnic reality in Skopje by creating separated ethnic cantons,
united by a name excluding the term Macedonia, would be the only solution to
avoid bloodshed as in Bosnia-Hercegovina.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: Love, lust and voyeurism - Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thematic exhibitions tend to be viewed with deep suspicion. If the theme is
too broad, and crucial loans unforthcoming, they run the risk of being
uneasy assemblages of disparate objects incapable of telling us anything
new. Giulio Macchi's ambitious multi-media exploration of Love: from Olympus
to the Alcove at Turin's Mole Antonelliana, is no exception.
From the first, the visitor is bombarded by a hotch-potch of images. The
opening sequence, for instance, takes us from the 1970s and Robert Indiana's
'Love' carpet to Guido Reni's 'Eros' and the seicento in three paces, and
sets a great Cranach beside a humble cupid on a candlestick. The visual
confusion is disorientating, and made worse by the Mole space which allows
one to see almost everything on each floor at the same time.
It soon becomes apparent that this is not an exhibition about art - as the
slipshod captioning bears witness. This is art as document of cultural
history, and it is a potted history to boot. Macchi alights on one promising
line of enquiry only to flit to another. Nothing is pursued, nothing
explained. Individual exhibits or sequences may be fascinating, but
juxtapositions are less frequently illuminating than banal or simply
baffling.
Enduring emblems of love set the scene. There are Venuses by Botticelli
(sacred), Cranach (profane), Man Ray (bound), Arman (sliced), Yves Klein
(blue) and Jim Dine (black). Boucher's is a cloud-borne confection strewn
with pearls; Pistoletto's is almost submerged in a mound of old clothes.
Hearts loom in abstract canvases or sit upon an outcrop of columns. Amorini
come cast, carved and gilt, woven, painted,enamelled . . . Picasso's
re-interpretation of Cranach is displayed but, inexplicably, on a different
floor.
Leering over all is Enrico Baj's repellent maiolica relief of an embracing
Cupid and Psyche, Psyche's shiny red tongue obscenely protruding. It makes a
travesty of the tenderness expressed in the Antique marble version of the
group on loan from the Capitoline Museum in Rome. Baj's monumental panel is
the first of many depressing late 20th century images of love.
In 'The Arms of Seduction' we glimpse the enchanted world of courtly love.
Medieval and Renaissance ivory combs and wooden caskets present gardens of
love and fetes galantes. Menacing hints of alchemy and magic crop up in the
weird fantasy landscape of Girolamo da Carpi. 'The Pact' dips into the codes
of behaviour sanctioned by society. We find a 15th century tract against
marriage and Chagall's 'Les Maries de la Tour Eiffel' as a joyful
celebration of holy matrimony.
An early 18th century sex manual, with illustrations treating the human body
like fragments of classical sculpture, helpfully instructs its newly wed
readers on the various combinations of genitalia of hermaphrodites. Bassano
and Burne-Jones depict virtuous women. A 15th century birth salver depicting
the Last Judgment stands in ironic contrast to the triumphalism of Valerio
Admai's 1970 'Les Joies de l'adultere'.
'Intimacy Revealed' proceeds to unlock doors and rip off any number of brown
paper wrappers. From the print room of the Uffizi comes a series of sexual
fantasies by Fuseli, notorious but never exhibited. More schematic, works of
reference even, are the couplings drawn by Francesco Hayez (he of 'The
Kiss', which is here too). Beside them is a more conventional portrait of
his model and mistress sitting up in bed. Additional paintings and drawings
by Picasso and Le Corbusier contrast the public with the private.
On general release, apparently for the first time, are frescoes, mosaics,
sculpture and ceramics from the secret or 'reserve' collection of
antiquities discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum. It is an extraordinary
collection, interesting not least, as the catalogue essay reveals, in terms
of subsequent attitudes towards it. Even the great Winckelmann was not
granted access to the still shocking marble of Pan and the goat.
Next comes 'Possession' - have not we had that already? - and violent
abductions and violations, from illustrations of mythological rapes to Andre
Masson's 'L'enlevement'. The fury of these scenes contrast with the docile
languor of the harem. This section offers up such curiosities as a 15th
century chastity belt, and death masks of a rapist and a wife murderer made
for Turin's long closed museum of criminal anthropology.
At the heart of the Mole's space-rocket interior is 'The Theatre of Love'. A
series of beds are viewed to the sounds of great theatrical love scenes
recorded by Luca Roncone. From here the 'siege d'amour' of around 1890 from
an infamous Parisian brothel (was it really made for the Prince of Wales?)
is only a footstep away. The cool classicism and unexpected comedy of Ledoux
and Lequeu's projections of Revolutionary maisons de plaisir, make for a
fascinating oasis before the latter part of the show's breathless romp
around fetishism (shoes, leather), sadism (Dix), transvestism (Warhol),
voyeurism and various homo-erotic acts. Surprisingly, the show has attracted
neither the wrath of the Roman Catholic Church nor enthusiastic art lovers
in dirty macs.
Thankfully we are cheered by the burlesque of the magic lanterns in 'The
Cinema of Love', and by the great love scenes of the silver screen. Nine
extracts play continually, from Bunuel's Un Chien Andolou to Zabriskie
Point. Around us Valentino, Garbo and Rita Hayworth smoulder from
promotional posters.
The show closes on a note of purification with 'The Triumph of Love'. That
proves another odd-ball assortment from Dante to Jim Dine, the latter's
'Twins in the Forest' a life-size and roughly hewn Adam and Eve ornamented
with spanners, saws, scythes and any number of tool-shed cast-offs. Geddit?]
L'Amore: Dall'Olympo all'alcova' continues at the Mole Antonelliana, Turin,
until October 4.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: The Opening - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any evening in the dance theatre that ends with Maurice Bejart's Rite of
Spring comes with a guarantee of impending doom, as we await the rutting
animal capers that will bring the curtain down. But Wednesday night's triple
bill by the Berlin Ballet was hell-bent from the first. To start a programme
with Bill T. Jones' The Opening is to offer the most miserable activities as
portrait of a company.
Purporting to deal with the Ballet after the destruction of the Berlin Wall,
its only connection with that event is to show choreographic rubble as a
parallel with the Wall's fate. There is a sound track (compiled by John
Oswald) in which recordings of music used for dance at the Deutsche Oper are
turned into a confetti of single bars, notes, phrases, that are, in certain
super-brutish instances, layered one on another. It is a profoundly
tasteless assemblage.
On a bare stage - with a golden figure from one of Berlin's monuments as
back-drop - twenty-seven dancers wear a rag-bag of costuming from the
theatre's wardrobe. They run, posture, trudge through snippets of their
repertory as scrappy and insolent as the sound-track. Of choreographic
scheme, invention, sense, I could discern no trace. A man and a woman
indulge in a running fight. Fatuity rules. The piece is an affront to the
Berlin artists and to the history of the company. How welcome and valuable
would have been the revival of a work by Tatiana Gsovsky, an important and
neglected choreographer who was the architect of the Berlin Ballet's rebirth
after the war.
There followed Christopher Bruce's Swansong. This portrait of a man under
interrogation - though Bruce has advised us that it might also be about the
ardours of a dancer's life - is very popular with audiences. Its great merit
is in the stunning role it has given Koen Onzia as the victim, and in a
guest appearance, he repeats his customary triumph. It is a reading of
dazzling physical resource, the ideas of terror and anguish marvellously
exact in expression.
There is little that remains to be said about the Bejart Rite of Spring,
which has been lumbering across the world's stages for the past three
decades, save that it is a cleverly packaged sex-act which combines
Disney-ish anthropomorphism with emotional blatancy. The boys are on heat;
the girls are tremulously expectant. They meet. They couple. (The piece
should be subtitled Congress Dances). The Berlin artists bounce and leap
with a will, and behave as if it mattered. A programme note announces that
these will be the last London performances of Bejart's Rite, since the
maestro has decided to withdraw the work from the stage. Who says prayer
goes unanswered?
The Berlin Ballet is at The Coliseum until July 4, with varied programming.
Support for the season comes from Montblanc (UK).

If I said that Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, whose embarrassing comedy
series Bottom is being repeated on BBC2 (9.00), were 'white and proud', or
that Hale and Pace, whose tacky comedy series Hale and Pace is being
repeated on Channel 4 (10.30), were experts at creating 'white centred
comedy', television producers would be appalled. Why, then, are they so
ready to patronise Lenny Henry by lauding his 'black centred comedy'? It is
true he is black, but equally true that Chaplin and Keaton were white. Do we
celebrate their comedy in terms of their skin colour? Who cares? Television
executives do because they believe in apartheid. They think that without
special treatment black people will never make it, hence ghetto slots where
blacks don't have to compete for attention with more gifted whites. What
hooey. The billing for today's repeat of a Lenny Henry Show (10.00 BBC2)
asserts that Henry is 'one of the few comedians successfuly to have created
black-centred comedy'. What about Gary Wilmot, Sammy Davis Jr, and Norman
Beaton? Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy?
The trouble with broadcasting executives is that they see so little
television.

FT  03 JUL 92 / People: Crest Nicholson builds up its board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Erith, who was the City's number one rated analyst of the building
industry for more than a dozen years, has joined the board of Crest
Nicholson, one of Britain's battered housebuilders, along with John
Matthews, the merchant banker who helped advise Beazer on some of its
biggest deals.
John Callcutt, who took over as Crest's chief executive a year ago, says
that 'both are not only well known financial men but are also well known for
the knowledge of our industry'. He said that Crest had consulted Proned, the
body which promotes non-executive directors, about the appointments.
Erith, 53, a former senior partner of Savory Milln, is probably best known
in the City for producing his annual building book - a tome filled with
facts and figures about the industry. Although he has not been involved in
analysing companies for some years - he is chairman of the equities group of
Swiss Bank Corporation - he maintains close ties with the industry.
Erith has known Geoffrey Fox, one of Crest Nicholson's founding directors
for over 30 years, and is deputy chairman of Erith, a family firm of
builders' merchants. He said yesterday that Crest had got itself into 'very
much better shape' following its problems last year. It had written down the
value of its landbank 'very hard', and reduced its gearing.
John Matthews, 47, has had a less traditional career than Erith. Having been
a senior director of County NatWest, he went on to become deputy chairman of
Beazer, the acquisitive building materials company which was taken over by
Hanson last year. He is currently chief executive of Financiere Indosuez.

FT  03 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: No undertaking for Sunday trading ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KIRKLEES BOROUGH COUNCIL v WICKES BUILDING SUPPLIES LTD House of Lords (Lord
Keith, Lord Ackner, Lord Goff of Chieveley, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle and
Lord Lowry): June 25 1992
A LOCAL authority exercising its law enforcement functions can seek an
injunction to restrain retailers from breach of the statutory prohibition on
Sunday trading; and the court has a discretion whether or not to require it,
as a condition of grant of the injunction, to undertake to make good any
damage suffered by the retailer should the prohibition be invalid under EC
law.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the Kirklees Borough
Council from a Court of Appeal decision that it was required to give an
undertaking in damages as a condition of its being granted an interlocutory
injunction to restrain Wickes Building Supplies Ltd from Sunday trading.
LORD GOFF said Sunday trading was prohibited by section 47 of the Shops Act
1950.
The ineffectiveness of prosecution to deter large stores from Sunday opening
had caused local authorities charged with enforcement of section 47 to
search for a more effective remedy. They had resorted to seeking injunctions
to restrain stores from infringing the section.
Now stores were invoking EC law. The argument was that section 47 could not
stand because, it was said, it was inconsistent with article 30 of the EC
Treaty which was of direct effect and prohibited quantitive measures on
imports and all measures having equivalent effect.
On May 14 1990 the council obtained from Mr Justice Mervyn Davies an
interlocutory injunction restraining Wickes until trial from using premises
in the Kirklees area for Sunday trading.
On the evidence before him Wickes had been trading on Sundays and intended
to continue doing so unless restrained by the court. It was common ground
that Wickes's Sunday trading was in breach of section 47 unless that section
had been rendered ineffective by article 30 of the treaty.
The judge, applying the principles in Hoffmann-La Roche (1975) AC 295, held
that since the council was engaged in law enforcement duties, he had a
discretion whether to require it to give an undertaking in damages. He
exercised that discretion against requiring an undertaking.
As a result of that decision many other local authorities obtained
interlocutory injunctions restraining Sunday trading.
The Court of Appeal decided that the judge had erred in not requiring the
council to give an undertaking.
The result was that large retail stores were trading on Sundays up and down
the country, undeterred by the threat of criminal prosecution and
unrestrained by injunction.
Section 71(1) of the Shops Act 1950 provided that it was the duty of every
local authority to enforce the provisions of the Act 'and for that purpose
to institute and carry on such proceedings in respect of contraventions as
may be necessary to secure observance thereof'.
Section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 provided that local authorities
'in the case of civil proceedings, may institute them in their own name'.
On the face of those two statutory provisions it appeared that proceedings
in its own name by way of injunction were open to a local authority in order
to secure observance of section 47.
The Court of Appeal required the council to give the undertaking because,
first, it held that in English law the discretion to dispense with it was
available only to give effect to a Crown privilege, and did not extend to
local authorities exercising the function of law enforcement; and second,
because under EC law an undertaking must be given where necessary to protect
any EC law right of direct effect which might possibly be affected.
In Hoffmann-La Roche the secretary of state claimed an injunction
restraining Hoffmann-La Roche from charging prices for drugs in excess of
those specified in an Order approved by Parliament. The House of Lords held
he was not required to give an undertaking in damages to recompense
Hoffmann-La Roche in the event of the Order being invalid.
Previously it had been generally accepted that the requirement of an
undertaking in damages as a condition of the grant of an interlocutory
injunction did not apply in the case of the Crown. The origin of that rule
lay in the fact that since the Crown was not liable in damages in the
ordinary way, an undertaking requirement would be inconsistent with its
immunity from liability. The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 had removed the
justification for the rule.
The question in the present case was whether the Hoffmann-La Roche principle
should apply in the case of public authorities other than the Crown charged
with enforcement of the law.
The majority in the Court of Appeal concluded that it should not apply. Lord
Justice Dillon said it was 'a privilege of the Crown alone'.
Hoffmann-La Roche did not confer a privilege on the Crown. On the contrary,
it dismantled an old Crown privilege and substituted a principle on which,
in certain limited circumstances, the court had a discretion.
It was difficult to understand why the same principle should not in similar
circumstances apply to other public authorities when exercising the function
of law enforcer in the public interest.
The breadth of section 71(1) of the 1950 Act was such as to embrace
injunction proceedings brought under the power subsequently conferred by
section 222 of the 1972 Act.
There was no material difference between the council in the present case and
the Crown in Hoffmann-La Roche. The court's discretion to require an
undertaking applied to public authorities exercising the function of law
enforcement in the circumstances specified in Hoffmann-La Roche.
It followed that, apart from the question of the impact of EC law, such was
the discretion which the courts should have exercised in the present case.
The Court of Appeal majority held that the court was bound by EC law to
require an undertaking in damages from the council if an interlocutory
injunction was to be granted. That conclusion based on the premise inter
alia that if Wickes was right that section 47 was incompatible with article
30, it had a current right to open its stores for Sunday trading and it was
the national court's duty to protect that right.
The question whether section 47 was inconsistent with article 30 had been
referred to the European Court of Justice in Torfaen (1990) QB 19. In
Stoke-on-Trent (1984) AC 754 Mr Justice Hoffmann, interpreting and applying
Torfaen, granted an injunction. Matters changed after the Court of Appeal
decision in the present case. By the time Stoke-on-Trent came before the
House of Lords, Torfaen had been followed by Conforama (Case C 312/89) and
Marchandise (Case C 332/89). The House felt compelled to make a reference to
Europe.
If the European Court should hold in Stoke-on-Trent that section 47 was
invalid as being in conflict with article 30, the UK might be obliged to
make good damage caused to individuals by the breach of article 30 for which
it was responsible.
It did not follow, however, that the council should be obliged to give an
undertaking in damages as a condition of the grant of an injunction.
That was because the obligation (if any) on the UK to make good any damage
suffered by Wickes would arise irrespective of any undertaking in damages.
In the circumstances, such an undertaking would be superfluous.
Wickes's argument that the council should be required to give an undertaking
in damages had no justification in EC law.
For the council: Stuart Isaacs QC, Timothy Straker and Neil Calver (Sharpe
Pritchard for MRG Vause, Huddersfield).
For Wickes: Andrew Collins QC and Paul Lasok (Edwin Coe for Metcalfe Copeman
Pettefar, Peterborough).
For the Attorney General intervening: Stephen Richards and Nicholas Paines
(Treasury Solicitor).

FT  03 JUL 92 / People: Maples takes on Saatchi role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It sometimes pays to be on the winning side, even if you are a loser, as
Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman who lost Bath in the UK's April
general election learnt. He quickly became governor of Hong Kong.
Now another Tory loser, John Maples, formerly economic secretary to the
Treasury and loser of the seat at Lewisham West, has also quickly picked up
another job. He has been appointed chairman of yet another new Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi advertising subsidiary, this one to be called Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
government communications worldwide, or SSGCW.
Few can forget the heroic role played by the Saatchi's in the Conservative
party's regular election victories. Three executives have been seconded to
assist Maples in his new role, which apparently will be to 'deal with
communications between governments and their people and people and their
governments'.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 58.4m for its last
financial 12 months, and chief executive Robert Louis-Dreyfus is struggling
hard to persuade those 300 group executives annually earning Pounds 150,000
and above to take cuts.
Michael Herson, formerly sales and marketing director of Greater London
Supplies, and Richard Miles, marketing and development director of the
branded restaurants division of Allied Breweries, have been appointed
director of commercial development and director of operations, respectively,
of PITMAN EDUCATION &amp; TRAINING.
*****
Michael Irvine has been appointed deputy md of REDIFFUSION SIMULATION; he
joins from Electro-Optical and Data Systems Group of the parent company
Hughes Aircraft Company.
*****
Michael Churn has been appointed director, fuels marketing for MOBIL OIL;
John Banfield, director lubes and commercial marketing, is to be appointed
president designate of Mobil Oil bv based in Rotterdam.

Julian Agnew has been appointed chairman of AGNEW's on the retirement of
Evelyn Joll, who remains a director.

<TEXT>
COMPUTER software vendors lose an estimated 40 per cent of their potential
revenue to software theft, euphemistically called 'under-licensing.' That
particularly happens when customers, who usually pay a fixed fee for using
software on designated hardware, run it on other machines.
Now US-based Proginet, a software developer for IBM mainframe host systems,
has unveiled Software Meter, the first product that enables software vendors
to record precisely how frequently and where their mainframe software is
used.
Software Meter automatically monitors a customer's applications software use
and produces a report listing the software product name, customer
identification number, units of usage, frequency of use and platform size
and type.
The information is relayed back to the vendor, by a telephone network link,
and the vendor can then charge the customer accordingly.

cleaning agent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AMONG the special properties of 'dry ice', or solidified carbon dioxide, are
its ability to change straight from a solid into a gas and to evaporate
leaving no residue.
Distillers MG, part of the German Messer Griesheim industrial gas group, has
devised a cryogenic system for industrial cleaning called Cold Jet which
uses dry ice to loosen and remove surface coatings.
The Cold Jet cleaning system uses small pellets of dry ice which are blown
in a stream of compressed air at the surface to be cleaned.
Thermal shock weakens the the bond of the coating or contamination, which is
then removed by the compressed air flow and slight attrition effect of dry
ice pellets. The pellets disintegrate on impact and sublime into a gas.
The system offers several advantages over conventional cleaning methods,
including speed, lower waste disposal costs, and hygienically clean
surfaces.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Management: Cleaning up after communism - Unilever has
ambitious plans for local manufacturing and sales in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From a Warsaw office building where General Jaruzelski once chaired meetings
of the politburo, Hans Overgoor, chairman of Unilever's operations in
Poland, busies himself today keeping the nation's laundry whiter than white.
It has been a full-time task since he was parachuted into the job a year
ago, when the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company bought Pollena
Bydgoszcz, a large Polish detergents producer, and set about turning it into
a viable modern business.
The results are already starting to show. Pollena, re-named Lever Polska,
has raised output by more than 50 per cent, is market leader in washing
powder and is expanding its range. Though Overgoor will give no figures, he
says sales this year will exceed 'many times' the roughly Dollars 30m made
in the second half of last year.
Unilever is keenly aware that making a success of Lever Polska is important
in a country which craves foreign investment but views multinational
companies with some suspicion. 'If you want to make further acquisitions,
you have to handle the first one well,' says Hans Eggerstedt, Unilever's
main board director responsible for Europe.
The operation is also the flagship of a plan to establish a local
manufacturing and sales network in eastern Europe on a scale equalled by
few, if any, competitors. Eggerstedt expects Unilever to have production in
all three countries in the region and annual sales of as much as Pounds 700m
in five years, by when the operations should all be profitable.
The strategy is the fruit of a meticulous planning exercise begun more than
two years ago. Once the broad goals were set, teams of experts descended on
the region to scout for potential acquisitions, tour plants and talk to
managers. Having identified its targets, Unilever has stuck to its guns,
resisting opportunistic buys.
In Hungary, Unilever has acquired VMTV, an ice-cream maker, and last
February teamed up with Ferruzzi, the Italian agribusiness company, to buy
NMV, a producer of oilseeds, margarine and detergents. Unilever also has a
Czech ice-cream joint venture and aims to round off its acquisitions this
year with a food business in Poland and food and detergents companies in
Czechoslovakia.
Though many day-to-day responsibilities have been left with managers and
staff of the acquired plants, teams of expatriate executives have been
dispatched to give advice and training. These 'facilitators' are hand-picked
for above-average ability and a talent for coaching local managers, who are
expected eventually to run the businesses. 'In the longer term, foreigners
can't play more than a marginal role,' says Andre Mico, head of Unilever in
Hungary.
Because Unilever vetted its acquisitions closely before purchase, their
factories have produced few surprises. Quality is said to be satisfactory
and Pollena's output was increased largely by ironing out bottlenecks in the
plant.
Redundancies have so far been avoided at Pollena. But Unilever, which
refuses to commit itself to fixed employment levels, expects to cut staff in
Hungary by as much as 15 per cent annually over several years.
Unilever is now upgrading its plants to handle technologically advanced
products, most of which are still imported from the west. It plans to invest
at least Dollars 24m (Pounds 12.9m) in Pollena, including adding a liquid
detergents production line, and Dollars 10m to treble VMTV's capacity to 10m
litres of ice-cream a year. Mico expects 90 per cent of VMTV's sales to be
locally produced by the end of next year, up from 25 per cent today.
Manufacturing is heavily influenced by brand strategy. Unilever is pursuing
a twin-track approach, keeping the better local brands while steadily adding
international ones, with prices about 50 per cent higher than local
equivalents.
Lever Polska's most successful product, Pollena 2000 washing powder, was
developed before the company was acquired - as was its television
commercial. Based on a Polish legend, its punchline, 'Dad, beat him up]' has
entered the local vernacular. In Hungary, however, sales of Panda, VMTV's
ice-cream brand, melted away after Unilever began importing products from
western Europe.
Though enthusiasm for western brands is strong in eastern Europe,
positioning products can be tricky. For instance, some consumers believe
locally-made products - even when they carry international brands - are
inferior to imported ones.
Market research is still rudimentary: Overgoor is unsure even how many
Polish households have washing machines. He relies heavily for marketing
guidance on informal soundings with colleagues, customers and individual
consumers.
Pitching advertising correctly also calls for careful judgment. Unilever has
found that glamour and glitz work for toilet soap, but a more informative,
down-to-earth message is needed for detergents.
One challenge which even Unilever's careful planning has not been able to
deal with is eastern Europe's chaotic and rapidly-changing distribution
systems. 'The trade environment makes it very hard to reach the consumer,'
says Mico. 'The really critical bottleneck to be tackled is to establish a
sales force and manage the supply chain.'
In Poland, Unilever estimates that a third of its products are sold through
street traders, even though it does not supply them directly. 'Distribution
is developed only in the sense that, one way or another, products seem to
find their way onto the shelves,' says Overgoor.
Until the situation stabilises, improvisation will remain important. As well
as working with and training selected local wholesalers and shops, Unilever
is building up sales forces and distributing some products itself. Mico has
called in colleagues from developing countries to advise him. Says Overgoor:
'Basically, we try anything that works'.
Both men hope the current turmoil is simply a transition phase, and that
more efficient and professional distribution systems will emerge in eastern
Europe later this decade. Judging by the daily pressures they face now, the
change cannot come a moment too soon.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Management: Toothpaste giants apply the squeeze - Nicholas
Denton looks at a state-owned Hungarian group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the fierce competition for eastern Europe's turbulent consumer markets,
it is the innocents who suffer. One of them is Tihamer Gedeon, beleaguered
managing director of Caola, the Hungarian state-owned cosmetics and
household chemicals manufacturer.
Competition from western multinationals since imports were liberalised at
the start of 1991 has broken Caola's near monopoly, reducing the company's
market share to 40 per cent. Turnover has fallen in step, the 1992 forecast
of Ft4.3bn (Pounds 28.6m) representing a halving in real terms since 1990.
In toothpaste, for instance, three multinationals are battling for market
share - and incidentally squeezing out Caola. Procter &amp; Gamble has taken the
lead with 30 per cent, with Colgate-Palmolive following strongly on 15 per
cent and rising. Now Unilever too has entered the market with the successful
launch of its Signal brand.
Caught in the middle, Caola has found its share of sales falling from 70 per
cent to just over 30 per cent in two years. The company now claims to have
stabilised its position and ironically, it is economic depression that has
given the company its temporary reprieve.
When cash-strapped Hungarian consumers compare the western price tags with
cheap local products on the shelves, enough of them economise to keep Caola
in business - just. But Caola faces a new threat as recovery approaches. 'We
have to prepare for the time when people don't just want cheap products but
have the money to buy better,' says Gedeon.
In this refusal to give up lies a minor miracle. The surprise is not that
Caola has been battered by western competition but rather that the company
has survived and is even fighting back. Gedeon insists he relishes the
competition. Caola languished in 'stagnant water' while it remained a
monopoly, he explains.
The company has pared down its product line from 800 to its 200 strongest
items. It is now going on the offensive with the launch of Heviz, a range of
pharmaceutical face and body creams named after one of the springs for which
Hungary is famed.
But Gedeon admits that, for all his efforts, Caola needs a western investor
to survive. 'We could last two or three years alone but we don't want to
wait.' And time may be running out even faster than that: as Caola weakens,
its attraction to western multinationals is fading.
Caola may indeed already have missed its best chance. Colgate-Palmolive bid
for the company last year but pulled out at the last minute, saying that the
company's worth was vanishing along with its market share.
Since then, failure has continued to breed failure. Beiersdorf, the German
manufacturer, has taken back distribution of Nivea and other products which
had been licensed by Caola.
Most ominously of all, Caola's most dynamic executives are voting with their
feet. Tamas Suto, Caola's go-ahead marketing head, now works for the
competition - Colgate-Palmolive. 'All the knowledge I had was wasted there,'
he says.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Management: Strategies that are based on an import duty
gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever has so far invested Dollars 120m in manufacturing facilities in
eastern Europe, and is likely to spend several times as much again in the
next few years, writes Guy de Jonquieres.
But why did it not save costs simply by exporting from its many western
European plants?
The group gives three reasons: to avoid import duties - as much as 40 per
cent on margarine in Hungary; to acquire market share quickly; and because
most eastern European countries' external trade positions are too frail to
afford large imports.
By producing in each country, Unilever also stands to gain from its image as
a contributor to local wealth creation. Indeed, Polish government officials
responsible for privatisation describe the group as a model corporate
citizen.
But Unilever's strategy is in sharp contrast with that of US arch-rival
Procter &amp; Gamble, which aims to centralise detergents production for eastern
Europe at a plant it acquired last year in Czechoslovakia. In theory, that
could give P&amp;G superior scale and efficiency.
Which strategy proves right may depend on what happens to import duties.
Unilever believes they will stay high for some time.
But Eggerstedt admits local production could be 'a risky proposition' if
eastern Europe succeeds in creating a common market. In that event,
Unilever's factories in the region would step up exports to western Europe.
That could complicate its current drive to rationalise surplus west European
capacity. But Eggerstedt says there would be no real choice because 'even if
we didn't export, others would.'

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher urges 'rethink' on treaty
 -Debates in the Lords and Commons strengthened the attack on the government
over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S attempt to find a way through the difficulties over the
Maastricht treaty came under fire from Baroness Thatcher yesterday, as she
used her first speech in the House of Lords to urge the Community to 'think
again'.
'Searching for a definition of subsidiarity is not a way forward,' she said,
pointing out that it appeared to be being discussed on the basis that the
Community had the power which it then parcelled out to the member states.
'It should be the member states that exercise all powers except those
specifically and legally granted to the Commission,' she concluded.
Her own proposal was for the government to press for a formal and binding
restatement of the Luxembourg compromise - under which if a country feels
that a vital national interest is at stake, a vote is postponed until
agreement can be reached. She said the move, though limited, would 'go some
way to restore people's confidence in the Community.'
Lady Thatcher's renewed call for a referendum on Maastricht received some
support from Lord Callaghan, a former Labour prime minister. He acknowledged
the force of her point that because all three parties had the policy of
ratifying Maastricht, the British people have had no way of expressing a
view on the matter in the election.
Lord Callaghan said he believed the treaty should be ratified and the
government should argue the case for acceptance in a referendum after the
bill had been passed.
Although maiden speeches are conventionally uncontroversial, it was clear
that peers had been looking forward to an occasion billed as being anything
but. Crowded in the doorways and seated on the steps of the throne, they
listened intently throughout the 25-minute speech, in what would normally be
a routine debate on developments in Europe. A huddle of Euro-sceptic MPs
looked down from the gallery, joined by Mr Graham Bright, the prime
minister's parliamentary private secretary.
Lady Thatcher warned that as EC ministers spent more time in each other's
company they became out of touch with their electors. 'Justifiable
scepticism is on the increase. People feel that their governments have gone
ahead too fast, so that now the gap between governments and people is too
wide,' she said.
She rounded on the message that had been coming from government loyalists,
that the powers transferred to the Community under the Maastricht agreement
were comparable with those transferred in the Single European Act which was
approved during her premiership. Any comparison was, she said, misplaced,
and she drew particular attention to the assurances given by Lord Howe of
Aberavon, then Sir Geoffrey Howe, and Baroness Chalker - the foreign office
ministers at the time - about the restrictions on the extended use of
qualified majority voting to bring about the single market.
Lady Thatcher supported the government's efforts to persuade the other EC
countries of the need for urgency in enlarging the Community.
She underlined the primary importance of bringing in eastern European
countries to help sustain their democracies and economies, even though they
would need a long transition period. She also emphasised that one of the
main aims of the UK's presidency of the EC must be to sustain relief
supplies for Sarajevo and other parts of what was Yugoslavia, and warned:
'We should be ready to use the air power available to Nato in the area.'

FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith plans review of Labour aims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, plans to present a paper at Labour's
annual conference in Blackpool this autumn spelling out an updated
re-interpretation of the party's core aims and values.
The paper, now under discussion in the Smith camp, will draw strongly on the
strands of Labour thinking that deal with the liberation of the individual
in society and play down the role of the state as manager and social
engineer.
While the contender for Labour party leadership has taken pains not to
appear to be pre-empting his certain victory at the electoral conference on
July 18, planning is already well under way for his first 18 months.
The 10,000 word discussion document, which will be drawn up in consultation
with close colleagues, is likely to be put to the National Executive
Committee for approval as a catalyst to spark a year-long public debate on
the party's future.
Mr Smith has already let it be known to colleagues that he is anxious to
avoid any headlong rush back to policy planning before an intellectual
framework for the future has been developed.
He is determined to use a year of debate to highlight the party's history of
progressive thinking and achievements in a bid to build confidence and
counter the doomsayers now disparaging Labour as wedded to a discredited
philosophy.
Senior figures close to Mr Smith stressed yesterday that its aim was not to
define or close off Labour's objectives but to broaden them. It is intended
to expand debate well beyond the parameters outlined in a similar 'aims and
values' document written by Mr Roy Hattersley in 1987.
The Hattersley paper drew strongly on Labour's definition of freedom along
lines spelt out more fully in his treatise, Choose Freedom. This stressed
that Conservative notions of the concept failed to acknowledge that the
freedom of many was often curtailed by the freedom of a privileged few.
The 'right' to send a child into private education, for example, was not
enjoyed by those who could not afford to do so, Mr Hattersley had argued.
The Smith paper is expected to seek a balance between the state's role as a
propagator and promoter of the interests of society at large and its duty to
act as a watchdog of individual liberties.
It draws in part on a discussion of the role of community - the clumsily
named communitarianism - currently in vogue among some academics. The paper
is also expected to stress the seams of Labour philosophy that deal with the
liberation of the individual rather than the role of the state.
'It will be more William Morris than Herbert Morrison,' one Smith insider
said yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the twin dauphins of the Labour party,
are to run for the national executive committee - their first electoral test
in the party's national arena.
With nominations for the national executive elections closing today, their
decision to run - undoubtedly taken jointly - will prove an intriguing
measure of their popularity in the country at large and the mood of
activists in the party.
Both men are regularly named as the two shadow cabinet members most likely
to become the next Labour leader but one.
Both too will present themselves as stalwart allies of Mr John Smith and
champions of a thorough modernisation of the party.
As candidates for the NEC's seven-strong constituency section, their rivals
include a strong field of party heavyweights with Mr Neil Kinnock, the
outgoing leader, also contesting a place.
At present there is only one known 'vacancy' following the decision of Mr
Gerald Kaufman not to seek re-election for the NEC or the shadow cabinet.
Under a rule-change introduced last year, constituency Labour parties are
now obliged to ballot all their members on the principle of one member, one
vote.
That change was said to have contributed to Mr Kaufman's victory last year
and the fall in the vote for Mr Tony Benn, the veteran leftwinger.
In Labour's parliamentary elections yesterday, Mr Derek Foster, the chief
whip, comfortably saw off a challenge from Mr John Evans, an NEC member and
MP for St Helens North, by 158 votes to 90.
The first round in the contest for the chairmanship of the Parliamentary
Labour Party saw Mr Douglas Hoyle, a veteran leftwinger, top the poll with
85 votes.
Insiders believe, however, that Mr Ernie Ross, with 62 votes his nearest
rival in the five-horse race, will come through when exhaustive balloting is
completed.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Big increase seen in life expectancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STARTLING scale of lifestyle changes in Britain over the last 20 years
is underlined in the latest government statistics, which show big increases
in life expectancy and in travel and leisure habits.
Life expectancy for men jumped from 68.6 years in 1970 to 72.8 in 1990, and
life expectancy for women from 74.9 to 78.2. In 1970 only 4.7 per cent of
the population was aged over 75, but this had risen to 6.9 per cent 20 years
later. Women still outnumbered men by 1.4m in 1990, although this was down
from the 1.6m 20 years before.
Average earnings rose more than tenfold, from Pounds 26 a week to Pounds 263
 -but what a pound would have bought in 1970 would have cost Pounds 6.80 in
1990.
The period also saw a growing taste for travel, both at home and abroad. Air
travel showed the biggest increase - up from 2bn passenger kilometres in
1970 to 5.1bn in 1990.
Overseas travel became more popular in spite of the fact that Britain showed
signs of getting warmer. At home the average daytime temperature in England
and Wales rose from 10.10C in 1970 to 11.10C in 1990. In Scotland
temperatures rose from 8.30C to 9.30C. and in Ulster from 9.10C to 9.80C.
Rainfall declined in England and Wales over the period, although the pattern
was not consistent. There was 910mm of rainfall in 1970, rising to 979mm in
1980 before dropping to 814mm in 1989 and 838mm in 1990.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Christie's sell dinosaur egg for pounds 5,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Good egg: Christie's South Kensington yesterday sold a 70m-year-old
fossilised dinosaur egg for Pounds 5,500. The 18.2cm-long egg, which is
assumed to have come from a sauropod dinosaur Hypselosaurus, was found near
Aix-en-Provence, southern France, Clive Cookson writes.
Paleontologists have recovered hundreds of fossilised dinosaur eggs. Most
contain nothing but featureless stone when cracked open, but a few contain
remains of dinosaur embryos. If the new owner of the Hypselosaurus does not
want to risk the Pounds 5,500 investment by taking a hammer to the egg, it
would be possible to get an idea whether anything interesting is inside with
a specialised X-ray machine.

<TEXT>
the latest initiative aimed at tackling the Cumbrian port's economic
structural problems - is looking for a Pounds 40,000-a-year chief executive
to steer the town towards a future based on the service sector.
The company was created in response to Whitehaven's worsening unemployment
and its difficulties in attracting inward industrial investment.
The company's priorities include fostering leisure uses for Whitehaven's
port, which has just lost its last commercial cargo with the ending of
phosphate rock imports for the town's Albright &amp; Wilson chemicals works.
Coal shipping trade ceased in the 1980s when the last pits in west Cumbria
closed. The development company, a joint venture with the West Cumbria
Development Agency, hopes to smarten up the town and attract tourists.
Unemployment in Whitehaven is 8.6 per cent, below the national average, but
the area is being hit by the shedding of 5,000 construction jobs at the
nearby Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant. Cumbria County Council
has forecast unemployment rates of up to 25 per cent in the borough of
Copeland, which includes Whitehaven.
Mr David Shelton, development company board member, said promotion of
leisure and tourism would run alongside development of a business park and
industrial estate. But he warned: 'To think we will attract new heavy
industry opportunities would be deluding ourselves.'

<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS to the health service commissioner last year were the highest
since the establishment of the health ombudsman system in 1973.
Mr William Reid, the commissioner, received 1,176 complaints - a rise of
nearly 19 per cent on the previous year. 'The similar experience of other
ombudsmen suggests that the increase owes much to growing public awareness
of how to complain and to whom,' Mr Reid says in his annual report.
He stresses that it is vital that patients, faced with 'an array of new
authorities and organisational arrangements' under the National Health
Service reforms, should know how to make their complaints.
He had been assured by the government that all dissatisfied NHS patients
would have access to the ombudsman system.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Retail pay settlements 'low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE PAY settlements in retailing and distribution have more than halved
in value in the past year and are below the average for the whole economy,
according to a report.
Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group,
found in a survey of 100 pay reviews in the four months to April that the
median was 4.2 per cent against 8.5 per cent for the corresponding period
last year and 4.4 per cent for the whole economy this year.
Thirteen of the 100 organisations had implemented pay freezes or deferrals
of up to 12 months. However, where general freezes are in operation, it has
been common for low-paid employees to receive an award as companies comply
with wages-council orders.
The report identifies a trend of stretching pay budgets through
profit-related pay. For example, Robert Dyas, the ironmongers, has a
six-month pay pause in operation. However, the company has also introduced a
profit-related scheme which it says will give some 80 per cent of its 570
employees net increases of between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.

   A MOVIE that demonstrates how entertaining a bad movie can be
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that is how American critic Ms Pauline Kael described Casablanca, and for
six days from today London cinema-goers will have the chance to judge for
themselves.
The black-and-white classic is to be screened at the Empire cinema in
Leicester Square, and Turner Entertainment, which bought the MGM film
library in 1986, has gone into marketing and public relations overdrive to
promote one of its most famous assets.
In the UK, United International Pictures has the marketing rights for
Casablanca - and certainly one of the best marketing moves is to try to
convince the public that they are being offered some kind of exclusively
special deal.
Thus between today and July 8 only some 35,000 people - four daily shows
plus late nighters today and tomorrow in the 1,300-capacity cinema - will be
able to see Casablanca at the Empire, paying either Pounds 6.50 or Pounds 8
a seat.
Turner is unwilling to say how much it has spent on marketing Casablanca -
'we don't discuss financial figures' - but United is running a thorough
advertising campaign on the London Underground. That is just the tip of the
iceberg - the public relations promotion of the film has been massive, with
a glossy 24-page pack of everything you could possibly want to know about
the movie, media interviews and other hype.
If, after all that, you still don't make it to the Empire - where ticket
staff say 'there are still plenty of seats available' - then you could
always pop along to the National Film Theatre and spend Pounds 10.99 on a
video version.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, was criticised yesterday for
suggesting that Names unable to attend the extraordinary general meeting on
July 27 were unlikely to get a postal ballot.
Lloyd's governing council faces votes of no confidence at the meeting,
following the disclosure of Pounds 2bn losses in 1989.
Several Names attending the annual conference of the Association of Lloyd's
Members demanded that arrangements for a postal ballot were implemented for
the many people who would be unable to attend the meeting.
One overseas-based Name said the council would be making a 'grievous
mistake' if it disenfranchised a large number of members from taking part in
a crucial vote.
Mr Coleridge said he could not give an immediate answer. He was taking legal
advice and consulting the Electoral Reform Society, although the position
would not be resolved for another week.
He suggested that there was insufficient time to organise a postal ballot,
which would be costly, lengthy and potentially damaging to the standing of
Lloyd's.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Maxwell report to be kept secret
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, said
yesterday that it would not publish the text of a long-awaited report on
regulators' responsibilities in the Maxwell affair.
'SIB has been advised that publication of the full report could prejudice
pending legal proceedings,' the watchdog said in a statement yesterday.
Instead, it would eventually publish a statement setting out its assessments
of regulators' roles and outlining actions it is taking.
It will also publish conclusions of a report by the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation, the self-regulating body for the fund management
industry, about its own role in the Maxwell affair.
Imro authorised and supervised two Maxwell-controlled companies which
managed nearly Pounds 800m of pension funds. Fund managers lent securities
from pension funds and those securities were later used as collateral for
loans to Robert Maxwell's personal interests.
Imro's report is believed to accept some of the blame for failing to spot
the theft of more than Pounds 400m from pension funds controlled by Robert
Maxwell, and to be critical of some of his professional advisers including
the auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Coopers is said to have protested vigorously to SIB about Imro's
characterisation of its role.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Court rules out 'duty of care' towards Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday won a landmark decision in the High Court that
it has no specific legal responsibility to look after the interests of
Names.
Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled that Lloyd's had no 'duty of care' in a case
brought in the name of Ashmore and 32 other plaintiffs who were Names on the
now defunct Oakeley Vaughan syndicates.
The decision will make extremely difficult any further attempts by Names who
have lost money on syndicates to seek compensation from Lloyd's in its role
as regulator of the market.
However, Mr Michael Freeman, solicitor for the Names, said after the
decision that he had already met some of the plaintiffs and there would be
an appeal.
The judge's decision rested on several issues concerned with the scope of
the 1911 Lloyd's Act, the principal legislation by which the market was
constituted until a new act was passed in 1982.
He ruled that while Lloyd's had duties to regulate and to act fairly, it did
not have a specific duty of care to Names. He also clarified that the 1982
Act - which specifies the duties of Lloyd's more precisely - came into
effect as soon as it received Royal Assent in July 1982.
Lloyd's said yesterday it was 'very pleased' with the decision. But it
added: 'This will not affect (our) continuous determination to regulate the
market in a way that is both fair to members and allows the business to
prosper.'
Nevertheless, it said it had always recognised the obligation to deal fairly
with members of Lloyd's in the exercise of its regulatory powers.
One plaintiff, who did not want to be named, said: 'The general move among
us is to carry on. This is definitely going to be appealed. It's a bad day
for Lloyd's. Lloyd's pleading that it has no duty of care means Names have
absolutely no redress at all and are absolutely unprotected.'
He said many members' agents and managing agents were no longer taking out
professional indemnity insurance. Combined with Lloyd's lack of duty, that
meant Names had none of the compensation mechanisms available to investors
in other regulated industries.
'This ruling must seriously affect any Names thinking about the future,' he
said. 'It means Lloyd's can have an investigation, keep the report secret
and Names have no redress.'
Another plaintiff said he was considering taking Lloyd's to a European
court.

FT  03 JUL 92 / City told to tighten regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE City's self-regulatory system must demonstrate its ability to get tough
with its own members in the aftermath of the Maxwell affair or face being
replaced with a more hostile watchdog, according to the chairman of the
self-regulating body for the stockbroking industry.
'Self-regulation is under attack from the media and from parliament,' said
Mr Christopher Sharples, chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority.
'In a sense, we are in the Last-Chance Saloon for self-regulation.'
Mr Sharples' remarks were made as the SFA unveiled its report for 1991-92,
which showed that the group had begun 23 disciplinary proceedings in the
period covered and fined members just over Pounds 1m.
Revelations about City firms' connections with the theft of over Pounds 400m
from pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell - even if those
firms had no knowledge of the theft - had brought the entire regulatory
structure into question, he said.
Separately, it has emerged that the SFA is considering disciplinary
proceedings against four of its members which have been named in a writ
issued by MGN pension trustees in connection with the disappearance of
Pounds 88m from the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme. The four are
Capel-Cure Myers, Lehman Brothers International, Bank of America and Credit
Suisse. The SFA is said to be awaiting the four members' response to the
writ before formally considering any action.
The writ alleges that Lehman Brothers, Bank of America and Credit Suisse
accepted collateral for loans to Maxwell that were in fact the property of
the MGN pension scheme, and charges that Lehman knew or ought to have known
that the securities were owned by the pension fund. It also alleges that, at
least some months before Maxwell died, some of the firms suspected that
assets were being diverted from the pension schemes.
The SFA's options in disciplining a member range from censure to barring it
from all or part of its securities activities.
Mr Sharples said that so far, self-regulation has proven to be more
successful than its critics acknowledge. The system prevents regulation from
becoming a bar to innovation, he said.
However, if Britain's retail financial service companies fail to agree on
the formation of an integrated self-regulating body for their own
businesses, political pressure to scrap the current system completely is
likely to arise, Mr Sharples said.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Fears of delay over HK airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR British and Chinese officials meet in Beijing today to try to break
the deadlock over financing Hong Kong's HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds 11.9bn)
new airport and related infrastructure. However, the British and Hong Kong
side is still unsure whether China is looking to settle the issue quickly.
The talks are expected to last less than a week.
Beijing was given details by the Hong Kong government more than three months
ago but has still not communicated its view on the financing of all aspects
of the project.
The British team is led by Sir John Coles, deputy under-secretary of state
at the Foreign Office, who is acting as the personal emissary of Mr John
Major, the prime minister. Mr Major agreed the talks with Li Peng, his
Chinese counterpart, during discussions at the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro last month.
Discussions so far have centred on a rail link between the airport and urban
areas of the colony, but the Chinese have not yet discussed the airport. The
cost of the railway has risen from HKDollars 12.5bn to HKDollars 22.2bn, in
March 1991 prices, and Beijing doubts the government's ability to control
its cost.
Beijing has also expressed doubts about a form of guarantee, known as
'callable equity', which the Hong Kong government wants to give the two main
public corporations responsible for the project. This equity can be called
if the projects get in trouble, but Beijing regards it as a potential burden
on the post-1997 government of the colony.
Discussions about financing offer China its last opportunity to exercise
political leverage on this issue. British officials are seriously worried
that the Chinese government will link its consent on financing to political
developments in Hong Kong. Approval might then be delayed for months as Mr
Chris Patten, the governor designate, is not expected to make any big
political changes until the autumn.
Such a delay could threaten the undertaking Britain gave last September to
finish the project before June 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong reverts
to China. It could also undermine the international financial community's
readiness to lend the project money.
The government needs China's consent before the local legislature rises for
its summer recess towards the end of this month. The finance committee of
the legislature has to approve the financing before the Provisional Airport
Authority can let a contract to construct the platform for the airport. The
PAA wants to do this in early August.

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LORD WILSON, Hong Kong's outgoing governor, yesterday defended his approach
to negotiation with China, saying talks were best conducted in private where
patience and explanation were required to overcome mutual suspicion.
'You do not get many plaudits for this approach, but it is the only way to
do it,' he said a day before he gives up his post. 'That is in no way what
is sometimes characterised as a policy of weakness; it is just a commonsense
approach.' Lord Wilson hit out at 'intellectual Luddites' in Britain who
suggested a knowledge of China was of little use in governing the colony or
in dealing with China. That was 'akin to saying 'let's have ignorance rather
than knowledge',' he said.
Lord Wilson, a leading Foreign Office sinologist before his appointment as
governor five-and-a-half years ago, has accepted retirement earlier than he
wished.
His replacement by Mr Chris Patten, a professional politician, was widely
seen as the result of dissatisfaction in London with the performance of a
senior bureaucrat in a job which increasingly required sensitive political
antennae. Lord Wilson praised Mr Patten's political talents, saying the
former Conservative party chairman would make a good governor. Mr Patten
takes over next Thursday.
During his term in office Lord Wilson had to deal with the influx of
Vietnamese refugees, the aftermath in Hong Kong of the June 1989 Tiananmen
incident, and gruelling negotiations with the Chinese government over
democracy in the colony and plans to build a new airport.
He won widespread praise for his leadership after June 1989 and his
forthright stand on the issue of British nationality for Hong Kong people.
But he has been criticised by colony liberals for being too prepared to see
Beijing's point of view in dealing with other issues, notably the pace of
democratisation.
Sectional dissatisfaction with his leadership was made plain on Wednesday
when members of the United Democrats, who swept popular elections last
September, pointedly failed to applaud his valedictory speech to the
legislature. Yesterday, Lord Wilson said there was a general wish in Hong
Kong to move to a more representative form of government but the community
was divided on the speed of that development.
China has given the Shenzhen special economic zone power to make its own
laws, Reuter reports from Beijing. Just over the border from Hong Kong,
Shenzhen, has had to rely on Guangdong province for its legislation until
now.
The decision was taken by the standing committee of China's parliament. The
Shenzhen had argued it needed the power to help regulate its booming
economy.

FT  03 JUL 92 / NZ deficit at twice forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS Ruth Richardson, the New Zealand finance minister, unveiled a deficit of
NZDollars 3.2bn (Pounds 916m) for 1991-92 in her annual budget speech
yesterday, nearly twice the amount forecast last year.
She predicted that the deficit would rise to NZDollars 3.3bn this year, fall
to NZDollars 2.8bn in 1994 and to NZDollars 2.3bn by 1995. Ms Richardson
said she was far from comfortable with these forecasts, but would not
increase taxes. Instead she would control the deficits by checking
government spending and countering tax avoidance.
The budget contained no new initiatives, in contrast to the sweeping changes
to the welfare state that Ms Richardson announced last year in what she then
called the 'mother of all budgets'. Many of these were amended or withdrawn
because of public protest or because they were considered unworkable.
Among the few changes yesterday, the government is to boost education
spending by NZDollars 100m and put an extra NZDollars 90m into employment
and training schemes.
The budget announced a number of new tax measures including taxing business
entertainment expenditure, and taxing New Zealand residents on their
worldwide income.
A plan to develop the biggest exotic forest in New Zealand, in erosion-prone
land on the North Island's East Cape, an area of high Maori unemployment,
was also disclosed.
Much of Ms Richardson's financial statement dwelt on what she termed the
successes of the past year. These included cutting government spending, to a
forecast 39.2 per cent of gross domestic product this year from 39.6 per
cent, and lowering inflation to 0.8 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, yesterday
called for the creation of a permanent rapid intervention force from 10 to
20 UN member states as part of an enhanced peacekeeping role for the world
organisation.
Each of these member countries would earmark a special battalion in its
national forces for use by the UN when required at 24 hours' notice. Such a
standby force would not only make the UN into a more potent peacekeeping and
peacemaking instrument, but would act as a deterrent to potential
aggressors, Mr Boutros Ghali said.
Mr Boutros Ghali's proposal is part of a plan called 'An Agenda for Peace'
drawn up by him after last year's summit of the 15-nation UN Security
Council, on request of its then president, Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, whom the secretary general met in London yesterday.
The report proposes a new four-phase strategy for dealing with threats to
peace and security. In addition to 'preventive diplomacy,' which would
provide an early warning system for assessing possible threats to peace, Mr
Boutros Ghali suggests a new method of dealing with such threats which he
describes as the 'preventive deployment' of UN troops.
Under this strategy, UN forces would be sent to an area to deter hostilities
instead of waiting until after the outbreak of hostilities.
Mr Boutros Ghali insists that, if peaceful means fail, the Security Council
should use its power to employ military force to restore international peace
and security. It has never been used before, not even in the Gulf crisis,
when the Council authorised member states to act on its behalf.

official results released yesterday, Reuter reports from Ulan Bator.
The General Election Commission said the Mongolian People's Revolutionary

down from its showing in Mongolia's first free elections in 1990.
The Democratic Coalition won the second highest number of votes with about
17 per cent. It won four seats in the country's new single-chamber
parliament. The Social Democratic Party came in third with 10 per cent of
the vote, securing one seat. The final seat will go to an MPRP member who
ran as an independent.
The democratic parties have yet to decide whether they will go through with
a threat to boycott the parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PESSIMISM about growth prospects for Japan's economy is spreading among
Japanese research institutes, many of which have lowered forecasts in the
past two days.
Nomura Research, one of the gloomiest, said yesterday the government would
have to spend an extra Y9,000bn (Pounds 38.3bn) on public works if the
forecast 3.5 per cent growth in the fiscal year ending next March was to be
achieved.
The governing Liberal Democratic party has proposed a programme for
Y6,000bn-Y7,000bn in extra public spending, although the Finance Ministry
opposed it.
According to Nomura additional spending of Y5,000bn, along with a 0.5 per
cent cut in the official discount rate to 3.25 per cent, would result in
just 2 per cent growth. 'We cannot be optimistic about future sales trends
among corporations because of difficulties in exports, continued caution in
capital spending plans, and obvious reduction in household consumption,' it
says.
Yamaichi Research and Wako Research have reduced growth forecasts to 2.7 and
3.0 per cent respectively. Yamaichi expects private sector demand to rise
this year by just 1.4 per cent, compared to 2.0 per cent last year.
Corporate capital spending is expected to decline by 1 per cent, after last
year's 3 per cent rise.
The themes have also been echoed by Sumitomo Research, Mitsui Trust and
Banking, and Nippon Trust Bank, which have lowered growth forecasts to
between 2.6 and 2.9 per cent.
Critical to all the forecasts is the timing and size of an expected
government supplementary budget, as well as the timing of inventory
adjustment as manufacturers reduce production to clear excess stocks of
unsold goods.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Home truths about Brazil's real debt problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of crisis over Brazil's foreign debt, there are now growing
worries that a more serious debt problem may lie at home.
Even before President Collor was enveloped by crisis, some economists feared
the government's domestic debt might soon be out of control. By pushing up
interest rates, the crisis heightens these concerns.
Even by the government's own conservative estimates, the interest bill will
be Dollars 21bn this year.
Federal debt in the form of domestic bonds grew 162.7 per cent between last
September and March: future growth depends on what happens to domestic
interest rates. High real interest rates are the main weapon in the
government's fight against inflation, but they dramatically raise the cost
of servicing domestic debt.
Unless real interest rates come down - ideally by the passage of fiscal
reform through Congress, which would reduce the burden on monetary policy -
the government sooner or later will find it impossible to service ballooning
domestic debt.
This cost has caused Brazil to fail to meet the first quarter budgetary
targets of an IMF standby agreement.
Servicing internal debt will, the government says, cost 4.9 per cent of GDP
this year. But analysts say this is optimistic as it assumes inflation will
fall, and it has not so far.
A study by Mr Mailson da Nobrega, a consultant and former finance minister,
warns that by the year-end public sector domestic debt will have risen 53
per cent in real terms to Dollars 92.4bn (21.5 per cent of GDP).
This would place it almost at the level inherited by President Fernando
Collor in March 1990 following uncontrolled spending by his predecessor.
This was before the Collor Plan, which froze assets nationwide, and reduced
public debt from 24.6 per cent of GDP to 14 per cent.
Mr Francisco Gros, the central bank governor, argues that the internal debt
tells only half the story. Internal debt has expanded from a very low base,
but this has been mostly cancelled by the shrinkage of the country's net
external debt. This has shrunk because, until recently, Brazil's foreign
exchange reserves were expanding.
Apart from high interest rates, internal debt is being swelled by two
factors. The first is the freeing of assets frozen under the Collor Plan.
Since last August the government has been repaying around Dollars 2bn of
these blocked cruzados a month by issuing bonds.
Although the government pays interest on the blocked cruzados, it is paying
much more - 30 percentage points above money market rates - on the paper it
is issuing to fund their liberation.
The second factor is the huge influx of foreign money into the economy,
caused partly by high interest rates. This has almost doubled reserves in
the last six months to Dollars 13.7bn at end-March, but has swollen internal
debt because it is government policy to issue bonds to neutralise the
monetary impact of the inflows.
Mr Gros predicts marketable internal debt will peak at 7.5 per cent of GDP
or Dollars 30bn by year-end, and argues that this is low compared to
countries such as Mexico and Italy. 'Public sector debt is not going out of
control because both elements which led to its increase are running out of
steam.' He says 90 per cent of the frozen cruzados has already been
liberated - the rest will be by August - while the central bank has acted to
stem the inflow of dollars.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Collor corruption crisis throws reforms off course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE temperature may have cooled a little in Brazil but the future of its
first popularly elected president for 30 years still hangs in the balance.
Described as 'a victim of his own democratic reforms', the ability of
President Fernando Collor to lead the country out of economic crisis is now
severely hampered.
The wave of allegations against the charismatic 42-year-old president
initiated by his younger brother Pedro in May, draws on a cast of family,
friends and aides in a real-life saga of tropical powerbrokers and sibling
rivalries. Whatever the truth of charges that the country is being run by a
gang of thieves, the political crisis in the world's eighth largest economy
has been compared to that of 1954 when corruption allegations drove
President Getulio Vargas to suicide.
Elected on an anti-corruption platform, Mr Collor had earlier sacked several
ministers for corruption and his wife had been forced out of a government
charity amid allegations of wrongdoing. While 'Collorgate' almost brought
down his administration, the evidence against the president rests on the
testimony of a driver, a few copies of cheques paid into his secretary's
account and a telephone bill showing frequent calls to his office by an
allegedly corrupt businessman who was his campaign treasurer.
The problem is not confined to the administration. Officials estimate tax
evasion at 7 per cent of GDP.
Mr Collor's colleagues claim that the real motivation behind Collorgate is
resistance to his modernisation programme, particularly the dismantling of
cartels and opening the economy to foreign competition.
A political outsider, Mr Collor's arrogance in office and initial insistence
that he could govern without recourse to traditional porkbarrel politics or
appeasing the powerful business community, has left him isolated among the
elite even though public opinion may be on his side.
Ironically the extensive press freedom under the new democracy has worked
against Mr Collor. 'The press is not only investigating but condemning -
it's a witch-hunt,' rages one minister. 'Instead of praising him as the
first president to allow police investigation into a minister they are using
it against him.'
While other Latin American leaders have been able to rely on a one-party
state, a strong majority or even dictatorship, to push though reform, Mr
Collor's party holds only 31 out of 503 Congressional seats. So fragmented
is Brazilian politics that there are 18 parties in Congress. While other
countries are disbanding communist parties Brazil recently formed its third.
Unable to muster political support for crucial fiscal reform, he has been
forced to rely on monetary policy as his only weapon against inflation.
It was for this reason that, to public approval, Mr Collor sacked his
cabinet in April, appointing well-known politicians from the Liberal Front
(PFL) whom he had criticised.
Within a month claims by his brother that his campaign manager was involved
in corruption with the president's blessing and that he was a cocaine addict
had plunged the country back into crisis. This worsened last week as new
testimony emerged.
Today the only stabilising factor is Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, Mr
Collor's morally upright Economy Minister. Despite his popularity, Mr
Moreira's ability to act is shackled by political paralysis. Far from
falling, inflation is stuck around 20 per cent a month.
Mr Moreira rules out the magic tricks which have characterised recent
Brazilian economic management, insisting on the orthodox route of fiscal
reform which in Brazil would involve constitutional revision. However,
approval by Congressmen for a fiscal reform which cuts at their privileges
is unlikely with municipal elections due in October and the corruption
inquiries providing them with a welcome diversion, weakening the President's
ability to force reform.
Mr Collor insists he will not resign. But the opposition has not relented
and his future now hangs on whether further concrete evidence surfaces in
the congressional inquiry under way in Brasilia. The military has said it
would not interfere.
If he is forced out, the reform programme is likely to collapse with him.
Under the constitution, Mr Itamar Franco, the vice-president would take
over. He is a strong opponent of reforms such as privatisation.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Deal on foreign debt: so near and yet so far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY MINOR points separate Brazil and its leading bank creditors from an
agreement in principle on restructuring Dollars 40bn (Pounds 21bn) of
medium-term foreign debt. However, the government's political crisis has
raised questions whether the deal will ever be completed.
Agreement on a Brady-style debt reduction deal had originally been hoped for
in April, but became bogged down over the guarantees banks would be offered.
Last week, in an attempt to speed negotiations, Mr Marcilio Moreira Marques,
economy minister, flew to New York to meet bank negotiators. Afterwards, he
said: 'Our positions are converging and we expect an agreement within weeks
if not days.'
Since then, a new wave of corruption allegations has surrounded President
Fernando Collor. Even if he stays in office, will he have the political
clout to push the deal through?
For Brazil, an agreement would help offset a darkening political and
economic picture. But some creditors are less certain. One group favours a
quick agreement, hoping it will bolster Mr Moreira - without whom they may
have to start negotiations from scratch - and aid a government sorely in
need of confidence. Some big US banks want a deal to be able to write back
provisions and to avoid being held responsible for the minister's possible
demise.
Others, particularly European and Japanese bankers, say an agreement amid so
much uncertainty would be pointless and raise doubts about Brazil's ability
to meet terms of any deal.
'At some point, one of these Brady deals will fail. The question is whether
it will be Brazil's,' said one US banker. Argentina is the next Latin
American state in line to secure a Brady accord - its detailed accord with
leading banks must now gain approval from all creditors - but Mexico,
Venezuela and Costa Rica have all secured theirs.
According to Mr Moreira, his meeting with the banks overcame two main
obstacles. The two sides agreed on a figure of Dollars 3.2bn for the
collateral to be used initially to guarantee the concessional bonds to be
issued under the accord. They also agreed that banks should be free to
choose how to change their debt into the six types of bonds on offer, but
gave Brazil the right to assess the feasibility of the deal after the
selection has been made.
Mr Moreira says the remaining sticking points are 'minor'.
The Brazilian accord is the most complicated of all the Brady debt reduction
deals so far, in both negotiation and execution. The waters are muddied by
the rapid collapse of the previous restructuring in 1988 and Brazil's
partial moratorium on interest payments since 1989.
There are six options to banks compared with two in the Argentine deal. It
is also possible - depending on US interest rates and the mix of options the
banks choose - that the guarantees will have to be phased in, instead of all
being available at the start as in the other Brady deals.
Brazil is expecting to raise Dollars 1.6bn from multilateral institutions
and new money from the banks, with almost half of this coming from the World
Bank. But a senior World Bank official said: 'There is no way we will give
money to Brazil until it gets its macroeconomic situation in order and we
see no signs of that at present.'
The country is again expected to miss the fiscal targets laid down in its
accord with the International Monetary Fund for the quarter that ends this
month and it is becoming increasingly difficult for Mr Michel Camdessus, the
IMF president, to sustain the agreement, despite his close personal
relationship with Mr Moreira and his continued warnings that 'Brazil is too
big to fail'.

FT  03 JUL 92 / AT&amp;T agrees three-year pay deal: Agreement focusing on job

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the world's largest communications company, yesterday announced
tentative agreement with its two unions which gives employees pay rises of
up to 11.8 per cent over three years, stock shares and a generous
compensation scheme for laid off workers.
The agreement, coming after a month of negotiations with federal mediators,
is subject to ratification by about 125,000 AT&amp;T employees.
The unions - the Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers - this year chose not to strike when the
deadline for settlement passed on May 31 but to use other means to pressure
the company. Their strategy was to urge other unions and small businesses to
switch to other long-distance telephone companies.
With AT&amp;T due to cut 6,000 more jobs - in addition to 133,000 lost since the
sell-off its regional operations - job security was a main concern. The
company agreed that employees declared 'surplus' can choose to take special
unpaid leave of up to two years to pursue career or personal interests while
the company pays all benefits, including tuition assistance.
Those with at least five years of service can be referred to temporary jobs
in the company with no loss of pay for two years.
AT&amp;T also agreed to establish a stock ownership programme, which would award
stock worth Dollars 3,300 (Pounds 1,780) in two instalments over the next
three years. With the union demanding pay increases of 13 per cent over
three years and the company offering 8 per cent, a compromise 11.8 per cent
was agreed with mediators.
Pensions are to be increased by 13 per cent. Former employees will get first
call on new jobs for three years. Family health benefits were expanded, and
AT&amp;T said it would give employees a greater voice in decision-making.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Fed rate cut: the rationale and the risks - Michael Prowse
discusses the pressures behind the move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a perverse way, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, must
have been relieved that the June employment figures released yesterday were
so awful. He was under intense pressure to cut rates for two reasons:
to give the lacklustre economic recovery a bit of pep ahead of November's
election and thus improve President George Bush's chances of re-election,
and
to let treasury secretary Nicholas Brady take to next week's economic summit
in Munich clear evidence of a US commitment to global economic growth.
In the event, the employment numbers were bad enough to give plausibility to
the Fed's claim that it eased policy in response to poor domestic economic
conditions. Financial markets had expected a rise in non-farm employment of
about 80,000 and no change in the unemployment rate, but employment plunged
by 117,000 and the unemployment rate jumped to 7.8 per cent, its highest
since 1984.
The details of the report were almost uniformly gloomy. The fall in jobs
partly reversed three months of modest gains and would have looked worse but
for a rise in public sector employment; non-farm private jobs fell by
142,000. Manufacturing and construction employment fell 58,000 and 32,000
respectively. Wholesale trade fell by 16,000. Much of the retail sector was
also weak. Services as a whole were flat.
The report also followed a series of gloomy statistics pointing to flagging
growth after a surprisingly robust expansion at an annual rate of 2.7 per
cent in the first quarter. Signs of weakness included:
Consumer confidence stalling in June after modestly rising in recent months,
the level of confidence remaining far below what is normal in a vigorous
recovery;
The Purchasing Managers' Index falling last month to 52.8 per cent,
remaining above 50 per cent and indicating that manufacturing is not yet
contracting but nowhere near the level expected after a year of faltering
recovery;
Sales of existing homes, following weakness in housing starts, falling more
than 5 per cent in May to register their fourth consecutive monthly decline;
and
New orders for manufactured durable goods falling 2.1 per cent in May,
following declines of 1.8 per cent in April and 2.1 per cent in March.
Growth in the first quarter was buoyed by a strong rise in consumer spending
just after Christmas. After a lag, this prompted higher industrial
production and a small rise in employment. However, the stimulus from
consumers was temporary and the risk is that the economy has now entered
another mini-downturn.
The Fed is easing to prevent such a downturn from gathering momentum. It
cited the 'uneven progress of the recovery' and also drew attention to
'sustained weakness in credit and money growth' and 'continued movement
toward price stability'.
The seven Fed governors voted unanimously for the half-point discount rate
cut to 3.0 per cent. This was the first cut since December and the seventh
since the recession began in July 1990. The discount rate is now at its
lowest level since the summer of 1963.
The Fed then signalled a half-point cut to 3.25 per cent in the overnight
federal funds rate - the rate at which banks lend to one another. Commercial
banks responded quickly, cutting their prime lending rates from 6.5 per cent
to 6.0 per cent. The prime rate influences the cost of a range of consumer
and business loans.
The Fed's move will be seen by some as a decisive reaction to renewed signs
of economic fragility. It is well aware that, had it cut rates more quickly
last year, it might have prevented a weakening of the economy in the fourth
quarter, when growth drooped to a disappointing 0.4 per cent at an annual
rate.
Policymakers outside the US, however, may wonder if the Fed has acted
rashly. After all, the economy has been advancing for four quarters, albeit
slowly. Few if any forecasters expect output to fall. In a sluggish upturn,
the economic statistics are likely to be choppy: too much should not be read
into a single month's disappointing figures.
And while inflationary pressures are abating, the maturity structure of US
interest rates hardly suggests financial markets are confident that
inflation is licked. Even after the surge in bond prices yesterday that
followed the Fed's announcement, the yield on 30-year bonds was still 7.6
per cent, more than four percentage points higher than short-term rates.
The long-run impact of the Fed's rate cut will depend greatly on the
response in bond markets. If the Fed is correctly responding to genuine
weakness, long rates should fall further, with beneficial effects on sectors
such as housing and consumer durables.
But there is a risk that the Fed has made the classic central banking error
of easing policy when the economy is already capable of recovering under its
own steam. If this proves the case, much of the blame will lie at the White
House's door.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Mexico and US settle kidnapping dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO and the US have resolved their diplomatic rift over the US Supreme
Court ruling that the kidnapping of a Mexican murder suspect was legal, with
President George Bush promising in a letter that his administration will not
engage in such practices again.
However the promise falls far short of what the Mexicans had sought. The US
refused to return the suspect, Dr Humberto Alvarez Machain, to Mexico.
It will neither revise the wording of the two countries' extradition treaty
nor exchange diplomatic notes that would in effect outlaw kidnapping beyond
the life of the Bush administration.
Instead the US and Mexico will exchange diplomatic notes that makes
kidnapping by private US citizens an extraditable offence. This would allow
US federal, state and other government employees to kidnap foreign nationals
without fear of sanction. This will have the effect of reinterpreting the
treaty.
President Carlos Salinas was earlier this week still fuming at the court's
decision, describing the kidnapping as a 'criminal act. . . unacceptable and
inoperable in Mexico, and totally outside international law'. The Mexicans
will take the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, whose
final decision, however, will not be binding on the US.
The Mexican government almost certainly decided to settle differences with
the US over the kidnapping of Dr Alvarez Machain so as not to jeopardise
negotiations over a free trade agreement which is now being negotiated
between the two nations and Canada, and to avoid further downward pressure
on the Mexican stock market.
The market fell sharply in June, partly because of the popularity of Mr Ross
Perot, the independent US presidential challenger - which has put the
re-election of Mr Bush, and therefore the future of Mexico-US relations, in
some doubt - but has recovered a little this week.
Mr Salinas will visit the UK, France, Spain and Hungary this month, and
explained his European trip in this context. 'When you decide to have a more
intense relationship with a neighbour so powerful, you need to become closer
with distant friends. . . I want more European investment with Mexico,
precisely because we are going to have a more intense relationship with the
US.'

FT  03 JUL 92 / World Trade News: EC may act on Korean chip dumping -
Samsung, Hyundai and Goldstar could face restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is considering possible anti-dumping measures
against three Korean manufacturers of semiconductors after recently
concluding a preliminary investigation into charges that the companies had
been dumping memory chips into the EC.
The commission said it has notified the parties involved of the findings of
its investigation into the dumping charges brought two years ago by the
European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA).
The charges were against Samsung, Hyundai and Goldstar of Korea, and Intel
of the US, which supplied memory chips manufactured by Korean companies that
were bought by the EECA on behalf of Siemens, the German electronics group,
an EECA representative said.
Although the commission will not make the results of its investigation
public until inquiries are completed, it said that discussions with the
parties concerned over possible measures to be taken were being complicated
as one of the Korean companies was disputing its findings. Meanwhile, Intel
says that the commission has accepted that the US company was not involved
in exporting the chips. The Korean anti-dumping case, which remains
unresolved two years after the charges were brought, highlights the
difficulty of trying to apply the outdated anti-dumping guidelines of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to an industry that is rapidly
evolving.
The EC's own anti-dumping regulations are based on Gatt guidelines, which
are more than 20 years old.
The case also underlines the dilemma that the commission faces over possible
anti-dumping action as it attempts to balance the demands of Europe's
semiconductor manufacturers and users. The Europeans claim that the Korean
manufacturers have been selling dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMs)
into the EC at prices lower than those charged in their home market.
However, trying to determine whether dumping has occurred - according to
Gatt guidelines - involves a very complicated and time-consuming process.
'The Gatt guidelines are old-fashioned and out of date,' says Mr Byron
Harding at Dataquest, the high-tech market consultancy.
They were set down 23 years ago when the electronics industry was very
different. For example, manufacturers can now set up facilities throughout
the world, making it very difficult in some cases to determine country of
origin of products.
The method the commission employs to determine dumping also leaves the
findings open to debate, says Mr Harding. For example, the commission will
consider even a 1 per cent price differential as substantial enough to
determine that dumping has occurred. But a manufacturer could argue that a 1
per cent price differential was merely the result of a technical difference.
While the options for action that are open to the commission are restricted
by the Gatt guidelines, European users of semiconductors have been unhappy
with the measures the EC has taken.
These include imposing anti-dumping duties or obtaining voluntary
undertakings not to sell products in the EC below a certain floor, or
reference, price. These undertakings are backed by residual anti-dumping
duties.
In the latest anti-dumping case, the Commission suspended anti-dumping
duties against 11 Japanese manufacturers which were accused of dumping DRAMs
and erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROMs) in return for the
Japanese agreeing reference prices. This was partly after consideration of
the interests of European semiconductor users, a Commission official said,
as imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese-made DRAMs would raise their
costs and hurt their competitiveness.
However, reference prices still add to the costs of European semiconductor
users.
Although DRAM prices have been falling in world markets for years they have
been held up in Europe due to the Japanese DRAM reference price, Mr Harding
says.
For the Koreans, a Japanese reference price combined with aggressive
marketing on their part, is likely to have helped to increase their share of
the European market.
Samsung for one raised its European market share by nearly 40 per cent last
year. The share of Korean manufacturers of the worldwide 4-Megabit DRAM
market also rose strongly last year to over 13 per cent from just under 5
per cent in 1990, according to Dataquest.
Having to agree a reference price would therefore be a blow to the Koreans
who will have to rethink their strategy and may even have to consider
setting up a DRAM facility within the EC, says Mr Harding.

FT  03 JUL 92 / World Trade News: EC boost for private sector export credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE sector insurance companies are to wrest short-term export credit
business in the European Community from state-backed insurers, according to
proposals to be presented in two weeks to the EC Council working group on
export finance.
The proposals, expected to come into force before the beginning of the
European Single Market in January next year, are intended to create a level
playing field for exporters inside the EC by removing distortions in export
credit terms arising from government subsidies. Government export credit
insurance would be confined to the underwriting of non-commercial 'political
risk' business.
The reforms could lead to a significant expansion of private sector
involvement in providing export credit insurance. They are controversial
because many state-backed insurers use the profits usually generated from
insuring short-term trade to subsidise losses often arising from insuring
medium- and long-term business.
They are expected to increase the cost of short-term export credit cover,
particularly to small companies. They are also expected to lead to pressure
inside the OECD for Japan, the US and other leading industrial countries to
follow suit.
Companies like NCM, the Dutch insurer that bought the short-term credit arm
of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department late last year, have
naturally welcomed the proposed change.
The main resistance has come from Germany, Italy and France, where
state-backed companies control effective monopolies on providing export
credit insurance.
The new regime will apply to 'marketable risk', on contracts of up to two
years. It will include both political and commercial risk cover on exports
to member states of the EC, or other highly credit-worthy countries like the
US, Japan or Sweden, but will continue to rely on government-backed
reinsurance for political risk in smaller or more volatile markets.
'We plan to start more narrowly, and widen the scope of commercial
involvement when the market has caught up with any problems,' said Mr Allan
Dalvin, head of the division for export credits and export promotion in the
EC's external relations directorate.
'We expect most countries to criticise certain areas of our proposals, but
to be in favour with the general approach,' he said. 'Those that have
already gone a long way on commercialising will want to go faster.'
The EC pinpoints four main distortions that have prevented private insurers
from competing with state-backed organisations in providing export
insurance: state guarantees or loans; free information or facilities; tax
exemptions in many forms; and monopoly control of reinsurance.
Russia will soon clamp down on companies to stop them wasting valuable
export credits, Mr Pyotr Aven, the foreign trade minister, said in an
interview yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
'We plan to change the system of distributing investment credits
fundamentally. We will not allow people to spend hard currency on technical
equipment which later disappears,' he told the daily Trud newspaper. Over
the last 20 years foreign machinery worth many millions of dollars has been
imported and either left to rust or been stolen.
He said vetted companies would only receive credits by bidding for them at
auctions.

Brussels' cyclical game of musical chairs is under way, with the
announcement yesterday that Mr Karel Van Miert will take over responsibility
for the environment, until Rome names a commissioner to succeed Mr Carlo
Ripa di Meana, appointed environment minister in Italy's new cabinet, writes
David Buchan from Brussels.
In 1989, Mr Van Miert ended up with transport and consumer protection, but
he may get environment in the next Commission, which would run only for
1993-1994. Most governments are expected to keep their present
commissioners. But Mr Ionnis Palaiokrassas, Greek finance minister, will
replace Ms Vasso Papandreou, who has run social policy. That dossier may be
sought by Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's finance minister. Sir Leon
Brittan is expected to be re-nominated the UK's senior commissioner, though
he wants the external affairs job which Mr Frans Andriessen wants to keep.

FT  03 JUL 92 / OECD raps Poland's knuckles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND will be unable to reap the successes of its radical economic reform
programme of 1990 unless it controls the budget deficit, defines property
rights, and attracts savings and investment in order to create a viable
capital base, according to the Paris-based Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
In its first report on Poland the OECD praises the Polish authorities for
pushing through several far-reaching reforms in 1990. These had the effect
of eliminating shortages, converting the zloty, liberalising trade, opening
up the private sector, and bringing inflation down from 600 per cent in 1989
to an annual rate of around 40 per cent in 1991-1992.
Yet despite this ambitious and courageous programme - the first to be
implemented in eastern Europe - the OECD says successive governments have
failed to build on it.
They have failed to introduce reforms to contain the budget deficit, which
was 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product last year and will be about 5 per
cent in 1992. Attempts to reduce the deficit, the OECD says, have been
hindered by delays in reforming the tax system, as well as overhauling
public expenditure.
'Certain expenditure programmes - pensions and housing in particular -
contain within them powerful expansionary pressures. . . Further strong
measures on both expenditures and revenues are likely to be necessary in
1992 and beyond.'
The report also criticises current legislation on property rights for
creating 'considerable uncertainty'. It cites the existence of at least 50
different laws, ranging from legislation governing agricultural land
transfer, to urban land taxation. Foreign investors will continue to shy
away from Poland until they are assured of ownership, use, and transfer
rights in property, it warns.
The issue of property rights - and restitution - has affected the pace of
privatisation. The OECD praises the mass privatisation programme, which
seeks to transfer ownership of 400 enterprises to investment funds whose
ownership will subsequently be vested in the population through a share
distribution. But delays and interference by the bureaucracy are hindering
its implementation.
The Polish government is also taken to task for failing to tackle the
problem of enterprises obtaining soft loans from other enterprises, or from
banks. The persistence of this trend, typical of post-communist economies,
coupled with a failure to adapt to market conditions, has meant that a third
of Poland's 8,200 state-owned enterprises have reported pre- and post-tax
losses in late 1991.
The failure to apply bankruptcy proceedings, and shortcomings in banking
supervision, have hindered enforcing financial discipline on state-owned
companies.
If the Polish authorities tackle these problems, foreign investment is
likely to start flowing into the country. But the OECD warns Warsaw about
the need to reassure investors on another level.
'What is needed, above all, is the confidence of the investors, which is
fostered by stable 'rules of the game', consistency in carrying through
stabilisation policies, and a minimum of bureaucratic intervention in
investment decisions.'

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (10): Barings' transatlantic
leap - A venerable British bank has a 40% stake in Dillon Read
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US remains the world's biggest market for corporate finance. Yet it
remains virtually closed to foreign banks, which have never prospered in the
fiercely competitive atmosphere of Wall Street.
Barings, one of the longest-established merchant banks in the UK, finally
decided this year that it could not remain on the outside any longer.
Its decision to buy 40 per cent of Dillon Read - a Wall Street firm whose
size and blue-blooded culture makes it roughly comparable to the British
bank - marks one of the most ambitious attempts yet to build a transatlantic
corporate finance business.
Barings has spent the past two decades developing an international presence
from scratch. In the the early 1970s it opened offices in Asia and in the
1980s set up in the leading European markets. In these less-developed
corporate finance markets, it managed to gain a foothold. But the 12-strong
corporate finance team it had built up in New York by the end of the 1980s
was paltry in comparison with established Wall Street houses.
'Several of our clients did deals in the US, and did them with US investment
banks,' says Mr Nigel Melville, a director of Baring Brothers.
The decision to take a stake in Dillon Read was partly opportunistic: the US
bank had been in the process of negotiating a buy-out from Travelers, the
insurance company, at the time. But it marks a big risk for a bank which had
survived two centuries without tying up with any other house.
The nature of the link marks a compromise. On the one hand, the banks will
remain largely separate. Both will continue to be run independently and each
will keep its own name. On the other hand, the two sides hope to benefit
from being able to make joint pitches to win business and from co-operation
on transatlantic deals.
The glue that is meant to hold this liaison together is a mixture of
financial self-interest and, both sides hope, a close working relationship.
A fee-sharing arrangement has been negotiated which is meant to encourage
the banks to refer deals to each other, although no details have been made
public.
Getting people on each side of the Atlantic to work together will not be
easy. Ambition, an addiction to secrecy and the fear of jeopardising a
relationship with a client make corporate financiers loathe to share their
best clients, even with people working in the same bank. Sharing them with
people across the Atlantic will take a big leap of faith.
Barings counters by pointing to the productive relationship that exists
between Lazard Brothers in London and Lazard Freres in New York, two banks
which operate independently (it denies that it has modelled its own alliance
on the two Lazards). However, Barings admits that managing the relationship
presents a challenge. 'The possibility of dropping a ball between two firms
that are co-operating is obviously greater than within a single firm,' says
Mr Melville.
In an attempt to avoid problems of overlap, a single director will be
responsible for the relationship with each client.
Barings' corporate finance office in the US has been closed down (with two
of the 12 staff transferring to Dillon Read). One of the British bank's
directors has moved in with Dillon Read to act as a link between the two
sides. In London, the US bank has shut its corporate finance unit, one of
its managing directors (Mr Christopher Kemble) becoming a Barings director
and the other (Mr Lorenzo Weissman) moving into the British bank's offices.
Meanwhile, the two banks' securities arms continue to operate separately.
That means, for example that Dillon Read salespeople in London continue to
sell some European shares to their clients, in competition with Barings
(though US equities comprise the bulk of the business).
There are no plans to bring the securities sides closer, Barings says.
Publicly, no extra business has yet flowed from the corporate finance link.
That partly reflects the time spent so far bringing the two businesses
closer, as well as the time lag in developing deals jointly.
It is also partly the result of a sluggish takeover market. Only when the
transatlantic takeover market hots up will it become apparent whether the
Barings/Dillon Read tie was worth the gamble.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (9): A lot of talk but not much
action - The accountants' view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS venturing into corporate finance work in the UK have been hit by
the recession like their banking competitors. But it would be difficult to
work that out by talking to them.
'The UK market is very, very depressed,' says Mr Howard Hyman, head of
corporate finance at Price Waterhouse. 'But we have been highly successful.'
Mr Richard Stone, from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, agrees: 'There's a lot of talking
but not much action in mergers and acquisitions,' he says. 'But we are at
about the same level as last year.'
Mr Richard Mead, of Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'It's going to be a dull summer.
Anyone who says the market is OK is not telling the truth . . . but the
gloom and doom can be somewhat overplayed.'
The apparent contradictions in the statements of these men - and most of
their competitors - is partly explained by the niche strengths of their
firms, of which they make great play. For Price Waterhouse, for example,
that means a strong European network which helps offset the downturn of
business in the UK.
'No doubt all our competitors talk about having a genuinely integrated
European network, but we are the only people who really do have one,' says
Mr Hyman. 'We are very federal. That has fantastic advantages, by allowing
us to run as one company with access to an enormous number of contacts.'
Mr Jerry Acher, head of corporate finance at KPMG Peat Marwick, says
business has been 'surprisingly resilient'. He says the firm made Pounds
50.3m in the year to last September, and is projecting Pounds 55m-Pounds 60m
this year. That was generated by more than 300 professional staff around the
country.
Peat's sources of revenue in recent months have included work on overseas
privatisations such the national electricity grid in Argentina, and a series
of projects in eastern Europe. Even in the UK, Mr Acher says the firm has
continued to strengthen. That has partly been through the provision of
advice on new issues and management buy-outs, but also because of 'forensic'
accounting, financial restructuring of businesses in difficulty, and bid
defence work for a number of well-known target companies in recent hostile
takeover battles.
For most of the firms, the lower end of the market has provided most of
their work. Mr Stone says the average deal for Coopers last year was about
Pounds 16m. 'We don't see the Pounds 500m disposal as in our realm,' he
says.
The size of deals done by the firms has shrunk in the last few months. Mr
Richard Mead of Ernst &amp; Young, which generated about Pounds 7m in the year
to April, says the average transaction has reduced to Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m,
from about Pounds 10m two years ago.
He says the firm has been increasing the number of dedicated corporate
finance offices in regions around the UK to help lift new business. It has
switched to different services more suitable to the recession, including
financial restructuring.
Assessing how the firms are doing is not easy. If they have brought nothing
else to the corporate finance industry, they have certainly come well-armed
with the skills of creative accountancy.
Mr Hyman refuses to provide details of the income generated from PW's
corporate finance arm. He argues that it is not comparable with the rival
firms, which include activities other than 'straight corporate finance' work
such as the due diligence conducted on acquisitions to verify stated
financial information.
Certainly due diligence in Coopers lifted its 'pure' corporate finance
income from Pounds 35m to nearly Pounds 80m last year, according to Richard
Stone. But Mr Acher defends the inclusion of these activities in KPMG's
corporate finance division. 'They all have a very similar skill base,' he
says. 'It's very important to have a common approach to marketing,
development and quality control.'
In spite of the difficulties of obtaining objective data, it does seem that
the accountants have made powerful in-roads into the corporate finance
market, with substantial and growing billings. That has not helped endear
them to other parts of the corporate finance world.
They have struck a raw nerve, which has become particularly raw during the
recession. Disgruntled bankers and other observers of the industry criticise
the encroachment. They moan privately that accountants are not well-trained
to be deal-makers - it is quite a transition from the cautious analytical
examiner of books to the bravado of the risk-taking wheeler-dealer.
They suggest that the accountants do not have the contacts at sufficiently
high levels within a large enough number of organisations to provide the
best service. They question whether all too often deals claimed by the
accountants are simply contracts on which they have 'piggy-backed' on to
bankers by providing some modest technical advice, rather than as lead
advisers.
These are criticisms that the accountancy firms have heard all too often.
'The original entrance of the accountants into corporate finance a few years
ago was over-hyped, but misdirected,' says Mr Mead. 'But the firms are now
well established. It is just not true today.'
Mr Stone agrees: 'There is an element of tension, but I don't think it is as
great as it was. The bigger merchant banks see there is plenty of room for
us all. The smaller end sees the firms as a threat.'
Mr Hyman says the accountants have a very large client base to leverage,
provide independent advice, and do provide the skills required.
'Where do most banks recruit financiers from? The accountancy firms,' he
says.
Indeed, Mr Acher says: 'I hope we continue to lose people to the merchant
bankers. It is absolutely vital that we continue these relationships.' But
he defends the basic training his firm offers: 'The chartered accountancy
qualification is an important base. It teaches you care, and a detailed
approach.'
He is dismissive of the suggestion that the accountants are depriving the
bankers of business. Accountants do not have access to external capital, and
are unlikely to move into very large deals. Smaller businesses, which might
previously have tried to conduct deals without so much external professional
advice, are more of a target. 'We are fishing in the same pond to some
extent, but we are trying to make the pond bigger for everyone,' he says.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (8): Profits in the recession -
Financial restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the accountancy firms are proud to trumpet their growing involvement
in corporate finance, they keep deathly quiet about one of its most
profitable aspects during the recession: financial restructuring.
Management buy-outs take place in a spotlight of publicity cultivated by the
parties involved. Mergers and acquisitions are often celebrated with
elaborate tombstones, and the case made in widely-circulated glossy
brochures.
Only rarely do financial restructurings hit the headlines. News that a
company is in discussions with its bankers about rescheduling debt or
reorganising its operations is likely to destroy confidence, hit the share
price and often precipitate its collapse.
'It's desperately important to keep it quiet or else the company will
suffer,' says Mr Richard Reid, a partner in KPMG Peat Marwick's corporate
turnround department. 'You can't shout about successful restructurings from
the rooftops.'
Some companies - such as Maxwell Communications Corporation and Olympia &amp;
York - began with work for corporate restructuring divisions, and ended up
in insolvency proceedings.
However, these examples create a distorted impression. Peat's corporate
turnround department, for example estimates that 80 per cent of the
restructurings to which it has been appointed have survived as going
businesses.
Heron Corporation - on which both Price Waterhouse and Peats worked - is one
example of a company which has so far managed to cling on. Indeed, the
company needed to communicate with its bondholders, and even cultivated
press coverage to help put its case clearly and sympathetically.
Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, lists
Berisford, LEP and Vestey Group alongside MCC as companies which at least
passed through his department. Other recent high-profile examples among the
leading firms have included Brent Walker and News Corporation.
Insolvency fee income has helped keep the total income buoyant in
accountancy firms, which have seen demand for consulting and other
professional services slump in recent months. Restructurings have done the
same in microcosm for some of their corporate finance departments, acting as
a counter-cyclical source of billings during the dearth of merger and
acquisition activity.
Nonetheless, the restructuring divisions are keen to separate themselves
from any taint of insolvency. Coopers, for example, moved its function into
an entirely separate unit five years ago, linked to its corporate finance
department.
Mr Stone says the merchant banks initially became involved in restructuring
work themselves, but soon lost interest. 'They thought they had come across
a bonanza, but realised the work was much more long-winded than deal-making,
and less rewarding than they first thought,' he says.
Restructuring is still a relatively new industry. In spite of growing
billings, Peat's division, for example still only numbers five partners.
That compares with just one about a year ago.
In the previous recessions in the 1970s and early 1980s, it was far less
developed. That has changed because of the growing sophistication of
lenders, financial instruments and corporations. 'Life was rather simpler
back then,' says Mr Richard Mead, head of corporate finance at Ernst &amp;
Young.
Changes include the emergence of large syndicates of banks, a plethora of
new types of loans, and the increasingly international and diverse
operations of companies.
Mr Richard Stone believes the proportion of companies surviving is probably
marginally better than in the previous recession, fuelled in part by a
concern about the value of their assets if they do call in the receivers.
'The approach of the banks has been that bit more constructive,' he says.
'You only ever read about the ones where banks appear to be difficult. On
many occasions they are very supportive.'
He argues that management teams are still too reluctant to bring in outside
advice earlier enough. 'They don't want to go to the banks and tell them
about their problems,' he says. 'They leave it too late.'
One of the reasons has been that during the intense competition of the last
few years, traditional banking relationships with clients broke down. As Mr
Jerry Acher, of KPMG Peat Marwick, puts its: 'In the 1980s many company
treasurers searched for the lowest one-sixteenth of 1 per cent interest to
get borrowings down to a minimum. That upset many close relationships.'
The typical restructuring, according to Mr Reid, begins with a referral from
a bank. A company may have a short-term problem paying its debts, or be
anticipating difficulties in the medium-term.
The accountants set about understanding the business, and particularly the
elements contributing to cash flows. They consider how to deal with any
short-term debt problems, and then analyse the operational aspects of the
business. Finally, they will present a plan, which might include
cost-cutting and reorganisation options for the company, and debt-equity
swaps and rescheduling for its bankers.
He says that a continuing problem is inadequate management information
systems, or systems created during periods of growth and not adjusted to be
attuned to the downturn. Insufficient sensitivity to cash flow problems
catches many managers unaware. And many directors have no experience of
senior managerial jobs during a previous recession.
The accountants working on restructuring projects are sensitive to the
charge that they are having to make good the wrongs of the corporate finance
excesses during the 1980s. 'No-one could have anticipated a recession of
this length and severity,' says Mr Acher.
Since loan agreements were drawn up, the prolonged recession has hit many
companies' ability to pay.
That might reflect rises in interest rates, falls in share prices against
which loans may be secured, or a disposal of core businesses to help keep
the company afloat and sustain cash flows.
It might come as a result of financial agreements which were staggered, so
that new, harsher repayment requirements are only just being triggered
months or years after the original agreement was prepared at a time of
economic growth.
On one thing the accountants are all agreed. It will be many months yet
before their restructuring work goes on the wane.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (5): Frightening moral tale -
Profile / Brent Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE story of Brent Walker's financial rescue is a frightening moral tale. At
the end of March the leisure and property group finally completed a Pounds
1.65bn refinancing package with its multitude of banks, the largest such
deal ever seen in the UK market.
The refinancing involved a Pounds 250m debt-for-equity swap, giving Brent
Walker's banks over 50 per cent of its shares and an agreement by the banks
to roll up or take in preference shares much of their interest payments. The
aim is that by the end of 1997 there should be sufficient value in Brent
Walker's businesses to put its balance sheet back on to a more normal
footing.
There are many lessons to be learnt from the case and other companies
entering the refinancing process would do well to follow them.
The first lesson, though, is too late for many of them. Brent Walker and its
banks should never have got into the mess that they did. It is hard to
apportion blame between a company which over-expanded in what now seems a
foolhardy way and the banks that were only too willing to finance the
headlong rush.
Under Mr George Walker, its former chairman and chief executive, Brent
Walker had wheeled and dealed its way to a Pounds 1.3bn debt mountain
borrowed from a total of 60 different banks. There were a multiplicity of
lenders for acquisitions such as the Pounds 685m purchase in late 1989 of
William Hill, the betting office chain.
In many ways this reflected the break-down of old-fashioned relationship
banking in the 1980s as the competition between banks to lend became
frenetic. It meant that banks were lending millions of pounds without seeing
the total picture - not knowing what Brent Walker had borrowed from other
banks.
Nor did they make sufficient effort to find out about the economics of the
businesses they were lending on. Bankers were taken on a grand tour of the
group's property developments, numbers were flung at them and they
apparently made little attempt to work out the projections - for example, on
likely sales of apartments at the holiday complexes.
Mr Richard Heley, head of corporate finance at Hill Samuel, the merchant
bank which advised Brent Walker through the refinancing, suggests that banks
should always take security for such loans. The security itself may not
prove much comfort when property values fall, but obtaining it would force
the banks to check titles to properties and planning consents, get
independent valuations done and so on.
The second lesson is to avoid relying on uncommitted loans. When it came to
the crunch, Brent Walker suddenly found that money which it thought was
available was not. That threw the group on the mercy of the money markets
where it scooped up loans, bringing a number of banks into its circle of
lenders late in the day.
Another piece of advice comes from Mr Nick Lyle, the partner of accountants
Touche Ross, who headed the team which prepared a report on Brent Walker's
business for the banks. He says that many businesses fail because, when
trouble strikes, they do not go to their banks early enough.
Brent Walker's problems had been mounting throughout 1990, but it attempted
to paper over the cracks, by announcing a Pounds 100m convertible bond issue
in September of that year and in the same month publishing interim results
which are now the subject of a serious fraud office enquiry.
It was not until Hill Samuel, which was only appointed in September 1990,
started working on the document for the bond issue that it became apparent
how severe the group's problems were.
Then it was a matter of getting a standstill agreement with its banks as
quickly as possible. A standstill is the first step in a refinancing and
essentially stops everything while a more detailed plan can be drawn up.
The standstill was tied up in a matter of weeks. But a couple of serious
mistakes were made in formulating it. First, although it called for a
strengthening of the board. the agreement did not demand that Mr Walker
leave the group, The consensus now is that an entrepreneur who has built up
a business is more likely to hinder than help a rescue.
A second error was to grossly underestimate the time required to do the more
detailed refinancing. The standstill was signed in November 1990 and
stipulated a final solution to be agreed within three months. In the event
it was to take 16 months. In the meantime, interest outstanding accumulated
adding to the debt and the group needed fresh financing to continue capital
spending.
The main difficulty in the Brent Walker refinancing was getting agreement
between a disparate group of bankers with different interests and exposures.
None were willing to give anything up for a general settlement.
Mr Heley acknowledges that it would be easy to be depressed by the
experience. He says the basic principles of the refinancing were thrashed
out in four-to-six weeks, but the banks' minor tinkering with the outline
agreement took as many months.
The only reason the refinancing could succeed was that underneath all the
debt Brent Walker had two businesses which were capable of holding out hopes
of the group trading its way out of its financial difficulties. The pub
business in particular was vital. While the discussions with the banks
continued the group was working to build a chain of pubs leased from the
large brewers, which would form a cash generating subsidiary.
The whole exercise has cost the group Pounds 53.8m in fees - nearly three
times its residual market capitalisation. It has also left a company with a
pro-forma, post-restructuring, balance sheet carrying debt of Pounds 1.5bn
and negative net worth of Pounds 177.1m.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (6): Saga inflicted deep wounds
 -Profile / Nestle-Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STUDENTS of cross-border takeover activity in continental Europe fall
broadly into two camps. One holds that national barriers are inexorably
crumbling in the face of global competition, technology and mobile capital.
The other argues that the barriers are not really falling at all, but simply
changing shape.
Both schools can claim vindication in the recent struggle for control of
Perrier, France's largest mineral water company, in which Nestle, the Swiss
food group, triumphed over the Agnellis, Italy's most powerful industrial
dynasty.
The affair is one of the most complex and controversial battles in European
takeover history. As well as splitting the French business establishment, it
inflicted scars on Italian pride which were only partly salved by the
Agnellis' success in ultimately extracting a handsome capital gain.
The saga began last year, when the Agnellis persuaded the Franco-Greek
Mentzelopoulos family to sell them 34 per cent of Exor, a holding company
which owned 35 per cent of Perrier. With French allies, notably the Saint
Louis paper and sugar group and the Worms family holding company, the
Agnellis gained control of almost half Perrier's shares and voting rights.
Then things began to go wrong. Their first mistake was to launch a bid for
just two thirds of Exor in November. Though partial bids were then legal in
France, the offer outraged some of Exor's minority shareholders, including
Compagnie de Suez, the large industrial group, which complained it was being
short changed.
The Agnellis hastily raised their bid. But it was too late to pacify Suez,
which turned to Nestle to act as a white knight. The Swiss company also
received backing from other influential French interests, notably BSN, the
country's largest food company and other main mineral water producer, and
Lazard Freres, the investment bank which dominates France's mergers and
acquisitions market.
To have stirred up such powerful opposition was a remarkable feat, given the
Agnellis' close personal and business links with both Mr Antoine Riboud,
BSN's chairman, and Mr Michel David-Weill, chairman of Lazard. Indeed,
Lazard had previously used its influence to help the Agnellis acquire French
assets which have made them the country's largest foreign investor.
Not only did the Agnellis consult neither BSN nor Lazard in their stealthy
approaches to Perrier. They actively antagonised them by hinting unwisely
that their next target was BSN, in which Lazard had helped them acquire a
minority stake.
Their biggest blunder was perpetrated by an ally, Mr Jacques Vincent,
chairman of both Exor and Perrier. In an effort to strengthen the Agnellis'
hand, Mr Vincent illicitly transferred to Saint Louis a 13.8 per cent stake
in Perrier which was frozen in the mineral water company's treasury.
Challenged by Nestle and Suez, the deal was annulled by a French court,
depriving the Agnellis of almost a third of their Perrier votes and paving
the way for their defeat.
It is tempting to see the story as a threatened French business
establishment ganging up against a hostile intruder. But though true in
part, that is too simplistic. After all, the Agnellis, with their
influential local connections, started out more as insiders than Nestle,
which is not even headquartered in the EC and whose bid for Perrier was
hostile.
In reality, a combination of arrogance and miscalculation led the Agnellis
to misplay their hand. They both mistook their insider status in France for
a licence to trample on tribal loyalties, while underestimating the degree
to which traditional French capitalism had moved closer to the Anglo-Saxon
model.
The real winner was the country's fledgling system of stock market
regulation, intended to provide greater transparency and equity, which was
aggressively invoked by Nestle and its allies and ultimately was decisive in
the Agnellis' undoing.
The ironies of the situation are manifold. For the tactics the Agnellis
employed to win control of Perrier were barely distinguishable from the
stealthy, behind-the-scenes manoeuvring which has traditionally
characterised the exercise of power by France's business establishment.
It is paradoxical that prominent members of that establishment should have
seized on rules designed to end such practices to defeat the Agnellis. But
the fact that they did so has probably done more to entrench the rules, and
their underlying objectives of openness and fairness, than could have been
achieved by any number of EC directives or government legislation.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (7): Good lesson in going public
 -Profile / GPA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the GPA Group aborted its Dollars 800m flotation its complex share
structure has being cited by investment bankers as an example of what not to
do when going public.
GPA's planned flotation was billed as a unique offering; a simultaneous
listing in New York, London and Dublin by tender offer to give the issue
maximum flexibility. There was to be a placement of shares in Japan.
In order to increase competition between institutional shareholders around
the world the issue was not anchored in any single market. The structure was
seen to have an inbuilt guarantee against the possibility of slack demand in
any one of the four markets.
If institutional shareholders in any one market appeared to be ambivalent
about the issue - as they turned out to be - the lead manager in any given
market could cite strong demand elsewhere in an effort to drum up support
for the issue.
There was a normal book-building exercise. Nomura International as global
co-ordinator, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers in the US
and Schroders and BZW in the UK, gathered indications of the number of
shares institutions wanted. The book building exercise took place within a
price range of Dollars 10-Dollars 12, following a 1-for-1 scrip issue, but
the actual price would not be fixed until the investment bankers had clear
figures of demand in each country.
According to GPA demand was so strong that 10 days before the new shares
were due to start trading it increased the total amount on offer by 5m to
85m. The aircraft leasing company said this was because of a surge in
interest from retail investors. But in the early hours of the day the new
shares were due to start trading the group was forced to pull the issue.
GPA had hoped to sell 80m shares worldwide, with 30m in the UK and Ireland,
20m in the US, 15m internationally and 15m in Japan. Instead, there was only
demand for about 50m shares, with 22.93m coming from retail investors in
Japan.
Dr Tony Ryan, chairman, asked his advisers to look at new options for
salvaging the offer. But their recommendation was the same: the offer had to
be pulled. So what went wrong?
There were considerable uncertainties surrounding an aircraft leasing
company trying to raise money in a market unconvinced that the recession in
the airline industry had bottomed out.
Putting these on one side, the offer structure was a significant
contributory factor to the collapse of the flotation. There were fundamental
weaknesses with the offer structure.
The sale was not anchored in any one single market. So instead of London or
New York institutions driving it, they stood back until they were certain
that there was demand in other markets.
When it became clear that demand was weak in the US the offer lacked a home
market to soak up the unwanted shares. The Wellcome share offer, for
example, is firmly anchored in the UK.
When demand from the US market collapsed it adversely affected sentiment in
the rest of the world. So far from increasing competitive pressure the offer
became doomed once it became clear that there was no demand for the shares
in the US. British institutional shareholders, which had expressed an
interest in buying the shares, fell away once they heard that US
institutions were not interested.
Mr Tim Pettee, vice president of Alliance Capital, which manages about
Dollars 60bn of pension and mutual fund assets, said: 'It later became
obvious that advisers in one country, where the demand was weak, were
talking up demand in another country where demand was equally weak. In
reality there was very little demand anywhere.'
Although the tender offer was chosen to increase flexibility, the price
range and the maximum number of shares to be sold could not be changed once
announced.
Some commentators believe that had the shares been sold by way of a US style
placing in the UK, like the offering of Waste Management International's
shares, it would have been easier for the advisers to have either reduced
the price or the number of shares on offer since a placing is not subject to
the some constraints as a tender offer.
GPA is still commited to coming to the market. With Pounds 12bn worth of
firm orders for aircraft from manufacturers over the rest of the decade, the
company needs new equity. With net assets of less than Dollars 2bn and
borrowings of more than twice that level GPA cannot go on increasing its
debt without finding new shareholders. Nomura is looking at several options
for doing that.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (4): A pause for restructuring -
Japan, M&amp;A activity has been cooled by the downturn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The fever associated with Japanese mergers and acquisitions activity in the
1980s has been cooled by the collapse of Japanese real estate and stock
prices.
With the downturn of the domestic economy and sharp falls in earnings,
Japanese companies have become more concerned over domestic core businesses
and have started to concentrate efforts on internal restructuring.
According to Daiwa Securities, the total number of transactions fell by 34.3
per cent to 516 in 1991, while total value of deals fell 66.6 per cent to
Y1,186.5bn. At the same time different perceptions have also brought about
changes regarded as improbable in the 1980s. Foreign purchases of Japanese
companies - considered a dream at the height of Japan's bull market - are
increasing sharply.
'In the late 1980s, 75 per cent of the purchase cost of a Japanese company
would be the real estate value,' says an investment banker at Credit Suisse
First Boston. With share prices around 60 per cent below their bull market
peaks and land prices halved Japanese assets have become a realistic
opportunity for overseas investors.
Foreign purchases of Japanese companies last year fell to a total of 13
deals, but grew by 2.7 times in value to Y58bn. In the first three months of
this year, seven deals have been completed, with the value totaling Y10.9bn,
up by 3.8 times from the previous year.
'The demand from foreigners is increasing, but the number of Japanese
companies available is currently very low,' says Mr Yoshiharu Ohi, head of
global marketing at Daiwa Securities. But he adds that a further fall in
share prices and restructuring within industries could increase
opportunities.
Foreign companies with international businesses which have comparative
advantages over Japanese counterparts have expressed interest in buying into
Japan. 'The trends are apparent in sectors where there are no global
Japanese companies,' says Mr William Nichol at Barclays Bank.
Pharmaceuticals and chemicals are areas where the western companies are
showing interest. Japanese drugs and chemical companies lag behind their
western counterparts and the expanding Japanese market provides incentive
for foreign companies.
Last year Monsanto of the US acquired 12 per cent stake in Hokuriku
Pharmaceuticals for Y14.5bn, while Ciba Geigy took 20 per cent stake in a
small agri-chemical maker.
Foreign companies are buying into Japanese distributors to overcome
structural difficulties. Hasbro, the US toy maker, recently acquired Nomura
Toy, a privately run toy design and marketing company. Pfizer, the US
pharmaceutical and chemical group, also said it would buy Koshin Medical, a
privately owned distributor of medical equipment.
Mergers and acquisitions have slowly become accepted among the Japanese as
an option for better business. Mr Keiichi Kawakami, deputy general manager
of Bank of Tokyo's corporate advisory division, says Japanese companies are
no longer 'allergic' to them.
As for mergers and acquisitions of foreign companies by Japanese
corporations, activity has been subdued. Last year, the number of
transactions fell by 44.3 per cent to 258, while the total value fell 78.6
per cent to Y683.4bn. The absence of big deals, such as Sony and
Matsushita's acquisition of US film studios and Fujitsu's takeover of
International Computers Limited, has deflated the total value of
transactions. 'Japanese companies are coming to terms with investments made
in the 1980s,' says Mr Kawakami at BOT. They are restructuring foreign
acquisitions and some are ready to sell non-core businesses.
The takeover of Firestone, the US tyre maker by Bridgestone, the leading
Japanese tyre company, is an example of the many poor purchases made by
Japanese corporations. They are also reviewing overseas acquisitions,
especially real estate-related investments. In addition, the sharp rise in
the cost of capital has discouraged a return to the international market.
Nevertheless, Mr Ohi of Daiwa says that many companies still indicate
interest in deals which would satisfy strategic needs in their core
businesses and 'negotiations are quite active'.
While Japanese companies are still keen to invest in south-east Asia because
of the region's high growth potential and low labour costs, interest in
eastern European and Russia has been low as a result of unfamiliarity and
the higher risks involved.
Mr Ohi points out that Treuhandanstalt, the German agency for privatising
former East Germany's state enterprises, has elicited little interest from
Japanese companies. 'The Japanese fear the former eastern German companies
could lack basic functions of a capitalised company,' he adds.
Among Japanese companies, however, the fall in asset prices and the sluggish
economy have heightened interest in mergers and acquisitions. Although the
total number of deals fell by 19.7 per cent to 245 in 1991, their value rose
by 31.5 per cent to Y445.1bn.
The reas on was the increase in rescue-type deals involving companies facing
severe financial problems as a result of extensive investment in the stock
and real estate markets. Traditionally, companies in trouble have been
salvaged by their main banks. But the latter have not been able to cope with
the number of companies struggling with mounting debts, since the banks are
themselves also grappling with a rise in non-performing loans.
Ishihara Construction, a listed company, was burdened with expanded debts
arising from loan guarantees extended to Kyowa, the steel-processing
company, which failed with outstanding debts of Y150bn. It was bought by
Misawa, a subsidiary of Misawa Homes, the housing company.
Aside from corporate rescues, Sanwa Bank says that the number of companies
wanting to buy quality companies at cheaper prices to strengthen core
businesses have increased. Meanwhile, the traditional practice of Japanese
companies avoiding the use of financial advisers for transactions is
gradually changing as the growing complexity of deals and need for corporate
information has provoked a shift in attitudes.
'The role of financial advisers will become more important since Japanese
companies are growing to understand the importance of information,' says Mr
Ohi. He adds that the number of advisers will increase, as will their roles.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (3): Bout of painful adjustment
 -US, in the 1980s credit was easy - but things have changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FLOOD of equity issues and debt refinancings is transforming corporate
America's balance sheet as the US gradually recovers from the financial
excesses of the 1980s.
This painful adjustment process has meant a sharp drop in the frenetic
takeover and leveraged buy-out activity which characterised the 1980s, and
large increase in corporate bankruptcies.
In the 1980s leverage was fashionable and credit was easy, encouraging many
US corporations to take on more debt than they could comfortably service
when the economy turned down.
The recession of 1991 therefore forced many companies into the protection of
the courts under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, which gives them a
breathing space while they try to restructure their balance sheets and
substitute new equity for debt. Some 23,989 companies filed for Chapter 11
in 1991, compared to 20,783 in 1990. It was the highest total since 1986.
Although the economy is now staging a modest recovery, and the wave of
bankruptcies seems past its peak, some substantial Chapter 11 filings may
still be to come.
The recession helped burst a speculative property bubble, leaving many of
the nation's largest banks nursing extremely large portfolios of
non-performing commercial real estate loans. That in turn has discouraged
them from making fresh loan commitments, although the resulting so-called
credit crunch appears to have been substantially ameliorated by increased
lending by foreign institutions.
Even relatively healthy companies with substantial debt burdens or operating
results hit by the recession, have needed to issue equity to shore up their
balance sheets or their ratings with the leading credit agencies.
Happily for them, the tail end of the recession produced a bull market in
shares as Wall Street anticipated the rising earnings which an economic
recovery would bring.
The result has been record stock market levels and an ideal climate for new
equity issues. Last year total US equity issues reached a record Dollars
56bn, almost three times the level of 1990, and in the first three months of
this year the total, including preferred stock was Dollars 29bn.
Among the most prominent issues was General Motors' recent Dollars 2.14bn
issue, the largest stock offering ever in the US excluding a controversial
Dollars 2.8bn rights offering to investors by media group Time Warner in
1991.
General Motors, which reported Dollars 4.5bn in net losses in 1991 and had
suffered an erosion of its credit rating, needed the new equity both to
sustain its heavy programme of investment in new models and to bolster the
credit rating.
The Time Warner offer was unusual for the US, where rights issues are rare,
and the company's first proposal ran into a wall of investor objections. Its
sliding subscription price, which depended on shareholder demand, was judged
to be coercive and had to be changed to a more conventional fixed price
offering.
The past year has also seen a rise in company flotations on the stock
markets. The amount of money raised in so-called initial public offerings
totalled Dollars 16.3bn in 1991, compared to just Dollars 4.6bn the year
before and a record Dollars 18.3bn in 1986.
Many of these issues have been of companies which were the subject of
leveraged buy-outs in the 1980s now returning to the public market place and
allowing buy-out investors to cash in their stakes at extremely attractive
price/earnings multiples.
The recession has meant a sharp drop in US interest rates. This has prompted
all companies to reshape their debt portfolios to lower their servicing
costs.
The US Securities Industry Association reckons that 35 per cent of all
corporate debt issued in 1991 was due to companies calling in their
outstanding fixed income obligations, whether bonds or bank loans, and
issuing new debt with lower yields.
The result has been record issuance of corporate bonds, which totalled
Dollars 507bn last year, up 74 per cent on 1990. Much of that was in the
form of asset backed securities, which allow banks and other deposit-taking
institutions to remove liabilities from their balance sheets and more easily
meet regulatory capital requirements. The flood has continued into this
year, helped by the Federal Reserve's cut in interest rates just before last
Christmas.
Asset-backed securities apart, most of the new issues have been of
investment grade quality, although there has been a modest revival of
interest in junk bonds - the high-yielding securities, issued by companies
below investment grade, which provided the fuel for the 1980s takeover
spree. Last year saw Dollars 13bn of junk bonds issued, compared to Dollars
40bn at the 1986 peak, but in the first quarter of this year alone some
Dollars 7bn was sold.
The much diminished market for junk bonds has taken the heat out of the
takeover business, since corporate raiders no longer have the financial
clout to launch hostile bids against vulnerable targets. Recession,
furthermore, has forced companies to concentrate more closely on the
efficient running of their existing businesses, rather than indulge in
empire building.
Takeovers are still being done, but they tend to be agreed rather than
hostile; be within a sector and have a strong industrial logic, rather than
being propelled by financial considerations; tend to involve more equity,
relative to debt, than in the 1980s; and involve mainly US companies, rather
than foreign bidders.
Much of the activity is concentrated in three sectors undergoing
restructuring - defence, which is responding to the cuts in Pentagon
spending; telecommunications, which is consolidating; and banking, which is
involved in a lengthy merger process which will cut the number of
institutions in this overcrowded and inefficient sector.

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (1): Dreaming of takeovers - The
takeover activity of the 1980s which dominated the work of merchant banks'
corporate finance departments has given way to the three Rs; restructurings,
rights issues, and rescues. Robert Peston looks at the consequences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE three Rs; rights issues, restructurings and rescues have dominated the
work of merchant banks' corporate finance departments over the past year,
especially in the UK.
The furious takeover activity of the mid-1980s seems an age away. Just
Pounds 7.2bn was spent by companies buying UK listed businesses in 1991,
marginally down from 1990, and less than a third of what was spent on UK
corporate acquisitions in 1988.
In other words, merchant banks could no longer rely for the bulk of their
fees and profits on providing advice in takeovers, whether recommended
takeovers or hostile bids.
Indeed, the mega-bid was particularly elusive. The biggest completed UK
takeover of the past year was the Pounds 1.4bn acquisition of Hawker
Siddeley, the engineering and aerospace group, by the conglomerate, BTR,
which was advised by the specialist corporate finance boutique Hambro Magan
and by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays.
Only one other completed takeover, that of Ultramar by rival oil company
Lasmo, was worth more than Pounds 1bn.
Both are dwarfed by the recommended Pounds 3.9bn offer by Hongkong Bank for
Midland. That takeover was redolent of the good years, in that Hongkong
Bank, advised by Schroders, for a while faced a stiff challenge to buy
Midland from Lloyds Bank. Lloyds had unusually indicated it would put in a
bid exceeding that of Hongkong only if certain pre-conditions were met. In
the event Lloyds, advised by the merchant bank Barings, feared that it would
have to pay too much to stand any chance of buying Midland, whose merchant
bank adviser is SG Warburg, so it withdrew.
In spite of the lack of takeover activity, leading merchant bankers say that
many of their clients are contemplating making acquisitions and that there
could, therefore, be an increase in the number of bids in the coming months.
The bankers explain that following April's general election in the UK the
confidence of some companies has returned.
Corporate confidence has been in short supply over the past year, because
many companies have been caught in the vice of large borrowings, taken on in
the 1980s, and low economic growth.
Hence, there has been a sharp rise in attempts by companies to raise cash
through rights issues. The London merchant bank, Robert Fleming, estimates
that in 1991 Pounds 10.5bn was raised by UK companies through rights issues,
which was 25 per cent more than had been raised in any single year.
The average size of each issue was relatively large at Pounds 58m, compared
with Pounds 35m in the previous year. Small companies found it relatively
difficult to make issues, because of the widespread fear among investors
that smaller businesses were more likely to collapse in the inhospitable
economic environment.
Fleming estimates that 19 of the 30 biggest rights issues were carried out
by companies in order to 'repair their balance sheets'.
It classifies the biggest rights issue of all, the Pounds 604m one by P&amp;O,
the property and shipping group, whose merchant bank adviser was Hambros, in
this category.
However, the next three largest rights issues - by Tesco, the supermarket
group, Bass the brewer and J. Sainsbury the other supermarket chain - were
carried out for rather less pressing reasons. They took advantage of a
favourable money raising climate - the investment institutions were
relatively flush with cash - to raise money for investment.
The institutions' cash position is less favourable in the current year.
Nonetheless, some further big rights issues are predicted by merchant
bankers.
Of great concern to investors is the possibility that one of the big
clearing banks might launch a record breaking rights issue to restore their
depleted capital resources. But the banks have resolutely denied that they
are planning any such thing.
There is one area of traditional corporate finance business which has
undergone a revival: the flotation of companies on the stock market. Though
there was a tiny number of flotations in 1991 - only 54, down from 167 in
1987 - in the current period a large number of new listings involving some
very big companies are occurring.
These include:
The Pounds 465m flotation of Waste Management International, the waste
disposal group, which took place in April. The sale was organised by the US
investment banks, Merrill Lynch and Kidder Peabody, with Lazard Brothers,
the City of London merchant bank, and Cazenove, the City stockbroker.
The international public offering of 330m shares in Wellcome, the drug
company, which are currently held by Wellcome Trust, the charitable
institution. Robert Fleming is co-ordinator of that sale.
The flotation of 26m shares in the Daily Telegraph at a price of 325p per
share. This will raise Pounds 84.5m for Conrad Black's Hollinger group and
puts a market value of Pounds 435.5m on the group.
Two other big flotations, MFI, the furniture retailer, and Del Monte Foods
International, the processed food manufacturer, have either begun or are due
soon.
The case of GPA, however, has emphasised that such issues are not risk-free.
The sale of almost one-third of the Irish aircraft leasing group's shares,
valuing the company at a total of Dollars 3.5bn, was aborted after it became
clear that demand from institutional investors was well below expectations.
3i, the venture capital group has also been obliged recently to announce the
postponement until next year of its planned flotation.
As with Wellcome, there is an increasing trend for such share offerings to
involve obtaining market listings in more than one country and for the
marketing to be done globally.
The technique for pricing the shares has also become far more sophisticated.
On the other hand, flotation of small companies remains few and far between.
The explanation is similar to the reason why small companies have launched
few rights issues. Many small businesses have not yet recovered sufficiently
from the effects of the recession for their shares to represent a suitably
safe investment.
The recession also explains why so much corporate finance work has been in
the form of corporate rescues and restructurings.
At the end of March, the reconstruction of Brent Walker's balance sheet and
Pounds 1.65bn of debt was completed after 18 months of tense negotiations
with banks. This was the biggest UK corporate restructuring. The merchant
bank advising was Hill Samuel.
Brent Walker's banks and bondholders have all suffered big losses on their
loans. However, in the event they were persuaded that their losses would be
significantly greater if Brent Walker had been put into liquidation,
receivership or administration under UK insolvency law.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, is in the process of trying to
persuade bankers and bondholders owed more than Pounds 1bn by Heron, the
property group, that they too would be disadvantaged if they plumped for an
insolvency filing for Heron rather than a debt reconstruction.
However, creditors are not always persuadable. Bankers recently opted to put
Canary Wharf, the east London property development owned by Olympia &amp; York
Developments, the Canadian private company, into administration. In the case
of Mountleigh, the property group, bankers took the view that their
interests were best served by pressing for receivership.
Corporate financiers view this fourth 'R', for receivership, as an anathema.
Once a company is in receivership, all the fat fees go to the accountants
and lawyers and none to the merchant bankers. These fees are indeed very
tempting.
Brent Walker, which was strapped for cash, nonetheless, paid more than
Pounds 40m to its merchant bankers, accountants and lawyers in its battle to
survive.
Nice work . . .

FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (2): Top of the integrated
banking structure - Morgan Stanley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF ever an advocate of the 'integrated' investment bank wanted to
demonstrate the benefits of this structure, he would surely point to Wall
Street in the 1990s. To back up his case, he could then cite a number of
individual examples, but Morgan Stanley would probably be top of his list.
Between two decades - the 1980s and 1990s - business opportunities for the
investment banking community have undergone a sea change. In the 1980s,
money was to be made in advising on acquisitions and hostile bids; running
leveraged buy-out funds, which themselves often triggered, or at least
participated in the takeover frenzy; and issuing debt-based securities, such
as junk bonds, to line the acquirer's pockets.
In the 1990s, the active areas have been corporate restructurings (although
with fees often subject to bankruptcy court approval, these are generally
less lucrative than bids); vulture investing in the securities of distressed
companies; and the issuance and underwriting of new securities, often
equity-based, as companies repair strained balance sheets.
The implications of this turnround are fairly obvious. Boutiques which set
up as bid or LBO specialists have either been obliged to sit out the
recession with much reduced earnings, or rethink their strategy. In reality,
many have responded by tacking on additional lines of business  - real
estate services, some underwriting, restructuring expertise - in an attempt
to combat the dearth of bid work.
For the large integrated houses the task, superficially, has been simpler.
After all, the downturn in bid work has been largely offset by the upturn in
underwriting activity. But managing the turnround has been no simple
assignment.
Morgan Stanley, one of the largest blue chip Wall Street houses, probably
exemplifies the point better than any. To look at the bank's bottom line,
business has been bumpy but, under the circumstances, remarkably
well-sustained. After-tax profits for 1987 (the year stock markets crashed
worldwide) were Dollars 230.9m. They then recovered to Dollars 394.6m in
1988; soared to Dollars 443m in 1989; dipped back to Dollars 270.4m in 1990;
and then hit Dollars 475.8m last year.
Overall, the investment banking division appeared to echo this pattern.
Here, revenues topped the Dollars 946m mark in 1989; slumped to Dollars
652.3m in 1990; and recovered to Dollars 823.5m in 1991. But it is the split
in the investment banking division's figures which tell a much more
meaningful story.
In 1989, about Dollars 360m - less than half the the Dollars 946m total -
came from underwriting activities, and the remainder from financial advisory
work. In 1991, by contrast, two-thirds of the Dollars 823.5m figures derived
from underwriting activities, the rest from advisory work.
This switch in business mix has meant a rearrangement of staffing, and in
Morgan Stanley's case a fair number of top management changes.
According to Mr Robert Matschullat, head of investment banking, the head
count in his division has remained flat. It totals about 668 worldwide,
compared with about 680 five years ago. But Mr Matschullat acknowledges that
there have been significant reductions in certain areas, such as mergers and
acquisitions.
To an extent, expertise in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) can be switched to
restructuring work. Individuals who advised on bids in the 1980s the
reasoning runs, know the same client companies who now wish to restructure
their finances. Neverthless, only six months ago, the bank announced the
dismissal of 45 investment bankers, 6 per cent of the total, as it
overhauled staffing requirements.
Meanwhile, responsibilities among senior executives have been in a fairly
fluid state. Mr Maschullat formally took up the reins of the investment
banking division at the beginning of 1992, succeeding Mr Joseph Fogg, a
veteran Wall Street dealmaker who quit after failing to secure a board seat.
In mid-June, the newly-installed division head announced that Mr Bruce
Fiedorek, formerly head of M&amp;A would take charge of a wider 'financing and
strategic services' group.
If the persistent management changes have derived partly from departures and
the change in workload, they also owe a good deal to Morgan Stanley's
determination to build up its international business. Globalisation is
almost an article of faith at the bank - the theory being that if
corporations become increasingly international in their scope, their demand
for investment banking services will follow a similar trend. Morgan Stanley
draws about half of its Dollars 2.8bn revenues from outside the US and Mr
Richard Fisher, chairman, has suggested that the proportion could increase
to about two thirds. Extensive branch offices range from Milan to Toronto
and additions, in Europe and Asia, are likely in the near future.
Morgan Stanley admits that the task of managing a worldwide personnel - in
particular, deciding how much responsibility to devolve outside the US - is
not always easy. In March, the bank appeared to rethink its approach,
although the change is described as evolutionary rather than revolutionary.
It set up a new operating committee under the charge of Mr John Mack, head
of its fixed income division, to oversee day-to-day operations and to handle
co-ordination between divisions. As part of the changes, it shifted four
managing directors from New York to London and Tokyo - effectively running
the group's worldwide government securities business from the UK.
Finally, although underwriting has been a mainstay of profits, and the
bank's earnings record is one of the most commendable on Wall Street, it
should not be assumed that everything has been plain sailing on the new
issue side. Although Morgan Stanley was third among the Wall Street houses
in terms of underwriting earnings last year, it has been noted that the bank
ranked only seventh for all common stock offerings and had a similar placing
for initial public offerings. In the first quarter of 1992, when a flood of
new issues descended, Morgan Stanley also came in seventh in terms of
amounts raised from all domestic issues, down from fifth place in the first
quarter of 1991.
As for current trends, Mr Matshullat, like any banker seeking business, is
the eternal optimist. Given the amount of equity which was retired during
the 1980s he reasons that the stream of issues will continue, albeit with
temporary fluctuations to allow for market digestion.

FT  02 JUL 92 / ANC pulls back from sports boycott
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S participation in the Barcelona Olympics and other
pre-arranged international sporting events can go ahead as planned, the
African National Congress (ANC) said yesterday.
'The decision will remain under view,' said the ANC press statement, which
warned that unless the country's political crisis is resolved, it 'will
consider a halt to all tours'.
This cautionary note did not disguise the fact that the ANC, for the time
being at least, has declined to use sport as a weapon. The news delighted
white South Africa, possibly the mosts sports-conscious community in the
world, although black South Africans are likely to have mixed feelings about
the ANC's decision.
mhe re-introduction of the ban on sporting contact may have seemed a
straightforward way of punishing the government for the stalemate in
constitutional talks, but there are several complications.
Football, for example, is a predominantly black game here. Supporters were
eagerly awaiting next week's scheduled visit of the Cameroon national side,
and Crystal Palace, the English first division side. Most supporters wanted
the visits to go ahead.
Also at risk were the visits of the New Zealand and Australian rugby teams,
and a cricket tour by India.
A sports boycott cannot be turned on and off like a tap. Should the ANC wish
to re-impose South Africa's sporting isolation, it would have faced a
protracted round of lobbying and persuasion. Advocates of contact also
pointed out that by the time this process was over, the constitutional
stalemate might have been broken.
In return for yesterday's go-ahead, the country's sports bodies agreed to
express 'public support for peace and democracy, including a democratically
elected constituent assembly'. They will also stage unspecified 'activities'
during international fixtures 'which will promote peace and democracy'.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Fresh models for east European privatisation
</HEADLINE>

   VERSAILLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ambitious mass privatisation schemes launched in Czechoslovakia and
Poland are becoming models for other east European countries.
Government officials and western advisers gathered at the weekend in
Versailles to discuss the advantages of distributing state-owned assets to
citizens in the form of vouchers.
Privatisation officials from all eastern European countries, as well as from
Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic republics, placed emphasis on the need to
ensure public support for reforms during their meeting.
Czechoslovakia and Poland, whose mass privatisation programmes are the most
advanced, have been models for Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Romania, which
are putting in place their own variations on a voucher privatisation scheme.
Czechoslovakia's privatisation programme cuts across a wide spectrum with
Dollars 9.9bn worth of equity in 1,491 enterprises to be distributed this
summer. Over 8.5m citizens are participating in the scheme, using vouchers
bought for a nominal sum. Two thirds have entrusted their vouchers to one of
the 460 private investment fund set up earlier this year.
The political impact of distributing state-owned assets to the public was
underlined in Czechoslovakia's elections earlier this month. Mr Vaclav
Klaus, the former finance minister who masterminded the programme, saw his
party win an absolute majority in the Czech parliament.
The Czechoslovak scheme came under criticism, however, because the vast and
diffuse mass of shareholders have little potential to influence the
management of enterprises. The Polish scheme, in contrast, aims to secure
management control over enterprises by 'leading funds' which will have block
of shares in their hands.
In Poland, some 400 enterprises, accounting for 8-12 per cent of the
country's industrial output, will be allocated to a limited number of
investment funds, whose shares will then be distributed to citizens free of
charge.
The Polish scheme, which relies on a narrow selection of enterprises
distributed to funds managed by western advisors, aims to create a group of
small shareholders interested in holding long-term stakes in profitable
enterprises.
Officials from former Soviet republics emphasised the need to give
management and employees, rather than investment funds, a stake in the
future. The Russian programme, which remains in its early legislative form,
aims to distribute shares on a preferential basis to employees and
management.
The relative independence of managers from the government was highlighted as
a crucial factor determining a programme's chances for success.
A survey on east European privatisation appears tomorrow.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (7): The 'other' Merseyside - Wirral,
Sefton, St Helens and Knowsley feel unfairly treated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVERPOOL IS only 30 per cent of Merseyside. This is the city's share of
county-wide costs for such services as policing and waste disposal. Wirral,
with nearly a quarter of Merseyside's population, pays 23 per cent, with
Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens sharing the rest.
It is easy to see, therefore, why the four other Merseyside boroughs often
feel unfairly sullied by Liverpool's problems. They have nearly 1m of
Merseyside's 1.4m residents, yet Liverpool hogs the headlines and gives them
all a bad name.
Sensitivities show in postal addresses. Many in Wirral - including some
prominent people responsible for promoting Merseyside - already describe
themselves on their private notepaper as living in Cheshire, and more will
do so soon when the government officially allows people to use ancient
county names and boundaries in addresses.
Sefton, comprising Bootle, Crosby, Formby and Southport, never uses the name
of the Liverpool postal district in the addresses of council offices, even
though it is an official part of many of them.
For anyone writing to the council, 'Bootle 20' will find most of offices,
when the postcode should really be 'L20'. Moreover, council headquarters in
Southport are officially in the 'PR', for Preston, postcode district,
although many locals would rather be in Lancashire.
A yearning for its old Lancashire roots is also apparent in St Helens,
although the borough escapes the Liverpool postcode stigma by being in the
'WA', for Warrington, postal area.
Pilkington, the world's largest glassmaker, avoids the image problems of
Liverpool by driving most of its visitors to St Helens from Warrington or
Runcorn inter-city railway stations or Manchester airport, both routes being
mainly green countryside all the way.
Companies in Knowsley, which houses a third of Merseyside's manufacturing
industry, can do similarly. Wirral is also easily and directly accessible
from Runcorn, Chester or Manchester airport. Even Liverpool's working docks
are now entirely in Sefton; the M57 and M58 motorways enable access from the
national network without crossing Liverpool's boundary at all.
The problem for the four other Merseyside boroughs, however, is that
although many of their residents would rather not live with Liverpool, they
cannot live without the place. It is the regional capital, offering rich
cultural and recreational diversity, and it is still an important centre for
financial and professional services.
Generally, they wish Liverpool could still be looked up to so it could act
as Merseyside's leader without embarrassing anyone. No matter Liverpool's
progress and present stability, people get fed up of having to explain its
past and present problems away, or its litter, or the structure of
Merseyside, or that 'it's a very nice place to live, really'.
More than 30,000 people from Wirral cross the river each day to work in
Liverpool - approaching a fifth of the peninsula's workforce. 'Home' for
many of them, however, is in the small Deeside towns of Heswall, Neston,
Caldy, West Kirby and Hoylake, facing the Welsh hills or Liverpool Bay.
Many other 'Liverpool' professional and white-collar workers live in Sefton,
in the pleasant, middle-class Conservative constituencies of Crosby and
Southport. If they live in St Helens, it will probably be in Rainford.
None of the four outer Merseyside boroughs has a self-contained economy,
although St Helens and Wirral probably come closest to not needing
Liverpool. This, however, has not stopped them all taking steps to avoid
being blighted by the troubled image created by Liverpool in the 1980s.
Politically, they are all stable - Knowsley and St Helens because they are
solidly in moderate Labour hands, and Sefton and Wirral because they have
three-way hung councils where consensus has to be achieved.
Wirral went through a period of left-wing Labour control, but the council's
leader came unstuck when she led a campaign against paying the poll tax and
was dumped by an angry electorate in the 1991 local government elections.
The Conservatives came within an ace of taking overall control this year and
consensus politics now rule.
Whether there will ever be a Merseyside consensus, however, is another
matter. Wirral, for example, is very wary of joint marketing to attract
inward investment, preferring to compete in its own right.
'We have all the advantages of being an island without the disadvantages,'
Mr Alan White, the chief executive, points out. 'We are midway between
Liverpool and Chester and have more golf courses than any comparable
borough.'
The private sector - dominated by Vauxhall, Unilever and Shell - influences
the council greatly and a partnership called the Wirral Investment Network
has been formed with Baroness Chalker of Wallasey as its president.
Wirral's private sector appears wary of doing much for Merseyside when this
might detract from the obvious selling points of Wirral's proximity to
Cheshire and sharing the same pleasant look of that shire county in most
respects.
When the council asked its partners what was its most important job, the
answer was street cleaning, so as to foster a good image. Clean streets
reinforce Wirral's generally pleasant appearance - a stark contrast to
Liverpool, where no route out of the city does not pass through a depressing
swathe of dereliction or run-down, urban tattiness.
The customer-orientation implied by this response was not lost on Wirral
councillors and their officers, who have made cleaner streets a priority.
They also get business leaders to present Wirral's case to potential
investors. 'We're paid to say the place is good, they're not, and so are
more likely to be believed,' Mr White says.
The borough is also working hard on its European links to maximise the
benefits of the single market. There are a high profile 'EuroWirral'
campaigns at local level and in Brussels itself, again with the private
sector to the fore.
Knowsley, meanwhile, is also being pragmatic on industrial development. The
borough contains the infamous 1950s outer estate of Kirkby and has desperate
unemployment problems. Mr Jim Keight, the council leader, is a retired
compositor from the Liverpool Echo. He puts the need for jobs first, and
readily eased the arrival in Knowsley of News International's Pounds 200m
northern printing works, in spite of his own union's anger over Wapping.
Local private sector confidence has manifested itself in other ways, such as
IMI Yorkshire Imperial Metals spending Pounds 10m modernising its Knowsley
factory and BICC investing in new plant.
There was also a 49 per cent increase in VAT registration in Knowsley
between 1979 and 1989, the largest locally and well ahead of the 15 per cent
rise achieved by Merseyside as a whole.
It is against this background that a Merseyside Partnership of all local
authorities and the private sector is struggling for life. Wirral, the
second biggest block in Merseyside's structure, probably holds the key, but
it is difficult to find much enthusiasm there.
What will probably happen is that Wirral will join, but will not put much
effort in and very little money. The 'other' Merseyside has its own song to
sing and appears to be doing it rather well.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (8): Investment picks up - Doubts about
strategy may be confounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Chris Farrow became the new chief executive of the Merseyside
Development Corporation (MDC) late last year, he might well have felt he was
jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.
He came from London Docklands Development Corporation, which was set up at
the same time as its Merseyside counterpart in 1981. The well-publicised
problems of Olympia &amp; York in finding tenants for London's Canary Wharf have
underlined the dangers of putting the cart of speculative office building
before the horse of proper access and infrastructure.
But while many parts of Docklands have attracted private sector investment,
Merseyside Development Corporation by contrast has failed, so far, to amass
significant similar interest. By 1990, nine years into its supposed life of
a decade, the MDC had spent Pounds 180m of public money but had generated
only Pounds 43.5m of private sector investment.
The efforts of the corporation had been accompanied throughout most of the
1980s by a chorus of criticism that the Merseyside waterfront would never
become financially viable because the corporation had adopted a misguided
strategy.
It had spent a great deal of its funds on reclaiming and gentrifying the
Albert Dock as a tourist complex. But although 5m visit the Albert Dock each
year it does not provide a great number of jobs.
Critics argued that the corporation should have developed industrial and
office sites which would have attracted small high technology companies and
other manufacturing concerns. These would have provided jobs for the main
category of unemployed - male manual workers.
The debate about strategy came to a head with the resignation from the board
of the MDC in 1989 of Professor Patrick Minford, the monetarist economist,
over the MDC's rejection of a project for a power station and deep water
jetty at Birkenhead, across the Mersey from Liverpool, at a cost of Pounds
250m and offering the prospect of 1,000 manual jobs.
The scheme, which would also have involved the Mersey Docks and Harbour
Company, was the kind of investment Merseyside needed, Prof Minford argued,
providing a growth point to mop up some of the unemployed. He contended that
60,000 unemployed men were not about to join the tourist industry as waiters
and barmen.
The MDC rejected the project because it conflicted with the upmarket image
it was trying to develop for the waterfront on both sides of the Mersey. In
this, the MDC also had an argument, for since that low point its record has
improved.
Private sector investment is now put at Pounds 250m - just slightly more
than the cumulative total of government expenditure. Although much of this
is accounted for by investment in residential property, the MDC has also
secured its first big office relocations: Customs and Excise is building an
office block to accommodate 2,000 staff eventually, and the Inland Revenue
is also moving into the MDC area with several hundred jobs. In addition, the
site of the 1984 International Garden Festival site has been reopened again,
and looks like flourishing as a leisure centre.
For all these reasons, Mr Farrow does not feel he faces a hopeless task and
says that there is definite, committed investment in the pipeline. 'It is
true that the levels of attainment were not very good in the 1980s, but my
predecessors did not stand a chance. The political climate was hostile to
any kind of investment,' he says.
Mr Farrow adds that all the councils on Merseyside and not just Liverpool
realise that something must be done to give the area a boost. 'All the
councils and the private sector are now pointing in the right direction.' A
recent visit to the eastern seaboard in the US with industrialists and the
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic created great interest, he says.
The turning point came in 1988, Mr Farrow believes. 'The government had a
chance to close the development corporation down then. Instead, it increased
the corporation's area from 800 to 2,400 acres. This was a sure sign it was
going to keep the corporation going beyond the original 10 years. We now
have a new chairman in Sir Desmond Pitcher, the chief executive of
Littlewoods, and a new management team,' he says.
Like other development corporations, the MDC owns some land and has planning
powers over all its area. Besides the Liverpool waterfront, the
corporation's area covers Birkenhead across the Mersey and parts of New
Brighton, the seaside resort on the Wirral peninsula.
Mr Farrow says there are 1,000 acres which could be developed. 'Merseyside
is not going to attract a company such as Toyota or Honda, capable of
employing thousands because there is not the room in the corporation's area.
But there will be 10- and 15-acre sites where smaller businesses could
come.'
The keys to attracting investment are the strategic waterfront sites close
to the Albert Dock and Pier Head, places like Prince's Dock, Queen's Dock
and George's Dock. 'There is room for 3m sq ft of development on these prime
sites. There will be office development and also what Merseyside is proving
itself very good at - tourism and leisure facilities.'
Mr Farrow envisages that the number of jobs within the corporation's area
could almost double from a current 35,000 to 60,000, with many of these jobs
coming from the service industries. 'Liverpool is very competitive in terms
of wages and property costs.
It is now where Glasgow was in l980. The political climate is improved and
there are lots of cultural attractions which are not known about. Liverpool
has more listed buildings than Bath,' he says.
Mr Farrow does not put a time scale on when the investment will arrive but
believes the sites will be developed in the 1990s despite the continuing
recession.
He is supported in his view by Mr Trevor Furlong, the managing director of
the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. His company, which owns Prince's Dock,
has received planning permission from the corporation to develop 1.5m sq ft
of offices there in conjunction with P&amp;O. 'We are not building
speculatively. We are only going to build for pre-lets. But I feel confident
there will be the demand for these offices,' Mr Furlong says.
Originally a critic of the corporation for concentrating on what he calls
'cosmetics', Mr Furlong now feels that small companies in services and even
manufacturing will want to come to Merseyside. He believes it will take
about five years for Prince's Dock to be built and let or sold.
Even Prof Minford has changed his mind somewhat. He feels that the male
manual workers which concerned him three years ago are now exporting
themselves to work as far afield as Warrington and Widnes and even London,
while Liverpool is beginning to pick itself up through the growth in service
industries.
He worries that Merseyside will lag behind as the UK recovers from
recession, but says the underlying economic situation in Merseyside is
looking better than it was.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (5): Turn of the tide - The long war
against the left is over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARFARE is not too strong a word to describe what has been going on in
Liverpool politics these past 10 years.
The good news is that the war probably passed its turning point on May 7.
The bad news is that the resultant political stability is at best fragile.
Yet confidence of every sort depends on it.
May 7 was local government election day in England and Wales. In Liverpool,
20 left-wingers stood against official Labour candidates. A year before, six
had stood and five had won - at a time when Liverpool city council was
engaged in a series of bitter strikes by town hall trade unions opposed to
3,000 redundancies needed to reduce overstaffing.
This year's battle was a Pyrrhic victory for Labour: only one of the
left-wingers was elected but enough of them split Labour's vote to let the
Liberal Democrats through in seven seats. With a Labour net loss of two
seats, the new council has 40 Labour members, 37 Liberal Democrats, 18
left-wingers, two Conservatives, one Liberal and one Social Democrat.
The centre - Labour and Liberal Democrats - can therefore control policy.
Thus, the crucial question for the governability of the city is: will the
centre hold? There is no formal alliance and consensus is not easy. Labour
leads and is opposed by the left. The Liberal Democrats can decide, issue by
issue, whether or not to support Labour and have already carried out one
damaging ambush at sub-committee level.
To make matters worse for Labour, the party whip is currently withdrawn from
five of its 40 members over past refusals to toe the party line.
To run the council - and be allocated the majority of committee and
sub-committee seats - the five have had to 'sign up' with the Labour group,
even though they face disciplinary action by the party's national executive
and possible expulsion. A rash of probationary forgiveness of past political
sins now seems likely.
This is essential for Labour. Next year is a blank in the local government
election cycle, so there will be no opportunity to defeat any more of the
remaining 18 left-wingers before 1994.
While uncertainty may therefore appear the only certainty, there has
nevertheless been a decisive shift of power from the left to the centre.
Moreover, management - led by Mr Peter Bounds, an able council chief
executive who earned his spurs in the strikes - has re-established control
over the council's workforce.
In effect, Liverpool is governable again, after eight years of being run or
at least manipulated by the left, mainly for the benefit of left-dominated
town hall trade unions.
To the government, opposition parties, business leaders and many ordinary
people, Mr Harry Rimmer, Labour's leader, is the man who deserves most of
the credit.
At 64 and plagued by summer asthma, he is an unlikely-looking champion - a
former electrical maintenance foreman and deputy leader of the abolished
Merseyside county council, who was persuaded back into local politics to
help clean up the chaos left by Militant's influence on the Liverpool party.
He has several younger supporters now coming through. These, in time, may
vie to succeed him, but his has been the will to tackle Liverpool's most
pressing political problem: who runs the city?
In Labour terms he is a moderate. Moderation was, however, the last thing he
could afford. Mr Keva Coombes, his predecessor, had tried to balance left
and right in the party after Labour had won 67 of the council's 99 seats in
1988.
Mr Rimmer realised early on there were too many left-wing fundamentalists in
the group for Mr Coombes's balancing act to succeed. Two years ago, he built
a base of support and ousted Mr Coombes. This split the Labour group, and
supporters of the left were later expelled by the national executive.
That, in turn, laid the ground for Mr Rimmer to tackle the truculent and
largely unmanageable town hall trade unions, several leaders of which were
known Militants or supporters of other left-wing groups.
Battle had to be joined because the district auditor, the government's
watchdog on local government spending, had warned the council it was more
than 10 per cent overstaffed and in danger of illegal overspending if it did
not reduce its payroll.
Even Mr Rimmer was unprepared for the bitterness of the battle as the
council sought to impose compulsory redundancies. 'I thought I knew how it
was, but it was much more sinister,' he says. 'Managers and supervisors were
intimidated and terrified of some of the shop stewards and their
supporters.'
The council fought last year's strikes with government support. Mr Michael
Heseltine, then environment secretary, said any demonstration by the council
of a will to manage was bound to improve business and investor confidence in
Liverpool. The City was briefed to ensure money market support if cash was
needed.
The strikes lasted seven months, but the redundancies eventually went
through, in spite of crises and near-chaos caused by more than 12,000 tonnes
of rubbish piling up in the streets and the storming and occupation of
council buildings by some strikers.
'The strikes were ruthlessly conceived and we never expected them to last so
long,' Mr Rimmer says. 'The key for us was ensuring Liverpool met its
financial commitments - in spite of a strike in the Treasury - and so
retained the confidence of the City.'
He believes victory has dispelled doubts about governability, in spite of
the fragmented council. When the Labour Party determinedly stands against
trade unions - and wins - in a place with Liverpool's tradition of worker
solidarity, it signifies a political sea change.
Mr Rimmer's personal and political courage is widely admired. 'We had to
show that elected councillors were in charge. What we did was right,' he
avers. 'It's not just business leaders who tell me this, but ordinary people
in the street.
'They stop me, perfect strangers, and shake my hand and wish us well.
Sometimes, after a depressing day, I used to go home and wonder how I ever
got into this, but now I know we have such widespread support there are very
many fewer days like that.'
Liverpool's financial stability has now been largely restored after the
chaos caused by deliberate overbudgeting in the Militant era. Foreign banks,
impressed by both Mr Rimmer and Mr Mike Storey, the Liberal Democrat leader,
have even rescheduled some debt to give the city extra breathing space.
Underlying problems of urban decline and regeneration are now being tackled
with private sector and government support. The fragmented council may even
be a blessing. It is forcing political consensus on the centre and
marginalising extremists. Almost certainly, the Militant-driven
confrontation of the mid-1980s cannot emerge again.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (6): The port comes back from the dead
 -A transformation in docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORT, once a byword for appalling industrial relations and inefficiency
is now one of Merseyside's success stories.
Mr Trevor Furlong, managing director of the Mersey Docks and Harbour
Company, says: 'Let me give you a just a few figures. In 1980 we made Pounds
800,000 profits and employed 6,000 people, 3,000 of them dockers. Last year
we made record profits of Pounds 13.2m and employed 1,500 people, 400 of
them dockers.'
Going further back, the contrast in the company's fortunes is even more
dramatic. In the early 1970s, the Dock Board - then a sheltered company -
had to be rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by the government after it
defaulted on bonds.
The implication of what Mr Furlong says is that the company has been able to
make great gains in productivity because of the better industrial relations
climate of the 1980s. Although staff numbers were reduced throughout most of
that decade, the turning-point came with the government's abolition of the
National Dock Labour Scheme in 1989. This scheme had allowed only voluntary
staffing reductions.
Mr Furlong says: 'It was not just being able to reduce the head count,
although that was important. It was also the improvement in working
practices with flexible manning levels.'
The government has also helped by writing off most of the company's
remaining debts of around Pounds 100m, allowing it to start paying dividends
again.
The company has made efforts to increase the volume of business. The port
claims it is the most comprehensive in Britain. Unlike other ports which
have a specialisation, say, in containers, Liverpool conducts almost the
whole range of business. It has ro-ro facilities and is constantly expanding
its container facilities. It trades in oil, bulk liquids and grain. It
competes with Rotterdam as the largest trader in scrap metal in western
Europe. It is the largest UK port for trade with the eastern seaboard of the
US. It is also the largest UK port trading with Ireland.
Additionally, it is the home of Britain's only successful freeport so far.
The freeport takes up 640 acres of the company's 2,000 acres of land on both
sides of the Mersey. It is currently being expanded to include a further 120
acres of Birkenhead docks. Since the free zone was set up in 1984, it has
handled goods worth some Pounds 700m from 80 different countries.
More than 100 companies use the freeport. The idea is that companies can
ship goods free of import duties and VAT so long as they remain in the zone.
Most of the companies using the freeport are involved in warehousing and
storage, but a few have started manufacturing. The freeport is a profit
centre in its own right.
Merseyside has also developed as a hub port for a number of Mediterranean
ports. It takes on cargoes from the US and Africa and tranships them with
frequent services to the Mediterranean. This counters the idea that
geography is against Liverpool now that the thrust of British trade is with
Europe and thus goes mainly through the east coast ports.
In a difficult climate, overall turnover rose by 27 per cent in 1991 to
Pounds 69.5m, against Pounds 54.8m in 1990. However, the increase in
business is perhaps best seen in volume terms. Cargo volumes through the
port of Liverpool rose in 1991 by more than 1.5m tonnes to 24.7m tonnes.
Most trades increased over the previous year. In 1987 the port handled 10m
tonnes of cargo.
Mr Furlong mentions two specific growth points for the future. PowerGen is
spending Pounds 40m on an environmentally sensitive bulk terminal at
Gladstone Dock. This will handle 5m tonnes of coal a year.
The other is the dedicated freightliner terminal at the Royal Seaforth
Container Terminal. This means that Liverpool will be set to become the
landbridge port for Irish trade with Europe, and for containers from North
Atlantic deep sea shipping services. It is anticipated that this trade will
initially be 60,000 container units once the Channel Tunnel opens.
There are also plans to expand Irish trade to Europe by using the Humberside
ports.
Although the core business of the Mersey Docks group of companies is
operating the Port of Liverpool and the Liverpool freeport, the group's
seven other companies include a port management consultancy, a security
service, a travel agency and property development partnerships.
Around 10 per cent or 200 acres of the port's land is non-operational and
available for property development. The company has successfully built and
mostly sold residential units at Waterloo Dock in conjunction with Barratts
Homes.
Recently, the company received planning permission from the Merseyside
Development Corporation to develop 1.5m sq ft of offices with P&amp;O at
Prince's Dock, a prime site next to Pier Head.
All this should keep profits on a rising curve. This would be welcome.
Although pre-tax profits were a record, the need to make provision for tax
for the first time meant that earnings per share showed a decline of 5 per
cent from 17.9p to 17p.
Relieved of its debts, however, the company's shares have become worth
trading again. The government still has a 20 per cent shareholding from the
days of the rescue, but is a passive investor. It has said it will sell its
shares when the time is right, raising the question of whether the company
might even become an attractive takeover target.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (2): Numbers slim down to fit a smaller
economy - The changing structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DECEMBER 1981 Merseyside County Council made a detailed forecast of
trends in the local economy, relating them to jobs. It was thought to be
scaremongering.
Merseyside had 619,000 jobs in 1977, but by 1981 the total was down to
560,000. The county council foresaw a range of possibilities for 1986 - the
year it was to be abolished by the government - from a high of 541,000 to a
low of 481,000. It hoped 10,000 jobs would come from inward investment and
new initiatives to put the probable level at 500,000.
In fact, the worst fears were realised. The 10 biggest sectors on Merseyside
in 1990 employed just over 400,000 people. The total of all sectors, about
20,000 higher, was an almost exact straight-line projection of the 'low'
forecast.
In half a generation, Merseyside has lost about a third of its jobs, the
bulk of them manual. The biggest employment sectors in the 1990s are largely
service-based, requiring an educated or skilled workforce.
Manufacturing, 202,000 strong in 1977, has been more than halved in size in
terms of jobs. In the modern - and almost full - environment of the new
strategic asset of Wavertree Technology Park, unskilled manual labour is not
required. The picture appears desperate for those displaced by Merseyside's
comprehensive economic restructuring, but - paradoxically - it is not as bad
as it looks.
Unemployment rates explain why. The volume of jobs lost since 1977 should
have given Merseyside a rate of nearly 40 per cent by now. In fact,
unemployment in May was 17 per cent, with 96,319 claiming benefit.
This is actually fewer than the 98,610 of November 1988, when the UK economy
was booming. But that was then 16 per cent of the Merseyside workforce.
Long-term and short-term, the figures can only mean one thing.
Professor Patrick Minford, Liverpool University's famous monetarist
economist, explains: 'Depopulation is proving the long-term solution. The
sort of jobs that have been coming in have been non-manual. This is a good
area for non-manual workers. It has good culture and nice housing stock.
'Manual workers have been looking elsewhere; first they commute to work in
other towns and cities and come back home at weekends, then they relocate
altogether. The collapse of the private housing market in London and the
south has helped because the rented sector there is now healthier and more
affordable.'
While depopulation ought theoretically to damage the tax base and local
spending power, this has not been the case because Merseyside's reshaped
economic structure is increasingly skilled, professional and middle-class.
There are fewer workers, but they are individually better paid, pushing up
overall earnings.
Coupled with lower costs and housing compared with the south, this helps
explain why Merseyside as a whole rarely looks like a place on its uppers.
Most people lead an affluent, comfortable life, in spite of the inner city's
struggle with decline.
This applies not only to professionally qualified or white-collar workers.
Mr Terry Greer is chief executive of Johnson Group Cleaners, founded in
Liverpool in 1817 and located in Bootle since 1896. It is a highly
successful, quoted company, with a thriving international business in the
US.
Its cleaning and industrial clothing rental business in Bootle is also group
headquarters. There are 360 employees on Merseyside out of Johnson's 5,000
in the UK. Local business has grown dramatically, but not jobs. Output
increases have come by training a highly flexible workforce with the skills
to deliver increasing productivity - and be paid commensurately.
Similar productivity improvements and staffing reductions have produced
flexible, mechanised, highly skilled and well-paid jobs in the docks and car
factories.
Meanwhile, white-collar areas such as governmental, financial and
professional services have grown because of Liverpool's low cost base. There
is usually a shortage of suitable staff. Royal Insurance is a principal
employer, while stockbrokers Charterhouse Tilney and BWD Rensburg have
strong local bases.
Successful law firms include Weightman Rutherfords, Alsop Wilkinson, Lace
Mawer, Mace &amp; Jones, and the rapidly emergent Bermans, which also boasts
busy offshoots in New York and Manchester and an associate office in
Glasgow.
Mr Ian Short of Bermans typifies the upbeat mood: 'There were 29 of us in
Liverpool in 1979. By 1986 we were up to 60 and we have more than doubled
that now. People talk of the need for incentives to attract investment but
we have never needed to lever a grant out of anyone.'
Like many others, Bermans takes training seriously and supports the
Merseyside training and enterprise council.
The USM-quoted company, Rathbones, has been a Liverpool business since
before 1742, when its records show it was already a successful timber
importer and merchant. For most of this century, it has offered personal
financial and fund management services, an extension of an original family
sideline through which its famous members found time for good works while
safeguarding the Rathbone fortune.
From about 10 people shortly after the war, there are nearer 200 now, spread
between offices in London and Liverpool.
According to Mr Sebastian Rathbone: 'Merseyside is a jolly good place to run
a business. The quality of people is high. They are not cheap, but they are
priced competitively and very loyal. Many of our staff have been here more
than 15 years; it makes for a better atmosphere in the office and for
reliability.
'Our strength is operating from a low cost area to sell our services
throughout the world.'
The sector which has come from nowhere, however, is tourism, once scoffed at
by some Labour politicians as unlikely to produce 'proper' jobs. Yet it now
employs some 14,000 on Merseyside, with others indirectly affected as
suppliers of services to the sector.
Merseyside had 29m visitors in 1990 - the last time tourism was measured
comprehensively - compared with 19m in 1985. Numbers of staying visitors -
they spend between Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 each compared with the Pounds 6
to Pounds 8 of day-trippers - nearly doubled to 3.5m.
Revenues from tourism in 1990 were Pounds 335m, compared with Pounds 223m in
1985. Last year, Merseyside's average hotel occupancy was 62 per cent, with
a July high of 74 per cent. The overall annual figures for Manchester and
Cheshire were less than 54 per cent.
Mr Samir Rihani, chief executive of Merseyside Tourism Board, says that 10
years ago tour companies used Liverpool as a cheap watering hole between
Chester and the Lake District, paying as little as Pounds 15 a night for
hotel rooms. The trade rate is more than Pounds 40 now, and the visitors are
more likely to stay two nights to take in the Albert Dock and Beatles and
other heritage attractions.
'It's all about bringing in money,' he says. 'Money equates to new jobs.'
The new industry has also created a new type of skilled operator. When
potential inward investors are shown round now, professional guides from the
tourism board do the job, well equipped to accentuate the positive. In spite
of unemployment, there seem plenty of plusses about.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (4): The clean-up continues - One of
the dirtiest rivers in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT Europe stretches to the Urals, it may well be that more filthy
rivers can be found, but the Mersey remains the UK's dirtiest.
Dr James Leeming, regional environment quality manager of the National
Rivers Authority, says the Mersey basin contains 20 per cent of Britain's
most polluted water courses.
Dr Leeming estimates that one third of the total length of the basin's
waterways are too polluted to support a large population of fish; the water
can be used for industry but not for drinking. Half as many are worse,
supporting only primitive life such as bloodworms.
This sorry state arose because the Mersey basin's catchment area was one of
the cradles of the industrial revolution. For more than 100 years, all kinds
of industries abused and misused the waterways.
Moreover, the basin is huge, covering an area of 5,000 sq km, with 1,700 km
of waterways. It also contains 5m people and their domestic sewerage has
been and remains the worst problem.
Sewers, pipes and other facilities were built long ago and are now
overstretched. Storm overflows are inadequate, often dumping domestic
effluent straight into the Mersey.
The Mersey Basin Campaign - a nationally co-ordinated effort to clean things
up - is partly funded by the Department of the Environment and now involves
the National Rivers Authority, North West Water, the privatised authority,
local authorities and pressure and interest groups.
About Pounds 4bn will be spent by 2010 in cleaning up and making onshore
improvements.
The standards, set in 1983, aim for 10 per cent dissolved oxygen in the
water, and the end of fouling of the foreshore. This means making the water
fit for drinking after advanced treatment. Coarse fish such as roach and
chub could live in it.
There are slightly different criteria for estuaries, because of the salt
water, but the goal for the Mersey estuary is to achieve equivalent
improvements to the fresh water feeding it.
Mr Peter Walton, head of the Mersey Campaign Unit, says: 'Given the area's
large population and industry, it is probably unrealistic to expect that we
can get the rivers up to a much higher standard.'
It was only with the privatisation of the public sector water utility into
North West Water and the establishment of the National Rivers Authority as
its regulatory body that the scale of the problem was fully realised,
although the need for better river sewerage had long been understood.
As recently as last year largely untreated sewage was being put into the
lower river and the estuary - right in the middle of Merseyside or along its
coasts. There were 26 outfalls on the Liverpool side and 18 on the Cheshire
and Wirral banks, many without even the basic screening provided by grids.
Dr Leeming says: 'The biggest source of polluting matter today is from
discharges under the control of North West Water. These contains both
domestic and trade waste going through their sewers.'
North West Water is investing heavily to remedy the situation. At Sandon
Dock in Liverpool, a sewage treatment works should make a big difference to
Merseyside. This was opened last September on a 20-acre site in the port and
cost Pounds 50m to build.
A further Pounds 150m is being spent on building interceptors to the
outfalls. Six outfalls have so far been linked to the Sandon Dock works. Mr
Tony Hampson, general manager, estimates these now carry about 45 per cent
of all the discharges formerly emptying directly into the Mersey.
Mr John Meacher, Sandon's project manager, says the other outfalls should
all be linked up by around 1995. Interim screening has been introduced on
the Wirral side and another plant is planned.
By the end of the decade there should therefore be primary treatment for all
discharges into the Mersey.
Whether this will make the Mersey clean enough for the European Commission,
however, is another matter. Last year, the goalposts were moved.
Anyone who visits Sandon Dock will see that water does not emerge crystal
clear. The EC's latest Urban Waste Water Treatment directive demands
secondary measures to eliminate suspended colloids, small organic mixtures
which do not settle out during primary treatment.
On top of this, another EC directive means that North West Water will not be
able to deposit the sludge left over from the settlement process in the
Irish Sea, as it has so far. It will either have to build incinerators or
use landfill to dispose of it, adding to costs. The company has already
leased a new 30-acre site adjacent to Sandon Dock.
North West Water says it is currently investing Pounds 500m a year, half
this on water treatment and half on renewal of assets, such as old iron
pipes. The company will have to go on investing at least these amounts to
the end of the decade.
'Anyone who feels we are making excessive profits now or raising our prices
too much ought to realise the size of the investment needed,' the company
says. Charges went up 5 percentage points above inflation this year.
The National Rivers Authority, however, is satisfied. 'North West Water is
making all the investment needed to meet standards. We have some qualms
about the time-scale. We wish they would speed their programme up. It could
be 2000 before everything is in place.'
But at least by then people should be able to bathe off Crosby beach without
feeling they need disinfecting afterwards.

scheme to dam Mersey is in the balance
</HEADLINE>

THE TIDE of opinion favouring a barrage across the river Mersey seems to
have ebbed. It is not clear whether it will flood back in.
Mooted 10 years ago, the barrage has been the subject of three ever more
comprehensive studies since 1987.
It seemed that the barrage would be built when the Pounds 2m Stage 1
pre-feasibility study - which was joint-funded by the Mersey Barrage Company
and the then Department of Energy - reported at the end of 1988.
The imminent privatisation of the electricity companies imposed a Non Fossil
Fuel Obligation (Noffo) on supply companies which would, in time, be
required to buy 20 per cent of their power from nuclear or renewable energy
sources.
The study envisaged a fixed barrage across the River Mersey between
Liverpool and the Wirral. There would be 46 sluices driving 28 turbines,
providing 700MW of electricity, operating 12 hours daily. The barrage would
provide half of Liverpool's electricity requirement during its expected
120-year life. The cost would be Pounds 1bn.
But two of the most serious objections were hydraulic and environmental:
what effect will the barrage have on sedimentation within and beyond the
estuary and what are the consequences for the wildfowl which winter on the
mudflats and sandbanks? These two issues were not fully resolved by stage 1.
Thus, stage 2 of the feasibility studies was set in motion. Again, it was
funded by the Mersey Barrage Company and the DE (at a cost of Pounds 1.3m).
But by this time the government was beginning to have doubts, so it asked
the MDC to launch further studies and ask specific questions.
Fearing that it might have another Channel tunnel on its hands with costs
escalating into the stratosphere, the government wanted a guaranteed maximum
price for the project. It asked for a detailed cost benefit analysis which
would cost the non-energy benefits of the barrage. It also wanted a dialogue
with the shipping interests to allay their fears about access to the
Manchester Ship Canal, and to look closely at the size and times when locks
could be open.
Stage 3 studies were set up and this time funded by some of the MBC's
shareholders including Tarmac, Costain Civil Engineering, Northern
Engineering Industries, and Trafalgar House. Stage 3 cost Pounds 3m and the
report appeared in summer 1991.
Mr James McCormack, general manager of the MBC, says: 'We have answered all
the government's questions. We have come up with a cost envelope which gives
a guaranteed maximum price of Pounds 1bn. Our detailed cost benefit analysis
covers everything: environmental costs, congestion costs, tourism benefits
and so on.
'We estimate there could be a net economic benefit of Pounds 308m at 1991
prices. We have had prolonged talks with the shipping interests, and have
done detailed environmental studies. The sedimentation could be resolved by
dredging. Still, the government has not given us an answer.'
The MBC feels it must have a government response so that it can press ahead
with stage 4 which would be a full developmental study costing Pounds 16m.
It also needs an answer so that a bill can be put through parliament and,
not least, so that finance can be raised.
The government's hesitation makes raising finance even for development
studies more difficult. However, some critics are not sure the doubts have
been stifled by the stage 3 report.
One businessman formerly connected with Manchester Ship Canal says: 'It is
nonsense to say that shipping would not be affected, when they would have to
spend time passing through a lock in the barrage.
'Ships already have to go through one lock to get into the canal at Eastham
and this already restricts the use they can make of the tide. I am not sure
either whether the sedimentation is as easily resolved as the MBC thinks:
one will not know until the barrage is built.
'Also, the cost is too high. If it's jobs you want to create, there are
better ways to spend Pounds 1bn in Liverpool. Finally there is the
environmental argument. At a time when there is an attempt to clean up the
Mersey, the barrage would be impounding dirty water.'
Another shipping businessman, who also does not want his name revealed says:
'The suggested line is close to where Shell's oil tankers unload at
Tranmere: construction would interfere with that. Also, these tankers have
to be unloaded at high tide, when there is enough depth of water for them
when full. It would not be ideal to have oil being unloaded close to
turbines going full blast.'
Mr McCormack says that the MBC is slowly gaining the confidence of the
shipping interests and waxes enthusiastic about the barrage.
'Apart from the environmental benefits, a Pounds 1bn investment would give a
terrific boost to Liverpool. There would be 4,000 to 5,000 jobs in
construction in building the barrage,' he says.
He admits to a sense of frustration, however. 'As the government drags its
feet, the backers start to look for other projects to build. People in the
street start believing that the barrage will never take place. People here
in this office begin to think their careers are going out on a limb.
'We have asked the government to give us an answer by the summer about stage
4.'
Given the government's doubts, whether the company will get one is
debatable.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (1): Living down the past - Ten years
of turmoil have left Merseyside struggling for consensus. Good leaders have
emerged and stability is firmer. The conurbation has been slimming down to
fit its new, smaller economy
</HEADLINE>

SIR DESMOND Pitcher, newly knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours, and
chairman of Merseyside Development Corporation, looked over the city of
Liverpool from his office, high in the headquarters of Littlewoods, where he
is chief executive.
'Merseyside has had to bear the consequences of its image,' he said. 'No one
wants to know the school delinquent. The problems were deeper and worse than
in most places, but they were made even worse by a political poison pill.
Fortunately, we don't have to live with that so much now.'
Sir Desmond is one of the people picking up the pieces after 10 years of
turmoil. They began with Liverpool's Toxteth riots in 1981 and - everyone
hopes - ended last year, when Liverpool city council withstood seven months
of bitter strikes by left-wing town hall trade unions to prove the council
runs the city.
The years between saw what Mr Neil Kinnock called 'the grotesque chaos' of
Militant's domination of Liverpool in the mid-1980s; the abolition by the
government of Merseyside county council, the only body ever to have held the
place together; the disqualification from office of 47 Liverpool Labour
councillors for financial mismanagement; and the break-up of Merseyside's
main party of local government - Labour - into almost sectarian left-wing
factions.
The means of getting over this trauma are now to hand. Politically, the
ultra-left has been marginalised. Moderation and consensus are apparent.
Substantial economic reconstruction has seen Merseyside shrink through
migration. It had nearly 1.6m people when it was formed nearly 20 years ago
but has closer to 1.4m now.
At 17 per cent, unemployment is bad, but depopulation means it is not
getting as bad as it has been. Although 200,000 jobs have been lost since
1977, the bulk of the 420,000 that now exist are well-paid and largely
filled by qualified, skilled or at least trained people. Professor Patrick
Minford, the Liverpool University economist, says this means the tax base
and total local spending power have not eroded.
At the same time, there is plenty to boast about.
Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, forgiven its debts by the government and
freed from trade union power by the abolition of the National Dock Labour
Scheme, has revived the port of Liverpool.
Liverpool Freeport is the most successful in Britain and an important
selling point to potential inward investors. They like the cash flow
benefits of its VAT-free internal regime.
Merseyside Development Corporation (MDC) has rescued the Mersey's two
waterfronts from dereliction, laying the basis for a tourist industry with
14,000 jobs that brought in 29m visitors last year.
Under the energetic Prof Peter Toyne, the elevation of Liverpool Polytechnic
into John Moores University - named after the founder of Littlewoods - has
created a more competitive academic environment for Liverpool University.
Merseyside is a good place to live; some of the talented staff and students
attracted will, as they always have, stick and stay. Merseyside won two of
the 11 national prizes in the government's City Challenge competition, one
on each side of the river, with millions of pounds of urban funding now
wiping out dereliction in Liverpool and Wirral.
The July issue of North West Business Insider, a magazine which chronicles
corporate milestones in the region, lists 35 significant projects and
developments currently under way in the Mersey docklands. A promotional
concert tour by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra to the eastern
seaboard of the US in February - paid for by the MDC and with a government
minister in attendance - produced 1,000 leads.
When the 111 tall ships of the Columbus Grand Regatta finish their race
across Atlantic in the Mersey next month, scores of potential US investors
will be there to see them, as well as to attend an operatic gala, compered
by Sir Peter Ustinov, which the MDC is staging near the Albert Dock.
In spite of all this, Sir Desmond, who took the chair at MDC 14 months ago,
and has focused its growth on 10 main project areas, points to a problem
stemming from past conflicts.
'Merseyside is full of people with skill and talent,' he says. 'But it has
been like a company whose directors are always arguing with each other.'
Urban regeneration elsewhere has demonstrated three main requirements.
First, there have to be leaders; second, all involved have to sink their
differences and work towards common goals; and, third, each leader has to
have a wider vision of the community than their own role in it.
Merseyside has always had good leaders. The problem has been getting them to
work together. It is as acute today as ever. Thus, it is proving very
difficult to form a Merseyside partnership of local authorities, government
agencies and the private sector to set common goals and develop the sort of
vision with which Glasgow revitalised itself in the 1980s.
The process is in its third year. Other communities have formed their
partnerships in weeks. Merseyside's started after Baroness Chalker, then MP
for Wallasey, was the moving force behind a large meeting of all potential
partners.
Government support was through the Merseyside Task Force, which co-ordinates
the work of various Whitehall departments in the area and controls the
purse-strings for most projects in need of public funding.
Prof Graeme Davies became chairman of the putative partnership. His was the
politically neutral constituency of Liverpool University, which he had
shaken out of years of inertia, as far as its role in the Merseyside
community was concerned.
But last year his talents saw him plucked out by the government to run the
Universities Funding Council. Mr John Billington, fourth-generation head of
Edward Billington &amp; Sons, one of Britain's last three sugar merchants, took
over. He has hands-on local government support from Mr David Henshaw, chief
executive of Knowsley council.
If this dislocation of chairmanship did not bode well, neither did 10 months
of uncertainty about the date of the general election. Labour would have
abolished the MDC and created a Merseyside Development Agency with
plenipotentiary powers. Local politicians dragged their feet to see what
might happen.
Meanwhile, diplomatic gaffes resulted in a failure to invite Liverpool
Chamber of Commerce - which has 1,300 members - to take part, as well as
Wirral feeling it was being left in the cold. Both mistakes have been
rectified, but many people seem incapable of forgetting them.
Mr Harry Rimmer, the moderate Labour leader of Liverpool city council, says
he finds it all 'depressing'. Wirral - which has 23 per cent of Merseyside's
population against Liverpool's 30 per cent - already has a successful
partnership, with powerful private sector participation from Candy,
Unilever, Shell and Vauxhall.
It is reluctant to risk public money on Merseyside and would rather go it
alone, though it will probably support Mr Billington for form's sake.
The most active private sector input has to come from Boom - Business
Opportunities on Merseyside - an enthusiastic promotional pressure group
founded by Mr Geoffrey Piper, formerly Deloitte's regional senior partner -
who also runs the north-west business leadership team.
It has 120 influential corporate members paying Pounds 2,400 each. 'Boom
will not wind itself up if there is no proper vehicle we can hand over to,'
Mr Piper says emphatically.
Mr Billington says: 'I know what's wanted but I am very frustrated at the
speed we can do anything. Because of everyone's diary commitments, it takes
four weeks to arrange a meeting that all five council chief executives can
attend. I'm used to getting on with it.'
He hopes to have a business plan to put to a public meeting of potential
partners this month, to recruit a chief executive in November and start up
officially next April.
If he succeeds, most will see it as a triumph. As Prof Minford puts it:
'John Billington is a very nice man who has managed to keep a lot of people
in the same room for a long time. That's a major achievement in this area.
It's as difficult as doing it in Northern Ireland.'
In the meantime, Merseyside will have to go on speaking for itself.
Unfortunately, its history has a very loud voice.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Greycoat loan refinanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT, the UK property company, has completed the refinancing of
Embankment Place, a central London office development, with a Pounds 125m
fixed-rate syndicated loan secured on the property. The loan was arranged by
Hypo-Bank and has been syndicated among German, Dutch and Swiss banks.
Earlier this year, Greycoat tried to refinance its Pounds 110m loan,
arranged in 1987 to finance the construction of the development, through a
Pounds 125m issue of 10-year discounted bonds. But the market was
unreceptive and the issue was cancelled.
Mr Richard Guignard, managing director (finance), said that when a
refinancing was first considered last year, rental income from the property
was not sufficient to service a bank loan. But, with lower interest rates,
annual net rental income of Pounds 15.3m now comfortably covers the annual
Pounds 13.7m refinancing cost.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Government bond markets
suffer from Maastricht fallout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S vote against the ratification of the Maastricht treaty sent a
shockwave through the European government bond markets last month, resulting
in a decline in total return for the higher-yielding markets, according to
J. P. Morgan.
Italy and Spain were the worst-performing government bond markets in June,
registering falls of 1.26 per cent and 1.24 per cent respectively.
Denmark, France, Sweden and the UK also suffered a fall in total returns as
the Danish referendum result took its toll on those markets which investors
had thought had the most to gain from the convergence of interest rates.
In the wake of the Danish referendum on June 2, dealers reported a switching
out of high-yielding European bonds into the relative safety of the D-Mark
bloc. However, in local currency terms, the D-Mark markets (Germany, Belgium
and the Netherlands) still showed a fall in capital return. 'No European
market gave a positive capital return in June - only the inclusion of the
month's accrual of coupon income lifted returns into positive territory,'
according to Kemper Investment Management Company, which tracks 21 bond
markets worldwide.
The top performing markets in June were Canada (2.84 per cent), Australia
(2.8 per cent), Japan (2.21 per cent), New Zealand (1.98 per cent) and the
US (1.7 per cent) in local currency terms, according to Kemper. The dollar
bloc benefited primarily from the uncertainty over the future of European
economic and monetary union, and these five markets were the only ones to
show positive capital returns. Australia and the UK were the top performing
markets in the second quarter of 1992 in local currency terms, showing gains
of 7.89 per cent and 6.34 per cent respectively.
US dollar-based investors saw the best returns from the D-Mark bloc bond
markets during June due to the dollar's decline of over 5 per cent against
most European currencies.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome share price victim of 'bear raid
by professionals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WELLCOME share price has been the victim of 'a long-drawn-out bear raid
by the professionals,' according to Volume Analysis, a company which
examines stock market trading patterns.
Shares in the drugs group have fallen sharply since Wellcome Trust, the
medical charity, said in early March that it would reduce its stake from
73.5 per cent to under 50 per cent, and possibly to 25 per cent.
They were 1,126p before the original announcement and closed yesterday at
854p, down 15p on the day. They have fallen by 20 per cent more than the
FT-SE 100 index over the period.
Last week Wellcome Trust said it planned to sell 330m shares, cutting its
stake to 35 per cent. However, more shares could be sold.
There have been suspicions that institutional investors have been talking
the price down or even selling shares with the aim of buying them back
cheaper in the sale.
Mr Charles Wyatt of Volume Analysis said that last week, when the share
price fell heavily, intra-market trade was nearly three times the volume of
customer business. Normally the proportions would be the other way round.
He said this suggested professionals in the market had been 'going short in
size to bring the share price down' prior to the sale.

FT  02 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIZEABLE selling by a number of the larger securities houses led to heavy
falls in stock index futures yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo.
Favourable results from GEC and Granada brought a strong opening for the
September contract on the FT-SE of 2,555, and that momentum soon carried the
contract to 2,561. This proved to be the high of the day, before a sell
programme in the underlying cash market by County NatWest  - also done in
the futures - sent the contract into retreat.
The downward direction continued in the afternoon, with Salomon Bros and
James Capel reported to have been among the big sellers of the session. Not
even the firm opening on Wall street could curtail the falls in the
contract, and September eventually closed at 2,510, down 35 from Tuesday's
session and around 13 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash
of about 25. Turnover, at 9,666 lots, was an improvement on recent levels.
Dealers reported a volatile day in the traded options market, which led to
increased volume. Total turnover reached 45,144 lots, with the FT-SE option
particularly busy at 20,183 contracts.
Lonrho was the most actively traded stock option, with a total of 1,706 lots
dealt by the close of business.

FT  02 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by fall in ADRs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POOR performance in the US for Glaxo on Tuesday ensured that the shares
would follow suit in London yesterday. The pharmaceuticals group was further
affected by bearish news on the pricing of drugs in Europe. Glaxo fell 21 to
658p, its lowest level since last August, on heavy turnover of 5.6m.
Shares dealt in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) had fallen
by a dollar in New York to Dollars 25 1/8 . The ADRs tested an eight-month
low following a recent profits downgrading, and a dealer said the percentage
of Glaxo stock held in ADR form had now dropped below 27 per cent.
Later, marketmakers focused on news that German health care reforms would
force companies such as Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, which dipped 11 to
882p, to reduce drug prices.
The second stage of a price referencing process went into effect yesterday
in Germany, and the move will affect the H2-antagonists class of drugs which
include Glaxo's headline product Zantac and SmithKline's Tagamet. However,
the probability of a price-cutting drive was acknowledged some time ago by
most pharmaceuticals analysts.
Granada sparkles
Sparkling interim results from Granada Group sent the shares ahead 13 to
257p, making it the best performing stock in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday.
The leisure group's 49 per cent rise in profits, to Pounds 57.2m, was
attributed to extensive cost-cutting rather than a genuine upturn in
business. Analysts predicted more savings in the second half and promptly
upgraded their forecasts to a range from Pounds 112m to Pounds 118m for this
year, and Pounds 135m to Pounds 140m for 1993. Hoare Govett, the company's
broker, moved from its undervalued stance to buy, although County NatWest
advised clients to take profits.
Pressure on Forte continued as rumours of a rights issue circulated but were
firmly denied by the hotel group. Behind the market talk was the continued
uncertainty surrounding Forte's prolonged proposed disposal of its catering
division, including Gardner Merchant, to Compass Group and ARA Holdings, of
the US.
Sources close to the talks say the complex negotiations are proceeding, but
the Pounds 550m sale price originally mentioned is now looking increasingly
optimistic. Whispers in the market also suggest some of Gardner Merchant's
largest customers are unhappy with the proposed buyers taking over their
contracts, with one said to have cancelled its agreement.
However, traders point to other considerations, namely the continued
weakness in the UK hotel market. The shares, down to 187p at one stage,
finished a net 6 off at 193p, the lowest closing level since December 1987.
The market registered its pleasure with GEC's preliminary figures by
hoisting the shares to 240p; they finally settled at 233p for a net gain of
8. Turnover expanded to 16m.
Mr James Ross, electronics specialist at Hoare Govett, described GEC as
'undervalued' and said he saw plenty of scope for outperformance by the
shares.
The expiry of the June petroleum products contract on the International
Petroleum Exchange saw crude oil prices under heavy pressure and triggered
another slide in oil shares. The biggest casualty was Lasmo, which dropped
13 to 167p, its lowest since December 1987. The stock had been chased higher
on stories that a bid was in the offing.
Big turnover in BP saw 23m shares changing hands, much of which was said to
have followed a switch recommendation, apparently by one of the influential
London investment houses, out of Shell, 5 1/2 down at 499 1/2 p. BP moved up
5 1/2 to 209p.
The exceptional defensive qualities of the utilities areas of the market
were said to have attracted the attentions of at least one of the UK's
biggest institutions and led to sharp gains among the stocks.
Worries about the debt refinancing of Isosceles, which owns the Gateway
supermarkets group, led to another bout of selling pressure in Standard
Chartered and SG Warburg. Rumours that Isosceles had encountered refinancing
problems have been circulating in the stock market for at least two weeks
and triggered a sharp decline in Warburg and Standard Chartered shares in
the middle of last week.
Fears of dividend cuts and the slide in the UK equity market and its
damaging effect on the composite insurers' solvency margins brought pressure
to bear on the sector. Sun Alliance lost 14 to 275p and Royal, a prime
dividend cut candidate, according to dealers, declined 6 tp 222p.
Dealing began in British Biotechnology, the first biotechnology company to
be listed on the London Stock Exchange. The shares opened at 425p and closed
25 up at 450p.
Electrical goods manufacturer Kenwood made a more than satisfactory stock
market debut. The shares, offered at 285p, traded at a 5p premium during
early dealing and eventually settled at a 2p premium, in spite of the heavy
sell-off in the equity market.
Aegis, the holding company for the world's largest group of media buying and
planning specialists, fell 10 to 79p as agency broker James Capel lowered
its profits forecasts for the group.
Capel cut its 1992 estimate by Pounds 20m, to Pounds 29m, and the 1993
figure by Pounds 14m, to Pounds 46m. The broker said a greater than expected
exceptional charge and a 'dire performance in France' had prompted the
review.
Marketing group WPP held firm at 50p after announcing that it had agreed to
swap some 25 per cent of the debt provided by its banking syndicate for new
convertible preferred shares. SG Warburg upgraded its recommendation on the
ordinary and convertible shares to a buy.
A view that worries about the effect of Germany's withdrawal from the
European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project had been overdone helped British
Aerospace, one of the main UK contractors on the project. The shares bounced
4 to 249p on light turnover of 1.5m. An analyst said: 'The news on EFA was
already discounted in the price.'
The fall in BM Group continued unabated. The shares lost 28 to 85p on
turnover of 5.6m as financial worries continued to dog the company.

FT  02 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities return to pre-election
levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEADLY cocktail of economic gloom and corporate financing and profit
worries drove the stock market down below the FT-SE 2,500 mark yesterday for
the first time since the re-election of the UK Conservative government in
April. The setback was accompanied by a heavy sell-off in the stock index
futures sector. At the day's low point, the Footsie was 33 points off and
heading for the biggest one-day loss of the year; but a late rally trimmed
the fall to 27.3 for a final reading of 2,493.9.
Weakness in share prices was counter-balanced by strength in UK government
bonds, prompting suggestions that a large institution might be switching
from equities into gilts, by way of the index futures sector.
A leading US securities house was a heavy seller of the September futures
contract on the FT-SE Index, and returned aggressively in the afternoon
after news of a fall in the latest US National Association of Purchasing
Management Index. But at least two UK securities houses were also heavy
sellers in the futures market.
Activity in futures also appeared to be related to a large selling programme
in the blue chip equities, completed at midsession but not printed until the
end of the day.
Adding to the market's nervousness were the pressures imposed by prospects
for the clutch of new share issues now pending. Traders waited anxiously for
news on the Telegraph issue, which was not known in market hours, and among
retailers there were uncertainties over the planned refinancing of Isosceles
and the pricing for MFI, the furniture group, which is expected today.
Investors also have to deliver today their cheques for the Pounds 1.9bn
second payment on BT shares.
The continued flow of profits downgradings of leading British companies by
brokerage houses completed the woe of the investment community. However,
trading volume was not excessive.
Seaq deals increased from Tuesday's 458.5m shares to 495.1m yesterday. 'Not
particularly heavy for a day on which the Footsie fell so heavily and the
background was so bleak,' commented one leading dealer.
Dealers stressed that equity trading was still affected by technical factors
as the market moved yesterday into the first day of dealing for the third
quarter of the year. Daily totals of customer, or retail, business in
equities, which are regarded as the most significant guide to investment
activity, have remained relatively low this week.
Tuesday's customer business was worth only Pounds 839.9m, below the Pounds
1bn figure seen as the sign of a healthily profitable market from the
viewpoint of the big securities houses.
Some market analysts were sceptical of yesterday's setback, which implied
that fund managers were over-pessimistic and assuming that the Footsie would
struggle to hold 2,600 at the year-end. Equity strategists preferred to
emphasise that such a view would overlook the likelihood of some recovery in
company profits in the third and fourth quarters of this year.

FT  02 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow firms on continued rate
cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A WEAKER than expected national purchasing managers report boosted
investors' hopes for lower interest rates, lifting US share prices across
the board in the process, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 35.58 ahead at 3,354.10, its high
for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 4.74 to 412.88, while the
American SE composite added 3.73 at 383.01 and the Nasdaq composite ended
5.39 higher at 568.99.
Turnover on the New York SE was fairly heavy at 214m shares, and rises
outpaced falls by more than two-to-one.
As it has for the past week, speculation about monetary policy remained the
dominant influence on market sentiment. An announcement from the National
Association of Purchasing Management that its index of nationwide business
activity fell from May's 56.3 to 52.8 in June sparked widespread strong
buying. The report indicates that the economy is still expanding, albeit
very slowly, but analysts had predicted a stronger number.
The figures immediately boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve, which was
reviewing monetary policy at its monthly Open Market Committee meeting
yesterday, will cut interest rates once more to stimulate economic activity.
If today's June employment report is noticeably weak, then the chances of a
rate cut will be high, analysts said.
Among individual stocks, General Motors retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 43
after analysts warned that a write-off at its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary,
announced late on Tuesday, could wipe out the carmaker's profits for the
first half of this year. GM's class 'H' shares, which represent Hughes,
dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 22 5/8 . The other two auto giants were
also lower, with Chrysler off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 21 and Ford Dollars
3/8 cheaper at Dollars 45 3/8 .
Owens-Corning moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 31 3/4 after the company
settled its lawsuits related to asbestos.
The retailer, Bradlees, a subsidiary of Stop &amp; Shop, made its debut
yesterday. With 11m shares offered to the public at Dollars 13 each, the
stock finished the session at Dollars 12 1/2 after turnover of 2.6m shares.
Stop &amp; Shop, meanwhile, was Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 13 1/8 .
Systems Center plummeted Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 on a warning from
the company that it expects to post a significant operating loss in the
second quarter.
On the Nasdaq market, Wetterau climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 in
the wake of a deal clinched late on Tuesday whereby Super Valu will buy
Wetterau for Dollars 30 1/4 a share in cash.
Oracle Systems appreciated Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 17 3/8 after an analyst
at broking house Alex Brown upgraded the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy' in
the wake of the company's strong earnings.
Michael's Stores weakened Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 17 1/2 after investors
reacted negatively to news that the retailer's same store sales during June
were up by just 2 per cent.
Toronto was closed yesterday for Canada Day.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Growth fears depress dollar
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday cont-inued its run of weakness amid fears about the
pace of the US economic recovery, writes Peter Marsh.
While some international investors switched money out of dollars on
speculation that the US Federal Reserve might soon sanction a cut in
borrowing rates, the D-Mark was relatively strong due to unease in financial
markets about progress towards European currency union.
The US currency's weakness was triggered mainly by news of an unexpectedly
sharp drop in an index of economic activity compiled by the National
Association of Purchasing Management. This fell to 52.8 last month from 56.3
in May, indicating relative gloom about economic prospects.
After President George Bush's comments last week that he would like to see
lower US interest rates, this led to some bullishness about imminent action
by the Fed. But a contrasting argument is that the US central bank may
refrain from changing borrowing costs, if only to show its unwillingness to
bow to political rhetoric.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.517, down more than  1/2 pfennig from
Tuesday's DM1.5235 close. It had fallen to DM1.51 earlier in the day, within
striking distance of this year's low point of DM1.5045. In New York the
dollar rallied to finish at DM1.5236.
The US unit also declined against sterling, which finished at Dollars 1.911,
compared with Dollars 1.904 previously, while against the yen, the dollar
slipped to Y124.9 from Y125.85. The dollar improved in New York to end at
Y125.35, with the UK currency at Dollars 1.9045.
The pound was finally quoted in London unchanged against the D-Mark at
DM2.9, but many dealers are unenthusiastic about the possibilities of gains
by the UK currency in the coming weeks. It is still the weakest unit in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
A combination of worrying news about the UK economy and fears that the
Maastricht deal on European union might unravel has unsettled many sterling
investors. 'The pound is going to be vulnerable to jitters in the short
term,' said Mr Ifty Islam, a currency specialist at UK investment house
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The French franc ended at FFr3.364 to the D-Mark, from FFr3.365 the previous
night, while the Italian lira, second weakest member of the ERM, eased to
L756.6 against the D-Mark from L756.2.
Fourteen banks, including Barclays, Commerzbank, Midland, and Hongkong Bank,
have set up a foreign exchange clearing house in London.
In Budapest, Hungary's first interbank foreign exchange market made a
cautious start. Less than Dollars 10m changed hands but the National Bank of
Hungary said it was pleased.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Lukewarm trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING was quiet yesterday in the money markets, reflecting the
disinclination of dealers to gamble on an early cut in UK base rates.
Another factor was that the banking system was relatively flush with cash.
As a result, the Bank of England had no need to inject money into the system
through bill purchases.
The three-month interbank rate - a good reflection of what the markets think
base rates will be in the future - was quoted last night at 10 1/32 per
cent, down  1/32 of a point from the previous close.
That underlined sentiment in the market that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, is unlikely to find an opportunity over the summer to cut base
rates from the current 10 per cent. 'Even though all the indicators are that
the economy could benefit from a cut, the pound's weakness means the options
are strictly limited,' said a money market trader.
The limited interest in speculating on a broadly based reduction in
borrowing costs was reflected in only a small amount of activity on the
sterling futures market.
The September future contract traded within a narrow spectrum, finishing the
day at 90.12, hardly changed from the 90.11 recorded on Tuesday night. Last
night's closing price indicates the market's perception that there is little
probability of a change in base rates by mid-September.
With the cash shortage in the money markets estimated by the Bank of England
at only Pounds 200m, its technical operations were limited to lending about
Pounds 185m to the discount houses. The terms of the deal were not
specified, but it is thought the houses have to repay the cash today, at
close to the 10 per cent base rate.
The extremely low shortage surprised some dealers. It was mainly due to
unspecified payments into the economy by the Treasury totalling some Pounds
800m.
The Bundesbank said it accepted bids for DM35.9bn in tenders for securities
repurchase funds. It allocated DM27.2bn of 35-day funds, mostly at rates of
9.65 per cent. It also accepted some bids made at a lower allocated rate of
9.60 per cent.
The central bank allocated DM8.7bn of 63-day funds, mostly at 9.65 per cent,
and accepted nearly a third of all bids made at this rate.

grain futures

A US Department of Agriculture crop report sent soyabean and wheat prices
plunging yesterday morning at the Chicago Board of Trade. The report,
released after the close of trading on Tuesday, said that farmers had
planted far more soyabeans than the market expected and that wheat stocks
were considerably higher than the industry had estimated.
CBoT soyabean traders rushed to knock more than 10 cents a bushel off the
July and August futures contracts. The July contract, the spot month, which
closed on Tuesday at Dollars 6.00 3/4 a bushel, opened in the range of
Dollars 5.87 to Dollars 5.88 a bushel. But the contract, like others in the
more distant months, regained a few cents during morning trading.
The USDA had reported that farmers planted 59m acres of soyabeans, about
1.2m acres more than the average industry estimate. Some of the extra
acreage came from 'double cropping', as farmers replanted winter wheat
fields with a summer crop of soyabeans. This followed a poor winter wheat
crop in many parts of the midwest.
Wheat traders also nipped 5 cents off prices at the opening of trading. The
Tuesday close had been Dollars 3.49 1/2 a bushel and the opening range was
Dollars 3.45 to Dollars 3.455. But, as in the case of soyabeans, prices
rebounded a bit by mid-morning to level the price loss to about 3.25 cents
for the July contract, which hovered at Dollars 3.46 a bushel.
In contrast, maize futures gained a few cents on the USDA report, which said
that maize planting and stocks were below analysts' estimates. Although some
had thought maize might follow other grains lower, the July spot month rose
3 cents by mid-morning to Dollars 2.51 1/4 a bushel.
There was some speculation that soyabean and wheat prices could reverse
direction if the USDA announced significant export credit sales to the
former Soviet republics yesterday. But no news emerged by mid-day from
Washington and industry analysts said the credit announcements could be
delayed by as much as several days. An allocation of Dollars 300m in credits
is waiting to be used by the Russians and Ukrainians.
However, Mr Daniel Basse, research director of AgResource in Chicago, said:
'The markets could not care less about the purchases by the former Soviet
republics. It's totally a weather market'.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Whale sanctuary plan shelved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHEME to make the Antarctic Ocean a sanctuary free of whaling suffered a
reverse yesterday at the International Whaling Commission when France,
proposer of the idea, asked for its consideration to be deferred to next
year.
France took the decision at the annual meeting of the IWC in Glasgow because
of the strength of opposition from whaling nations. It was greeted with
dismay by conservation bodies, which had seen the proposal as a further step
to preserve remaining whale stocks.
At the week-long IWC meeting, nations with whaling industries are seeking a
resumption of commercial whaling through the adoption of a scheme known as
the revised management procedure (RMP). A moratorium on commercial whaling
came into effect in 1985-86 but IWC research suggests that numbers of the
small minke whale have since recovered.
Norway has already said it will resume commercial whaling next year whatever
the IWC decides. Iceland this week left the IWC altogether.
France faced opposition to its sanctuary plan from Japan, Norway, Mexico and
China. Japan also had the backing of four Caribbean states, St Vincent, St
Lucia, Dominica and St Kitts. With these countries opposed the proposal
would not have commanded the required 75 per cent majority of the 29 states
attending the meeting of the 37-member IWC.
Even had it been supported in principle, the proposal, which would have
outlawed whaling beyond the 40 degree south latitude, would not have come
into effect for some years, and it is said to have been poorly prepared.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, early yesterday called off a protest
that on Tuesday blocked the departure from Glasgow of the Elin Toril, a
Norwegian whaling boat, which had sailed to Scotland to support Norway's
case for resumed whaling. Instead it called on Britain to use its European
Community presidency to block any application by Norway to join the EC while
it carried out whaling.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: British Gas in huge Kazakhstan
deal

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS, the UK gas group, and Agip, the oil subsidiary of Italy's
state-owned ENI energy group, have won exclusive negotiating rights with the
former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan to develop the huge Karachaganak oil
and gas field.
The field is among the biggest in the world, containing 20 trillion (million
million) cubic feet of gas - four times the size of the UK's largest gas
field.
Recoverable reserves of oil and condensate are estimated at 2bn barrels,
equal in size to the Forties field in the North Sea. The deal would double
British Gas's worldwide reserves, and is also a big step in Agip's attempt
to break into an international energy industry still dominated by major UK
and US companies.
The two companies have been bidding for 18 months to develop the field,
which is expected to produce into the second half of the next century.
They beat a consortium of BP, the UK oil and gas producer, and Statoil, the
Norwegian state oil company, as well as initial competition from two big US
companies, and hope to sign a final agreement by summer next year. According
to the letter of intent signed in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata yesterday,
the two companies in a 50/50 joint venture will invest more than Dollars 6bn
in the project over the next decade. British Gas refused to release precise
details of the deal, but said that the share of profits going to the Kazakh
government would gradually increase over the life of the field, eventually
tipping the balance in favour of the Kazakhs.
The contract is initially for 40 years, extendable by another 20 years, and
is expected to make a substantial contribution to Europe's gas requirements.
Infrastructure already exists which could transport the gas into western
Europe, via the Soyuz pipeline, but British Gas said it had not ruled out
the possibility of further pipeline construction.
Karachaganak, discovered in 1979, is already producing at a low level, but
investment from the two western companies is expected to bring daily
production up to 2bn cu ft of gas, and 200,000 barrels of oil.
This is the second significant deal involving Kazakhstan in less than two
months. Chevron, the US oil company, recently reached agreement to develop
the giant Tengiz oilfield.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ghanaian cocoa on road to
reform - Plans to liberalise the internal market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER YEARS of cautious reform the Ghanaian government is poised to take big
steps towards privatisation of the cocoa trade and curbing the stranglehold
of the powerful, inefficient and costly Ghana Cocoa Board.
In the face of falling world prices for cocoa and marginal returns to
Ghana's farmers, it is increasingly recognised that considerable savings
must be made in the financing and operating costs of the board, which should
be passed on to smallholder producers in the form of better incentives if
cocoa production is to be maintained at its present level. In a critical
first step, privatisation of domestic marketing is due to be introduced for
the 1992-93 crop.
The 1991-92 crop is estimated at about 240,000 tonnes, a decrease of 16 per
cent from the 286,000 tonnes produced last year. The fall in production
resulted partly from adverse weather conditions but was exacerbated by
farmers turning their attention to other crops.
Last year the government decided to sell forward 80 per cent of the 1991-92
crop, thereby insulating itself from the drop in world prices. In the first
four months of 1992 about 75,000 tonnes of Ghanaian cocoa was delivered to
the world market. While that amount was on target, maintaining deliveries
presented more problems in May and June.
According to the local representative of ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade
house, sales by Ghana to date are no more that 90,000 tonnes. This means
that priced sales to the world market are probably no more than 50,000
tonnes, he says, a historically poor sales position in a depressed market
that weakens the case for the board continuing to market the crop.
He blames the depressed level of world cocoa prices - recently at 16-year
lows - partly on the poor forward sales positions of Ghana and the Ivory
Coast.
The longer the producers stay out of market, the safer the buyers feel, he
explains, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later origins will have to
sell and push the market down.
In Ghana, the crucial contribution of cocoa to tax revenues and foreign
exchange earnings and the powerful position of the board has made cocoa a
highly charged political issue. Rigid price setting and market controls have
dominated the trade. According to the World Bank, inefficiencies in the
marketing system and high levels of taxation have characterised the sector
and resulted in low producer prices, disinvestment and declining yields and
output.
Substantial devaluation combined with limited reforms over the past six
years including the elimination of input subsidies, continuing divestment of
plantations owned by the board, streamlining of operations and a reduction
of at least 12,000 in the board's staff, have already had an impact on
producer prices, which have risen from about 20 per cent of the world market
price in 1983 to about 51 per cent for this crop year. Producers are still
worse off, however, as the world price has fallen by two-thirds over that
period.
Much deeper reforms are necessary to stimulate production by giving farmers
a much higher percentage of the world market price. To do this the
politically powerful vested interests in the cocoa board have to be tackled
and its functions considerably reduced. With a staff of 42,000 and a budget
that consumes a third of total cocoa export revenue, the board, with its
monopoly on domestic trade and external marketing, will have to be broken if
higher producer prices are going to be awarded to farmers.
Last December on farmer's day, Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings, the country's
ruler, announced that the government would introduce private competition in
domestic cocoa marketing. Hopes are high that competitive internal buying
will increase marketing efficiency and raise producer prices as buyers
compete for cocoa.
The huge financing costs of the board, which at present purchases the entire
crop, will also be reduced and spread among several private traders. The
government has already published regulations governing the entry of private
operators into the cocoa market and is due to approve applications for
licences within the next two to three months.
The technical committee of the producer price review committee has also made
recommendations for the board's prices for the 1992-93 crop to be paid both
directly to the farmer and to private licensed buying agents. It recommends
a 2.7 per cent increase in the minimum producer price from C251,000 (Pounds
330) to C258,000 a tonne and that 'takeover prices', at which the board will
buy from the licensed agents at three designated take-over points, be set at
between C307,000 to C319,000 a tonne, depending on the point of take-over
and the origin of the cocoa. The difference between the producer price and
the take-over price represents buyers' operating costs, haulage costs and
profit margins.
The board will then have responsibility for subsequent storage, pre-shipment
handling and final shipment. Several details of the new system have yet to
be worked out but the World Bank is pressing the government to grant the
licences on an annual auction system and only to license buyers who have the
expertise to maintain Ghana's high export quality standards. The bank is
also arguing for private traders to be allowed to operate completely freely
with no reporting, up-country inspection or control procedures exercised by
the board.
Supporters of the system argue that its greatest advantages will be in
higher prices to farmers and considerable staff and financing savings by the
board, which, under the new system, will only have to finance its pre-export
stock.
Other measures like abolishing the government's role in the import and sale
of fertiliser and agrochemicals for the cocoa sector will have to be taken
to boost production further. According to Mr Jim Wilson, managing director
of Valley Farms, the government will also need to consider overhauling its
system of extension services to boost average yields of 250 kg an acre.
Valley Farms, which bought two cocoa plantations from the board, plans to
increase yields to as much as 1.5 tonnes an acre by using new techniques of
vegetative regeneration, clonal seeding, hand pollination and new
insecticides. Most of these techniques are available from the Cocoa Research
Institute of Ghana but are not widely disseminated by the Cocoa Services
Division of the board.
Ultimately, emerging private sector players in the cocoa trade hope the
government will also move to liberalise external marketing. Only if all
these measures are taken, say cocoa experts, will Ghana begin to boost
production to significantly higher levels.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Foreign investors stay away from Italian
10-year auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN government bonds plunged yesterday after international investors
shunned the government's L2,000bn 10-year bond auction, leaving domestic
buyers to take up the issue. The futures contract fell from its opening of
95.80 to a low of 94.95, before edging up to 95.00 by late afternoon.
The Italian government bond market has been particularly vulnerable since
the Danish referendum on Maastricht dealt a severe blow to hopes of
convergence and forced investors to focus more closely on Italy's economic
problems.
At yesterday's auction of 10-year fixed rate bonds, the bids amounted to
L2,390bn. The Bank of Italy said the paper was assigned at a price of 95.50
per cent, down from 99.30 per cent at the last sale of the paper on May 29.
Elsewhere in continental Europe, German government bonds ended the day
unchanged or slightly higher, lifted by the US Treasury bond market. Dealers
said the market was lacklustre as participants were awaiting the outcome of
talks on the 25 per cent withholding tax on investment income.
The French government bond market ended slightly firmer, but dealers said
the market was held in check by the prospect of an auction of FFr9bn to
FFr11bn of bonds.
The French government's announcement yesterday that the referendum on
European monetary and political union would be held on September 20 had
little effect on the market. However, dealers expect the French bond market
to be vulnerable to opinion polls in the intervening period.
UK government bonds rallied by up to three-quarters of a point, helped by
good demand for long-dated gilt issues and sterling's stability in the
foreign exchange markets.
The gilt market started on a strong note, following an announcement that
Electricite de France plans to buy back Pounds 250m of its sterling bonds,
removing some supply from the market.
In addition, rumours circulated that an institution had switched a
significant portion of its equity portfolio into gilts. Dealers reported
lengthening trades and outright buying of long-dated issues.
The Liffe futures contract opened at 98.06 and traded up to 98.24 by late
afternoon on above-average volumes of about 39,000 contracts. In the cash
market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 116 11/32 to 116
15/16 to yield 9.20 per cent.
US Treasury prices bounced back strongly from early losses yesterday after a
weaker-than-expected national purchasing managers' report buoyed interest
rate cut hopes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  9/32 at 102
25/32 , yielding 7.752 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 11/32
, yielding 4.800 per cent.
Prices had opened weaker on a Market News Service report that members of the
Federal Reserve's board had told a group of banking economists last week
that an interest rate cut was unlikely so long as the economy maintained a
steady, if modest, growth path.
The market rebounded, however, after the National Association of Purchasing
Management announced that its index fell from 56.3 in May to 52.8 in June,
and indication of slowing business activity nationwide.
The figures came while the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee was
meeting in Washington, and bond investors hope the NAPM numbers, plus
today's June employment data, will persuade the Fed that the economy needs
fresh monetary stimulus.
JAPANESE government bond prices climbed on hopes of an easing in interest
rates, with cash and futures prices reaching their highest levels since
February.
Dealers said speculation about a cut in interest rates has arisen mainly
because of the fragile state of the Tokyo stock market and the Bank of
Japan's recent tolerance of lower money market rates. The unsecured
overnight call rate slipped  1/32 to 4 23/32 per cent yesterday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.28 per cent and closed
at 5.23 per cent, the high of the day. The September futures contract ended
at 103.15, just off the high of 103.17 and up 0.20 on the previous day.
The Ministry of Finance plans to auction about Y300bn of 20-year government
bonds today. Dealers expect a coupon of 5.9 per cent or 6 per cent.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Two borrowers add to heavy supply of
FRNs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO borrowers yesterday added to recent heavy supply of floating rate paper
in the international bond market, BankAmerica and Asfinag raising Dollars
300m and Dollars 100m respectively.
The deals followed Monday's Dollars 1bn floating rate issue by Finland and a
spate of other recent deals by US and European financial institutions.
Bankers said yesterday that a significant amount of paper from these earlier
transactions remained unsold. In particular, recent issues by Italian banks
have faced problems because of doubts about their credit quality. Last week,
Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, one of Italy's largest financial
institutions, had its credit rating unexpectedly lowered by Moody's
Investors Service, the US rating agency.
In contrast, BankAmerica is one of only a few banks to have its credit
ratings increased. Debt issued by the bank holding company is rated A2 by
Moody's and single-A by Standard &amp; Poor's.
Lead-managed by Kidder Peabody, the paper issued yesterday is fungible with
a Dollars 200m transaction launched in February, creating a liquid benchmark
in the sector. The notes pay  3/8 per cent over the three-month London
interbank offered rate, and were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.80. At this level, the discounted margin is 42 basis points over Libor.
In February, paper was launched at 50 basis points over Libor.
Participants reported steady buying rather than spectacular demand. By the
close of trading in London, the notes were trading at 99.55 bid, inside full
fees of 25 basis points.
The Asfinag paper carries the backing of the Austrian state and a top
triple-a credit rating, but was considered tightly priced. The bonds pay
1/8 per cent over six month Libor, but subject to a cap of 6.5 per cent for
the second year. The cap rises through the five-year life of the bonds.
Elsewhere, IBM International Finance launched a Dollars 300m fixed-rate
deal, targeted at retail investors. The 5.625 per cent paper matures in
1995.
The deal, lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston, was expected to appeal
mainly to Swiss investors with Eurodollar bond holdings maturing over the
next few weeks.
The bonds were re-offered at a fixed price of 99.935, where the yield spread
is 25 basis points over US Treasury bonds.
However, syndicate officials noted that the bonds carry a payment date - the
date on which primary market purchases must be settled - six weeks ahead, an
unusually long period for a Eurobond. This increases the cost of the bonds
for institutional investors switching into the issue, since the proceeds of
bond sales have to be held in cash for longer than usual.
The lead manager said the long payment date, designed to get better terms
for the borrower in the interest rate swaps market, underlined the retail
targeting of the deal.

disposal of assets
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the leading US bank that is seeking to bolster its capital base,
said last night it had raised Dollars 175m by means of the sale of assets
related to its merchant processing unit for credit cards.
The asset disposal, part of the bank's efforts to lift its main Tier 1
capital ratio from its present level of 4.06 per cent to the range of
between 5 and 5 1/2 per cent, is the latest in a string of fund-raising
security issues and sales of assets defined as non-strategic.
Citicorp said that since the beginning of 1991 - when Mr John Reed, the
chairman, first announced a plan for strengthening the company's capital
position and restoring profitability by the end of 1992 - it had raised the
equivalent of about Dollars 2.8bn in Tier 1 capital.
The total amount of capital at the end of March 1992 was Dollars 9.1bn.
Citicorp's target is capital of Dollars 12bn to Dollars 13bn.
Yesterday's disposal of certain assets in Citicorp's credit card processing
business does not mark a withdrawal from the sector. Citicorp emphasised it
would continue to focus on providing credit card services to consumers, who
presently hold 41m Citicorp-issued cards.
The business affected by the sale, which is known as Citicorp Establishment
Services, processes an annual sales volume of about Dollars 30bn in the US
and provides authorisation, processing and settlement to merchants who
accept credit cards.
The buyers of the assets are Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe, Prudential
Equity Investors and William Blair &amp; co.

ORENSTEIN &amp; Koppel (O&amp;K), the big German construction equipment and
escalator producer, is to reduce its workforce by 780, or 9.5 per cent, and
streamline its management as part of a reorganisation plan unveiled in
Dortmund yesterday.
The shake-up will reduce O&amp;K's workforce to 7,400, and comes on top of about
1,000 job cuts last year. It follows the approval by shareholders in Hoesch,
the German steel group which owns 75 per cent of O&amp;K, of the long-awaited
takeover by Fried. Krupp.
The reorganisation includes the sale of O&amp;K's plant and systems division to
Hoesch. The division will be combined with its counterpart at Krupp
Industrietechnik.
O&amp;K said yesterday that the reorganisation and new corporate strategy was
aimed at ensuring 'the long-term and permanent strengthening and
stabilisation of the company.'

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Healthy market for
pharmaceuticals - The growing accessibility of Japan's drugs sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of sitting in the back seat, the world's leading pharmaceutical
companies operating in Japan have started to gain presence in what used to
be one of the most introverted sectors in the country.
Until recently, Japanese drug companies had the market virtually to
themselves, with imports accounting for less than 10 per cent of total
sales. However, recent falls in asset values, along with industry
restructuring, have created chances for international drug companies to
expand their Japanese operations.
The country's drugs market, the second-largest in the world after the US
with annual sales of Y6,000bn (Dollars 47bn), holds substantial potential
for further growth as the population ages rapidly and Japanese consumers
become increasingly health-conscious.
Mr Thomas Hofstaetter, executive managing director at Hoechst Japan, says:
'For a pharmaceutical company to be truly global, it must maintain presence
in US, Europe and Japan.' However, until recently, most foreign companies,
lacking distribution networks, were forced to rely on tie-ups with Japanese
companies.
Although acquisitions by leading foreign companies date back as far as 1983,
when Merck of the US purchased 55 per cent of Banyu Pharmaceutical, a
medium-sized listed company, such cases were rare. The recent fall in the
stock and real estate markets have triggered activity among foreign drugs
companies.
Earlier this year, Pfizer, the US drugs and chemicals group, announced plans
to buy Koshin Medical, a privately-owned medical equipment distributor, for
an estimated Y3bn. Last year, Monsanto of the US acquired 12 per cent of
Hokuriku Pharmaceuticals for Y14.5bn, and Roussel Medica merged with
Morishita Pharmaceuticals.
Other leading European drug groups have also shown interest in purchasing
Japanese companies. Bankers point out that some smaller Japanese drug makers
and wholesalers are welcoming foreign drug companies which have comparative
advantages over their Japanese counterparts.
The price cuts by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, implemented every two
years from 1981 and averaging from 10 to 15 per cent, have squeezed profits
at drug manufacturers. The small and medium-sized companies, which lack new
innovative drugs, face increasing difficulties.
Japanese drug wholesalers have also been forced to change their business
strategies because of to the price cuts. In the past, the manufacturer and
wholesaler had special keiretsu - corporate grouping - type relationships.
However, the price cuts are continually depressing profit margins, and
wholesalers now need to distribute a wide range of products, rather than
those of just one manufacturer.
Last April, Japan's Fair Trade Commission banned manufacturers and
distributors from manipulating drug prices, and that has also broken their
cozy relationship. Mr Kenji Wakamatsu, at Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, says:
'Since wholesalers have more freedom it's much easier for foreign companies
to establish ties.'
Foreign companies that entered the Japanese market early have started to set
up their own sales and marketing operations. Sandoz, which entered the
market in the 1960s through a distribution tie-up with Sankyo, the
second-largest Japanese drugs maker, set up its own distribution network in
1990. Bayer also ended its sales tie-up with Takeda, the industry leader, in
1990.
Mr Hofstaetter at Hoechst says the key to success is to have a number of
strong products.
Bayer's Adalaat, a calcium antagonist, posted sales of over Y50bn last year,
becoming the second best-selling drug in Japan. Nippon Roche's Furtulon, an
anti-cancer agent, is also seeing brisk sales. Mr John Wilson,
pharmaceutical analyst at James Capel in Tokyo, says: 'Japan is a profitable
market for foreign companies, since they already have effective drugs and do
not need to spend a fortune on research and development.'
Many foreign companies are in final stages of setting up full operations
with production, sales, and research and development. Bayer is investing
Y20bn in its new research centre, while Sandoz expanded its production plant
north of Tokyo and expects its new Y15bn research laboratory to be completed
next year.
In contrast to foreign car and electronics makers, foreign drug companies,
which hold about 20 per cent of the market, say they are treated equally
with the Japanese.
One problem which remains is clinical testing for new drugs, where foreign
companies must present data from clinical trials in Japan. However, the
Ministry of Health and Welfare is loosening its grip as more Japanese
companies venture abroad, and with some drugs, overseas data from
pre-clinical tests are accepted.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: South Africa to change control
of airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA is to take its airports and air traffic services out of direct
government control and into two new companies.
Mr Piet Welgemoed, South African transport minister, will today announce the
approval of proposals for the commercialisation of nine airports and air
traffic and navigation services, said Price Waterhouse, the London
accountancy firm which helped draw up the proposals.
The South African government will remain the sole shareholder in the
companies but both will be run on a commercial basis and the government
should be able to phase out subsidies.
The biggest of the airports, Jan Smuts at Johannesburg, handles 12m
passengers a year, comparable with Geneva airport. Eight others will be
affected, including Cape Town and Durban airports.
South Africa is increasingly popular for air traffic: over the past year, 25
more airlines have applied for access rights.
Legislation will have to be passed before the plan can proceed and this is
expected by next spring. The government will set up a regulation committee
for the two companies, but it will not be able to intervene in everyday
affairs.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y likely to announce
write-downs of Dollars 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments, the Canadian-based parent of the O&amp;Y group, is
preparing to announce at least USDollars 2bn of write-downs on its global
property holdings, according to a US executive familiar with the company's
financial position.
The disclosure, which would help to illustrate the weakened financial
position of O&amp;Y, will be contained in a filing to be made shortly with a
Toronto bankruptcy court. Along with the write-down will be O&amp;Y's disclosure
of its total group assets on a consolidated basis.
The write-downs, which are likely to include the Canary Wharf project in
London, could be as high as Dollars 2.5bn or even more, the US executive
warned. He added that O&amp;Y and its financial advisers were still working on
the numbers last night.
The write-down disclosure, expected before the end of this week, will refer
to O&amp;Y's position at the end of its fiscal year to January 31 1992.
It is part of the most comprehensive financial portrait to date to be
provided by the Reichmann family's troubled group.
In a related development, a set of preliminary results for O&amp;Y's US
subsidiary in the fiscal year ended last January showed a loss of Dollars
184.3m, up from a net loss of Dollars 147.1m the previous year.
The US figures, which might still be revised, were contained in a draft
financial statement supplied recently by O&amp;Y to the two Canadian creditor
committees, according to a source with knowledge of the draft report.
The US financial statement showed a negative cash-flow of Dollars 42.3m for
the year ended January 31 1990. For the year ended January 31 1992, the cash
flow was a positive Dollars 23.3m.
The expected O&amp;Y property write-downs, while not likely to affect the
group's debt restructuring talks in Canada, the US or Britain, show the
degree to which the Reichmann empire has been hurt by the slump in
commercial property values.
In April, O&amp;Y said its net equity - assets minus liabilities - amounted to
CDollars 5.5bn (USDollars 4.6bn) on what it termed a fair market basis. This
figure, however, would have little meaning if the group were forced to
liquidate rapidly substantial portions of its property holdings.
O&amp;Y filed for protection from creditors under Canadian bankruptcy law in
mid-May. On May 27, O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf project in London was placed under
the control of UK administrators.
The Reichmanns have been seeking to avert the need for a filing under US
bankruptcy law by putting several US properties on the auction block.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG, the UK securities group, is pulling out of making markets in
London in Japanese equity warrants, a business which has suffered badly in
the wake of the slump in the Tokyo stock market.
The move is the latest step in a steady trimming of costs in Warburg's
Japanese equity operations, including a reduction in the number of staff
employed by 31 to 111 over the past year.
Like other brokers, Warburg has been hit by the sharp decline in prices and
volume in the stock market which began in early 1990.
In the changes announced yesterday, four people in London have lost their
jobs and two others are being transferred to other work.
Two remaining traders will continue to trade in London but they will not
make markets. Warburg will continue to trade warrants in the Tokyo markets.
Christopher Purvis, branch manager of Warburg's Tokyo office, said Warburg
has been 'refocussing' its Japanese operations. It had pulled out of making
markets in warrants in London because the decline in turnover had made the
market illiquid.
Warburg is the third company to have pulled out of market making in warrants
in London.
The other companies were Kleinwort Benson of the UK, and Merrill Lynch, the
US broking group.
About 12 market makers are left, including the Big Four Japanese
stockbroking groups and several British and American companies.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Banesto to sell cement group for
Pta60bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORACION BANESTO, the Spanish industrial holding group, is to sell
Sanson, Spain's second-biggest cement group, for Pta60bn (Dollars 623m).
The Spanish group said that it would make a consolidated profit of Pta8bn on
the disposal, the third major industrial sell-off in the past 18 months.
Sanson was Corporacion Banesto's most profitable company last year.
Sanson is being sold to Apax, a Liechtenstein affiliate of Unifund, a
Geneva-based financial holding company. Unifund, whose owners are Egyptian,
controls Siam Cement, Thailand's biggest cement manufacturer, Cementos Lima
of Peru and has banking interests in Mexico.
A senior Corporacion Banesto official said last night that Unifund had first
expressed an interest in investing in the conglomerate a year ago and had
signed a letter of credit for an option to buy Sanson last weekend. Unifund
is being advised by JP Morgan of the US.
The surprise decision to sell Sanson comes two months after Banco Banesto
launched a Pta12.1bn public share offering for the 40 per cent of Sanson
that it did not already own. Mr Arturo Romani, chief executive of
Corporacion Banesto, said at the time that the conglomerate intended to
strengthen its position in the cement industry.
Corporacion Banesto said that the agreement with Unifund has been conducted
'with enormous speed'.
The conglomerate offered Pta10,000 per share to the minority equity holders
compared with the Pta20,012 per share which Unifund paid for the group.
The cement company's earnings fell 36 per cent to Pta1.1bn in the first
quarter of this year. However, this was double the amount returned by
Acerinox, Corporacion Banesto's next largest earner.
Last year, Corporacion Banesto's net consolidated profits fell by 48 per
cent to Pta12.6bn. In the first three months of this year, the
conglomerate's top five companies lost Pta5.9bn, against 1991 first-quarter
profits of Pta1.6bn.

FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Playing politics with a
country's top jobs - The last phase of the French cabinet's review of the
corporate elite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, contemplated the latest
three-yearly review of the top jobs at France's state-controlled companies,
he made clear that he did not envisage any dramatic changes.
His reasons were clear. The general election is only a year away. Many of
France's nationalised companies are struggling to adjust to intense
international competition. The last thing the French premier wanted was to
add to that instability with by stiring controversy over government's role
in industry.
Yesterday, Mr Beregovoy's cabinet completed the third and final phase of the
review, which encompassed the top jobs at 45 of France's state-controlled
companies, including the two biggest banks, three large insurers, the gas
and electricity groups, and a string of key industrial concerns ranging from
Air France to Thomson electronics.
Mr Beregovoy achieved the stability. The only changes in the financial
sector concerned smaller banks, such as Compagnie Financiere du CIC and
Societe Marseillaise de Credit. Most of the chairmen to lose their jobs in
the industrial sector, apart from Mr Francis Lorentz of Bull, did so because
they were about to pass the mandatory retirement age of 65.
But Mr Beregovoy has been less successful at averting controversy. The
background story of this summer's three-yearly review is a neat illustration
of the pervading influence of politics over corporate life in France.
Initially, it had looked as though there would be changes at the top of at
least one big bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, where the chairman, Mr Rene
Thomas, 63, is due for retirement, and at an insurer, probably Groupe GAN,
to create a job for Mr Daniel Lebeque, number two at BNP.
At one stage, it even seemed feasible that Credit Lyonnais, the other big
bank, would also lose its chairman, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, because of the
controversy over his aggressive strategy.
In the end, Mr Thomas stayed at BNP. His job is said to have been offered to
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the French Treasury, who turned it down
reportedly for fear of upsetting Mr Lebegue, his predecessor at the
Treasury. Mr Thomas, a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand, was
prevailed upon to postpone his retirement. This meant that all three
insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), Assurances Generales de
France (AGF) and GAN - kept their chairmen as there was no need to make way
for Mr Lebegue.
Meanwhile, Mr Haberer remained at Credit Lyonnais despite the fact that one
director abstained from the board's vote on his renomination. Mr Haberer had
seemed vulnerable until March when his good friend, Mr Beregovoy, became
prime minister.
The changes in industry show the same pattern of political patronage. Mr
Lorentz lost his job at Bull mainly because, like Mr Haberer, he had pursued
a highly controversial strategy, but unlike the Credit Lyonnais chairman, he
had no powerful friends to protect him.
Mr Lorentz's dismissal prompted Le Point, the news magazine, last week to
run a feature entitled 'Les Presidents du President', arguing that Mr
Mitterrand's intervention was making a nonsense of Mr Beregovoy's attempts
to depoliticise the review.
Another controversy erupted this week when Mr Gilles Menage was named as the
new chairman of Electricite de France (EDF), replacing the retiring Mr
Pierre Delaporte. Mr Menage, 49, is the head of President Mitterrand's
private office. The EDF trade unions immediately protested against his
appointment.
Despite the rows over Mr Lorentz and Mr Menage, the concept of political
control over industry is so well-entrenched in French society  - where the
state sector represents 12 per cent of the economy according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  - that there is no
groundswell of demand for radical reform. However, there are signs of
pressure for moderate changes within the system.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, recently suggested that the three-year
tenure should be extended to five to give more continuity to the public
sector. The pressure for change is likely to intensify as the government
proceeds with its privatisation programme and is certain to accelerate if
the right returns to power next year and accelerates privatisation.
Even some of the state chairmen favour changes. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who has
just been renominated for the top job at UAP, recently said he believed
nominations should be left to the board, not to the government. However, he
did add, with the self-confidence typical of France's corporate elite, that
'the same people would probably end up in charge anyway'.

Total dividend for the year to May 31 is maintained at the forecast 3.5675p
with a final of 2.5675p, payable from earnings of 3.53p (3.57p) per share.

Teredo Petroleum has changed its focus to concentrate on enhancing revenues
from producing areas and in line with this is altering its fixed assets
accounting policy.
The USM-quoted oil and gas producer saw pre-tax profits decline by 43 per
cent to Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 160,000 restated) in the half year to March
31, after exceptional costs of Pounds 65,000 connected to its reorganisation
under which exploration activity has been curtailed and staffing levels
reduced.
Sales in the six months declined to Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 3.1m). Provisions
for exploration costs fell to Pounds 414,000 (Pounds 486,000) and interest
payments and exchange losses took Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 73,000).
Earnings fell to 0.3p (0.5p).

Profits of MS International, the Doncaster-based engineer, rose from Pounds
59,000 to Pounds 251,000 pre-tax over the 53 weeks to May 2. An Pounds 8m
fall in turnover to Pounds 30.5m mainly reflected discontinued activities.
Profits were struck after taking account of a drop in interest charges to

relating to a factory closure.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.77m (income Pounds 1.89m) were principally
final settlement terms of the dispute relating to the sale of two Laurence

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HENLYS GROUP has changed its stockbroker, two days after becoming the
subject of a Pounds 27.1m hostile takeover bid from rival motor dealer T
Cowie.
Mr Robert Wood, Henlys' chief executive, said he had switched from Hoare
Govett because 35 redundancies at the broker, following its recent takeover
by ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, had left it 'short on
overall resources.'
Henlys has gone to Panmure Gordon, which took on five corporate finance
staff from Hoare Govett, including the three most familiar with Henlys.
Mr Wood said he wanted to work with people he knew and who were familiar
with the company in what was likely to be a tough takeover battle.
Henlys had two banks as advisers, Charterhouse and Hill Samuel, and had
decided that Charterhouse would conduct its defence.
T Cowie has agreed to buy Walker Jackson, the main Ford dealer in Swindon,
for an undisclosed sum.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Management at MF Industrial may be set to
launch buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MANAGEMENT buy-out is believed to be imminent at MF Industrial, the
Manchester-based construction equipment producer owned by Varity, the
US-based manufacturer of farm and industrial machinery, vehicle components
and diesel engines.
MF, part of Varity's Massey Ferguson farm and industrial machinery group,
said last night that it was unable to comment on a newspaper report
yesterday that Varity is to dispose of the company.
No comment was available from Varity, which has indicated that it may be
interested in selling some non-core businesses.
It is believed, however, that a management buy-out of MF supported by City
institutions and banks is under discussion and close to being announced. MF
would confirm only that it had told the MSF staff union that it had been
looking for joint ventures or partners for three years.
MF is a relatively small but separate part of Massey Ferguson, one of the
world's leading producers of agricultural tractors.
The unit was created from the merger in 1983 of Massey's industrial and
construction equipment products, and has its one production facility in
Manchester.
Sales of MF grew from Dollars 53m in 1984 to an annual level of nearly
Dollars 140m at the end of the 1980s. Since then, it has been caught up in
the worldwide construction equipment recession.
Production of backhoe loaders, its main product, has fallen from 3,200 in
1988 - a boom year for the construction equipment industry - to 2,900 in
1989, 2,000 in 1990 and 1,600 in 1991.
In the UK market, MF has consistently managed just under 10 per cent of a
backhoe loader market dominated by JCB of the UK and US-owned JI Case. Last
year, MF sold 220 backhoe loaders in the UK out of a total market of 2,800.
MF also has exclusive European rights to sell Korean-built ScatLoader
skid-steer loaders.
Massey Ferguson recently announced an agreement to relocate its 'master'
parts warehouse from Urmston, near the MF plant at Stretford, to Desford,
Leicestershire, where the warehousing will be handled by Caterpillar
Logistics Services.
This will lead to the closure of the Urmston warehouse with the loss of
about 300 jobs.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Streamlined Granada rises 49%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group, yesterday
produced evidence of a recovery in its fortunes when it announced a 49 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 57.2m for the 28 weeks to April
11.
The performance was marginally ahead of the result for the last full year to
September 28 1991 when Granada's profits slumped from Pounds 120m to Pounds
57m.
Turnover was Pounds 674.5m (Pounds 721m including discontinued businesses).
Granada's share price rose 13p to close at 257p.
Mr Gerry Robinson, who was appointed chief last year, said the company had
made real progress in simplifying its structure and in improving efficiency.
'We have much to do but I think we have made an encouraging start,' he said.
Mr Robinson aroused controversy when, earlier this year, he required the
resignation of Mr David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television.
The company said that a 12 per cent increase in the underlying level of
operating profit had been achieved by:
a turnround in Granada Computer Services from a Pounds 3.6m loss to a Pounds
4.3m profit;
higher profits from Granada Television - up from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds
18.8m;
the disposal of the lossmaking Canadian rental businesses.
The pre-tax result was also helped by a 44 per cent fall in interest charges
to Pounds 19.3m following last summer's rights issue.
Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman, said there were few signs of economic recovery.
'Against this background it is encouraging that our actions over the past
year have started to generate positive results,' he said.
The rental and retail businesses have been boosted by satellite television
and Granada Leisure had been streamlined. Apart from businesses which had
been sold Granada had about 2,000 fewer employees than a year before and now
had about 20,000 staff.
Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 8.2p fully diluted and the interim
dividend at 2.75p was up 10 per cent.
Analysts are predicting that Granada will make pre-tax profits of between
Pounds 112m and Pounds 117m for the full year.
Mr Robinson said he foresaw considerable growth for Granada's computer
maintenance business - which had been a lossmaker for the company. Granada
was one of the largest independent operators yet had only 0.5 per cent of a
world market worth Dollars 50bn (Pounds 27bn) a year. Acquisitions were
likely in computer services once the company was sure the structure of the
division was right.
Mr Robinson also said he believed that eventually there would only be five
or six ITV companies and that if the rules allowed it Granada would be
interested in taking over another large ITV company. At present large ITV
companies are forbidden from taking each other over.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Germany allows anti-viral drug to be sold
without prescription
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceuticals company involved in the world's largest
non-privatisation secondary share issue, has received permission from the
German regulatory authorities to sell Zovirax, its best-selling anti-viral
drug, without a prescription in chemists.
Germany is the largest pharmaceuticals market in Europe and the third
largest after the US and Japan. About 30 per cent of pharmaceuticals sales
there are without prescriptions. Zovirax's German patents run out next year,
allowing generic manufacturers to launch their own versions.
Wellcome already sells Zovirax, which is mostly used to treat herpes, over
the counter in New Zealand and has applications to do so in most other
European countries.
'We are delighted that Germany has been the first country in Europe to
license the product OTC,' said Mr Doug Clark, product manager in consumer
healthcare.
'The German authorities are stringent but appear to have passed the drug at
first reading. This augurs well for other markets.'
SG Warburg, the company's brokers, said in a recent research note on the
group that if 20 per cent of herpes sufferers in Australasia and Europe used
the drug once a year it would add Pounds 50m to Wellcome's annual sales.
This estimate was based on a price of about Pounds 4.37 for each 2g tube.
Wellcome plans to sell the product in Germany for about Pounds 10 a tube.
The company has a co-marketing agreement in Germany with Hoechst for Zovirax
prescription sales, but Mr Clark said he did not know whether that would be
extended to OTC.
Wellcome has no OTC presence in Germany at present. Mr John Robb, chief
executive, has said the group is in the final stages of negotiations with
two or three European groups to exploit OTC products more effectively.

FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Lord Sainsbury comes under attack on Sunday
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD SAINSBURY bade farewell to J Sainsbury's shareholders at the grocery
chain's annual meeting yesterday after 23 years as chairman.
However, in spite of his glowing remarks about the company's past
achievements and encouraging comments about its current trading prospects,
his swan-song was marred by shareholders objecting to the company's stance
on Sunday trading.
Some said Sainsbury's lacked integrity by flouting the law and disturbed the
peace of those who lived near its stores by opening seven days a week.
'We do have a serious violence problem in this country, and it's not right
that big organisations should be seen to break the law in this way when
small people are penalised,' one shareholder said.
Lord Sainsbury replied that the company did take the matter very seriously
but observed that polls indicated that two thirds of its shoppers wanted its
stores to stay open on Sundays. He also pointed out that, according to Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, no one trading on Sundays was breaking
the law because the House of Lords had decided the law was not clear.
But even if some shareholders remained dubious about the company's stance on
Sunday trading, they could hardly quibble with the company's results under
Lord Sainsbury's stewardship.
When Lord Sainsbury became chairman in 1969 - then as Mr John Sainsbury -
pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 4.3m (or Pounds 33m in 1992 prices). Last
year, the UK's biggest retailer made pre-tax profits of Pounds 628m.
Commenting on current trading, Lord Sainsbury said the year had started well
with food price inflation being 'lower than we expected and sales volumes
slightly higher'.
Stores opened this year were trading well and 22 were likely to be completed
by the year-end, he said.
Lord Sainsbury will hand over the chairmanship to his cousin, David, in
November.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Eurobond firms fear impact of EC securities directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN regulations for the securities industry agreed this week could lead
to large areas of the off-shore Eurobond market being driven back on to
domestic stock markets, according to senior bankers.
On Monday, European governments reached agreement on a draft Investment
Services Directive, which lays down rules for the conduct of securities
business in the European Community.
The agreement gives governments the right to demand that securities
transactions undertaken by retail investors - private individuals rather
than institutions - are conducted on regulated markets.
The Eurobond market does not qualify as a regulated market because it does
not meet the strict disclosure and reporting requirements laid down in other
sections of the directive.
Bankers had expected Eurobonds to be specifically exempted from the
provisions of the directive. However, monetary officials familiar with the
agreement confirmed yesterday that no blanket exemption for Eurobonds has
been granted.
Firms fear that some European governments could now use the directive to
increase the volume of business traded through domestic stock exchanges, by
demanding that all retail bond business is conducted on a regulated market.
'We were given specific assurances by the regulators on this issue. I am
astonished and concerned that the exemption is not in place,' said Mr Dirk
Hazell, Secretary General of the International Primary Market Association,
which represents leading Eurobond underwriters. In the first six months of
this year companies and governments raised Dollars 148bn (Pounds 80bn) in
the Eurobond market. Although institutional investors take the majority of
big Eurobond issues, retail investors remain a significant and lucrative
area of the market. Yesterday, IBM raised Dollars 300m from an issue
targeted at retail investors.
Other areas of European legislation exempt Eurobonds from securities
regulations. For example, the Public Offers Directive says borrowers in the
Eurobond markets need not publish a full prospectus before a new issue.
Eurobond underwriters are already concerned that capital adequacy rules for
the securities industry agreed two weeks ago will increase their costs.

FT  02 JUL 92 / GEC increases profits by 1% to Pounds 829m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANCELLATION of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) could have serious
consequences for the General Electric Company's radar factories in
Edinburgh, Lord Weinstock, managing director, warned yesterday after
announcing a 1 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 829m last
year.
He said the company had not calculated how many jobs would be at risk, but
GEC is planning to develop the EFA's radar on the basis that Germany may
pull out of the project's production phase.
Lord Weinstock was confident that Britain's other EFA partners - Italy and
Spain - would develop a fighter regardless of the German decision.
He said GEC's results vindicated its strategy of expansion in Europe through
joint ventures with Alsthom of France (power engineering) and Siemens of
Germany (telecommunications). GEC also has a joint venture with General
Electric of the US in consumer appliances.
Profits from continental Europe rose 32 per cent to Pounds 199m, offsetting
a fall in UK profits from Pounds 428m to Pounds 393m.
Operating profit rose 2 per cent to Pounds 702m for the year to March 31, on
a Pounds 27m fall in turnover to Pounds 9.44bn, largely due to a strong
performance from GEC-Alsthom. Improved profits from GEC's 50 per cent share
in that venture helped profits in the power systems division rise 27 per
cent to Pounds 157m.
Operating profit at GPT, the telecommunications joint venture with Siemens,
rose Pounds 2m to Pounds 127m on a 10 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds
1.1bn. Better financial discipline at GPT also helped GEC's cash reserves
rise sharply, from Pounds 528m to Pounds 876m. GEC has net cash of about
Pounds 1.46bn.
The consumer goods joint venture with GE raised operating profits by Pounds
3m to Pounds 21m. Turnover fell Pounds 3m to Pounds 268m. Profits at
electronic systems, which mainly comprises Marconi, the defence electronics
subsidiary, fell Pounds 9m to Pounds 260m. The Picker medical equipment
business improved profits by Pounds 6m to Pounds 32m, but profits at the
office equipment and printing division fell by Pounds 9m to Pounds 17m.
The board is recommending a 5.2 per cent increase in the final dividend to
7.05p for a total of 9.6p (up from 9.25p). Earnings per share were unchanged
at 18.6p.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Major admits Britain may miss Maastricht target date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN launched its six-month presidency of the European Community
yesterday with a show of unity and co-operation between Mr John Major and Mr
Jacques Delors, the European Commission president.
But a reminder of the political obstacles facing the Community emerged when
Mr Major conceded for the first time that the UK may not complete
ratification of the Maastricht treaty by the target date of the new year.
At a joint Westminster news conference with Mr Delors, Mr Major pledged that
Britain was determined to press ahead with the process after taking stock of
the situation in the autumn. Then he added: 'It would be desirable to finish
it by the end of the year, but it is not essential.'
Mr Major's tacit admission of the risks posed by domestic political
opposition came after a plenary meeting between the UK cabinet and the 17 EC
Commissioners in London.
It was followed by a series of bilateral meetings, including a private
session between Mr Major and Mr Delors, focusing on the central problem of
Denmark's rejection of the treaty.
Underlining the spirit of conciliation, both Mr Major and Mr Delors
confirmed their agreement that Denmark would succeed Britain, as scheduled,
in the presidency in January, brushing aside suggestions that it was no
longer eligible.
Mr Delors, who refused to rise to the recent criticism from his old
opponent, Lady Thatcher, said the Commission and the UK presidency were 'on
the same side, with the same purpose to make progress and succeed'.
At last weekend's Lisbon summit, the UK had tried unsuccessfully to avoid
the ratification of Maastricht being made a formal precondition for the
opening of enlargement talks with European Free Trade Association (Efta)
countries. The compromise was that 'preparatory' talks could be held before
ratification, but that 'official negotiations' could only begin afterwards.
Yesterday, Mr Delors said there would be little difference in practice
between 'preparatory' and 'official' talks with the Efta countries. He added
that the Commission would soon deliver its formal opinions on the EC
candidacy of Sweden, Finland and Switzerland, having already given a
positive verdict on Austrian membership.
Both Mr Major and Mr Delors emphasised the need for subsidiarity, or taking
decisions in the EC at the lowest appropriate level. Mr Major said it should
be 'enshrined as a natural part of the Community's instincts rather than as
something to be wheeled out from time to time when it is convenient'.
He conceded the potential conflict between the Community's two goals of
forging a single, barrier-free market without national distortions and of
giving national governments more say in the implementation of EC laws.
Each issue, Mr Major said, would have to be examined to see 'whether the
balance of advantage lay wholly with an unreconstructed single market or
whether subsidiarity would have to take precedence'.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Widespread spending cuts in German draft budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR THEO WAIGEL, the German finance minister, yesterday won cabinet approval
for an austerity draft budget for 1993, imposing widespread spending cuts to
finance the continuing heavy transfer of subsidies to eastern Germany.
He presented the deal as 'a political signal' for next week's Group of Seven
economic summit in Munich.
Mr Waigel said it complied point-for-point with Germany's commitment made
last January to reduce its budget deficit.
The budget was put to cabinet two weeks early in an effort to show Germany's
good faith to the G7. Germany was strongly criticised at the last G7 meeting
in Washington for its disturbingly high public sector deficit.
In the budget, overall spending is kept to a strict 2.5 per cent nominal
growth rate, well below current inflation, and the government's net
borrowing requirement will be cut by DM2.5bn (Pounds 850m) to DM38bn next
year.
By 1996, the plan is to reduce government borrowing to 'well under DM25bn',
he said.
The draft budget proposes its biggest savings in defence spending - down by
2.5 per cent from DM52.1bn to DM50.8bn.
That budget also does not include an item of DM110m for the pre-production
phase of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), following the political
decision not to go ahead with the fighter as currently planned, but to
design a cheaper derivative.
Net savings are also planned in the economics ministry budget, which
includes regional subsidies and trade promotion, down by 4.8 per cent, and
in environment spending, down by 3.5 per cent to DM1.29bn.
On the other hand the heavy spending drain remains overwhelmingly in eastern
Germany, with an 8.8 per cent increase in the employment ministry budget -
paying for unemployment benefit, retraining and job creation measures.
Overall, the Waigel budget would see spending next year rise from DM425.1bn
to DM435.65bn, or 2.5 per cent.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Letter: Thinking on Ross Perot hard to understand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is surely of some interest that so many Americans seem to be
rejecting all the established parties in favour of a 'maverick' and surely
also reasonable to expect some enlightenment from the serious press. So I
began reading your article on Ross Perot with some interest ('Trial by
rabbit punch', June 27).
I ended it wondering, not for the first time, why the liberal mind is so
much harder to understand than ordinary Americans. Mr Perot is sneered at
for 'frequently underwriting the missions of unsavoury soldiers of fortune
to find Americans in Indochina'. What can possibly be objectionable if a
private citizen finances attempts to discover some of his fellow citizens,
despatched to a far country on military service, and apparently (according
to your correspondent himself) abandoned there by the American government?
What is 'unsavoury' about the people who do the dangerous work?
I ask the questions seriously; the mind that counts this activity as
something of which Mr Perot can be 'accused' is beyond ordinary sense.
Later, Mr Perot is reported to have 'admitted delving into' a Republican
plot about Iran in 1980 'to see if Mr Bush was personally involved'. Why
does this count as an admission? If your correspondent had been delving and
had found anything, it would be a scoop, but if it's Perot, something has
been 'admitted'.
Mr Perot is evidently a shock to the East Coast liberal establishment.
Whether it can dispose of him as it did of President Nixon remains to be
seen; as does whether Mr Perot is genuinely shocking or only a man of common
sense. Either way, it is that liberal consensus that is really impenetrable.

<TEXT>
Sir, May I add to Mr Hartley's letter (June 29). There are spectators who
hope, perhaps vainly, that tennis play will develop beyond the power service
into a more interesting volley game in which players will demonstrate their
wider skills. Those who do not, presumably enjoy the spectacle of a
gladiatorial contest in its own right.
My suggestion to compensate for the high-tech racket's impact on the service
is to deny the second chance to serve. Aspirants to world-class
championships should be prepared to get their service right first time. In
fact, such a rule should be effective in opening up the game. Meanwhile, I
suspect that the pressures of the market will prevail. Demand for seats at
Wimbledon, for example, exceeds supply. Until spectators vote with their
feet, I doubt that the authorities will introduce the change.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Letter: Charities should provide input in assessing top pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why does the Top Salaries Review Body concentrate so much of its
comparison research on directors' pay in private industry ('Political row
may erupt over top people's pay', June 22)?
There are other sectors of the economy where valid comparisons can be made
with chief executives in local government and major charities.
Our annual survey of the latter, based on 67 voluntary organisations, shows
charity directors earning Pounds 36,500 in 1991 compared with chief
executives in all sizes of private-sector companies on Pounds 45,000. In
addition, only 55 per cent of the charities, compared with 84 per cent of
companies, offered their chief executives a car.
The relationship between a charity director and his trustees is in many ways
similar to that of a permanent secretary and his minister and although the
scale is different - even the Red Cross and the National Trust being dwarfed
by the smaller ministries - input from some charities would seem relevant to
the Top Salaries Review Body's work.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Letter: Benefit of well-constituted remuneration committees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN ST JOHNSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We warmly welcome the contribution made by Prof Main of Edinburgh
University to the debate on how to improve the quality of boardroom practice
('Committee boost to top pay seen', June 29).
However, it is important to put into context some of his remarks about the
efficacy of remuneration committees if companies are to derive the real
benefits which such committees can achieve.
First, these are early days for remuneration committees. It is easy to
forget how recently and how quickly the interest on matters of corporate
governance has developed.
Prof Main's research, to which we contributed, was largely conducted before
Pro Ned had issued its Guidelines on Remuneration Committees and when media
attention on the issue had yet to gather steam.
At the time, our guidelines, which were sent to more than 2,000 chairmen and
chief executives, were welcomed because committees were unsure about what
they ought to be doing. Interest has been so great that we have since been
asked for a further 3,000 copies.
Second, we firmly believe in soundly constituted remuneration committees and
the issue now is how to help companies find the best ways to make these
committees work. The key here is who sits on the committee and how they are
appointed.
The system will only work properly under the following conditions:
where there is a separate chairman;
where non-executive directors are appointed by a nomination committee and
are of sufficient calibre to be independent;
where shareholders make their views on remuneration known and the chairman
of the committee has to answer them at the annual general meeting.
It is important to encourage remuneration committees and then to set about
improving their operation.
That is what Pro Ned aims to do.

There's no question that the UK Treasury's chief economist Alan Budd is
right to call for outside advice on topics economic. But whether he's asking
the right people to give it, is another matter.
True, given the dismal science's strong rivalries, any list that didn't
include everybody was bound to put some noses out of joint. Even so, there
were some brow-furrowing omissions from the affable Budd's Great George
Street pow-wow.
One was David Stout, chief economist at Unilever and soon to begin a new
career in interpreting business strategy at London Business School. A second
absentee was Shell International Petroleum's formidable head of economics
DeAnne Julius. Still others were Julian Tapp of British Aerospace, Glaxo's
Robert Jones, and Jim Hirst of Esso.
That is, of course, not to imply any inability on the part of those who were
invited to give a good blow-by-blow account of the spiralling decay being
experienced by large chunks of British industry. They included, for
instance, Richard Freeman of ICI, RTZ's Phillip Crowson, Kate Barker of Ford
and GKN's Leslie Gunde.
Next time, however, Budd would do well to spread the net wider. In
particular, why not invite some of the livelier City economists who're
always complaining about lack of opportunities to swap data with Treasury
counterparts?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it a brave display of editorial independence, or injured pride which
prompted Time Magazine to publish a special Olympics supplement with its
international edition that includes a sharp attack on Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the controversial president of the International Olympic
Committee?
What makes the article on Samaranch special is that Time is one of the 12
chief sponsors of next month's Barcelona Olympics, who have each paid
millions of dollars for the privilege of associating their names with the
glory of the games.
It is unusual for a sponsor to attack the product it has paid bundles of
money to endorse. But then Time magazine and its sister publication, Sports
Illustrated, were singled out for criticism in the recently published book
on the IOC - The Lords of the Rings. Referring to their right to produce
earlier special Olympic souvenir issues, the book wondered whether the
publishing group had 'tied itself so closely to the Olympic movement that it
jeopardised its ability to produce critical journalism?'.
Interestingly, Time's sister publication and fellow Olympics sponsor, Sports
Illustrated, recently gave 'The Lords of the Rings' an unfriendly review,
describing it as 'naive'.
The review drew a rebuke from one of the co-authors, who snorted that it was
just another example of sports publications ignoring the truth about the
IOC.

Chris Haskins must surely be one of the lowest paid chairmen of a Footsie
company. Despite a 17 per cent pay rise last year, the cheery chairman of
Northern Foods was only paid Pounds 181,000.
Indeed, his entire seven-man board - which includes three non-executives -
earns less than Pounds 500,000, which is roughly the same amount as the
chief executive of Unigate, a company under half Northern's size, gets paid.
There's also quite a difference in the two companies' share prices over the
past year - Northern has outperformed Unigate two and a half times.
So perhaps Northern's seven shirt-sleeved directors, as pictured in the
annual report, should be allowed to celebrate with something a little
stronger than water and only five glasses.

Can it be that Toyota Motor is about to loosen up culturally by passing on
the presidency from 67-year-old Soichiro Toyoda to his younger brother
Tatsuro? After all, with Dollars 13bn in the bank, it could perhaps afford
to add a touch of cosmopolitan leavening to its almost paradigmatically
Japanese style of management.
Its achievement in emerging from turbulent times as the world's richest
automobile company owes much to the 10-year reign of the elder Toyoda, son
of the founder Kiichiro. But the buzz is that Soichiro now wants to devote
his considerable energies to the influential Federation of Industrial
Organisations, where he is vice-chairman.
Although his younger brother is also an engineer by training, the hand-over
would bring more international experience to Toyota's driving seat. Now 63,
Tatsuro has an MBA degree from New York University and has been looking
after the business outside Japan.
In the end, though, whether the change takes place depends not on the two
brothers, but on the company's 79-year-old chairman. Needless to say, he's
their uncle Eiji who made his name pioneering the super-efficient Toyota
production system in the 1950s.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Farewell to life in the fast lane: Recession and high
capital costs are curbing the expansion of Japan's car manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many years car manufacturers in the west have waited impatiently for the
aggressive international expansion of Japan's automobile industry to lose
its cutting edge. The time may finally be coming.
Japan's carmakers are deep in a recession which is likely to leave lasting
scars. Increasingly, industry leaders believe the downturn has brought to a
close an era of rapid expansion, and will mark the advent of a more mature
industry.
'The Japanese automobile industry is at a turning point,' says Mr Yutaka
Kume, chairman of Nissan Motor and, as chairman of the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association, the industry's leading spokesman. 'We have to
adopt new policies and strategies. We should not depend on numbers, on the
quantity of production for profitability.'
Mr Kume believes that Nissan and the other Japanese carmakers need to wean
themselves off ingrained habits, which mean that companies have narrowly
pursued sales and bigger market share, often at the expense of short-term
financial gain. With profits now falling sharply and prospects for growth
waning, the Japanese industry is being forced to pay more attention to
immediate financial returns.
The full impact of this change in outlook remains to be seen. But already
this year Nissan has pulled out of marginal markets in Australia and Peru by
closing assembly plants. Toyota Motor, Japan's biggest manufacturer with 41
per cent of the domestic market, is cutting costs by reducing optional extra
equipment on new cars. Industry executives say Toyota is planning to reduce
the number of models it offers, in particular in low-volume niche market
segments.
Toyota this year raised average prices in the US, in spite of the recession,
by Dollars 432 a vehicle. The price of its top-of-the-line Lexus, for
example, was lifted by 5 per cent, or Dollars 2,100 (Pounds 1,130).
Of course, the Japanese companies have not suddenly become uncompetitive.
Indeed, they are likely to continue making inroads in the luxury car market
at the expense of manufacturers such as Mercedes Benz and BMW of Germany.
Yet the overwhelming comparative advantage of the Japanese industry,
supported by the country's strong domestic market in the late 1980s, is
being pared back as a result of changes arising from the recession.
Competition between Japanese and foreign carmakers promises to be more
evenly matched.
The change has been sudden. The Japanese industry went on a spending spree
for new plant and equipment when worldwide sales accelerated in the late
1980s. In the three years to the end of fiscal 1990, Toyota's capital
spending doubled to an annual level of Y858.4bn (Pounds 3.6bn). Nissan's
spending tripled in the same period to Y318.6bn. But the bills for this
surge in investment are now falling due. Toyota, for example, saw a Y40bn
increase in depreciation charges in the six months to December, compared
with parent company operating profits of Y77bn.
At the same time, demand has contracted. Sales of passenger cars in the
domestic market last year fell by 6.5 per cent.
The downturn has left the industry with excess capacity, and a mismatch
between the models rolling off the line and what consumers want to buy.
Toyota's efforts to move its Corolla - a sturdy, value-for-money car - up
market by lifting the price and quality have fallen flat, contributing to a
loss of market share in the small car sector.
The adverse business environment, however, has affected the companies
differently.
Nissan Motor, number two in Japan, is struggling to stay in the black after
reporting a 71.8 per cent fall in operating profits to Y33.8bn in the year
to March. Under Mr Kume's leadership, Nissan shook off its stodgy image by
introducing a series of radically styled cars, beginning in 1987. But other
companies quickly copied Nissan's strategy and its market share remained
stuck at about 23 per cent. Its long-term goal of regaining its former 30
per cent of the market is now a distant dream.
In the past year, Nissan's debt (including bonds) has grown from Y3,100bn to
Y3,570bn and the ratio of debt to equity has increased from 128 per cent to
147 per cent. The company desperately needs cash, and has been forced to
sell long-held securities.
Toyota has also suffered from the downturn and forecast a 30 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits to Y400bn in the year to the end of June. But the company
is sitting on large cash reserves, totalling Y1,180bn at the end of
December, and has insignificant net debt.
Mr Soichiro Toyoda, the company's president, is confident about Toyota's
future, and dismisses suggestions that the industry is passing through more
than a cyclical trough. Many industry executives, however, echo the themes
articulated by Mr Kume, and say that Toyota too must learn to live with
lower growth, longer product cycles and less choice for customers.
Mazda Motor, with 8.3 per cent of the domestic market, boasts the most
eye-catching network of dealerships in Japan. It has just finished
rebuilding its sales network into five channels for different types of cars
and launched a series of stylish vehicles, such as its Sentia luxury sedan,
but its sales and market share are also in decline.
It has lost third place in the Japanese market to Mitsubishi Motor. Mazda's
operating profits fell by about 53 per cent in 1991, with margins of less
than 1 per cent. Poor sales have forced Mazda to cancel night shifts at its
most automated plant, which opened only in January.
Honda Motor, which now ranks fifth, has halted a slide in its market share
at about 7.6 per cent. Consolidated operating profits grew by 4.4 per cent
last year to Y153bn owing to strong US sales. But Honda too has had to
increase its borrowings and its debt-to-equity ratio has risen from 74 per
cent a year ago to 87 per cent at the end of March.
Only Mitsubishi Motors is expanding sales in Japan, and now claims an 8.4
per cent share of the domestic market. But its balance sheet is the weakest
of the big five, with twice as much debt as equity.
While the recession has brought difficulties to a head, the companies do
seem to be facing more than a cyclical downturn:
Growth prospects: Car markets in Japan, Europe and the US are mature and
offer little prospect for rapid growth. Japan's annual domestic vehicle
sales increased by 46 per cent between 1986 and 1990, providing a big
stimulus enjoyed almost exclusively by the Japanese industry. But that
market is now near saturation; Japan's population is declining and its roads
are full. Mr Kume expects the market to stabilise eventually at about 6m
vehicle sales annually, slightly higher than the 1990 figure of 5.98m.
Cost of capital: Many Japanese companies raised finance at a cost of less
than 1 per cent until the stock market crashed in 1990. Much of the debt
raised during that period is expiring, and now has to be refinanced at
interest rates closer to 6-7 per cent, placing a new burden on cash flow.
The environment: Tightening emissions standards around the globe, led by
stringent standards in California, have increased the costs of producing new
models and placed a greater strain on cash flow. Labour shortage: Japan has
a steadily worsening labour shortage resulting from its low birth rate. To
recruit production line workers and to keep them from leaving the company,
Japanese manufacturers are being forced to increase salaries, and to spend
billions of yen to improve work environments and housing. Toyota's wage bill
rose by Y20bn in the six months to December. At the same time it is cutting
working hours by about 100 hours a year per worker.
These factors make manufacturing in Japan more difficult and they are
forcing the companies to squeeze more profits out of existing facilities. In
part, this will happen by itself, provided that capital spending declines,
as the heavy burden of depreciation charges on profits begins to ease in the
years ahead.
Cutting costs is also high on the agenda. In the hectic race to satisfy
rising demand in the 1980s, manufacturing efficiencies were sometimes lost.
Mr Ryuichi Tsukamoto, executive vice-president of Honda Engineering, says
Honda's parts supply capacity is between 20 and 30 per cent greater than
necessary.
Mr Tsukamoto is leading a programme to increase the common use of parts
among different Honda models, instead of designing each part separately for
every model.
Flexibility and choice for consumers - hallmarks of the Japanese car
industry - may also be reduced. Honda is cutting by a third the hundreds of
different designs of sun visors it uses. Mr Kume says Nissan will look to
extend the current four-year model cycle on a case-by-case basis as an
additional cost-cutting measure.
Mr Toyoda is less optimistic about prospects for cost saving on the factory
floor. He says: 'We have been trying to use common parts for a long time,
but have not been able to do it very well.' This is because of the subtle
differences in parts required for various vehicle designs.
In the end, if the Japanese companies wish to raise profits, they may have
no option but to become less flexible, offer less choice to consumers, and
charge a higher price for their products. Should they follow this path, they
will begin to look a lot more like the companies they compete against in the
west. Indeed, as the automobile industry in Europe and the US continues to
slim down and adopt many of the management techniques originally perfected
in Japan, the Japanese companies will look increasingly less invincible.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Credibility test for Bonn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN GERMANY was reunited in October 1990, its friends and allies hoped that
Europe's pivotal nation would meet its new challenges and responsibilities
in a way which would maintain its credibility as a reliable partner of the
west. That credibility has now been sorely strained by the decision,
confirmed by the Bonn cabinet yesterday, not to go ahead with production of
the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) developed at a cost of Pounds 8bn with
Britain, Italy and Spain.
The Bonn government is under strong pressure to take high-profile action to
reduce its budget deficit. Additionally, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
administration has to show that it can successfully draw up post-unification
priorities. For Bonn's political leadership, these twin aims pose a great
test; beating a retreat from the EFA production hangar is, unfortunately,
the wrong way to accomplish them.
On financial, industrial and strategic grounds, the decision appears to be
misguided, for three reasons. The step may end up wasting more money than it
saves. It risks considerable disruption and uncertainty in a highly
important sector - the aerospace industry - which the German government has
done its best to restructure and make competitive under the aegis of
Daimler-Benz. Finally, the move fails to answer the question of how Germany
will secure its air defences over the medium term in a world which, despite
the ending of the Cold War, will not remain threat-free.
Cheaper aircraft
The German government has left open the possibility of negotiating with its
partners on a cheaper and lighter aircraft, still to be modelled on the EFA.
But there is only the slimmest of hopes that this can be accomplished on a
satisfactory basis. Rather than keeping other governments, air forces and
aerospace companies guessing, the Germans now have a duty to tell their EFA
partners exactly how they intend to acquire their next generation of combat
aircraft, and with which other countries - if any - they propose to
co-operate in fulfilling that need. A continuation of Bonn's present
ambiguity would provide the worst possible framework for industrial
planning. It would also buttress the suspicion, already raised by Bonn's
dilatoriness in areas like the Gatt talks, that indecisiveness has become an
endemic part of German policy-making.
Fresh collaboration
Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, has indicated that other countries
outside the EFA quartet might be invited to join in fresh collaboration. For
political reasons, Mr Kohl would have strong motives in extending an entry
card to France, which is pursuing development of its smaller Rafale fighter,
designed for ground attack and naval operations rather than air defence.
Certainly, if France, Germany and Britain had decided to co-operate on a
new-generation combat aircraft in 1985, rather than going their separate
paths, the industry would be in a better position to surmount the present
problems. A German attempt to reopen aeronautic fiancailles across the Rhine
might however have a highly debatable outcome. The French would have to
abandon the already-troubled Rafale project and start again on a new
aircraft - without any assurance that it would not end, like the EFA, in
tears.
In reacting to the EFA imbroglio, Germany's partners must consider a range
of difficult options. German withdrawal from the production phase need not
totally undermine the economics of the project. But it may damage the
aerospace industry's claim that the EFA is cheaper than any other comparable
performance alternative - including off-the-shelf aircraft from the US. A
thoroughgoing attack on costs, involving cheaper avionics and weapons
systems, as well as streamlining production and assembly work, will be
necessary in any event. Draconian cost cutting would indeed be needed to
regain German participation, as the German aerospace industry hopes, at a
later stage. The chances of tempting the Germans back into the EFA fold may
be extremely slight, but they should not be completely abandoned. If, on the
other hand, the nein turns out to be definite, Germany will have to realise
that ending this particular alliance will have political as well as
industrial consequences.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The UK's EC presidency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT CAN reasonably be expected of the UK presidency of the European
Community? One thing at least can be hoped for: that the UK should start
from sensible priorities. It should, this once, let internal developments
largely take their course, and concentrate instead on the EC's external
obligations.
This is not to deny that the internal agenda of the EC is a substantial one.
On it, for example, can be found completion of the single market, the
'Delors II' proposals for an increase of one third in EC revenues by 1997,
ratification of the Maastricht treaty and enlargement.
Among these items, the UK presidency should focus on completion of the
single market programme, which will probably contribute more to the welfare
of the ordinary European than everything else on the table.
If the UK is as committed as it claims to the ratification of the Maastricht
treaty, it will also have to accept an increased EC budget. The need for
budgetary discipline remains. But it would be foolish to allow everything to
be halted over whether the EC spends 1.37 per cent of its forecast gross
domestic product by 1997 rather than only 1.2 per cent.
Ratification of the Treaty on European Union is now in the hands of the
French voters. Only when the treaty has jumped this and the other national
hurdles, will it be possible to go back to the Danes. For the moment all the
EC can do is wait and hope.
The British government's proposed bait to the Danes is an elaboration of the
concept of 'subsidiarity'. This is to be convincing enough to change the
Danish vote, but not so convincing that it amounts to a renegotiation of the
treaty.
Intellectual jellyfish
This looks a hopeless quest, not merely procedurally. The relevant article
of the treaty states that: 'in areas which do not fall within its exclusive
competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the
principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the
proposed actions cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and
can, therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action be
better achieved by the Community.' How can backbone be inserted into this
intellectual jellyfish?
The UK would argue that interference in working hours is a violation of
subsidiarity. Others claim that it is the EC's crusade against state aids
which must be moderated. The meaning of subsidiarity depends, therefore, on
what people think can be 'better achieved' by the EC. The notion cannot
determine what the EC would, in fact, achieve better.
Further centralisation
Little less hopeless is the UK's zeal for an immediate start on enlargement.
It cannot be broached until it is clear what the new members are to join.
Nor can one ignore the difficulty - adumbrated by the Commission before the
Danish 'no' - that the EC, already unwieldy, would become unmanageable once
it has a host of additional members. Further centralisation of power would
probably be inevitable, at least if the EC is not to turn into the free
trade area that the UK's partners have rejected for a generation.
Once one has eliminated the impossible, one must concentrate on what is
left, however improbable. The EC represents a quarter of the world economy;
it is the world's biggest trading power and by far the most important
economic partner for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Here are
challenges that will not wait, challenges that will figure on the agenda of
the summit of the group of seven industrial countries in Munich next week.
Here also is where leadership is needed. Mr Major did not have much success
as chairman of the last G7 summit. Perhaps he can do better as president of
the EC. It is difficult to accept that infinitesimal differences over farm
policy should still block a deal with the US over the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations. It is depressing that the need to open
markets to the products of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union should
still be evaded. The world needs EC leadership now. If the UK cannot provide
such leadership, what good are its pretensions to a global vision?

<TEXT>
Corporate Culture and Performance By John P Kotter and James L Heskett Free
Press/Macmillan Dollars 24.95
Professor Charles Handy, who is probably Britain's foremost management
thinker, has made quite a splash with his argument that the purpose of a
company these days must be much more than merely to create shareholder
value. Instead he says that it must put the interests of customers and
employees at least as high in its order of priorities.
His message has been decried in some quarters as intriguing yet
insufficiently hard-edged. But now two Harvard professors have demonstrated
from extensive empirical research that his case is indeed strong. They show
that the values he espouses are very much the ones which are associated with
 -and may ensure - a company's ability to out-perform its competitors in the
long term, both financially and in every other sense.
In a nutshell, the message of John Kotter and James Heskett's book is that
superior financial performance in most market circumstances is heavily
dependent on having a culture which helps the organisation anticipate and
adapt to changes in the business environment. One of their paragons in this
respect is Hewlett-Packard, the US computer company. Strong but unadaptive
cultures, like those of General Motors, can be at least as dangerous as weak
ones, they argue.
Yet, as British Airways, Nissan and others have shown, strong but
inappropriate cultures can be changed, say Kotter and Heskett - given the
right sort of leadership.
All this will come as especially good news to anyone who invests in, or
works for, IBM, ICI, or even troubled BP. These, and a host of other
corporations, are expending considerable effort and expense on what they
variously call organisational- or culture-change.
One of the great virtues of this book, compared with the plethora of others
on corporate culture and organisational change which has appeared in recent
years, is that it is based on a set of studies into relatively large samples
of companies - between 10 and 200, depending on the type of study. Another
is its clarity, brevity and lack of evangelistic flannel.
Its definition of organisational culture, for instance, is much simpler than
most. Whereas previous writers have argued that it consists of multiple
layers, Kotter and Heskett delineate just two, each of which influences the
other.
At a visible level are the behaviour patterns of groups of employees (such
as fast or slow responses to customer requests, and the involvement or
otherwise of junior employees in decision-making). At a deeper, less
conscious, level are values which are shared by people in the group. In some
corporate cultures people care most deeply about customers, in others about
technological innovation, and in still others about their managerial status.
Until a decade ago, most people's understanding of corporate culture
extended only as far as the idea that, to be successful, companies require
just one or two strongly 'shared values', such as IBM's commitment to
customer service and its respect for individual employees. Then the
bestseller In Search of Excellence, by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, taught
people that culture was much more complex.
But what neither school of thought spotted was that, in an age of rapid
change, cultures appropriate to today's business environment may be
unsuitable - or even lethal - in tomorrow's. Many of the companies lauded by
Peters and Waterman stumbled soon afterwards.
More recently, IBM and Citibank have done so too. Such companies can do well
for quite a while, say Kotter and Heskett, because their cultures fit their
relatively static environments. But when these start to change, the
company's competitive performance suffers.
Kotter and Heskett's empirical research assessed in various ways the
cultural characteristics and financial performance of their study of
companies over 11 years to 1988.
Their prime conclusion from the data is that a company will adapt
appropriately only if all its members really care deeply about, and pay
constant attention to, what the academics call 'the three key managerial
consistencies': customers, stockholders and employees. As each constituency
changes its preferences and priorities, the company anticipates or responds.
The Harvard pair put the three constituencies in a slightly different order
from Professor Handy, but their message is essentially the same as his. And
as powerful.
The book is slightly less satisfactory in its advice about how companies can
turn themselves into adaptive paragons like Hewlett-Packard. It contains
plenty of examples of successful change programmes, such as those at
American Express, Bankers Trust, British Airways, Xerox and especially ICI
and Nissan.
Yet some of its judgments of success are premature - at Scandinavian
Airlines for instance - despite its own correct warning that culture change
can seldom occur quickly. The book is also rather short on evidence that
many such change efforts have instilled a really flexible set of 'adaptive'
values, rather than just created a more modern but still static culture.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Arts: All's Well that Ends Well - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The only common view about All's Well that Ends Well is that it is not
Shakespeare's best play. It lacks both a central character and an
identifiable central theme and although it cannot be categorised as anything
other than a comedy, it is not very funny. Having some fondness for the
piece, my own view has been that the best way to approach it is to play up
the part of Helena, the woman who cures the King of France of his near-fatal
illness, and is allowed to pick the husband of her choice (Bertram) as a
reward only to find that he rejects her and goes off to the wars. She
catches up with him in the end by conceiving his child while he thinks he is
in bed with another woman.
That is emphatically not the view of Sir Peter Hall, making a return to the
Royal Shakespeare Company after 20 years absence. Hall's approach is to play
the piece slowly, even ponderously, warts and all, just in case we miss
anything. At the end of the first half, I thought that he was overdoing the
literalness at the expense of enjoyment. The second half, in which he
developed an anti-war theme, is very good indeed. In the end he has directed
the play at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in the way it appears to
have been written: an imperfect, puzzling piece full of reminders of
characters in other Shakespeare plays, but none of them developed.
Hall's central figure is Parolles, a follower of Bertram, who claims to be
full of military expertise and magnificently played here by Michael Siberry.
There is a touch of Malvolio in him, but also of characters from Ben Jonson.
In the first half he is teased for being extravagantly over-dressed.
However, there is more than a touch of Falstaff: not Falstaff the drinker of
sack, but the cowardly braggart who ultimately realises the horrors of war
more than his fellows. The contrasts between Siberry in his early finery and
later tatters and the changes in his physical movements are breathtakingly
stark.
By stressing the role of Parolles, Hall has not solved the problems of the
play. The chief riddle is Bertram. It is understandable that he should
object to having a wife foisted on him by the King of France, but that is no
reason why he should be so grotesquely rude to her. There are elements of
Coriolanus in him, even to having a similar kind of mother.
Bertram is an impossible part to play convincingly and it is a tribute to
Toby Stephens (as it is to Hall's direction) that he gets better as the play
goes on. As his mother, Barbara Jefford is impeccable throughout. Richard
Johnson's King looks strikingly sick at the start, but becomes a dominant
figure towards the end. And if you want an example of how to play a small
part to perfection, watch Andree Evans as the widow who helps to arrange the
bed-trick on which the plot turns.
Helena, as played by Sophie Thompson, comes out as a mousy-looking woman,
whom one can well understand Bertram wishing to avoid. There is little
evidence for this in the text and indeed it would add to the magic of the
play if she were allowed to be one of Shakespeare's most vivacious heroines,
making Bertram's rejection of her more inexplicable and therefore more
interesting. After all, she is an intelligent, inventive woman. Why can't
she be attractive as well?

FT  02 JUL 92 / Arts: Tuck and Patti - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was determined not to enjoy husband and wife team Tuck and Patti from the
moment I saw them likened to Wes Montgomery and Sarah Vaughan and Fred and
Ginger on London's billboards. When the compere at the Royal Festival Hall
on Tuesday warned us that we were about to experience an evening of love and
togetherness I almost bolted for the door. But, shucks, after 14 years of
togetherness and 11 years marriage, the cuddly couple really have found an
irresistible way of spreading connubial bliss.
Tuck Andress, a 1970s throwback in large white suit, permed hair and
gormless expression, plucks adeptly at a large semi-acoustic guitar while
the missus, Patti Cathcart, a contralto cross between Joni Mitchell and
Chaka Khan, does likewise with the heartstrings. 'Love relates both night
and day, doesn't matter where you are,' she boomed generously to Horace
Silver's 'Togetherness' tune.
They make an extraordinarily relaxed pair. Their molasses-laden material -
which ranges from 'The black mining hills of Dakota' to Cyndi Lauper's 'Time
after time' - washed pleasantly over us, Patti being both reassuring and
comfortably raunchy in her vocal acrobatics. 'People tell me I don't sing
the blues,' she complained to squeals of approval, 'Well ah do ever time ah
wear these shoes . . . I got those high heeled blues.'
Tuck, who spends most of his time slavishly accompanying her tear-jerking
cadenzas has his moment too: when Patti leaves to recharge her emotional
batteries. After an overlong comic interlude, a la Rowan &amp; Martin, the
guitarist launched into a powerful, percussively harmonic version of Michael
Jackson's 'Mirrorman,' of all things.
Although black and white images of soppy Sonny and Cher are conjured up by
this extraordinary double act, they have tremendous musical value. Even a
cheerless number about a mute crippled girl whose wheelchair has rolled to
the cliff's edge is no cause for real sadness when Patti sings it.
Tuck and Patti perform good tunes, simply and with panache. If they exploit
the sentimentality of the permed classes, so be it.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Arts: The Trojans - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Launching brand new productions of both The Ring and The Trojans within a
single season suggests estimable resources and high ambition. The Theatre de
la Monnaie in Brussels has done just that: Herbert Wernicke's much praised
staging of The Ring last autumn celebrated the end of Gerard Mortier's reign
as the house's director, and now the Berlioz has arrived as the first major
project of Bernard Foccroulle's stewardship.
Evidently keen to establish his post-modern credentials right from the
start, Foccroulle gave the German producer Peter Mussbach responsibility for
the production; Sylvain Cambreling, the house's musical director, is the
conductor. Mussbach's stature continues to grow in Europe; next year he
becomes chief producer at the Frankfurt Opera, when Cambreling becomes its
director. My own encounters with his operatic work had broken just about
even before this - an imaginative, visually arresting realisation of
Wolfgang Rihm's new opera in Hamburg last January set off against the absurd
version of Idomeneo he made for Amsterdam a year ago - but the new Troyens
very definitely left the account on the debit side.
While Mussbach does conjure up some passages of keen visual inspiration,
they are invariably beside the dramatic point; there is little illumination
or even a suggestion that the production has got to grips with the substance
of the work itself. The sets by Lucio Fanti are dominated by blood-red
pillars which infiltrate every scene; Joachim Herzog's costumes - grey
overalls and mob caps for the chorus in the Trojan scenes, the same in
orange for Carthage, while the principals wear a timeless mixture of finery
 -are uninspired.
If the production has a thesis at all, it appears intent on depersonalising
the opera, switching the focus from the protagonists to the Trojan and
Carthaginian peoples in turn. So in the first part Cassandre, Chorebe and
the rest are swallowed up by the chorus, and their own personal problems
subsumed into those of the masses, while in the second Didon and Enee are
just one more lovesick couple in a people devastated by the same sickness.
That Berlioz's music consistently tells us otherwise is a difficulty this
concept never quite overcomes.
There's also a determination to avoid anything that might seem like an
operatic set piece - the chorus admire a Trojan horse standing somewhere in
the wings, the Royal Hunt and Storm offers some vaguely suggestive liaisons,
and the ballet is illustrated by desultory cross-stage traffic. The chorus
spends much of the first half of the opera writhing on the ground and the
rest of the time upstaging the principals.
Cambreling's conducting was brisk and unfussy, but the orchestral playing
was never quite clean and precise enough to make the musical account as
invigorating as it should have been, but the singing of the female roles in
particular saved the day. The casting of the Cassandre (Francoise Pollet)
and Didon (Kathryn Harries) was as good as one has any right to expect,
though Harries was far better served by the production than Pollet. This
Cassandre has to make her vocal presence felt largely from up stage, and
frequently with the massed chorus teeming in front of her. She is not the
most compelling stage presence, but her diction is wonderfully clear.
Harries was allowed a good deal more space and her movement and gesture
delineated the presence still further. Her mastery of this role continues to
deepen; it has developed even beyond the level of her performances for
Scottish Opera in 1990. There is now a weight of expression in every single
phrase, a sense of each element in the portrayal fitted perfectly into
place. That she was able to make her singing so affecting in these
inhospitable dramatic circumstances was sufficient tribute in itself, and
she was supported too by an excellent rich-toned Anna from Elzbieta Ardam.
The male characters were not realised with anything like the same intensity.
Ronald Hamilton's Enee was short of stature and in his phrasing; both
William Stone's Chorebe and Reinhard Hagen's Narbal were out of focus,
though there was an interestingly misanthropic Iopas from Barry Banks. The
chorus, of whom so much is expected in this production, was efficient if not
sonorous, and on its own was never likely to provide the sense of epic so
lacking elsewhere.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Technology: Japanese electronics forced to clip its research
wings - The metamorphosis caused by a collapse of demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western perceptions of Japanese electronics companies' approach to product
development tend to be heavily influenced by the success story of the Sony
Walkman, and the claims of Akio Morita, Sony chairman, that 'any amount of
market research' could not have measured the worth of his winning ideas.
Tales of product-driven successes were all the more convincing when Japanese
developers appeared to churn out an endless array of winning products.
Now the downturn in the international electronics market and the increasing
cost of capital in Japan have forced companies to reassess the importance of
market research in focusing their R&amp;D.
A sobering trend has been the collapse of domestic demand for audio-visual
equipment; a market which had been a prime target for researchers competing
to develop 'new' products that were actually minor variations on an older
theme, whether it be large-screen televisions or a video-cassette recorder
with an extra knob or two.
Japanese consumers' apparent willingness to toss out hardly-used items and
embrace these 'new products' helped to convince companies that the market
would do them no wrong.
Unfortunately, products have continued to surface, while audio-visual sales
have been in decline for two years, leaving electronics companies with
painful bruises.
Matsushita Electric Industrial's pre-tax profits were down 39 per cent in
the year to end March and Sony's were 44 per cent lower.
Companies have reviewed the development process and concluded that
life-cycles are too short and product ranges too wide, as even the domestic
market is reluctant to absorb new products.
At the same time, R&amp;D budgets are under pressure from the turbulence in
Japanese financial markets, which is also encouraging companies to be more
focused about research.
Investment in R&amp;D is an important source of corporate pride in Japan, as it
is generally taken as a measure of long-term strength. This year, however,
budgets are generally flat or falling, while some image-conscious companies
which claim to be increasing R&amp;D are simply shifting other business expenses
into that budget.
At Hitachi, which makes consumer, office and industrial electrical goods,
R&amp;D spending is forecast to fall by 4 per cent this year, after a 6 per cent
increase last year, and rises of 14 per cent, 15 per cent and 13 per cent in
the three previous years.
The sharp increases coincided with the surge of the Tokyo stock market in
the late 1980s, when new funds were easily raised.
The company said that the role of market research differs depending on
product type. For heavy machinery under development, perhaps in co-operation
with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) and other
equipment makers, the lead time may be ten years or more and the company may
agree to participate in a project on the understanding that there will be
public sector demand.
'For consumer products, our lead time can be almost nothing. We would like
to increase the life cycle of products because we can see that there has
been some change in consumer demand and that would reduce our R&amp;D costs,'
the company said.
Instead of wasting development funds on a minor upgrading of an existing
model in an already overcrowded market, Hitachi and others are trying to
find better uses for their money.
One change at Hitachi is that control over R&amp;D is shifting from individual
facilities, which had been seen as 'profit centres', to administrative
divisions with broader access to market research: 'These divisions are
closer to the market and our company is moving closer to the market,' the
company said.
Last year, NEC, the electronics maker, introduced changes in its R&amp;D
policies based on what it calls the 'Customer Satisfaction Concept'.
Mr Hiroshi Okazaki, manager of the engineering control division, points out
that 'the most important thing is that every R&amp;D person has a marketing
mind'.
R&amp;D, he says, is kept relevant to the market by regularly bringing together
researchers on a particular project and representatives from divisions that
would have responsibility for handling the finished product.
Meanwhile, the group business planning division prepares market studies
which are circulated among the R&amp;D workers.
As for the common belief that Japanese companies have research programmes
that churn out dozens of completely new products, only a few of which are
relevant enough to be marketed, Mr Okazaki said that this approach was
discarded at NEC more than 20 years ago.
'It was once believed that the central research laboratories should be
'black-boxed', and not controlled by outsiders. But, more than 20 years ago,
NEC introduced a modern research management system, including research
evaluation before the project start, and meetings between the central
researchers and operational divisions,' Mr Okazaki said.
Making minor changes to existing models, and then releasing 'new' models in
rapid succession on the domestic market, is a more recent trend, quite
distinct from the researching of genuinely new products.
Companies have had to release slightly improved models less frequently, and
they have simultaneously had to pay more attention to the selection of new
development projects.
Fujitsu, the computer company, aims to spend the equivalent of about 10 per
cent of total sales on R&amp;D, but admits that its manufacture of
semiconductors and various other high-tech products requiring huge
investments during development has put the R&amp;D budget under pressure.
'As technology further advances and information and communication systems
spread into more versatile areas , R&amp;D activities to realise these
technologies require more and more investment. Therefore we have to be more
selective and set priorities,' Fujitsu said.
Fujitsu is not the only Japanese electronics company forced to be more
selective.
Proud as they are of big R&amp;D budgets, the Japanese makers are under extreme
pressure to get value for money by choosing winning research and by curbing
an enthusiasm for 'developing' products that the market does not want.
