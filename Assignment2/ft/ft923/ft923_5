FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (2): Bruised but not battered
 -Riding the Recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE past two years Atlanta and the wider Georgia economy have had to
cope with a phenomenon of which they have had remarkably little recent
experience: recession.
The economy of the Georgian capital has grown so rapidly since the second
world war that it has not suffered nearly so badly from periodic recessions
as most of the US. And it managed to avoid the great 1981 downturn entirely,
thanks in part to an extensive public works building programme.
Not so the 1990-1992 recession, which has been the worst in Atlanta since a
severe property crisis in the mid-1970s. 'We took a significant recession
and we're just gradually digging out of it,' says Mr Donald Ratajczak,
director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.
Total payroll employment in the state dipped to 2.942m in 1991, down 1.6 per
cent from 1990, and economists are expecting only a marginal increase this
year, of about 0.2 per cent. Atlanta, for its part, saw a 1.4 per cent drop
last year, to 1.46m jobs, with signs of an equally muted upturn so far this
year.
The big question now is how much business conditions will improve in 1993,
with many economists hopeful of jobs growth of 1.5 to 2 per cent, provided
the wider US economy does not fall into a 'triple dip' recession.
However, Mr Moncure Crowder, economist at Wachovia bank, points out that the
current slow pace of recovery means no one is ready to proclaim the return
of the kind of boom Atlanta enjoyed in the 1980s.
And while the state is generally expected to enjoy stronger economic growth
than the nation as a whole during the 1990s, it may not retain quite the
advantage of the past decade.
As economists at the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta have pointed out,
changes in the structure of the regional economy have diminished some of the
comparative advantages of the Southeast, which is increasingly 'becoming
subject to the same general influences as the nation.'
Atlanta's growth over the past 30 years has certainly been remarkable. In
the 1950s it was roughly the same size as the steel city of Birmingham,
Alabama, but it is now far bigger and the undisputed economic capital of the
South.
Contributory factors have included:
An optimistic, boosting, can-do business philosophy;
The city's geographical position, as a rail, telephony, road and air
communications centre;
Its political leadership - which grasped the need to reinforce these
advantages with, for example, repeated modernisation of the city's
Hartsfield airport, one of the world's biggest and
An early, enlightened attitude to racial integration, which gave comfort to
companies from outside the region looking (in the 1960s and 1970s) for a
city in which to place a southeastern regional headquarters.
The first boom occurred from 1966 to 1973 and included two developments
which have been important to the city's continued success.
One was the modernisation of Hartsfield. The other was construction of the
first wave of the hotels which have propelled Atlanta to an important
position in the convention business.
Boom was followed by a property bust in the mid-1970s and then, starting in
about 1977, came a long wave of expansion which saw the city consolidate its
regional position and aim to become an international centre of note.
The boom drew in a substantial number of foreign companies and produced a
widely diversified economy. (For although the Atlantan and Georgian
economies are heavily dependent on the services sector, no single industry
dominates, and agriculture, once the state's mainstay, now forms a
relatively minor component of its output.)
This second boom ended in 1990 as the US headed into a national recession.
Atlanta was hard hit by the demise of Eastern Airlines, which had a large
presence at Hartsfield, and the closure of one of two General Motors plants
in the area. (The second appears safe for now).
The overheated property market also slumped. Atlanta currently has an office
vacancy rate of about 20 per cent, similar to many other big US centres, and
its warehouse and retail vacancy rates are also high. 'Property is going to
be a drag almost throughout the decade,' says Mr Bethel Minter, economist at
SunTrust Banks.
However, positive economic factors should significantly outweigh any
negatives over the medium to long-term. Atlanta's good infrastructure,
pleasant life-style and relatively low property costs means that it
consistently ranks at or near the top of surveys of the best US cities in
which to do business.
It will continue to be a magnet for new investment, whether it comes from
the small, new technology firms which quietly provide many of the new jobs,
or dramatic corporate relocations such as the move of United Parcels Service
to the city from its former Connecticut headquarters.
The 1996 Olympics will also give a direct boost to the economy,
provisionally estimated at some Dollars 3.5bn - but almost certainly its
greater long term importance will be the public relations impact it will
give Atlanta internationally as a place to do business.
The Olympics will certainly give a mid-decade impetus to the city's
important tourism industry. This has been stuck on a plateau for the past
two years, and may find it hard to show substantial growth while the US
economy remains so subdued.
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, an important local employer and one of the
'big three' US carriers, is expected to expand less aggressively over the
next few years as it digests its recent purchase of many of defunct Pan Am's
routes, which enabled it to make a huge leap into the international arena.
However, growth in the city's transport services business is expected to
remain positive.
Among the best hopes for strong growth over the next few years are the
city's various high technology businesses. Communications is a huge
industry; it ranges from BellSouth, the largest of the Bell regional
telephone companies, to Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network (CNN).
Atlanta has one of the most extensive networks of fibre optic cable in the
US, and the city's role as a communications hub was cited by British Telecom
when it decided to place the headquarters of Syncordia, a subsidiary set up
to manage large users' worldwide networks, in the area.
The Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology represents an
attempt by government and private industry to capitalise on the state's
communications advantages by researching ways of integrating the convergent
technologies of telecommunications, consumer electronics, cable tv,
computers and tv programming.
Computer software is also becoming a significant employer. So is medical
technology, with the location in Atlanta of the US Public Health Service's
Centers for Disease Control and the American Cancer Society.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Downing Street brushes aside Mellor ethics issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWNING STREET last night brushed aside claims that Mr David Mellor, the
national heritage secretary, had breached the government's ethical
guidelines for ministers when he accepted hospitality from the daughter of a
leading Palestine Liberation Organisation member.
Officials said that as Mr Mellor had judged that his family's Marbella
holiday with Mrs Mona Bauwens in August 1990 did not breach the guidelines,
he was under no obligation to refer the decision upwards to the prime
minister.
However, Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary, claimed in a letter
to Mr John Major yesterday that the rules required that Mr Mellor should
have taken advice on the holiday, paid for by Mrs Bauwens.
The row followed the abandonment yesterday of a London libel case brought by
Mrs Bauwens against The People when the jury split evenly over whether her
reputation had been damaged by an article in the newspaper.
Mr Mellor, who has seen speculation that he might resign from the cabinet
rise strongly during the hearing, yesterday emphatically denied any plans to
quit.
Under the guidelines for ministers' behaviour made public on the
instructions of the prime minister this summer, the matter is left to 'the
good sense of ministers'. But it is also made clear that in grey areas, they
should seek the prime minister's advice.
The relevant sentence reads: 'It is a well established and recognised rule
that no minister or public servant should accept gifts, hospitality or
services from anyone who would, or might appear to, place him or her under
an obligation.'
Mrs Bauwens has fought her libel case in an effort to establish that her
father's role as a leading figure in the PLO has no bearing on her
reputation or public standing. Last night she was considering seeking a new
trial after the indecisive conclusion of the hung jury.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Concert party that led to crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE winter of 1979-80, the Takeover Panel decided that St Piran, a
Cornish tin mining company, was controlled by a concert party of companies
run by Mr Jim Raper, chairman of the Gasco conglomerate.
It ordered him to bid for the remaining 8m-plus shares at 85p each. Mr Raper
could not raise the money, and the company's shares were suspended in May
1980.
In April 1981, Mr Raper borrowed Pounds 3m from Savings and Investment Bank
for 12 months to buy St Piran. Gasco had agreed to buy nearly 1.2m St Piran
shares at 50p, conditional upon a similar offer being made to all other
shareholders. Mr Raper beat off a 60p a share counter-offer from Burmah
Mines, promising to match it.
By October 1981, the bank gave Gasco a revised loan and overdraft facility
totalling Pounds 5m, secured on St Piran's share capital.
Mr Raper believed he had until September 1982 to repay the amended loan; but
the bank thought that the original date of April still applied. Mr Raper did
not know that the bank had been insolvent since the previous April.
Like Mr Raper, Mr Victor Gray, the bank's owner, believed St Piran would be
worth between Pounds 16m and Pounds 20m if its shares could be reactivated,
and he had found a likely buyer.
In December 1981, Gasco defaulted on interest payments and asked to
reschedule the loan. The bank demanded that Gasco repay the outstanding loan
and interest. Mr Raper refused, and in March 1982 the bank obtained an
injunction from the English High Court preventing Gasco removing Pounds 7m
of assets from the court's jurisdiction.
Mr Raper failed to pay up. Early in June, Mr Gray told him he wanted the St
Piran shares but Mr Raper issued a press statement that he was suing the
bank for Pounds 12m for breach of the loan agree-ment.
That started a run on the bank, which soon crashed, unable to repay Pounds
42m of depositors' funds.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Prospects of Labour Europe clash recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of a clash within the Labour leadership over European policy
appeared to be receding last night on the eve of a crucial debate on a new
document aimed at outlining the way ahead after the UK's abandonment of the
exchange rate mechanism.
Speculation had been mounting that Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage
secretary, might quit the shadow cabinet in protest at the paper that seeks
to reaffirm Labour's claims to be 'the party of Europe'.
Mr Gould's aides indicated last night that they believed he would have
little difficulty in accepting the terms of the paper that lays out broad
principles for British membership of the ERM, while arguing for flexibility
within the system.
The paper, drawn up by Mr John Smith, the party leader, in consultation with
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, aims to position Labour as still
firmly behind the Maastricht treaty. It also rules out Labour support for a
referendum, widely backed by Euro-sceptics within the opposition party.
The document, to be submitted for endorsement to the national executive
before proceeding to the shadow cabinet tonight, appears to offer few
hostages to fortune on when Labour would seek the UK's readmission to the
ERM.
Accepting the de facto devaluation of the pound, it instead argues for a
return to a flexible ERM in which periodic realignments are customary.
Its main aim is to castigate the government for presiding over circumstances
where the pound was unable to resist the wave of speculation in the foreign
exchange markets that forced sterling's withdrawal from the ERM last week.
Close allies of Mr Smith have grown increasingly angry over recent days with
what has been seen as maverick behaviour by Mr Gould. In a number of
interviews the shadow heritage secretary has claimed that the Maastricht
treaty was as good as dead and appeared to urge a British plebiscite on the
accord.
However, the Labour leader's advisers have also made the case for seeking a
compromise acceptable to Mr Gould, who fought Mr Smith for the Labour
leadership this summer. They are more than aware that any showdown between
Labour's Euro-sceptics and the pro-Maastricht leadership would be damaging
on the eve of tomorrow's Commons debate on the economy and next week's
annual party conference in Blackpool.

FT  23 SEP 92 / BA scraps 500 supervisor posts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS has abolished more than 500 supervisor posts as part of a
flexible-working deal agreed with unions representing almost 4,000
engineering and maintenance staff at Heathrow, Gatwick and Glasgow.
Mr Alistair Cummings, BA's director of engineering, said: 'We realised
supervisors were doing an impossible job. They had to combine aspects of man
management, the organisation of production, problem-solving and material
shortages.'
Former supervisors will be absorbed into teams responsible for one or other
of those functions. Some will be promoted into the upper layers of
production control management within a new production control unit on the
shop floor.
The move is consistent with recent research by the Confederation of British
Industry and the National Economic Development Council. Both criticised the
competence and development of Britain's supervisors, who number more than
1m.
BA's approach to the matter fits in with recommendations that the job of
supervisor should be rethought. Some functions should be transferred to
management and others to production team leaders.
The airline says the wider deal, agreed with the AEEU electrical and
engineering union and the MSF professional and technical union, underlines
the sea change in relations with engineering staff. It believes the deal
means immediate productivity gains of 5 per cent to 10 per cent.
In the longer term, BA hopes the new arrangement will allow it to undertake
more work for other airlines because of the end of demarcation among
engineering staff and the creation of a multi-skilled workforce through
training.
It introduces a simplified pay structure that consolidates allowances into
basic pay. That means improved sick pay and pension benefits. The airline
says all jobs are secure and the deal will improve long-term prospects for
staff.
During the 1980s and early 1990, BA and its engineering staff were involved
in a number of disputes over pay and flexibility. BA says relations were
hampered by a lack of trust on both sides. The airline believes the vital
groundwork for the new agreement was laid in 1986 when the two sides agreed
a measure of flexibility. Union fears of job losses proved groundless.
Management and unions cemented their working relationship in 1990 when the
two sides met frequently to discuss changes in the airline.
Mr Roger Butler, an AEEU executive council member, welcomed the deal, which
he said would protect jobs: 'This multi-skilled training package gives the
workers higher skills and more independence. It also gives them a lot more
trust and responsibility.'
He said the abolition of the supervisors was sensible, since it had been
proved that the workforce could self-supervise.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Investor watchdog to enlarge board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL NUKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMATION committee of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed
watchdog for retail financial services, is expected to accept in a
consultative document published tomorrow that it has no means of forcing
companies to be regulated by it.
The new authority is designed to replace Lautro - the self-regulatory body
for life assurance and unit trusts - as well as Fimbra - the regulator for
financial advisers - and the retail operations of Imro, the fund managers'
regulator.
But the formation committee, headed by Sir Brian Hayes, has come under
increasing pressure from the big four high street banks and insurance
companies. Their absence from the new body would undermine the objective of
creating a one-stop watchdog for retail financial services.
The committee's main attempt to meet those objections will be to increase
the size of the board so that it can include more bank and life-company
members.
The organisation's board will now have 30 seats rather than 25 as originally
proposed. If the latest proposals are accepted, product providers will hold
a total of 12 seats on the board, consisting of seven life offices, three
unit trust and investment management companies, one bank and one friendly
society.
The remaining seats will be filled by 12 independent financial advisers, 10
consumer representatives and one independent chairman appointed from outside
the industry.
The planned timetable for the new regulatory body will include completion of
the consultation process by late autumn, publication of firm proposals in
January next year and a launch in July.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Veil of Whitehall secrecy is lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAREER DETAILS of the head of MI5 are given in the first edition of a new
guide to Whitehall, published with official blessing - but no reference is
made to the head of foreign intelligence.
Dod's Whitehall Companion, produced with the encouragement of Sir Robin
Butler, the head of the Civil Service, provides information on 980 top civil
servants, ministerial advisers, regulators and executive agency chiefs.
It contains a brief biographical note on Mrs Stella Rimington, head of the
MI5, but there is no entry for Sir Colin McColl, her counterpart at MI6.
Dod's gives details of present jobs, past careers, education and recreations
of mandarins as well as addresses and telephone numbers.
Many of those listed have also supplied photographs of themselves.
Apart from the reference to Mrs Rimington, information is given about the
Security Commission - which deals with Whitehall leaks - and the Security
Service Tribunal, which investigates complaints against the security
service.
The guide also discloses previously unpublished information about the
responsibilities of individual civil servants, including those working in
the Cabinet Office and at for the prime minister at No 10 Downing Street.
Detailed organisation charts for each government department show the links
between individual ministers, top civil servants and departmental divisions.
Sir Robin Butler played a central role in producing the guide, arranging
access for the compilers.
In his foreword to the book, Sir Robin welcomes its publication as
'consistent with the mood of open govern-ment'.

   THERE used to be two types of people on the Isle of Man
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the native Manx and the 'come-overs'. The latter were immigrants, sometimes
rich and mainly from England. If they did not like the island's way of life
and customs, the Manx retort was simple: 'If you don't like it, there's a
boat leaving every morning.'
As one well-heeled English come-over put it last week: 'I realised early on
this was a foreign country. Whingeing come-overs, or those who try to change
things, do not do well here.
'I decided to go with the grain and find a Manx partner to work with for my
business deals. It has worked well.'
He did not want to be named, fearful of falling foul of the network of
native islanders openly referred to as the 'Manx mafia'.
Two things are precipitating change, he said - a flood of technocratic
come-overs who have taken over the island's finance sector; and the collapse
10 years ago of the Savings and Investment Bank with Pounds 42m of
depositors' funds.
The Manx bank crash shook the island to its millennial roots and Tynwald,
the Manx parliament founded by the Vikings, put in tough supervision for the
finance sector. That achieved what Tynwald had wanted all along: serious
investment by respectable banks and insurance companies that knew they were
not going to be tainted by a milieu that encouraged crooks.
Last year's census shows that for the first time the proportion of the
population who are come-overs is now just over 50 per cent. That will not
last, because most of the come-overs are professionals whose children, born
on the island, are a new generation of native Manx people. Moreover, a
further type of islander has appeared - the 'come-backs'. These are native
Manx who emigrated, succeeded, and have returned to play an active part in
island life. They rarely returned in the past.
Mr David Cannan worked in Sri Lanka and Malaysia before settling in England,
where he owned several retail properties and became a Conservative county
councillor in Berkshire.
He joined the come-backs in 1980 and was elected to Tynwald after the Manx
bank crash. As finance minister in 1987 he called in the Metropolitan Police
fraud squad to investigate the Manx bank and, together with Mr Miles Walker,
then the new chief minister, insisted that the truth be disclosed.
The two eventually fell out politically - Mr Cannan is a Tory while Mr
Walker is much nearer to being a social democrat - but the truth about the
Manx bank finally came out yesterday with publication of the Chadwick
report, delayed because a fraud trial connected with the Manx bank's deals
in Britain was not completed until last month.
Even at 10 years' distance, the report is unpalatable.
In 1975 Tynwald decided to expand the island's finance sector to counter
chronic depopulation and decline in its traditional industries of tourism,
farming and fishing.
However, in a community the size of a small English market town, politicians
were part-time amateurs and soon found themselves in a sea of complicated
offshore tax law alive with sharks. They failed to see the danger and had no
budget for serious supervision - and there was no one capable of carrying
out that supervision.
The island became an easy place for speculators. Some obtained banking
licences and dipped directly into depositors' funds - some of it 'black'
money carried to the island in cash by tax evaders in Britain and Ireland -
to speculate, mainly in land and property in the UK.
Savings and Investment Bank was not a 'bad apple' - four other 'banks' also
crashed on the island in the early 1980s. But Savings and Investment Bank
had a disproportionate impact, because about 2,000 of its 3,000 depositors
were honest, innocent local savers.
Regulatory failings meant there was no political will to allow the truth to
emerge until the government changed in 1987. That proved fatal to punishing
the bank's principals - charges against them were dismissed in 1990 because
the delay in bringing them to trial was judged unreasonable.
Most believe such a thing could not happen again under the strict regime run
by Mr Jim Noakes, chief executive of the Financial Supervision Commission.
For example, anyone trying to deposit more than Pounds 1,000 in cash
anywhere on the island has to prove where it came from.
Mr Noakes believes offshore finance centres are a necessary adjunct of
international marketplaces such as London, Tokyo or New York, but that they
must be properly policed.
He says: 'What drives offshore centres is the ability to exploit differences
in international tax laws. You can do this openly and many respectable
financial and insurance companies do so.
'But where you get people doing it in secret, where you get an atmosphere
where you are not likely to encounter much punctiliousness by the
authorities, people with dubious records will try to take advantage of it.'
His toughness has en-couraged the respectable.
Royal Insurance, Roywest and Coutts are among the big operators that have
moved in or expanded. Clerical Medical Insurance has won a Queens Award for
Export from its Isle of Man base, while Barclays Bank has set up
international and money transmission operations on the island and grown from
under 100 staff to 260 in four years. The finance sector accounts for 30 per
cent of the economy and 14 per cent of jobs, with just as many in
professional services such as accountancy and the law.
Mr Noakes says the influx has brought professional competence and high
ethical standards, while there has been a shift in the nature of deals from
the personal to the institutional.
But until the Isle of Man confesses its sins over Savings and Investment
Bank and purges them by paying fair compensation to depositors, Mr Cannan
for one thinks its image will always be tainted.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Manx authorities attacked over supervision: Regulation
failed after bank's insolvency - 'Funny money' deals uncovered / Important
documents impossible to find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHADWICK report into the collapse of the Savings and Investment Bank in
1982 was published yesterday after six years of legal delays.
The 500-page report is an indictment of the regulatory role of the Manx
government, which according to Chadwick was so poor that the task of
supervising the island's growing finance sector could not be fulfilled.
Its charges may have been softened by the passage of time and financial
reform on the Isle of Man. But the report, by Mr John Chadwick QC, will be
eagerly read by the 3,000 depositors who between them lost Pounds 42m.
Mr Chadwick, who was appointed by the Manx High Court, tells the story of
the bank's collapse in full for the first time. Supervision failed when
quarterly returns showed the bank to be insolvent, but it was allowed to go
on trading.
The report also notes that the government's public stance that the truth
should come out was not matched by co-operation from officials.
Mr Chadwick and his team were unable to find some important documents.
'Rumours of shredding during June and July 1982 are likely to have
substance,' the report comments. The inspectors assisting Mr Chadwick - Mr
Tim Beer, of KPMG Peat Marwick, and Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully - found
no record at the Manx Treasury of analyses or comment on the bank's
quarterly returns. They said the process of supervision under the island's
Banking Act could not be carried out without that. Mr Peter Duncan, the
Treasury official responsible for supervision at the time, 'declined to tell
us whether there was some system within the Treasury for analysis and
comparison of quarterly returns.
'If there was no system of this nature, it appears to us the finance board
was in practice quite unable to carry out the task of supervision as had
been set under the Banking Act.'
The report also refers to 'funny money' deals carried out by Mr Duncan on
his own account and says it is a matter for serious concern that a Treasury
official should have been prepared to indulge in such matters.
The inspectors said many of the Manx bank's transactions could be understood
only in the context that 'those concerned had persuaded themselves that the
evasion of tax was a legitimate objective condoned in the Isle of Man'.
Mr Robert Killin, managing director of the Manx bank, told the inspectors
this central element of his work 'received some measure of encouragement
from the government'.
The inspectors said: 'SIB was to engage in venture financing to a degree
which was out of all proportion to its own resources and management ability
and in many cases assumed virtually the whole financial risk. Most of the
back-to-back transactions we have identified had a fiscal or illegitimate
purpose.
'Transactions of this nature were used to hide the identity of the true
lender or investor, to facilitate the falsification of company accounts or
to disguise the source of funds which have been acquired or retained
illegally.' Mr Killin told the inspectors that all big decisions required
the approval of Mr Victor Gray, the beneficial owner of the bank.
Even when Mr Killin felt he could not cope with the various troublesome
accounts, he felt he could rely on Mr Gray to eventually put it right.
The bank had very heavy lending to customers such as Mr Gilbert Hunter, Mr
Michael Morris and Mr Kenneth Fincken, who were using the Isle of Man to
raise funds, mainly for property deals.
In early 1981 Mr James Raper, chairman of the Gasco conglomerate, began
borrowing from the Manx bank to support his bid for St Piran, the Cornish
mining group.
The bank had been insolvent for 16 months before its collapse, but its
dealings with Mr Raper precipitated a final run on its funds when Mr Gray
tried to seize Mr Raper's St Piran shares as security. The bank closed on
June 25 1982. Rescue attempts by the bank's directors, owner and the Manx
government failed.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Markets rally strongly on realignment
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets staged a strong rally yesterday afternoon
on rumours of a general realignment of the exchange rate mechanism, although
these were denied by government officials and central bankers.
The largest afternoon gains were seen in the French market, where the bond
futures contract rose nearly a point in late trading. The benchmark 8 1/2
per cent 10-year bond closed on a yield of 8.48 per cent, from 8.62 per cent
on Monday.
Rumours centred on a 5 per cent upward revaluation of the D-Mark block
currencies and a 3 per cent upward revaluation of the franc. This would
imply an effective 2 per cent devaluation of the French currency against the
D-Mark but French bonds rallied on the premise that a general realignment
would allow the Bundesbank and other central banks to cut interest rates.
The franc remained under pressure on the foreign exchange markets, The
trading at around FFr3.42 against the D-Mark, against a floor within the ERM
of FFr3.4305.
The government said the 1993 budget bill will not be introduced into
parliament until September 30, a week later than expected. Analysts are
expecting a reduction in government expenditure.
GERMAN government bonds led European markets lower during the morning
session following the release of figures showing German M3 money supply
growing at a higher-than-expected annual rate.
In the futures market, the December 10-year contract rose to 91.13 in late
trading, but during the morning the contract hit a low of 90.33 having
opened at 90.60. Volume was heavy at 98,500 contracts. The benchmark 8 per
cent 10-year bund closed on a yield of 7.48 per cent, from 7.51 per cent on
Monday.
The Bundesbank's favoured measure of money supply grew at an annual rate of
9 per cent in August, from 8.5 per cent in July. The target rate of growth
is 3.5 to 5.5 per cent, suggesting further interest rate cuts are unlikely.
Indeed, fears that August's money supply figures would be inflated by
international inflows into the D-Mark appeared to have little foundation.
The numbers showed only a small rise in time deposits, the most likely
destination for inflows of international cash. The strongest component
behind the overall rise in M3 was an increase in notes and coins in
circulation, suggesting monetary growth is being driven mainly by domestic
economic conditions.
YESTERDAY'S 1 percentage point base rate cut, and speculation of a further
easing in German interest rates, buoyed UK government bond prices, prompting
gains of nearly a point for short and medium-dated conventional gilts.
However, the strongest gains emerged in the index-linked sector, where fears
of higher inflation now that sterling has left the exchange rate mechanism
of the European Monetary System have encouraged strong demand for
index-linked stock.
Index-linked issues gained nearly five points yesterday with the 2 1/2 per
cent index-linked gilt due 2020 rising from 112 11/32 to 117 9/32 by late
afternoon.
The Bank of England issued a Pounds 600m tranche of 4 3/8 per cent
index-linked stock due 2004, available with effect from today - and the
second tranche of index-linked stock to be issued this week. The bank sold
Pounds 500m of index-linked stock on Monday.
Conventional gilts were boosted by the Bank's announcement of a one
percentage point cut in the base rate to 9 per cent and by sterling's slight
strengthening against the D-Mark. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from
103 3/4 to 104 by late afternoon.
However, at the long end of the yield curve, prices dropped in the morning
on fears that a cut in interest rates could lead to higher inflation,
especially now that sterling is not a member of the ERM. The 9 per cent gilt
due 2011 opened at 97 21/32 , but recouped some of its earlier losses to end
at 97 15/32 .
ITALIAN government bonds were pulled lower during the morning session by the
weak tone in the French and German markets but also rallied later on hopes
for a general realignment of the ERM.
The 10-year fixed-rate government bond maturing May 2002 closed at 91.64,
from 91.58 at the opening. On Liffe, the BTP future traded up to 92.80 in
late trading, from 92.52 at the opening and a low of 92.15.
SWEDEN'S central bank held its marginal lending rate at 50 per cent in money
market operations, but yields on longer-dated government bonds fell during
the day, encouraged by the stronger tone of continental European markets.
The lending rate was cut from 500 per cent on Monday. The benchmark 11-year
government bond closed on a yield of 11.30 per cent, from 11.50 per cent on
Monday but still well above the 10.75 per cent yields seen at the end of
last week.
US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of unexpectedly good
housing starts figures and a reported increase in department and chain store
sales. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1
11/32 at 97 13/32 , to yield 7.462 per cent. The losses at the short end
were less pronounced, with the two-year note down 3/32 at 100 9/16 ,
yielding 3.927 per cent.
The news that sparked the early selling was the 10.4 per cent rise in August
housing starts, the biggest monthly gain since January 1991. Although one
month's worth of figures does not provide much of a lead on economic
conditions, the market was nervous because of calls from the International
Monetary Fund - meeting in Washington - for higher US interest rates once
the recovery is under way and uncertainty ahead of the afternoon's first
experimental 'Dutch', or single-price, auction of Dollars 14.5bn in new
two-year notes. The auction went well, with the securities awarded at a
yield of 4 per cent, the lowest since 1974. Although prices ticked up after
the auction, they plunged again on the news from the Johnson Redbook Service
that department and chain store sales rose 0.8 per cent in the last three
weeks.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Intervention helps reduce
borrowing requirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE likely impact of UK government borrowing on prices in the gilt-edged
market has changed sharply in the space of a fortnight.
The borrowing requirement for 1992/93 has been greatly reduced, due to the
level of intervention in the currency markets in the days before sterling
was hauled out of the European exchange rate mechanism.
Also, in the immediate future the Bank of England appears more likely to
issue short-dated and index-linked stocks. So far this week, the bank has
issued a total of Pounds 1.1bn in index-linked gilts responding to strong
demand due to concern that inflation could rise.
Estimates of how much the bank spent on intervention vary widely.
Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, estimates that more
than Pounds 10bn spent on intervention will count towards this year's
funding requirement.
The bank's official reserves figures for September will be released on
October 2, which should provide a more accurate indication of how much was
spent on defending the pound. Intervening to support the currency helps the
government's funding on the one hand, while running down its foreign
currency reserves on the other.
Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at Warburg Securities, calculates that about
Pounds 5.5bn of borrowing remains to be done this financial year, assuming a
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of Pounds 33bn - against the
government's forecast of Pounds 28bn - and intervention amounting to about
Pounds 10bn.
The figure also takes into account the latest index-linked issues. Some
analysts say that the funding for 1992/93 has already been completed.
Even if the government has already hit its target, however, there is a
strong possibility that the bank will continue to issue gilts in the current
financial year - if market conditions are conducive - to fund some of next
year's PSBR in advance. This is likely to be as big, if not larger, than
that for 1992/93.
Following sterling's exit from the ERM, the shape of the gilt yield curve
has changed: yields on short-dated issues have fallen while those on
long-dated stocks have risen with the result that the yield curve is no
longer inverted. This has important implications for further gilt issuance,
making it cheaper for the government to borrow at the short end of the yield
curve.
The sharp rise in yields on long-dated issues reflects concern about the
prospects for inflation now that the UK no longer has the discipline of ERM
membership to determine its economic policy.
The reduced funding requirement should help to ease some of this pressure on
yields.
Inflation worries have prompted renewed demand for index-linked gilts, as
investors see them as an effective means of obtaining a real return.
On Monday, the bank sold Pounds 500m of its new index-linked stock - the 4
5/8 per cent gilt due 1998 - within a few hours, and yesterday Pounds 600m
of the 4 3/8 per cent index-linked gilt due 2004 was issued to take
advantage of the rally in the sector.
Dealers report a surge in turnover in the index-linked sector over the last
fortnight.
So far this year, the bank has issued Pounds 2.4bn of index-linked stock in
small tranches, compared with Pounds 15.5bn in conventional gilts (where
most of the issuance has been in medium-dated and long-dated issues).
The fact that the last two gilt issues have been index-linked suggests that
the government is keen to demonstrate confidence in its ability to keep
inflation down: however, it also indicates that the bank is issuing in those
areas where demand is seen to be strongest.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Spain lifts yield on Eurodollar issue
by 10 basis points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TURMOIL in bond markets of the past fortnight yesterday claimed its
latest victim as the Kingdom of Spain was forced to increase the yield on
its first Eurodollar bond issue by a substantial 10 basis points.
The decision to lift the yield, to 55 basis points over US treasuries
against the 42 to 45 basis points mooted when the bonds were first put on
sale a week ago, marks the latest climb down among issuers recently.
The Kingdom of Spain considered withdrawing its issue as the European
Investment Bank and Spintab had been forced to do, but decided instead to
proceed at a higher yield.
The change in price level raised again the question of the value of
underwriting in the Eurobond market. Banks which had underwritten the issue
a week before at 45 basis points over treasuries were excused the need to
stand behind a price which all agreed would have been a disaster in the
secondary market.
A sharp rise in spreads in the secondary market on issues of supranational
agencies such as the World Bank partly accounted for the need to change the
terms. Traders said spreads on these issues had jumped by around 15 basis
points, following a change in their tax treatment in Italy at the end of
last week.
The bonds ended the day at an unchanged spread of 55 basis points as the
lead managers stood behind the issue, picking up paper from other syndicate
banks.
Meanwhile, yesterday saw a renewed wave of floating rate notes with minimum
and maximum yield levels, as the Eurobond market came back to life after the
past week of n upheaval. The activity included a well-received Dollars 250m
issue from Austria, later raised by Dollars 150m, marking the first
sovereign issue in this sector.
The second tranche was priced at 100 1/4 after the first had been sold at
par, with the bond bid later in day at 100 1/2.

THE Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority has awarded a contract to build the
country's first nuclear reactor in more than 30 years to the Argentinian
company Investigaciones Aplicadas (INVAP).
Egypt's only existing nuclear plant, built by the Soviet Union in 1961 at
Inshas (55km north-east of Cairo), is to be dismantled.
INVAP won the tender for the 22MW research plant over rival bids from
General Atomics, the US group, Atomic Energy of Canada, and a Franco-German
consortium of Siemens and Framaton.
Mr Maher Abaza, Egypt's minister of power and electricity, said the
five-year project will cost Dollars 44.47m (Pounds 25.1m), plus Dollars
16.6m for sub-contracted construction and locally-manufactured components.
Work on the first phase will begin before the end of the year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM GRANT &amp; SONS, distillers of the internationally-known Glenfiddich
and Grant's whisky, has taken legal action against the Portuguese
distributor of a rival Scottish company to prevent it marketing gin and
vodka under the brand name Grant's.
Several crates of spirits were seized on Monday from warehouses and retail
outlets in Lisbon after William Grant &amp; Sons had been granted an injunction
against the Portuguese company Scorbebe which had been distributing on
behalf of Glen Cardine Bonded Warehouse.
The move follows similar legal action taken in May in a Scottish court
against Glen Cardine and two associated companies, A. Bullock and Company
(international) and William Morton.
A spokesman for William Grant &amp; Sons said it had gone ahead with the latest
litigation because the other companies had refused to stop producing and
selling products under the Grant's name, and were threatening to expand
their market penetration in Southern Europe.
Aire-based Glen Catrine is one of the three leading Scottish low-strength
whisky producers. It was recently embroiled in a public controversy claiming
that an EC directive discriminated unfairly against low-strength whisky.
The company has a bottling plant and bonded warehouse at Catrine, a
distillery in Loch Lomond, and a warehouse division in Glasgow.

FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Britain in arms talks with Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to start detailed negotiations on an arms supply package for
Kuwait. The move follows a visit there by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British
defence secretary.
Discussions have included possible sales of tanks and armoured vehicles, and
there has been speculation that a package might also include aircraft such
as Hawk jet fighters, as well as naval vessels.
Vickers' new Challenger 2 battle tank recently underwent trials in Kuwait in
a competition to supply about 200 tanks. This deal would be worth up to
Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.77bn).
Kuwait is known to be keen to diversify its sources of arms to avoid relying
solely on the US.
Yesterday's agreement is aimed at moving talks forward after a wide-ranging
memorandum of understanding on UK-Kuwaiti defence co-operation. The
understanding was signed in February.
A British consortium linking the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard with the
construction companies Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey has already been selected
to rebuild and upgrade Kuwait's main naval base, a project expected to be
worth up to Pounds 200m.
Mr Rifkind, who has also been discussing pending arms sales to Saudi Arabia,
said yesterday that Iraq still posed a threat to stability in the Gulf
region and also expressed concern about Iran's arms build-up.

trade

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, warned in Tokyo yesterday that
exclusive trade groupings in Asia and the Pacific were a threat to open
trade in the region.
Mr Keating is concerned over the various Asian trading groups that are
emerging in response to the faltering Uruguay Round.
Meanwhile in Washington, the treasurer, Mr John Dawkins and the trade
minister, Mr John Kerin, are also talking bilateral trade, and protesting at
the recent sale of 220,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan, a
traditional market for Australian cereals.
The ministers' trips come two months after Mr Keating publicly pondered
Australia's 'life after Gatt'. He has argued that a successful conclusion to
the Uruguay Round would be best, but if it failed Australia should explore
'Gatt-friendly' regional arrangements.
The problem for Australia, according to a government advisory group, is that
Asia's embryonic trade groups see little value in including a small and
marginal market like Australia, which is anyway an object of suspicion
because of its westernised views on politics and human rights.
The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which aims at free trade in most
manufactured goods, ignores Australia's main interest, which is farm
products.
The US has invited Australia to join the proposed North America Free Trade
Area (NAFTA), regardless of the geographical conundrum that implies. But the
US could refuse to dismantle existing barriers to critical Australian
exports to the US like steel, sugar and beef.
The group which seems to be gaining the edge in the Asian region is the East
Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) which was an initiative of the Malaysian prime
minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Here, however, Australia and New Zealand have
been left out.
In Japan this week, Mr Keating will hear whispers that Japanese business is
actively encouraging the EAEC. This is despite government officially
supporting Australia's own initiative, the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation Group (APEC), formed four years ago as Australia's attempt to
affirm its Asian links.
APEC would be the prefered forum for Australia, and was seen as helping it
to gain clout in the fight against EC protectionism. Australia has
traditionally considered the EC as the principal offender on corrupting
trade in its key exports, particularly wheat. But this conviction has been
clouded recently by subsidised US wheat exports to key Australian markets
like Kuwait, Yemen and Pakistan.
APEC's problem is that it is suspect just because it is chaired by
west-leaning Australia. Moreover, if Japan throws in its lot with the EAEC,
APEC would become less viable as a free trade bloc.

FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Beijing encourages Tokyo trade links -
China is set to be Japan's second biggest trading partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the past few days, Toyota Motor has expanded links with a Chinese car
maker, a group of Japanese trading houses agreed to develop a new Chinese
industrial zone, and a transport company, Sankyu, announced plans for a
network of trucking routes and warehouses in northern China.
The surge of Japanese investment interest in China is matched by the flow of
trade between the two countries. The flow is such that China is on the verge
of becoming Japan's second most important trading partner, from fifth place
last year, and it is likely to consolidate this position in coming months.
China's leaders, sometimes wary of an over-dependence on Japan, are
encouraging the trend. Li Peng, the Chinese premier, told Japanese
executives last week that they could explore for oil in the country's far
west, which is an important military region and has been off limits to
foreign companies.
Next month, Emperor Akihito will visit China and, in his understated way,
apologise for the past and laud the future. In retrospect, the emperor's
visit may be seen as marking the year in which long-sceptical Japanese
companies became convinced that China would realise at least some of its
much-touted commercial potential.
Trade between the two countries rose by 26.6 per cent in August, compared to
a year earlier, as the Chinese Government continued to encourage rapid
economic growth and Japanese companies, struggling to find customers at
home, were eager to capitalise on the flourishing demand from companies and
consumers.
For two of Japan's troubled sectors, the electronics and car industries,
China has been a source of increased sales when most other markets, even
south-east Asia, are flat or falling. Exports of electrical equipment are 20
per cent higher so far this year, while exports of transport machinery have
almost doubled.
After having been behind the US, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan as Japan's
leading trade partner, and aside from a Taiwanese statistical blip last
month, China has overtaken all but the US, still by far the most important
market. Sino-Japanese trade, in which China runs the surplus, does not
include exports to Hong Kong, which are rising sharply and often find their
way to southern China.
The unofficial trade is particularly heavy in consumer electronics, some of
which are subject to a 100 per cent duty in China. It is convenient for
Japan that many of its exports do not appear in official statistics, as some
Chinese Communist Party elders still have a rather simple view of trade and
regard a country with which China has a deficit as an 'exploiter'.
Since China launched its economic reforms in late 1978, the trade flow has
been characterised by surges and sudden halts, as Beijing turned on or off
the tap of foreign exchange. Fearing that the government was losing control
of the economy, central planners simply stopped issuing import licences or
cancelled allocations of hard currency.
However, Japanese industry is growing in confidence that the current rapid
growth will endure. Asked to list influences on their attitude to
investment, companies frequently cite the crushing of the pro-democracy
movement in June 1989 and the ensuing durability of economic reform.
After the Tiananmen brutality, China's economic policies were under
concerted attack by elderly conservatives intimidated by the pace of
development and by the ideological compromises inherent in the free market
policies. Attacks were routinely made against 'pernicious foreign
influence', giving the impression that the 'open door' was on the verge of
closing.
But the door has remained open, confirming perceptions that the endless
political infighting in Beijing is having increasingly less impact on
economic policy. A second reassuring conclusion is that political power has
drifted away from Beijing to the provinces, where local officials are often
ready to do business regardless of the fluctuating editorial tone of the
People's Daily.
Mr Yoshiharu Nonaka, general manager of the China section at Marubeni, the
trading house, said that Beijing bureaucrats should be given credit for
their handling of the economy, which was overheated in 1988, but now appears
to have entered a period of sustained growth.
He said the stronger yen was prompting his company to look for suitable
joint ventures in car parts production: 'We are are looking for these
opportunities. Our problems in trade with the US also mean that we have to
diversify as much as possible.'
A manager at Sanwa Bank responsible for China business said that there does
appear to be a clear distinction between the Communist Party's concerns
about being faithful to ideology and its desire for rapid modernisation.
'We can see that political and economic factors are now separate in China.
We have to be a little bit cautious, but we are also confident,' he said.
The Japanese are certainly more confident in committing their money to
China, as actual investment rose from Dollars 349m (Pounds 197m) in 1990 to
Dollars 579m last year, according to Ministry of Finance calculations in
Tokyo.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) expects the rate of
increase to continue through this year and that, in the longer-term,
Japanese manufacturers will be under extreme pressure to cut costs by
producing more components in regions such as southern China or the area
around Dalian in the north.
Investment in production facilities abroad was disrupted by the 'bubble'
economy of late 1980s, when spiralling domestic growth boosted earnings, as
did the easy money to be made on financial markets. These factors lessened
the incentive to find cheaper suppliers outside the country, and led to
increased investment in areas such as Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's
four main islands.

FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: EC Commission faces a bruising
shake-up - About half the 17 commissioners will be replaced in December
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   THE quadrennial changing of the guard at the European Commission
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
traditionally a lively spectator sport as EC member governments,
commissioners, and candidates lobby and intrigue for the few real jobs in
the Brussels executive - is shaping up as a rather sombre affair.
This is not because the jockeying for position is less fierce than at
previous ends-of-term for the Brussels executive. Indeed, about half the 17
commissioners will be replaced when their four-year mandate expires at the
end of December.
It is the continuing uncertainty over the Maastricht treaty which has taken
most of the fizz out of the spectacle. Whether or not Maastricht ends up
being ratified, the Commission not only faces a big reshuffle at the top,
but a morale-bruising shake-up throughout its civil service. 'The present
set-up is hardly tenable,' admits a senior Commission official.
Hostility towards Maastricht has been fuelled as much by widespread popular
perception that 'Brussels' is out of control as by what the treaty contains.
'We need to send a signal that this is a shrinking bureaucracy, and one that
has got the message,' says another top official.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, returned from his summer break
determined to use the reshuffle as a lever to re-order the executive's
priorities, and thoroughly reform its organisation.
Since his arrival in 1985, he has revitalised the Commission, won a reform
of EC finances, and offered Brussels bureaucrats an integrationist vision of
the single market - and then Maastricht. But to make the bureaucracy work,
he has relied on an informal network of capable loyalists, and the prestige
and combative projection he himself has given the Commission.
But within a maximum of two years from January - the period for which Mr
Delors has been reappointed by the 12 - this network will be wound down.
There is a real risk that an already vulnerable Commission will become
invertebrate. Only if the Commission puts its own house in order will it be
able to defend itself against increasingly sovereignty-conscious
governments, and increasingly irritated citizens, who want to cut Brussels
down to size.
The first outline of the reshuffle of the 17 commissioners is beginning to
emerge. Four commissioners are definitely going - Ray MacSharry, Carlo Ripa
di Meana, Antonio Cardoso e Cunha and Vasso Papandreou; seven (including Mr
Delors) are virtually certain hold-overs; and there are differing degrees of
uncertainty about the other six. Not all member governments have made up
their minds on who to nominate.
The Commission clearly needs to attract politicians of real standing.
Whether it will be able to depends on how Brussels emerges from the
Maastricht ratification battle, and how central a role it retains in shaping
Europe's future.
Under the more democratic arrangements almost everyone now agrees are
essential for the EC to re-establish its popular legitimacy, many argue it
is vital to have front-rank figures in the Commission. 'We need 'live'
politicians,' says one senior official, 'people with a future who are
looking over their shoulders to see how what they are doing is playing with
the voters.'
The presidential ambitions Mr Delors has nursed in France, this official
suggests, are part of the vitality the former French finance minister
injected into the Commission from 1985.
Reshuffling commissioners is, at the best of times, like multi-dimensional
chess, with each member state's domestic as well as European interests on
the board. But this is not the best of times. An overshrunk role, moreover,
risks turning the Commission into a refuge for displaced politicians - as it
was before Mr Delors took over.
The Commission's ability to attract depends on how it is reformed, and what
the member states want, or will allow it to do. The majority view is likely
to end up being that the Commission should do less, and do it better. Mr
Delors would probably add that it should have all doubt about its rights to
intervene removed by a code of conduct on 'subsidiarity'.
This would establish clear EC and national spheres of influence, oblige the
Commission to demonstrate that Community action is needed because measures
would be ineffectual at national level, and require governments to
substantiate their objections in the same terms.
Mr Delors himself wants more formal political control over the Commission to
be exercised by its secretariat general, which operates now as part
administrator, and part informal network. A beefed up secretariat would have
a purview over four or five central areas of EC policy, such as the internal
market, foreign relations and regional policy. It would know what was going
on right across the Commission with potential impact in these areas. The
object would be to minimise internally contradictory proposals, and the
meddling for which the Commission is sometimes fairly, but often unjustly
accused.
Most important, the secretariat would assess whether there was a real need
for the Commission to bring forward legislation.
Officials and outside experts say about nine of the existing 23 directorates
general (DGs) are considered ripe for possible re-organisation, merger, or
closure, although they warn it could take a long time to get the chemistry
right.
Brussels' foreign responsibilities, now spread over several DGs, are likely
to be more unified, with responsibility for foreign trade policy conceivably
passing to the industry directorate - a pet scheme of Mr Martin Bangemann,
the German industry commissioner, to replicate Japan's Miti.
EC structural aid spending, now spread over three DGs, would also be unified
more round the regional policy directorate.
The social affairs directorate, now internally divided into three,
effort-duplicating areas, could be reorganised, and the powerful agriculture
directorate could be limited to a core activity of commodity market
management, with its internal market and trade dimensions hived off to the
relevant DGs.
Such a scenario would probably lead to the closure of four directorates: for
small to medium-sized industry; fisheries (if it is amalgamated with
agriculture); for co-ordinating structural aid; and the ineffectual
information directorate.
Resistance can be expected from inside the Commission, and possibly from
member states that may feel unfairly treated in the new share out of top
civil service posts. But most insiders feel a more powerful impulse will be
the Commission's need to fight for its place at the centre of European
development.

FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Sweden unties welfare apron strings
 -The price to be paid in adapting to new realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A SWEDISH all-party agreement on government cuts and higher taxes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
finalised in the early hours of yesterday morning - represents a significant
break with the welfare state attitudes that have dominated the country since
the 1930s.
Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, told the Financial Times last night that
although the 'vision of the Maastricht treaty was in doubt' at the moment,
he wanted to see Sweden - when it becomes a European Community member - as
one of the 'core countries in economic and monetary union'.
With all-party support for underpinning the exchange rate and a continuing
broad political consensus over Sweden's EC membership application, he is
drawing considerable comfort from the readiness of his Social Democratic
opponents to swallow fundamental changes in the structure of the welfare
state as a price to be paid in adapting the country to the new realities of
global markets.
The Stockholm bourse share index fell 1.5 per cent yesterday in active
trading and short-term interest rates rose as the Riksbank, the country's
central bank, maintained a 50 per cent marginal lending rate to the banks.
However, capital appeared to be flowing back into the country.
The continuing unease in Sweden is partly a reflection of the wider
turbulence on the European money markets. It is still hopedthat the package
hammered out at the weekend between the four-party centre-right coalition
government and the Social Democratic opposition, aimed at eliminating a
growing structural deficit over the next few years, will make clear the
determination of the government to deal with the country's underlying
economic difficulties.
The country's old social consensus, based on high public spending and high
taxation administered by a powerful centralising state, and that once-famous
Swedish Model of comprehensive welfare provision, is being gradually
abandoned. Next year old-age pensions and child benefit are to be cut in
value. Housing subsidies are being reduced by as much as SKr3bn.
Swedes who are sick will receive no benefit for their first day of absence
from work and the amount they get thereafter will be less than before, with
a saving to the government of SKr4.5bn.
Sweden's foreign aid budget is also being cut by SKr1.5bn to 0.9 per cent of
gross national product from 1.0 per cent.
The cuts in government spending will amount to Skr18.9bn worth of savings
next year with a further Skr8.7bn coming through higher taxes (mainly on
petrol and tobacco) to strengthen the revenue side of the budget.
The total effect in on next year's budget will be Skr27.6bn but the impact
will rise to SKr40.6bn by 1997.
The all-party agreement deals not just with short-term reductions in the
still generous range of benefits provided for Swedes. It also makes an
important long-term commitment to transform Sweden's health and injury
insurance system by shifting its enormous and mounting costs from the
shoulders of the taxpayers to employers and trade unions with a saving to
the state of Skr50bn, 3 per cent of gross domestic product.
This reform is expected to go through in the mid-1990s with broad political
support. Mr Bildt sees this long-term change as opening up the huge public
sector to private market forces and going a long way to begin the necessary
reduction in the size of Sweden's public spending as a proportion of gross
domestic product which at 56 per cent is the highest in the developed world.
His government has been forced to make some sacrifices in its free-market
programmes. A moratorium has been imposed on the further privatisation of
state companies for the rest of the present parliament that ends in
September 1994, although ministers insist they will still have the final
decision on the timetable.
A plan to abolish the wealth tax has been postponed until 1994, as has a
proposal to reduce the tax on capital to 25 per cent from 30 per cent.
Nor has the entire Swedish Model been thrown out. All sides remain
determined to do what they can through labour market policies to contain
unemployment which could rise to 7 per cent this winter.
A further Skr10bn is to be devoted to work incentive and training schemes to
provide places or work for 130,000 people, 3 per cent of the jobless. It is
estimated this will lessen the cost of unemployment to the state by around
SKr4.5bn next year.
Under the remorseless pressure of outside markets, Sweden's political
establishment has been forced to accept that the country must adapt quickly
to the realities of economic and political integration with western Europe.
It has taken four weeks of severe turbulence on the markets and dangers to
the fixed exchange rate of the krona to bring about what Mr Bengt Dennis,
the Riksbank governor, has been seeking. But after three long nights of
argument and hard bargaining a new kind of consensus has emerged.
As Mr Bildt argues: 'A few weeks ago I saw severe troubles in parliament on
economic policy. Now we will have a comfortable majority for what needs to
be done.'
Under unprecedented conditions, the right-left divisions of Swedish politics
have been swept aside, albeit temporarily. Faced by the dangers to the krona
the politicians rallied round.
The immediate response from public opinion has been favourable. A poll
carried out by Sifo found 76 per cent in favour of the crisis package and
only 11 per cent thought it was bad.
Such popular support for the all-party agreement suggests the end of the old
Swedish Model will not be a cause for national mourning.

FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Money supply spectre haunts the
ambitious Bundesbank - But M3 goals will not be dropped easily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank may come to be haunted by its ambitious money supply targets.
On the one hand, they are fundamental to its monetary policies, intended to
curb inflation. On the other, they have led to interest rates which are
damagingly high for the rest of Europe and could even harm the slackening
domestic economy.
The latest figures have caught the central bank rather on the hop. When Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, its president, announced cuts in German interest rates
two weeks ago - as part of a limited currency realignment - he also held out
the possibility that money supply figures would look a little better after
the 8.5 per cent annualised expansion of July.
Yesterday, however, the bank said M3, the broad monetary indicator, had
advanced at an annual rate of 9 per cent in August, with bank lending
continuing to move along rapidly. The Bundesbank has set an ambitious target
range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent for M3 this year. As Mr Schlesinger
has ruefully admitted, there is no chance of this being reached.
Nonetheless, the Bundesbank is not about to abandon its targets lightly.
Even though the figures did not bear out Mr Schlesinger's hope that M3
expansion may have since been 'somewhat less' than in July, it still aims to
rein back money supply to a speed which will inhibit future inflation.
If it succeeds, interest rates will come down further. The question is when.
In view of the unprecedented turbulence on foreign exchange markets in the
past few weeks, the Bundesbank's targeting of money supply has, not
surprisingly, been the subject of considerable argument. Should the
Bundesbank relax its adherence to M3 at such a complex time, which includes
the manifold strains of unification, or should it stick to this indicator as
one of the only real yardsticks it has?
'In the past,' says Mr Thomas Mayer, an economist at the Frankfurt office of
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, 'M3 has shown its quality as a
leading indicator of inflation'.
Now, it is less easy to state whether it remains reliable. But he asserts:
'If there is any doubt, the Bundesbank has the duty to err on the side of
caution and stability'. Its legal duty, after all, is to maintain price
stability.
This is what the Bundesbank has been very successful in doing over the past
four decades; annual inflation has never exceeded 7 per cent. But then came
reunification, a generous conversion rate for East German Marks into
D-Marks, and the immense cost of shoring up east German living standards
while the economy was put through the immense trauma of moving from a
communist system to the free market.
Much of the extra growth in money supply reflects this process. Bank
lending, a large part going to finance investment in the east, has risen
rapidly, with annualised growth of 11 per cent over the past six months.
Although this rate is slightly less than in some months this year, 'it is
still far too high', says Mr Paul Brunker, economist with Robert Fleming in
London. 'I would have expected this to have come down faster.'
Much of the investment going into east Germany is helped by special credits
and soft lending, rendering it insensitive to changes in interest rates.
This worries the Bundesbank, though such spending will eventually contribute
to economic growth and create jobs. 'If the money goes into capital
investment, it will be less inflationary', adds Mr Brunker. 'But some must
be potentially inflationary.'
Among the strongly dissenting voices on the Bundesbank's monetary policies
is the DIW economic institute in Berlin. The Bundesbank took a roasting from
the DIW in July when it was accused of possibly becoming 'a slave of its own
money supply concept'. The institute said bank credits for east German
investment were highly necessary, and actually still too low. Moreover, they
would inhibit inflation over the medium term by adding to production.
So far, the Bundesbank has shown little sign of taking any notice. Wedded to
price stability, it has always kept policy tight when this objective has
been threatened. Only an easing of M3 growth, or immense foreign and
domestic political pressure, allied to further foreign exchange upsets, are
likely to persuade it otherwise.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN, which currently holds the EC presidency, yesterday called for
member states to rally round the single market project as an antidote to
turmoil elsewhere in the Community.
Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister, told internal market ministers they
should make a special effort to complete the barrier-free market by the
January 1, 1993 deadline.
But within hours of the start of yesterday's meeting, the 12 ministers were
embroiled in a familiar but fruitless debate about the working language of
the planned European trademark office. The office is supposed to provide a
single agency for EC companies to register trademarks.
Ministers agreed yesterday that EC leaders should discuss a second problem -
the site of the office - at the Edinburgh summit. Similar problems with the
location of various new European agencies will also be raised there.
But the 12 were unable to settle the dispute about whether the office should
accept trademark applications in any of the nine official EC languages or
adopt a simpler and cheaper system based on the use of English, French and
German.
The Commission has estimated that a nine-tongue solution could cost as much
as Ecu112m (Pounds 87m) to initiate.
Yesterday's meeting was also addressed by Mr Peter Sutherland, a former EC
competition commissioner, who is working on a report on how to implement and
enforce the market. He said before the meeting that member states should not
be allowed to invoke the concept of subsidiarity to wriggle out of single
market commitments.
The committee he is chairing is likely to recommend centralised controls to
help settle disputes which cannot be solved at national level.
'Subsidiarityshould not be used to wriggle out of single market commitments'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government is delaying a multi-million pound seismic study of
territorially disputed waters in the south Atlantic because of commercial
objections to the way two companies were initially given access to the area,
write Jimmy Burns in London and John Barham in Buenos Aires.
In July Falkland Islands' officials announced they had chosen Spectrum of
the UK and Geco Prakla, a subsidiary of the New York-based energy services
group Schlumberger, to conduct more than Pounds 7m in high-technology
seismic work beginning next month.
However, the islands' administration, under instructions from the UK Foreign
Office, yesterday again invited applications for the licences in a move
expected to delay work in the area until at least early next year.
The Foreign Office said last night the move reflected the UK government's
concern that the tendering process should be fair and transparent. 'We want
the net to be thrown as wide as possible,' an official said.
It is believed the announcement earlier this summer drew protests from other
companies, including Ensign, a UK computer analysis group. The companies are
understood to be interested in applying for licences but were not fully
consulted by the Falkland Islands' government or the British Geological
Survey, the UK government-funded research organisation advising island
officials.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Collor crisis likely to slow debt accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government has completed negotiations over a detailed debt
restructuring agreement with leading creditor banks in the face of the
corruption scandal surrounding President Fernando Collor.
The agreement, now being examined by lawyers from both sides, will have to
be translated into Portuguese and approved by the Brazilian Senate before it
goes to all lending banks for final approval.
An agreement in principle was reached on July 9.
However, it may be next year before the accord, which allows banks six
options in the restructuring of Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.8bn) of medium-term
debt, is finally completed.
Brazilian officials were quoted by bankers yesterday as saying it would take
a month or more to win Senate approval, and the final completion might not
take place until next year.
Bankers attending the International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings in
Washington also reported progress between banks and the Argentine government
on a Dollars 23bn debt accord. This has been held up as an estimated 80 per
cent of banks chose one of the two concessionary bonds on offer - the
so-called par bonds which cost significantly more for the Argentine
government to finance.
The government has said that a 65 per cent take up of par bonds would be
satisfactory, a figure which leading banks consider reasonable. Now banks
have to be persuaded to increase their take up of the alternative discount
bonds.
Turmoil surrounding Mr Collor is transfixing domestic politicians and is
expected to slow progress on the Brazil accord. Furthermore, the government
is out of compliance with an International Monetary Fund standby programme,
which will have to be renegotiated before banks agree finally to close the
deal.
Mr Collor's lawyers were due to present his defence to a congressional
commission by last night, but were expected to make no attempt to prove the
president's innocence. Instead, in an effort to win time, they were expected
to demand that his accusers present proof against him.
Their 20-30 page document is expected to attack the congressional
investigation which has implicated the president, question the lifting of
banking secrecy and ask for 20 witnesses to be called.
The commission was expected to reject these arguments on the basis that Mr
Collor has already had four months to present his defence and that they are
merely presenting a recommendation, while the actual judging of Mr Collor
will be done by the Senate.

'must not turn its back on the poor'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, yesterday urged donor nations
to give more aid to the poorest developing countries and committed the bank
to a policy of 'people-first environmentalism' in the third world.
'Donor budgets are tight and events of the past week have created further
uncertainties and pressures,' he said. But 'the international community must
not turn its back on the poor'.
By allowing aid flows to decline in real terms, the industrialised world was
asking the poor 'to bear the burden of adjustment in the rich countries as
well as in their own'.
Only five of 20 of the richest industrial countries have met the
international target of official development assistance equivalent to 0.7
per cent of GDP. Britain and the US are among the laggards.
Addressing ministers from 167 countries at the formal opening of the
IMF/World bank annual meetings, Mr Preston said the real resources of the
International Development Association (IDA) - the bank's concessional
finance affiliate - had to be substantially increased.
The bank is negotiating the tenth replenishment of the IDA, which covers the
three-year period beginning next July. A commitment of about Dollars 18bn
(Pounds 10.1bn) is the minimum required to maintain the current volume of
lending to the poorest countries.
However, there are nine new countries eligible for the IDA, including some
former Soviet republics, and new calls on resources, including environmental
pledges made by world leaders at the Rio Earth Summit in June.
The bank fears the commitment to aid is so weak in industrial countries that
even the minimum Dollars 18bn target may not be reached. It has been
pressing for an 'earth increment' of about Dollars 5bn to help finance
environmental policies but has received little support.
Mr Preston said the most urgent environmental problems were 'those that
cause illness and death on a huge scale in the developing world - dirty
water, inadequate sanitation and pollution. Ours must be a people-first
environmentalism.'
He said the bank would increase its investment in water and sanitation
projects by 75 per cent over the next five years and substantially expand
agricultural services and pollution abatement schemes. Spending on social
programmes such as health, education and family planning was set to rise by
50 per cent.

<TEXT>
US HOUSING starts in August showed the strongest increase in 18 months, the
Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The
annual rate of starts on new homes climbed by 10.4 per cent to a seasonally
adjusted 1,237m units.
This followed declines of 4.1 and 2.4 per cent in June and July respectively
and was far stronger than expected. The bond market fell as investors felt
the increase would lower chances of an interest rate cut. The benchmark
30-year Treasury bond lost a full point.
August's increase came after bad weather limited building in the summer. The
housing market is being helped by lower interest rates, with mortgage rates
near a 20-year low.
Although construction activity picked up strength last month, applications
for new permits fell by 1.6 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1,063m units.
This followed a 4.7 per cent increase in permits in July and suggests
August's big gain in construction is likely to moderate in coming months.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Washington group backs relaxation of Cuba embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US should exempt tourism and communications from its embargo on Cuba to
improve the flow of information and ideas to the country, an influential
foreign policy group has recommended.
The Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue's task-force on Cuba concluded
that such a selective relaxation of the embargo 'is the best way to foster
political opening' in Cuba and more likely than isolation to bring change.
This would mean expanding modest steps already taken by the Bush
administration, and would include allowing an upgrading of the telephone
service between the US and Cuba; permitting all US citizens, including
tourists, to visit Cuba; allowing scheduled air flights; establishing direct
mail links; and encouraging scientific, academic and other exchanges.
However, the group - comprising prominent personalities from North and Latin
America and led by Mr Elliot Richardson, former US attorney-general -
suggested that further relaxation of the embargo should only follow positive
steps by the Cuban government towards democracy and respect for human
rights.
The task-force, whose report was published last week, said the Cuban
government - which has suffered a devastating economic blow from the
collapse of communist regimes in east Europe and the Soviet Union - has
recently 'sharply stepped up its repression against all dissident groups'.
But it found no evidence that tightening the embargo and further isolating
Cuba would provoke positive change there. Such a policy would be
'short-sighted, costly for the people of Cuba and probably
counterproductive'.
It also rejected the opposite view that the embargo should be lifted
entirely: this would give away bargaining chips in negotiations to encourage
a change of policy in Cuba.
The task-force said that Radio Marti, the propaganda station relayed to
Cuba, should become a source of objective news while TV Marti, whose
operation violates international conventions, should be closed. The US
should also attempt to reduce Cuba's fear of military attack and start to
negotiate concrete accords with Havana over, for example, migration
agreements and weather and environmental matters.
US policy towards other countries should not be influenced by their
relations with Cuba. The group said it opposed legislation, such as that now
being proposed in the US Congress, designed to prohibit all trade with Cuba
by subsidiaries of US companies in other countries.
The report's likely influence on US policy is still unclear. In obvious
efforts to attract exiled Cuban voters in Florida, both main candidates in
this year's US presidential election have promised a hard-line stance
against the regime of President Fidel Castro.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Yugoslav plea to avert exclusion from UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Milan Panic, prime minister of the rump state of Yugoslavia, warned the
United Nations last night that exclusion of his country's delegation from UN
activities would set a bad precedent.
In a last minute bid to avert his delegation's exclusion from the UN general
assembly, Mr Panic argued that his state - consisting only of Serbia and
Montenegro - fulfilled all requirements of UN membership.
Sir David Hannay, Britain's ambassador, formally introduced a resolution to
exclude the rump state, following the declarations of independence by other
republics in the former Yugoslavia.
Sir David said the exclusion was in no sense a 'punitive measure' against
Serbia nor one designed to undermine the Yugoslav peace process.
He said it was only designed to deny the Serb-controlled rump state's right
to inherit the UN seat Yugoslavia held before its break-up.
Mr Panic served notice that he would formally apply for the new federation's
readmission.
Earlier, he pleaded his case in an hour-long meeting with the foreign
ministers of the council's five permanent members - the US, Britain, France,
Russia and China - who reaffirmed their rejection of Belgrade's claim to be
the automatic successor to a state that was a founding member of the UN.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, repeated that position on behalf
of the European Community in his address to the Assembly yesterday and
insisted that a delegation from the new 'Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'
should not participate in the work of the General Assembly.
Privately, western officials stressed that they did not want to do anything
to harm Mr Panic's standing and they acknowledged his political courage. But
they reiterated their view that Serbia and Montenegro must follow the same
route as the other republics of former Yugoslavia and apply for independent
membership if it wished to be in the UN.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US acting secretary of state, told reporters he
believed Mr Panic was working hard and constructively to bring peace to the
region, but both he and Mr Hurd agreed there were 'very serious problems' to
be resolved before the penalties imposed on Belgrade could be lifted. Any of
the permanent members of the Security Council could block its membership
application through a veto.
In an appeal addressed to all UN members, Mr Panic said the case of
Belgrade's membership affected the rights of all small states and its
expulsion would set a dangerous precedent. 'Today it is Yugoslavia; tomorrow
it may as well be any other member state of the United Nations,' he said.
Mr Panic is determined to strengthen his fragile base in Serbia, despite
attempts by Serbia's ruling socialist party to threaten another
no-confidence vote against him.
As soon as he returns to Belgrade, he will try to gain control over
television, currently monopolised by Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic.
Television is the main source of information for the countryside which
continues to support Mr Milosevic.
To achieve this, Mr Panic wants to change the federal constitution, in a
move aimed at placing the television, or at least one of the two main
channels, under federal control.

FT  23 SEP 92 / US talks still grappling with Russian debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS in Washington have so far failed to resolve disagreements over how to
ease some of Russia's debt repayment burden, but ministers and officials
remain confident they can still reach a formal debt rescheduling agreement
in the next month or so.
Russia must settle a number of outstanding issues with the other republics
of the former Soviet Union, while its creditors are at odds with each other
on how to structure the rescheduling agreement they hope to conclude at the
Paris Club of creditor-nations in October.
Germany and the US have taken opposite stances on the need for concessions
to Russia on its debt problem. Germany, by far Russia's largest creditor,
wants tougher conditions than the US, which has relatively little money at
stake in any debt deferral.
Over the juridical details of a Paris Club agreement looms the question of
economic reality: will Russia earn enough money next year to meet the
repayment obligations it will take on? 'We want to sign an agreement we can
definitely fulfil,' says Mr Pyotr Aven, Russia's minister for foreign
economic relations.
He says talks are still proceeding on the basis of preliminary projections
for the Russian balance of payments in 1993, which suggest his country could
take on a payment schedule that fell within Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn).
But detailed balance of payments projections are not yet available. 'Until
we have them, it is impossible to conclude a rescheduling. At the moment, we
are mainly discussing ideology,' Mr Aven added.
Among the issues is the reworking of last year's agreement under which all
the republics took on joint and several responsibility for the former-Soviet
Union debt.
Russia has been negotiating with many of the smaller republics to take over
their share of responsibility for the debt, in exchange for their
abandonment of any claim on Soviet assets, such as embassy buildings. But Mr
Aven said Russia wants a different agreement with Ukraine, because its share
of the debt is too big for this kind of 'zero option' treatment. This
rearrangement of responsibilities poses problems for some of Russia's
creditors, but Paris Club officials are sure a deal can be worked out.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Rouble plunges amid inflation fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian rouble yesterday plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar
since the Moscow interbank currency exchange opened last year, as fears of
galloping inflation gripped businessmen.
At the end of trading, it had sunk to 241 against the dollar - a loss of
35.5 roubles on last week's level of Rbs205.5 to the dollar. The volume of
dollars traded was also a record, at Dollars 68.8m - a sign of the
willingness of Russian enterprises to use Rbs15bn to buy the US currency as
a hedge against inflation.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian prime minister, confirmed in his speech
to the opening session of parliament yesterday that inflation had risen to 4
per cent a week or over 20 per cent a month, after falling to around 10 per
cent in August. The government lays the blame for the inflationary surge at
the door of Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, who has
pumped billions of roubles of credits into industries, and advanced billions
more to other former Soviet republics in the rouble zone over the past three
months.
Mr Sergei Glaziev, the deputy minister for foreign economic relations, said
exporting companies were not flexible enough to react to a fall in the
rouble, so he did not expect exports to rise as a result of fall in the
rouble.
Mr Gerashchenko, who took over as bank chairman in July, said then that he
would not waste resources on trying to support the rouble. However,
according to the daily Izvestia, the bank did try to intervene in the market
yesterday, but could not stop the sharp fall in the rouble.
Rumours have been sweeping the markets that the government will return to a
fixed exchange rate of the rouble against the dollar - though neither Mr
Gaidar nor Mr Glaziev gave any hint of this yesterday. The maintenance of
artificially high exchange rates for exporters had cost the government
billions of roubles in subsidies - and these are unlikely to be reimposed at
a time of further planned budgetary cuts.

FT  23 SEP 92 / UK troop protection attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British defence ministry yesterday came under fire from both government
and opposition MPs over the amount of protection planned for British troops
in the former Yugoslavia and their ability to respond to attack.
The House of Commons defence committee - called exceptionally during the
parliamentary recess - questioned Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces
minister, over the planned despatch of 1,800 UK troops to Bosnia, as well as
the latest deployments in the Gulf.
Mr Hamilton emphasised that the UK had 'a very short-term and limited
objective' in escorting UN aid convoys in Bosnia. 'We do not wish to see
this being enlarged into some sort of peace-making activity,' he said.
One opposition MP described the UK effort as 'pretty half-hearted'. This was
after Mr Hamilton repeatedly stated that the British forces would withdraw
if convoys became 'seriously blocked' or suffered heavy casualties.
Mr Winston Churchill, a Conservative MP, criticised the ministry for not
providing armed helicopters or other air cover.
Mr Hamilton said he did not expect the troops to come under air attack or
find themselves in a position where helicopter gunships were needed.
But he accepted that the troops' Warrior armoured vehicles would be
vulnerable in the event of an artillery attack and would have 'serious
difficulties' locating where fire was coming from.
The aim was to secure passage for convoys by negotiation and not by military
means. 'They are not in the business of fighting their way through,' Mr
Hamilton insisted.
He said Britain was 'quite happy' to work under UN rules of engagement, and
denied that these precluded using superior firepower against an aggressor.
Once the attacker was identified, troops would be entitled to 'fire back
with anything they've got.'
Major General Roger Wheeler, assistant chief of general staff, said UK
troops would carry a card, as they do in Northern Ireland, spelling out the
circumstances in which they might open fire.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Russia freezes trade with Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL transactions between Ukraine and Russia, the two largest former
Soviet republics, have been frozen since Friday when Mr Viktor Gerashchenko,
chairman of the Russian central bank, bowed to pressure from reformers and
said he would no longer accept payments from Ukraine.
Blocking Ukrainian-Russian trade, which accounts for about 70 per cent of
inter-republican trade, is likely to deepen the recession in most former
Soviet republics. It represents another blow to the faltering financial
links between the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
A senior official at the National Bank of Ukraine confirmed yesterday that
Russia would not accept further payments from Ukraine. The rationale is
Russia's contention that by issuing credit to Ukrainian enterprises, which
in turn purchased goods from Russia, Ukraine is exporting inflation to its
northern neighbour.
'These actions will only speed Ukraine's exit from the rouble zone,' a
senior Ukrainian banker said.
This banking wrangle coincides with a continuing struggle between Mr
Gerashchenko, a conservative thought to favour Russia's powerful industrial
lobby, and Mr Igor Gaidar, Russia's reformist prime minister.
Against Mr Gaidar's wishes, on September 10 Mr Gerashchenko signed an
agreement with Mr Vadim Hetman, chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine,
which was aimed at simplifying payments between the two republics.
Russian reformers have been outspoken in their criticism of the deal which
they say would allow Ukraine to sabotage Mr Gaidar's efforts to tighten
Russian monetary policy by flooding Russia with devalued 'Ukrainian'
roubles.
Ukrainian banking officials said that Russia shares the blame for Ukraine's
runaway emission of credit.
According to Ukrainian calculations, Russian enterprises, feeling the pinch
of Mr Gaidar's austerity measures, have amassed a debt of Rbs300bn to
Ukrainian enterprises.
Mr Viktor Ilin, Ukraine's deputy minister of finance, reacted angrily
yesterday to Russia's freeze on payments from Ukraine.
He said the Russian move could lead to mass bankruptcy of enterprises and a
catastrophic collapse in trade between Ukraine and Russia.
Mr Ilin said the Russian decision was likely to hasten Ukraine's exit from
the rouble zone and the introduction of a separate currency.
'Russia is pursuing a protectionist policy,' Mr Ilin said. 'Russia seeks to
dictate conditions to Ukraine and to force Ukraine into economic
dependency.'
The financial crisis has highlighted a fundamental flaw in the banking
system of the former Soviet Union. While Russia is the only republic able to
print paper roubles, the central banks of all 15 former Soviet republics
have the ability to issue credits.
This means that Russia's efforts to tighten monetary policy can be sabotaged
by a loose credit policy in any of the other republics.

<TEXT>
MR Yegor Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, yesterday told a sullen
Russian parliament that the government would seek to enforce a tough credit
and monetary policy in an effort to stem the spiralling budget deficit and
hyperinflation.
In his starkest speech since taking command of economic reform less than a
year ago, the 36-year-old Mr Gaidar said the recent relaxation of tough
monetary policy had reached a dangerous point, and must be reversed. 'We
will have to toughen monetary policy in order to stop a destabilisation of
the monetary system,' he said.
In the short debate following his speech, deputies called for his
resignation. Significantly, these calls came from leading members of
centrist groups which had reluctantly supported the government in the past.
Mr Gaidar said later he had no intention of resigning.
Mr Sergei Polozhkov from the centrist Smena faction said that Russian
industry would soon stop completely, and called for an 'anti-crisis
programme' and for the resignation of Mr Andrei Nechaev, the economics
minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of
privatisation and Mr Peter Aven, the minister for foreign economic
relations. Mr Mikhail Chelnokov of the Civil Society faction said that the
reform 'was carried out in the interests of foreign business', and called on
Mr Gaidar to resign.
Mr Gaidar and his colleagues have dispensed with any efforts to put a
positive gloss on the reform process, emphasising instead the catastrophic
nature of the country's finances and productive base in the apparent hope
that this will jolt the country into accepting a renewed squeeze on
expenditure. However, as Mr Gaidar has recently noted, they face an
organised and aroused opposition and a weary population.
In his speech, Mr Gaidar painted a picture of a country racing towards
collapse. Production last month was down 27 per cent on the previous August,
capital investment had been cut by 46 per cent this year, and would be down
by around 55 per cent on the whole year; the budget deficit stood at the end
of the first eight months at Rbs800bn; inflation was rising to 4 per cent a
week, or more than 20 per cent a month; prices had increased 15.6 times in
the year to last month, while wages had gone up 10.6 times; 13m people lived
below a (very low) poverty line of Rbs1,200 income a month (Dollars 5 at
yesterday's new market rate for the rouble).
The prime minister pointed out that living standards were at the level of
the early seventies, before the Soviet Union enjoyed the benefits of the oil
price rises. He forecast a harvest of 96.7m tonnes of grain - significantly
below the 110m tonnes forecast less than two weeks ago by Mr Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian president, although better than last year's. However, livestock
production had declined by 23 per cent, as producers stopped breeding
because they could not afford fodder.
The only good news was the privatisation of 18,000 small businesses and
shops with receipts to the government of Rbs10bn - though this was far
behind the annual target of Rbs96bn. Unemployment stands at only 500,000 in
Russia, but is expected to grow to 1.5m by the year end - still only 2 per
cent of the workforce, but also a sign that industrial restructuring has not
yet taken hold.

A FRESH European Community effort is under way to find a name under which
the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia can be given international
recognition without offending Greece.
Mr Robin O'Neill, a British diplomat, is holding talks today in Skopje, the
Macedonian capital, after meeting Greek officials in Athens last week.
Mr Kiro Gligorev, the Macedonian president, has so far ruled out a name
change after the refusal of the EC, under pressure from Greece, to recognise
the republic under the name of Macedonia.
Nevertheless, other EC members remain sceptical of the Greek argument that
Macedonia's choice of an ancient Greek name amounts to a territorial claim
on the modern Greek province of Macedonia.
Mr Gligorev will probably be asked to compromise on a double name: Macedonia
would be recognised abroad under a different name, while at home it could
still call itself Macedonia.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Home loan rates set to fall: Lamont looks to regain economic
initiative with one-point rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government yesterday took full advantage of the freedom conferred by
a floating pound to cut interest rates by 1 percentage point, bringing them
below short-term rates in Germany for the first time for more than 11 years.
The effort by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to regain the initiative
over UK economic policy was swiftly followed by announcements from banks and
building societies that they would cut mortgage rates by around  3/4 of a
percentage point.
The move came less than a week after 'Black Wednesday' when the government
had to suspend sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism, thereby
abandoning the central plank of its economic policy .
The decision to take rates to their lowest levels since mid-1988, was taken
after consultations yesterday morning between the chancellor and Mr John
Major, the prime minister. It is designed to raise the spirits of
Conservative backbenchers ahead of tomorrow's emergency Commons debate on
the economy.
The move will also reinforce the impression at Westminster that Mr Major's
priority now is to rebuild his support among Tory MPs, even at the expense
of some higher inflation.
The chancellor made it clear yesterday that he 'was not going to take any
risks with inflation' and would raise rates again should price rises
accelerate.
The cut in commercial banks' base rates from 10 per cent to 9 per cent came
shortly after the Bank of England reduced the rates at which it lends to the
banking system just before 10am.
The pound shrugged off the cut in interest rates, which had been widely
expected in the City, although a bigger-than-expected rise in the German
money supply dampened prospects of another early rate cut.
Some industrialists and politicians warned yesterday that further reductions
in borrowing costs were necessary to lift Britain from its longest recession
for 50 years.
Sterling closed in London up  3/4 of a pfennig on the day against the D-Mark
at DM2.5450, but in late New York trading it was quoted at DM2.539. It was
barely changed against the dollar in London at Dollars 1.7090, although it
finished in New York at Dollars 1.695.
The Leeds Permanent building society, with half a million borrowers, was the
first of the big mortgage lenders to cut its basic rate by 0.75 per cent
from 10.7 per cent to 9.95 per cent.
The Abbey National followed with a pledge to cut mortgage rates by 'around
0.75 per cent', but the Halifax said it would wait to see how the markets
settled before deciding by how much to reduce its lending rates. A reduction
of 0.75 of a percentage point would take the average cost of a Pounds 30,000
mortgage down by just over Pounds 11 a month.
Mr Lamont said the cut was justified on both fundamental economic grounds
and recent sharp falls in inflation but he stressed he was determined to
press on with the government's policy to reduce inflation.
Yesterday's move is expected to lift some of the gloom stifling economic
activity, but worse-than-expected trade figures came as a reminder of the
difficulties facing the UK economy.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that the UK's deficit on
visible goods, excluding oil and erratic items, was Pounds 1.7bn, its
highest level for two years. It followed an underlying rise in import
volumes to record levels and a levelling off in exports growth. The devalued
pound could make imports more expensive, but will make exports more
competitive.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'While this interest rate
reduction must of course be welcomed, it is essential that it is accompanied
by immediate action to improve the long-term performance of the economy.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / Executive pay rises slide to 25-year low of 5.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY rises for UK executives have fallen to their lowest level for 25 years,
according to research published yesterday.
The report by P-E International, the research company, found that in the six
months to September 1992, median salary increases for top managers were
running at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent.
The figures suggest that recent high-profile pay rises for some company
directors are not the norm. Executive pay rises have remained no more than
about 2 percentage points above inflation since the recession began in
mid-1990. Before then, average increases had run at twice the rate of
inflation since 1983.
This pattern resembles that during the recession of 1980 and 1981, when
annual pay rises stayed at about 20 per cent during a period in which
inflation was 18 per cent.
However, executive pay is still rising more rapidly than inflation,
currently 3.6 per cent, and more rapidly than average settlements for
non-executive workforces, currently running at just over 4 per cent.
A separate, smaller survey of management pay settlements conducted by
researchers at Employment Conditions Abroad over the last year, showed rises
of up to 7.5 per cent.
The P-E International survey shows that in the year to July 1992, the number
of executives facing pay cuts and freezes increased to 11 per cent from 7
per cent year-on-year, the survey of 6,703 salary packages from 508
companies shows.
Companies with an annual turnover of about Pounds 500m are paying top
executives an average of Pounds 160,000, and senior managers Pounds 49,000
in basic salaries, excluding bonuses. Those with a turnover of about Pounds
50m pay executives Pounds 85,000 and senior managers Pounds 33,000 in basic
salaries before bonuses.
An executive earning Pounds 100,000 basic salary is likely to drive a
company car retailing at about Pounds 30,000 or the equivalent of a Jaguar
XJ6 4.0 Auto or a BMW 730i.
Those on Pounds 35,000 would drive cars worth Pounds 16,000, for example a
Rover 820i or Ford Sierra 2.0i Ghia. The company cars are worth between 10
and 15 per cent of their basic salaries.
About a third of company bonus schemes made no payments this year.
Just 37 per cent of top managers won extra payments this year compared with
38 per cent in 1991 and 49 per cent in 1988. The average value of executive
bonuses was 12 per cent of basic salary, marginally higher than last year.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Training obligation for jobless ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has rej-ected as too costly the introduction this autumn of a
US-style Workfare programme under which long-term unemployed would lose
benefits unless they took up training or community service.
The viability of such a policy has been investigated over the summer by the
Department of Employment in response to widespread calls in the Tory party
as the number of long-term jobless has continued to rise.
Such a strategy is not ruled out completely but implementation in the short
term is considered too difficult because of the multiplicity of schemes that
would be required.
Instead, to save money and focus on the problem of the long-term unemployed,
the Treasury wants entry to Employment Training - the main training
programme - to be more tightly restricted to people who have been unemployed
for more than six months.
In a confidential document sent by the Department of Employment to Training
and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which administer training schemes, the
government has detailed funding arrangements to achieve this.
The Department of Employment is currently reviewing the whole area of state
provision for the adult unemployed in consultation with a number of other
government departments, including the Treasury, as well as the Tecs.
The government is considering merging ET with Employment Action, the work
experience scheme for the longer-term jobless which has had a
lower-than-expected take-up.
To give Tecs some discretion over how they administer the programme, Mr John
Lambert, director of the operations division at the Department of
Employment, wrote in the document sent to the councils: 'It is agreed that
training in a merged scheme would not be mandatory.'
Mr Lambert said the government wanted ET confined to those unemployed for
six months or more.
Such a time-limit would adversely affect women returning to the labour
market after having a family, short-term unemployed, disabled people and
victims of large-scale redundancies.
Currently these groups are exempt from the six-month restriction and make up
about 30 per cent of participants on the training programme.
Tecs, in a submission to the review last week, said these groups should
retain their eligibility for ET.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Pressure intensifies for further realignment of ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, ANDREW FISHER and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE FOR a further realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism
intensified last night after five of the system's remaining currencies
dropped close to their ERM floors against the D-Mark.
Four European central banks intervened heavily on the foreign exchange
markets yesterday, buying their currencies for the D-Mark after an
unexpectedly strong figure for Germany's monetary growth in August indicated
that the Bundesbank would be unable to cut interest rates further.
A spokesman for the French finance ministry denied rumours that the ERM
would be suspended altogether and that the French franc would be devalued
against the D-Mark. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, said
in Washington that he did not see a D-Mark revaluation happening.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, who was in Washington for the
World Bank/International Monetary Fund meetings, said last night he saw no
need for 'further adjustment' after last week's turmoil on the currency
markets. Speaking to journalists he also said there was no good reason for
speculators to attack the French franc.
Mr Waigel's comments came after he had abruptly cancelled his scheduled
appointments and attended what German embassy officials there described only
as a 'series of bilateral meetings'.
It was not immediately clear with which countries he had conferred. But
after a day in which a number of currencies were pushed close to their floor
levels in the European exchange rate mechanism, the move raised speculation
that a further ERM upheaval could be imminent.
Further fuelling this suspicion were reports that several EC financial
policymakers - including Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, and
Mr Horst Kohler, Mr Waigel's top official - were flying back early from
Washington. Community and national officials maintained their denial of
rumours earlier in the day that a meeting of the European Community Monetary
from Committee, which is composed of representatives of finance ministries
and central banks, was about to be convened.
Mr Waigel later reaffirmed Germany's commitment to the European Monetary
System and said it would do 'everything possible' to allow currencies that
have temporarily left the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS to return to
it.
On the foreign exchange markets, the falls in the value of the French franc,
the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Dan-ish krone and the Irish
punt came within a week of the sus-pension of sterling and the Italian lira
from the ERM.
The Bank of France intervened for the fourth trading day running, buying
francs for D-Marks, as its currency threatened to fall to its ERM floor
against the D-Mark of FFr3.4305. Dealers said that the French central bank's
intervention was substantial, but the franc closed in London at FFr3.4260.
The Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo also came under intense selling
pressure. The Bank of Spain intervened to defend the peseta for the first
time since its currency was devalued by 5 per cent last week. But the peseta
closed at Pta71.91 to the D-Mark, very near to its new ERM floor of
Pta72.62. The Portuguese escudo slipped below Esc89 to the D-Mark, close to
its floor of 92.33.
The Dutch central bank bought the Irish punt and the Danish krone for the
Dutch guilder, which was yesterday the second strongest ERM currency.
In Frankfurt the Bundesbank said that M3, the broad monetary aggregate, had
expanded at an annualised rate of 9 per cent from 8.5 per cent in July. This
suggests inflationary pressures in Germany are still high and that German
interest rates may not be reduced again for some time.
The figure for August M3 money supply compares with the Bundesbank's target
range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent for the full year.

toiletries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GILLETTE, the US toiletries and shaving products group, yesterday unveiled
its Gillette Series line as it prepares to foray into the male grooming
product arena.
Developed at a cost of about Dollars 75m, the 14 products that will form the
core of a line of shaving preparations, deodorants, anti-perspirants and
after-shave conditioners, will be the first toiletries to carry the Gillette
name.
The company will spend Dollars 125m to market the products in the North
Atlantic market and it has applied for more than 20 patents to cover new
technologies used, including a novel gel-based deodorant which will be
rolled out through a grid applicator.
Although Gillette has a chequered track record in toiletries, the company
has a strong presence in the men's shaving market. It expects the Dollars
6bn male grooming market to grow to nearly Dollars 12bn by the end of the
century.
The move is the latest effort by Gillette to expand from its established
product base. In the summer it launched a Sensor razor for women and
acquired a majority stake in the biggest razor blade maker in China. Earlier
this month it bought Parker Pen for Pounds 285m (Dollars 564m).

FT  23 SEP 92 / Customs charter to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES paying excise and Customs duties can expect their costs of
compliance to fall and the efficiency with which claims are processed to
increase under a charter launched yesterday by Customs and Excise.
The Excise and Inland Customs Charter and the Value Added Tax Traders'
Charter both lay down a number of measures to improve the speed and
efficiency with which claims and inquiries are handled.
Achievements against the targets will be published in the Customs annual
report and there will be regular market research to help to improve the
quality of service.
The two new charters add to the framework established in the Taxpayers'
Charter published jointly with the Inland Revenue last year.
Sir Brian Unwin, chairman of Customs and Excise, said: 'There is enormous
emphasis on reducing the burdens on business and a renewed commitment to
reducing compliance costs.
'The biggest challenge is simplification,' he said.
'Traditionally we have had a confrontational culture,' he continued.
'We are trying to change to emphasis to being service-oriented.'
However, the charters were criticised by the National Union of Civil and
Public Servants and the Civil and Public Servants Association for not going
far enough and for failing to set out service standards for the taxpayer.
The unions said the VAT standard charter did not address service standards,
and that the government had both reduced the number of VAT staff and cut the
number of visits they paid to taxpayers.
The VAT charter says that staff will wear name badges, be polite and
considerate and send a written reply of any correspondance received.
It emphasises that officials will show if tax due has been over-declared as
well as under-declared.
The Excise and Inland Customs Charter says the agency is committed to
reducing the costs to business of complying with the requirements. It says
local offices will also set out their own service-related objectives.
Customs expects to have by November the findings of a market survey of
travellers.
It is commissioning another to survey excise and inland customers shortly,
and plans another on VAT traders for next year.

HOUSEHOLDS should receive higher compensation for poor service from water

Ofwat said that customers had made only limited use of the compensation
rules introduced in September 1989 when the 10 water authorities of England
and Wales were privatised.
Ofwat now recommends that the compensation rate should double to Pounds 10
if the water company fails to:
Keep service appointments.
Give written notice the day before any planned interruptions lasting more
than four hours.
Install a meter requested by a customer within 15 working days.
Repair leaks or bursts in strategic mains within 48 hours (not 72 hours as
now).
Restore supply after unplanned interruptions within 24 hours.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Accountant admits BCCI paper leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACCOUNTANT working on the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into the
collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International leaked a highly
confidential document to make money by insider dealing, an Old Bailey jury
heard yesterday.
Mr Mark Braley, who had been seconded from Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte for
the BCCI probe, admitted supplying a paper relating to Control Securities, a
company central to the SFO's investigation, to his co-defendant Mr Bernard
Lynch, a freelance accountant.
Mr Braley agreed this had been 'thoroughly wrong', but denied that he had
ever intended to undermine the SFO's investigation by leaking the document.
He and Mr Lynch both deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice by
interfering with SFO files and passing on information relating to the
inquiry.
The paper, which outlined the SFO's lines of inquiry into the company, was
the most sensitive material available to him and he was prepared to leak it
for financial gain, Mr Braley told his counsel, Mr Vivien Robinson QC.
However, he was unaware Mr Lynch would make the paper available to The
Times. When, after the leak, Mr Braley took part in the raid on the offices
of Control Securities, he felt 'absolutely sick' he said.
He had not intended to pre-judice the SFO investigation, he told Mr
Robinson.
The trial continues today.

SINGLE people living on their own account for more than a quarter of
households in Britain, according to official figures released today, John
Willman writes.
The 1991 General Household Survey also shows that almost two thirds of women
with dependent children are in work or seeking work and 70 per cent of
parents with children under five use some form of childcare.
The figures are among preliminary results published today by the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys. The survey, the most authoritative guide to
households in Great Britain, is based on interviews with 19,229 adults in
9,955 households.
The size of the average household in Great Britain has decreased from 2.91
in 1971 to 2.48 last year. That has been caused largely by more
single-person households, up from 17 per cent in 1971 to 26 per cent last
year.

formerly the UK Atomic Energy Authority - made a net profit of Pounds 16.8m
in the year to 31 March 1992, its first surplus since 1987.
Last year AEA reported a Pounds 40m net loss.
The 1991-92 results, announced yesterday, show that state-owned AEA is
expanding its sales of non-nuclear industrial technology rapidly to make up

Total turnover has been steady for the past five years at about Pounds 440m
a year, while the industrial division's sales rose from Pounds 85m in
1990-91 to Pounds 105m in 1991-92 and a projected Pounds 130m in 1992-93.
AEA is a candidate for privatisation in the mid 1990s - although there has
been speculation that the government may want to break it up first into
separate nuclear and non-nuclear businesses.
Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, said in an interview that he welcomed
privatisation 'though not at the expense of breaking up the organisation'.
He said: 'If it was broken up, we would lose many of our strengths, and I
would be fundamentally opposed to that.'
Mr Eyre said there were many examples of AEA's nuclear and non-nuclear
divisions working together - for instance, similar technology was used to
clean up chemical and radioactive wastes.
AEA is also expanding overseas, with international sales up 16 per cent to
Pounds 44m in 1991-92.
It has made its first overseas acquisition: O'Donnell, a specialist US
engineering consultancy bought for Pounds 2.2m. It will use AEA O'Donnell,
as it is now called, as a route into the American market.
Meanwhile the UK workforce continues to contract. The number of people
employed fell by 1,000 during the year to 9,750.

rules introduced in September 1989 when the 10 water authorities of England
and Wales were privatised.
Ofwat now recommends that the compensation rate should double to Pounds 10
if the water company fails to:
Keep service appointments.
Give written notice the day before any planned interruptions lasting more
than four hours.
Install a meter requested by a customer within 15 working days.
Repair leaks or bursts in strategic mains within 48 hours (not 72 hours as
now).
Restore supply after unplanned interruptions within 24 hours.
There are two changes to compensation: where sewers flood into a household,
customers may claim a rebate of the sewer charge part of their water and
sewerage bills. Also, most compensation payments will become automatic.
In 1991-92 water companies received only 1,078 claims and made only 887
payments under the Guaranteed Standards Scheme, Ofwat said.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said: 'An Ofwat survey has shown
that only about 13 per cent of customers are aware of the scheme's
existence. This suggests that under 2 per cent of customers eligible for
payments submit a claim. Automatic payment and higher compensation should
prove more helpful for customers.'
Mr Mike Carney, secretary of the Water Services Association, which
represents the 10 water and sewerage companies, said: 'We have been
discussing this for a long time with Ofwat. It is arguable whether automatic
payments are the best way of compensating customers, but so be it.
'The whole intention is that these sums should never need to be paid out,'
he added.

SWEDISH power utility firm Sydkraft said yesterday that emergency repairs to
the cooling systems of four faulty nuclear reactors would take three weeks,
Reuter reports from Stockholm.
Sydkraft said the closures, ordered by Sweden's national nuclear inspection
board on safety grounds, could cost it up to SKr20m (Pounds 2.1m).
Two of the boiling water reactors are at Sydkraft's fully owned Barseback
plant in the south-west, and two at the half-owned Oskarshamn on the east
coast. The oldest of Sweden's 12 nuclear reactors, they were built between
1972 and 1977 by ABB Atom, now a unit of Swiss-Swedish power and engineering
firm ABB Asea Brown Boveri.
A fifth reactor at Ringhals owned by state-controlled Vattenfall AB was also
ordered closed.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH FITTINGS Group yesterday reported its second successive half-yearly
loss but is paying a token interim dividend as an indication that it had
reached its nadir and would return to profit by the year end.
The group, which distributes valves, tubes and fittings, manufactures and
hires high pressure water products, and distributes non-ferrous metals,
announced a pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 1.02m
compared with a profit of Pounds 1.71m in the 1991 first half.
The group's position deteriorated during the second six months last year,
however, and it posted a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.96m for the full year
after heavy exceptional items.
The latest deficit, struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 622,000
(Pounds 374,000), came on turnover reduced to Pounds 40.4m (Pounds 42m).
Fully diluted losses per share were 3.48p compared with earnings of 5.37p.
However, Mr Brian Stanton, chief executive, said 'the company should run
into profit in the second half.' An interim dividend of 0.5p (1.375p) is
declared.

BRAMALEA, one of the three key property companies of Toronto's
Edper-Bronfman group, suffered a nine-month loss of CDollars 34m (USDollars
27.80m), or 38 cents a share, and warned that a further big write-down would
be taken in the fourth quarter.
Bramalea, caught in the North American property crisis, owns residential and
commercial properties and a large land-bank. It would not say how big the
fourth-quarter write-down would be, but analysts estimate it at up to
CDollars 500m.
The company has proposed a five-year restructuring designed to reduce total
debt from CDollars 4.5bn to CDollars 2bn and has already sold assets and
written down some carrying values.
Its bankers have agreed to defer principal and interest payments on land and
other non-revenue producing assets, but holders of CDollars 524m of secured
debentures are resisting a plan that would pay them in equity and give them
almost 50 per cent ownership.
Bramalea's revenues totalled CDollars 589m in the nine months, down 4 per
cent from a year earlier. The company reported a profit of CDollars 4.3m, or
2 cents a share in the 1991 period.

restructuring

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USG, the parent company of US Gypsum, yesterday announced it had reached
agreement in principle with two of its three creditor groups on a debt
restructuring plan which would involve it making a 'pre-packaged' Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing.
Under a pre-packaged scheme, a company reaches agreement on a restructuring
with its creditors before filing for bankruptcy, minimising the time it
spends under the authority of the court.
USG's filing would only involve the parent company with no effect on trade
creditors of its operating subsidiaries or the asbestos health claims
against US Gypsum.
USG, which ran into trouble after loading up with debt to fend off a 1988
takeover, said it had agreed with its senior bondholders' committee and
agents of its banks on a restructuring which would reduce the face value of
its debt from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 1.6bn.
Some 82 per cent of the equity would be owned by holders of 13 1/4 per cent
senior subordinated bonds, whose creditor committee has accepted the plan.
Some 15 per cent would be held by the junior creditors, who have rejected
the scheme.

DOWNING Street confirmed last night the European Community summit called by
Prime Minister John Major had been fixed for October 16, writes Ivo Dawnay,
Political Correspondent.
The agenda is intended to allow leaders to 'take stock' of issues arising
from the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty and turmoil in the
exchange markets.
Officials said the meeting in London would include talks on widespread
disenchantment with the European Commission's interference in national
issues and workings of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
There are hopes Denmark will be ready by the summit to indicate how it will
proceed towards ratification of the treaty, after its No vote in a June
referendum.
Mr Major is due to visit President Francois Mitterrand in Paris, possibly
next week, and is expected to meet Mr Poul Schluter the Danish premier, in
London before the summit.

FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Swedes untie welfare apron strings -
Efforts to adapt to fresh realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A SWEDISH all-party agreement on government cuts and higher taxes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
finalised in the early hours of yesterday morning - represents a significant
break with the welfare state attitudes that have dominated the country since
the 1930s.
Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, told the Financial Times last night that
although the 'vision of the Maastricht treaty was in doubt' at the moment,
he wanted to see Sweden - when it becomes a European Community member - as
one of the 'core countries in economic and monetary union'.
With all-party support for underpinning the exchange rate and a continuing
broad political consensus over Sweden's EC membership application, he is
drawing considerable comfort from the readiness of his Social Democratic
opponents to swallow fundamental changes in the structure of the welfare
state as a price to be paid in adapting the country to the new realities of
global markets.
The Stockholm bourse share index fell 1.5 per cent yesterday in active
trading and short-term interest rates rose as the Riksbank, the country's
central bank, maintained a 50 per cent marginal lending rate to the banks.
However, capital appeared to be flowing back into the country.
The continuing unease in Sweden is partly a reflection of the wider
turbulence on the European money markets. It is still hoped that the package
hammered out at the weekend between the four-party centre-right coalition
government and the Social Democratic opposition, aimed at eliminating a
growing structural deficit over the next few years, will make clear the
determination of the government to deal with the country's underlying
economic difficulties.
The country's old social consensus, based on high public spending and high
taxation administered by a powerful centralising state, and that once-famous
Swedish model of comprehensive welfare provision, is being gradually
abandoned. Next year old-age pensions and child benefit are to be cut in
value. Housing subsidies are being reduced by as much as SKr3bn.
Swedes who are sick will receive no benefit for their first day of absence
from work and the amount they get thereafter will be less than before, with
a saving to the government of SKr4.5bn.
Sweden's foreign aid budget is also being cut by SKr1.5bn to 0.9 per cent of
gross national product from 1.0 per cent.
The cuts in government spending will amount to Skr18.9bn worth of savings
next year with a further Skr8.7bn coming through higher taxes (mainly on
petrol and tobacco) to strengthen the revenue side of the budget.
The total effect in on next year's budget will be Skr27.6bn but the impact
will rise to SKr40.6bn by 1997.
The all-party agreement also makes an important long-term commitment to
transform Sweden's health and injury insurance system by shifting its
enormous and mounting costs from the shoulders of the taxpayers to employers
and trade unions with a saving to the state of Skr50bn, 3 per cent of gross
domestic product.
This reform is expected to go through in the mid-1990s with broad political
support. Mr Bildt sees this long-term change as opening up the huge public
sector to private market forces and going a long way to begin the necessary
reduction in the size of Sweden's public spending as a proportion of gross
domestic product which at 56 per cent is the highest in the developed world.
His government has been forced to make some sacrifices in its free-market
programmes. A moratorium has been imposed on the further privatisation of
state companies for the rest of the present parliament. A plan to abolish
the wealth tax has been postponed until 1994, as has a proposal to reduce
the tax on capital to 25 per cent from 30 per cent.
But under the remorseless pressure of outside markets, Sweden's political
establishment has been forced to accept that the country must adapt to the
realities of economic and political integration with western Europe.
It has taken four weeks of severe turbulence on the markets and dangers to
the fixed exchange rate of the krona to bring about what Mr Bengt Dennis,
the Riksbank governor, has been seeking.
As Mr Bildt argues: 'A few weeks ago I saw severe troubles in parliament on
economic policy. Now we will have a comfortable majority for what needs to
be done.'
Under unprecedented conditions, the right-left divisions of Swedish politics
have been swept aside, albeit temporarily.
A poll carried out by Sifo found 76 per cent of Swedes in favour of the
crisis package.
Such popular support for the all-party agreement suggests the end of the old
Swedish model will not be a cause for national mourning.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN, which holds the EC presidency, yesterday called on member states to
rally round the single market project as an antidote to turmoil elsewhere in
the Community.
Mr Richard Needham, British trade minister, told internal market ministers
they should make a special effort to complete the barrier-free market and
ensure its effective implementation beyond 1992.
He said afterwards the project was 'crucial to gaining, maintaining and
building on the goodwill of our people'.
But earlier, ministers became embroiled in a familiar but fruitless debate
about the working language of the proposed European trademark office. The
office is supposed to provide a single agency for EC companies to register
their trademarks.
Ministers agreed yesterday EC leaders should discuss a second problem - site
of the office - at the Edinburgh summit. Similar problems with other new
European agencies will also be addressed then.
The 12 were unable to settle the dispute about whether the office should
accept trademark applications in any of the nine official EC languages or
adopt a simpler and cheaper system based on the use of English, French and
German. The Commission has estimated a nine-tongue solution could cost as
much as Ecu112m (Pounds 80m).

FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Waigel tries to soothe markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, said last night he saw no need
for 'further adjustment' after last week's turmoil on the currency markets.
His attempt to calm the markets was made in a speech at the IMF annual
meeting in Washington after a day of rumours of a further impending
realignment in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Mr Waigel referred to the suspension of sterling and the Italian lira from
the ERM and the French Yes vote on the Maastricht treaty. The French vote,
he said, had taken an important element of uncertainty from the markets.
Then he added: 'After last week's decisions, there is no further need for
adjustment, as a look at economic fundamentals shows.'
Emerging later from the IMF meeting, Mr Waigel laughed off questions about a
possible realignment of currencies in the ERM. 'I never comment about
marriages and currency movements,' he told reporters.
But he went on to say there was no good reason for speculators to attack the
franc. 'French fundamentals are in order,' he said.
In his IMF speech, Mr Waigel pledged that Germany would continue to meet
fully its obligations in the European Monetary System.
He repeated that German interest rates were not, in his view, at the root of
the currency market's upheaval. 'German capital market interest rates are,
at 7.6 per cent, the lowest in Europe, barring Switzerland; the same goes
for money market rates. The capital movements into the D-Mark obviously have
other causes,' he said.
In a day of rumours of further currency changes, finance ministry officials
visiting Washington for the IMF session scuttled surreptitiously from
meeting to meeting, anxiously skirting clusters of journalists trying to
ambush them.
Gossip of impossible precision insisted that Mr Michel Sapin, France's
finance minister, would announce a realignment at the crack of dawn today,
after flying back to Paris from Washington.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Energy Trust slow to gain
speed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was going to be one of Britain's answers to global warming. Plans for an
Energy Saving Trust to look at ways of using energy more efficiently
featured in the Conservative Party general election manifesto in April. A
month later, Michael Howard, environment minister, called the Trust 'an
important initiative to protect the environment', and made much of it at the
Rio Earth Summit in June.
But five months after the first declarations, little appears to have moved.
The Trust still lacks a chairman and its pilot projects, which were going to
invest Pounds 6m in the first year, are on hold.
The purpose of the proposed Trust - in reality a company limited by
guarantee - is to search out investments for British Gas or the 12 regional
electricity companies that will help their customers to use energy more
efficiently.
The first three pilot schemes were chosen to encourage:
More efficient use of gas by low-income households.
Purchase of more efficient heating when households replace old systems.
Investment in small-scale generators for both heat and power, in hostels,
blocks of flats, and small factories.
The pilots were expected to cost Pounds 6m in the first year of operation.
British Gas - which spends around Pounds 10m per year on other energy saving
schemes - would be allowed to pass that through to the gas consumer, adding
some 30p a year to bills, Ofgas estimates.
One of the Trust's other roles would be to help the regulators Ofgas and
Offer - which supervise the increases in gas and electricity bills  - judge
whether projects merited such 'cost pass through'.
There have been several reasons why progress has been slight, although
British Gas expects the Trust to be running by next May, just within the
original timetable. First, the lack of a chairman has prevented the
appointment of a full-time chief executive or a board of directors.
The Department of the Environment, which is setting up the Trust through its
Energy Efficiency Office (EEO), says the appointment is 'a political matter'
and will not comment on the apparent delay. Part of the problem may be that
the Trust's creators have set their sights high. Colin Myerscough of the EEO
says that the Trust has been looking for a 'high status' person possibly
with business experience who 'can talk to the top executives of the
utilities as an equal'. Luring that kind of worldly negotiator to public
sector posts has never been easy.
Delays also seem to have arisen when the original gas remit was broadened.
John Dawkin, Ofgas's deputy director general, says: 'It is moving more
slowly than we would have wished partly because the government wanted a
wider brief.' He adds that momentum may have been lost when it moved to the
EEO. In the long run he expects the wider remit to be fruitful.
Even with a board in place, questions remain about the Trust's likely
effectiveness - and who will benefit. For a start, why should the utilities
encourage their customers to use less energy, if this leads to lower
revenues? In Dawkin's view: 'British Gas will certainly suggest schemes
where it doesn't lose out. One could look at ways of getting round that, but
at the moment the priority is getting started.'
However, both he and Myerscough suggest that in the long run the schemes are
to their advantage because gas and electricity compete when consumers
re-equip their homes. It is clear, though, that in the depths of a recession
it may take a long time before householders take up this new technology.
It seems likely too that the consumer will foot the bill for projects which
get the Trust's backing. According to Myerscough: 'The utilities have made
clear that they want most of the costs passed on - and the Trust's approval
could encourage the regulator to allow that.'
Ofgas responds that 'we will have to be sure, before approving projects,
that it is in the benefit of British Gas's customers'.
Despite the delays, those involved remain confident. According to Dawkin: 'I
don't think it will solve Britain's problems in one fell swoop but it can
make a significant contribution.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Getting to the root - Is
fluoridated water good for teeth? / A debate still raging after nearly 40
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most emotive issue in environmental dentistry - whether to add fluoride
to public water supplies - is back on the agenda of local politics in the
UK.
This month the health authorities in two regions, Strathclyde in the west of
Scotland and Yorkshire in the north of England, launched separate campaigns
to introduce fluoridation for a total of 5m people at a cost of Pounds 13m.
To succeed, they have to win over a substantial majority of local
councillors in the face of a vocal anti-fluoride lobby.
Some opponents believe 'mass medication' is wrong in principle because it
infringes the rights of the individual. Others have linked fluoridation with
health problems ranging from headaches and indigestion to brittle bones and
cancer.
However, bodies representing mainstream medical and dental opinion are
unanimously in favour. The World Health Organisation, British Medical
Association, American Medical Association, General Dental Council, Royal
College of Physicians and many similar organisations have put out statements
supporting fluoridation. They say drinking fluoride at the recommended level
of one part per million of water brings no health risks.
The only proven ill effect of fluoride is 'dental fluorosis', a mottling of
the teeth that occurs occasionally in places that have very high natural
levels in drinking water - well above the recommended 1ppm.
Comprehensive reviews of possible links between fluoridation and cancer were
published by the UK government in 1985 and the US government in 1991. They
found no health risks. As James Mason, US assistant secretary of health, put
it last year, the risks 'are so small that they have been impossible to
detect in epidemiological studies to date. In contrast, the benefits are
great and easy to detect'.
Fluoride reduces the solubility of tooth enamel in acid and can help to
remineralise enamel that has started to decay. Although children with
growing teeth receive the most benefit, there is evidence that regular
fluoride helps to strengthen adults' teeth too.
Regular surveys of children's dental health, co-ordinated by the British
Association for the Study of Community Dentistry, show great geographical
differences, which are clearly related to fluoridation. Average DMFT scores
(decayed, missing and filled teeth) vary by a factor of more than five
between the best areas and the worst (see table).
Despite the proven medical benefits - and the fact that opinion polls have
shown public support rising steadily, with 79 per cent in favour of
fluoridation in a NOP survey this year - only 6m people in the UK drink
water with fluoride added. A further 2m live in areas with naturally high
fluoride levels. In other words, 15 per cent of the UK population benefits
from fluoridation, compared with more than half of the US population.
Fluoridation is most widespread in the West Midlands and Tyneside. Nowhere
in Scotland, the London area or the industrial north-west of England has
fluoride been added.
Anti-fluoride campaigners say it is up to individuals to administer the
chemical to themselves or their children, in the form of fluoride tablets,
rinses or toothpaste. But health authorities argue that poorer families, who
have the worst dental health, are least likely to do so.
The UK government pays for agreed fluoridation schemes. The necessary
equipment, which pumps fluoride solution into the mains, costs about Pounds
300,000. The capital cost per head of population varies according to the
number of people served by each treatment plant but is typically in the
region of Pounds 1 to Pounds 5. Running costs are 15p to 50p per person per
year.
The 1985 Fluoridation Act provided a legal framework for water authorities
or companies to add fluoride at the request of local health authorities. It
overturned the 1983 Scottish court judgment in what became known as the
'toothless granny' case: after a long legal battle, Catherine McCall, a
Glasgow pensioner and anti-fluoride campaigner, obtained a ruling that water
authorities did not have the necessary powers to add fluoride to public
supplies.
Although the Act was intended to lead to more widespread fluoridation, no
significant new schemes have got under way since 1985.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Resentment grows over Spanish
parkland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUELINE MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visitors to southern Spain tend to envy the people living on the edges of
one of Europe's largest and best-known wetlands, home to flamingoes, eagles
and lynxes. But in the eyes of the local inhabitants, the 77,260-hectare
Coto Donana National Park is a job-stealer and a waste of natural resources.
Rice and strawberry farmers are under pressure from conservation groups to
reduce their irrigation and use of pesticides. Traditional occupations have
been lost. And even ecotourism is almost impossible, as most non-scientists
are barred from entering the park.
However, a recent report by the European Commission, called A Strategy for
the Sustainable Socio-economic Development of Coto Donana and its
Surroundings, recommends that Pta50bn (Pounds 270m) of EC and Spanish
government money be invested in the area over the next eight years, to help
create jobs. Eduardo Crespo, deputy director of the state-run national park,
says that the money would not go directly to the Coto Donana.
'This park has a sufficient budget, probably the highest budget of national
parks in Europe (at Pta 1bn-1.5bn a year excluding salaries and overheads).
The money is needed in the surroundings - in the seven or eight towns around
Donana - to create different sorts of enterprises.'
The investment, says Crespo, would be in infrastructure, such as roads and
sewage works, to make the area more attractive to private investors, and in
training and education programmes for the local population. In this way, he
hopes that the villagers can be won over to the park.
The task is a hard one: local anger flared into violence two years ago when
conservationists protested at plans to build a Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m)
tourist development, called the Costa Donana, which would have provided
construction and hotel jobs.
Javier Hidalgo, who owns a sherry bodega in Sanlucar de Barrameda to the
east of the park, says: 'For many years Donana was a private estate for the
aristocracy to hunt in, with benefits for the local people of keeping
cattle, fishing, egg-collecting, beekeeping, collecting sticks to support
the vines, gamekeeping - the local people had jobs. Now the native
population in Donana has disappeared.'
Farmers, attempting to diversify out of olives or grapes into more
profitable crops such as strawberries, rice or flowers, have been strongly
criticised for using too much water and too many pesticides, endangering the
wildlife. Six years ago more than 20,000 birds died in an outbreak of
botulism related to pesticides.
The report recommends retaining the rice farming, but says that the use of
pesticides should be controlled by the regional government. It suggests that
the Costa Donana development should not be built, but that more
environment-friendly schemes could provide work.
Andrea Gardiazabal of SEO, Spain's ornithological society, believes that the
opposition to the park is fading. A recent symposium of local villagers to
discuss the report showed less hostility to the recommendation that the
Costa Donana resort should not be built.
As Crespo says: 'It's a question of how long-range your thinking is: if
you're only thinking of construction jobs for the next five years, you're
against the report. If you're thinking of national use of resources over a
period of 50 years, then you'll follow the report.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / Management: Bureaucrats are called to account - Michael
Smith assesses the Civil Service salary scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The teacups in Whitehall must have rattled more loudly than usual when John
Major announced details of his Citizen's Charter a year ago. Every civil
servant was to be affected; not only were they expected to provide a better
service, their pay would depend on it.
The government made clear that it wanted a rapid extension of performance
pay and more delegation of decisions on pay to departmental level.
Performance pay has long been a feature of the private sector: recent
surveys have indicated that more than two-thirds of private sector companies
have performance pay schemes for at least part of their white-collar
workforce. However, the link between pay and performance in the public
sector has, until now, been relatively limited. The Citizen's Charter
proposals amounted to the most significant reform in a decade in the way the
pay of 500,000 civil servants was to be determined.
While the politicians had a broad view of what they wanted to achieve, the
detailed work fell in large part to pay negotiators in the Treasury. One
year on, as the Civil Service pay round ends, these negotiators should be
reasonably satisfied with their efforts.
Initially, all five of the main trade unions either opposed or had strong
reservations about increasing performance pay and the devolution of
bargaining. Four of the unions have now agreed to deals incorporating both
elements; the fifth, the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, has tacitly agreed
to performance pay from next year.
From the government's point of view, the price of the unions' agreement has
not been high, particularly when compared with the experience of many
private sector employers: higher than normal pay deals often have to be paid
in industry in the year that new bargaining arrangements are introduced.
Virtually all the Civil Service deals this year have been around 4 per cent.
While the increase is higher than inflation, it is still at the bottom end
of what is permissible under a long-term pay formula - linking pay to the
middle 50 per cent of rises in the private sector. In effect, little if
anything has been paid for the changes.
There are three reasons why all of this suggests competence, rather than
miracle working, on the part of the Treasury and Inland Revenue negotiators.
Few employees want to take industrial action during a recession, however
much they may oppose their employers' wishes. Only one Civil Service union,
the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, seriously threatened
industrial action but was unable to win members' support.
The new Civil Service pay system is considerably less of a threat to unions
than many schemes in the private sector. Some employers bringing in
performance-related pay have sought, at the same time, to derecognise
unions. In the Civil Service there has never been any suggestion of this.
Under revised long-term agreements, the unions will continue to negotiate
national pay rises each year. Civil servants will depend for only some of
their annual rise on performance and the rest will come automatically, as a
result of the national negotiations.
The new system has been sold by union leaders to members as an improvement
over an earlier, more limited scheme introduced in the late 1980s. Says
Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services
Association, the largest Civil Service union: 'Under the previous system,
civil servants generally had to wait five years for a payment. Now there is
something every year.'
Union leaders have had a strong interest in playing down the less
advantageous aspects of the scheme, knowing that, ultimately, the government
was prepared to force the changes through.
In the case of most junior and middle-ranking civil servants,
performance-related payments will merely replace increments that they would
have received under the previous systems, equivalent to between 4 and 6 per
cent of salary.
None the less, there will be something extra, generally a further percentage
point, for civil servants whose performance is judged to be in 'box two'.
There are five boxes altogether on assessment forms, ranging from box one
for excellent, to box five for unsatisfactory.
Box one performers will receive a further 2 percentage points. Managers will
also have the discretion to award one-off payments, which are not
consolidated into salary. The downside for civil servants is that box five
performers and even some in box four will receive no performance award at
all.
For senior civil servants - including senior professionals and what used to
be known as assistant secretaries and principals - performance pay will be
more at the discretion of managers and structures will be less rigid.
That at least is the theory. The test of the new systems has yet to come.
Their success will depend in large part on the ability of departments to
develop performance appraisal systems which are both seen as fair by staff
and are robust enough to indicate whether performance really is being
improved.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Management: One small step for Manpower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mitchell Fromstein, head of the world's biggest employment services company,
Manpower International, was in Havant, Hampshire, last week to witness a
small revolution for the UK labour market.
The deal between the UK Manpower subsidiary and IBM that brought Fromstein
from Milwaukee involved just 92 employees.
But unlike most of Manpower's temporary staffing arrangements, IBM was
handing over to it complete responsibility for the staffing and management
of a new national centre for service calls.
Instead of merely supplying, say, 10 computer operators to a company for
three months, Manpower in Havant is itself deciding the staffing and
supervising requirements for the service call centre, following performance
guidelines laid down by IBM.
What Manpower calls 'managed staff contracts' are not entirely new, indeed
the first one - involving the manufacture of ice cream - was established
four years ago.
There are now nearly 30 in the UK - including all non-professional staff at
the Department of Social Security in Leeds - and more than 100 in the US.
As in normal temporary contracts, staff are directly employed by Manpower
but usually stay for much longer periods with a single employer on the
longer-term managed contracts.
But for Manpower, there are two especially significant points about the
Havant deal. First, it has been struck with IBM, a company with a
highly-developed human resource management strategy of its own. Second, it
involved a brand new unit rather than just taking over responsibility for
the human 'software' of an existing plant.
The deal is on cost-plus terms for Manpower but IBM manager Mike Coleman
says that it will provide significant savings for his company in cash and
management time.
Manpower says that the request to take over more and more responsibility for
units of staff is market led. 'It wasn't our idea but the thing is now
starting to mushroom - we've got about 50 projects in the pipeline in the
UK,' says Fromstein. The 'managed staff contract' has come of age.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Management: Quick bite for lunch when you're Russian - Leyla
Boulton continues our series on the art of business entertaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gogol, the great 19th century writer, combined descriptions of elaborate
Russian cuisine with a satire of Russian traditions such as its bureaucracy.
Business entertaining in modern Russia runs along similar lines.
In the latest innovation of the Russian tax inspector - as absurd as the
content of Gogol's play, The Government Inspector - you can only set
entertaining expenses against your tax bill if your guest signs a statement
naming his company and confirming that you fed him on business.
This is partly to do with the fact that despite a big increase over the past
few years of decent places to eat out in Moscow, business lunching remains a
concept imported from the west. As Russia switches back to capitalism after
seven decades of communism, a lot of the power lunching in Moscow is still
done with or between foreigners.
The older generation Russians are more used to the old system where the main
official entertaining was done by state trading and industrial organisations
at long banquet tables. At such banquets, which are held increasingly by
new-style businessmen, the vodka flows freely, endless toasts are proposed
and business deals are elaborated in strolls out in the corridor.
But the old guard is by no means averse to being taken out for a tete-a-tete
lunch or supper.
A modicum of tact, however, is required, particularly if the invitation is
being extended to Russian officials by foreign women in a country where
notions of male gallantry are still very conservative: women can do the
heaviest jobs but are not supposed to carry heavy objects or pick up tabs.
At the other end of the scale, western-orientated 'yuppies' in government
and business will tell you they are too busy to sacrifice two hours in the
middle of the day to be softened up. 'You foreigners like going out to
lunch, but can't you just stop by the office to tell me what you want,' is
the response I have heard more than once.
One restaurant that tries to cater for such attitudes and still pull in
customers is the Marco Polo which advertises 40-minute business lunches for
Dollars 18 (Pounds 10) a head.
The basically alien nature of business lunches is underlined by the fact
that most of the new restaurants are joint ventures with foreign partners or
Russian restaurants which charge hard currency.
Some of the most prestigious and expensive establishments are attached to
hotels managed with foreign participation, like the Savoy or Metropol, where
a three course meal with wine will cost at least Dollars 100 per person.
Purely Russian establishments like the Traktir Arcadia, which offers decent
food and drink in roubles for a tenth of the price charged at the Metropol
across the road, are still few and far between.
The Kropotkin 36, the first private, Russian-owned restaurant in Moscow and
still a favourite for its quiet atmosphere and good service, will be more
expensive, costing upwards of Dollars 30 a head.
In an illustration of just how open Russia is to a mish-mash of western
influences, American-style breakfasts are also catching on - ranging from
the Germanic buffet at the Penta Hotel (Dollars 25 per person) to the lovely
setting of the Metropol breakfast room (Dollars 35).

FT  23 SEP 92 / Foreign Affairs: Fast train to China - Chris Patten faces
his moment of truth in determining how Hong Kong is governed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A familiar face flashed briefly across British TV screens last week, just as
the monetary whirlwind was gathering speed. So familiar that many viewers
will hardly have noticed it. Six months ago, after all, the sight was an
everyday one: Mr Chris Patten, then chairman of the Conservative party,
standing beside the prime minister.
The sad sequel is well known. Mr Patten's triumph as party manager was
marred by the loss of his own parliamentary seat, and he was sent off to
govern Hong Kong. So what was he doing breakfasting with the prime minister,
who surely had other things than Hong Kong on his mind last week? He had
returned to London because in Mr Patten's judgment the affairs of Hong Kong
merited a spot of prime ministerial attention.
You are probably thinking that things in Hong Kong must be pretty bad if the
British government had to be bothered with them in such a week. Not a bit of
it. The colony is booming. The deep gloom into which it was thrown by events
in Tiananmen Square on June 4 1989 has almost entirely dissipated. For those
events, traumatic though they were, did not usher in the long era of
repression and retreat that many expected. The Chinese central government
remains essentially authoritarian, but it has allowed capitalism to proceed
apace in the provinces, and nowhere faster than in Guangdong, the province
that borders Hong Kong. As China's economy grows, Hong Kong has thrived as
never before, being the conduit for foreign trade and investment.
That leaves Mr Patten in a much happier situation as governor than he would
be now as a British cabinet minister. Stamp duty and other indirect forms of
taxation are pouring in. The public sector is showing a healthy surplus. He
himself, as the first politician to govern the colony in its 150-year
history, has, according to opinion polls, won almost universal popularity.
He has done this by his direct, meet-the- people approach - a contrast with
the aloof dignity adopted by previous governors.
So why should he need to bother Mr Major? In the first place he knows from
personal experience that opinion polls are fickle and honeymoons do not
last. A fresh face, a glamorous teenage daughter, a witticism here and there
can make you popular for a few months. But soon comes the moment when you
have to take real decisions. These can seldom measure up to people's hopes,
and if they are to make any real difference they are bound to upset vested
interests.
Mr Patten knows, from his experience as a junior Northern Ireland minister
in the mid-1980s, that when interests are sharply polarised it is not only
impossible to please everybody but dangerous to please anyone, since one
side's admiration is enough to damn you with the other.
The moment of truth he has set himself is now two weeks away. On October 7
he will address the colony's legislature, and lay out his programme for the
last five years of British rule in Hong Kong. The date falls in the middle
of the Tory party conference, but even so Mr Patten's officials are hoping
he will grab a few headlines in the UK and locally.
Of course he can only achieve that if he keeps the content of the speech a
surprise, but he expects it to cause considerable 'reverberations', and
wanted to be sure of full support from Mr Major before finalising the draft.
Reverberations will no doubt come from many quarters, and notably from Mr
Martin Lee's United Democrats, who, having won most of the directly elected
seats in last year's elections to the Legislative Council (LegCo), believe
they should now join the Executive Council (ExCo).
(The former body has to approve all legislation and the colony's budget,
though it has no power to initiate expenditure. The latter is an advisory
body consisting of permanent civils servants, plus some appointed pillars of
the community.)
Mr Patten, though he certainly has more respect than his predecessors did
for Mr Lee's democratic credentials, has dropped several hints that he does
not see things this way. In his eyes the logic of the Hong Kong
constitution, and the best hope of enabling it to function democratically
under the Basic Law after 1997, lies in a clear separation of powers between
executive and legislature. He believes the opposition would be better
advised to concentrate on broadening the electoral base of LegCo and using
it to check and supervise the government, rather than on securing
representation in ExCo, which is in any case only an advisory body, not a
cabinet.
The reverberations that count, however, will be those in Beijing, to which
Mr Patten will make his first visit as governor immediately after the
speech. The Chinese have already given many signs of displeasure about his
appointment, which they have taken, rightly or wrongly, as a sign that
Britain's Hong Kong policy has changed and will be less accommodating than
it was. Indeed, some Chinese officials have made a direct link between the
financing of Hong Kong's new airport and their fears that Mr Patten will
appoint people to ExCo whom they regard as subversives, such as Mr Lee.
On that point Mr Patten has called their bluff, by agreeing to let the
airport be financed essentially in the way Beijing says it prefers. Although
Hong Kong officials believe this is a less good deal for Hong Kong, they do
not see the issue as important enough to give China extra leverage over
political decisions.
The crunch issue, however, is likely to be the manner of election, and hence
the composition, of LegCo after 1995. Up to now both Britain and China have
set considerable store by the notion known as the 'through train', under
which the LegCo elected in 1995 would remain in office through the handover
of sovereignty and up to 1999. The Chinese interpret this as giving them a
veto over its composition.
Mr Patten is keeping his own cards close to his chest. He cannot increase
the number of directly elected seats (20) without China's consent, but he
could expand the 'functional constituencies' which elect 30 members, and
many of which at present have small electorates. He could also, more
radically, allow the 'election committee', a new body which is to choose the
remaining 10 members, to be elected in its turn by the people - like the
electoral college in US presidential elections. This would create a LegCo
half of whose members would be democratically chosen.
It is certainly not what the Chinese want. In their eyes the purpose of the
election committee is to enable the executive to pack LegCo with its own
nominees. But it would not be incompatible with the letter of the Basic Law.
If that, or something like it, is what Mr Patten announces on October 7,
stand by for reverberations of a seismic order. China will probably threaten
to derail the train and hold elections for a new LegCo in 1997, using its
own rules.
That thought would have been enough to deter previous governors, but Mr
Patten is not easily intimidated. He knows that China's rulers hold most of
the cards, but he still has nearly five years in which to convince them that
Hong Kong itself also has a hand to play.

On my return from holiday in Poland at the weekend, I was not surprised to
find that the pound had devalued - or floated as I gather the official term
is. It had, while I was away, lost significantly against the Polish zloty, a
currency not known for its own strength. Something must be amiss, I thought.

Sir, I think it is about time for some resignations from the ranks of the
Treasury officials who advised the chancellor on (a) the rate at which
sterling entered the ERM and (b) the purchase of about Pounds 7bn of foreign
currency to support this rate.
The path to a working European monetary union is simply bound to be hard
because of our different cultures and national loyalties.
Nevertheless, nothing has changed from last week and the idea of a united
and integrated Europe remains a necessity if the majority of Europeans wants
their children to live in a strong and civilised continent. This will not
come easily and the events of the past week should not come as a surprise,
but our political leaders and electorates are either prepared to grapple
with these discomforts for the next 10 years, or else be submerged by
periodic upheavals caused by national self-interest. As if the wars of
1914-18 and 1939-45 were not sufficient punishment.
If European leaders keep calm, we shall all learn from this recent hiatus
and grow even stronger, but there are undoubtedly more heartbreaks on the
horizon.
I disagree with your editorial 'Dancing amid the ruins' (September 19) in
which you imply that the prime minister, Mr John Major, is tired and
discredited. I just point the finger at the competence of the monetary and
economic advice which both he and the chancellor and his predecessors have
been receiving.

Sir, It may be that history never repeats itself, but the current sterling
crisis seems uncannily like a variant of a previous one: that accompanying
the end of the gold standard in 1931-32.
Some quotes: '. . .the speculator who sold sterling was betting on a
certainty once its stability was in question. . .(on September 21 1931) an
act suspending the gold standard was rushed through parliament. The value of
the pound fell by more than a quarter on the foreign exchange. Otherwise
nothing happened. . .the anti-climax took everyone by surprise. Passfield
spoke for all his late colleagues when he complained: 'Nobody told us we
could do this'. . .This was the end of an age.' (A J P Taylor, English
History 1914 -1945).
'A large number of countries. . .followed Britain off gold. By April 1932. .
.the financial crisis was over. Bank rate was steadily reduced. . .The
industrial depression was at its worst in the third quarter of 1932, but
thenceforth all indices showed a strong upward trend, leading to the boom of
1937.' (Sidney Pollard The Development of The British Economy 1914-1980).
To replace 1931 by 1992, and the gold standard by the ERM may be facile.
But, so far, the parallels are striking.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Both John Plender ('Theory of bond investment culture comes unstuck',
September 19) and Lex on the same day, worry that the UK's exit from the ERM
will lead to higher inflation.
It won't. Henry Kaufman (quoted in Anthony Harris's column, September 21)
gives the reason: 'Devaluations would probably be inflationary if European
economies were pushing against capacity constraints. However, the reality is
the opposite.'
Short-term rates in the US have fallen to 3 per cent and long-term rates in
the US have fallen to 7.3 per cent and US inflation continues to fall.
Worldwide lay-offs continue, with General Motors, Siemens Medical and
Swissair recently announcing cuts.
Dr Kaufman again: 'The Fed (read: any central bank ex-Germany) continued to
maintain. . .vigilance against inflation. . .in the context of a dispirited
economy. . . .This took on some of the aspects of fighting the last war.'
Cut rates. Come back inflation (when and if you can), all is forgiven]

Sir, May I be maverick enough to suggest that unwittingly, amid the chaos,
the government may have achieved a near ideal policy mix (at the cost of
putting back European integration a few years). By continuing in the ERM
until now, inflationary pressures have been dramatically reduced thereby
softening the inflationary blow from the downward float that has occurred;
by leaving the ERM now when Germany's interest rate needs are still
projected to be radically different from our own, we have set ourselves up
for lower interest rates - as shown by yesterday's cut to 9 per cent - and a
sustained period of low inflationary growth. Of course the government still
has the small matter of re-establishing confidence in its economic policies
and on the foreign exchanges, but since it is at the beginning of a
five-year term and is clearly committed to low inflation (whether inside or
outside the ERM), maybe that confidence will return surprisingly quickly.
Would that chaos always led to such good results]

<TEXT>
Sir, May I congratulate Britain on its stylish withdrawal from the ERM. For
too long the British have been obsessed with interest rates to the detriment
of the real problems of the economy.
Monetary policy is to the economy what petrol is to a car: if there is no
car, the fuel is no good.
In Japan when there is a recession a company first seeks to improve its
productivity; second to cut costs; third to encourage government spending;
and only finally, interest rates. In the UK, industry responds in the exact
opposite order. It concentrates on the symptoms of a weak economy - high
interest rates - and ignores the source of its problems, inefficiency.
The Japanese may have it wrong, though I am far from convinced that the
British way is right. But those who wish to follow the German model should
be warned that an independent central bank in the UK will not provide either
a stable or strong currency unless it mirrors the realities of the economy.
This is determined less by bankers than by the behaviour of governments,
companies and consumers. It is they who are independent - or rather
inter-dependent - and who pay the piper.
Britain must now quickly find its own way to do things.

And finally, some good news for Albania - the British comic actor Norman
Wisdom, now 77, has announced that he is returning to films and hopes to
make some wacky television situation comedies.
One of the more startling things Observer discovered in travelling to
Albania before the collapse of communism was that Norman Wisdom was a
national comic hero, thanks to the Albanian state television being unable to
afford much else.
Lucky old Albania.

It's a funny old world inhabited by Britain's top mandarins, at least in
their off-duty hours. Their recreations vary from 'eccentricities' (Robin
Birch, Social Security department) to 'collecting domestic anachronisms'
(Robert Venables, Charity Commission), according to the first edition of
Dod's Whitehall Companion, the new Who's Who for Whitehall.
The prime minister's principal private secretary Alex Allan is a 'deadhead'
(or follower of the US rock group Grateful Dead). Professor Anthony Hawkins,
director of fisheries research at the Scottish Office, is into whippet
racing. And Ian Burns, head of the Home Office Police Department, likes
'adventurous gardening' - whatever that is.
There are at least two couples in the book. Rosalind Gilmore, who is
chairman of the Building Societies Commission, fortunately shares the same
recreations as her husband Brian (a big shot at the social security
department): music and Greece.
John Rimington, director-general of the Health and Safety Executive, likes
walking, gardening and watching cricket. Stella Rimington, meanwhile, does
not disclose her recreations, or much else apart from a brief career
history: Security Service 1969-, director-general 1992-. As chief spook
hunter, she'll have whiled her days away as a lamplighter, pavement artist

Price Waterhouse, the bean counters with an ever-expanding portfolio of

recruit to its management consultancy division.
Rival Ernst &amp; Young recently hired Christopher Chope, a former transport
minister. Now PW, not to be outdone, is to take on Margaret Hodge, the
left-wing leader of Islington Borough Council, to advise on local government
matters.
The culture shock may be considerable; a surprised PW spokesman used to the
secretive world of accountants said news of the appointment emerged from the
council, which 'leaks like a sieve'. Not so, retorted an outraged Islington
bureaucrat who insisted it came from PW.
Whatever the truth, Hodge clearly has a strong head for strategic planning.
It appears that she had been in discussions with the firm since before the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a stunning display of solidarity with the embattled Princess Diana,
President Boris Yeltsin has traded in his Mercedes for something less
flashy. The Russian Information Agency reports that he has returned to his
old ZIL limousine - a vast, armour-plated black vehicle, shaped like a
mobile version of Lenin's mausoleum.
The reasons are somewhat similar to those ascribed to the Princess. Yeltsin
has gone back to his ZIL 'after receiving criticism on one of his trips
round the country that he was using a foreign make'.
But Yeltsin may also have drawn a lesson from the experience of his
predecessor Mikhail Gorbachev, one of whose expensive limos has just been
stolen.
That said, Yeltsin is likely to be making a lone stand. Citing sources in
the government car pool, the agency reported that vice-president Alexander
Rutskoi, acting Premier Yegor Gaidar and top presidential aides Gennady
Burbulis and Yury Petrov had all gone off their ZILs - but did not say what
they used instead. As for Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary leader, 'he
prefers a Mercedes' - in spite of his much advertised concern for the fate
of Russian industry.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Arts: 'Christophe Colomb', 'Mignon' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The splendid royal palace of Compiegne, about one hour north of Paris, on
the edge of the forest of the same name, now has an Imperial Theatre to add
to its attractions. That 'now' points to a strange history. Napoleon III and
his Empress, Eugenie, who both loved Compiegne and entertained there
lavishly, found the existing theatre too small and commissioned a larger
one, still incomplete when the Second Empire collapsed in 1870.
Quite recently private sponsors banded together to restore the theatre and
entrusted it to Pierre Jourdan's Theatre Francais de la Musique, an opera
company formed to explore and revive forgotten corners of the rich French
repertory. And so the Imperial Theatre finally opened its doors last autumn,
about 120 years late. This year's operas are Christophe Colomb and Mignon.
They are followed through the winter by a series of weekend concerts of
French music. Compiegne being easy of access, the enterprise is an
acquisition for Paris as well as for the neighbourhood.
The theatre is large for even the grandest palace. The present capacity is
770 - about the same as the Glyndebourne we used to know but vastly
different in shape and appearance - a wide, semi-circular auditorium with
raked stalls, three balconies and side boxes. Those expecting a profusion of
Second Empire gilt may be disappointed. Apart from plasterwork there is
little decoration - plain greyish-white surfaces. But the architect
Ancelet's strong, simple lines are as harmonious as they are imposing. The
restoration was the work of Renaud Bardon, architect of the Musee d'Orsay.
Milhaud and Claudel's Christophe Colomb, a monument of modern music and
theatre in the 1920s, imposed itself this year, celebrating both the
composer's centenary and the quincentenary of Columbus.
Concert performances apart, this dauntingly demanding work has still not
been given in Paris or the surrounding region. Nevertheless, since the
Compiegne stage is by no means large as opera houses go, it was a brave
decision.
A crucial factor was the generous offer of the Gulbenkian Foundation in
Lisbon to lend not only chorus, orchestra and ballet for the performances
but to ensure adequate rehearsal time for preparation of the complicated
score. The solo singers were French and mostly young. The conductor, Michel
Swierczewski, is a Frenchman who has studied with Mackerras in Vienna and
who is a regular visitor to Lisbon. Claude Lule produced, in designs by
Jean-Yves Legavre and Juan Stoppani.
One thing the venture did prove. Colomb, though no walkover, is not after
all such an immense undertaking - it can be done, and worthily, on a fairly
modest scale. Not that total success was won in this turbulent work in which
episodes from the life of Columbus (rarely given in chronological order) are
separated by spoken narrations and by comments and reactions from the
chorus, all in Claudel's torrential language.
Lule decided not to use film as specified by Claudel as an auxiliary means
and substituted dancers. In the storm scene he even fell back on our old
friend, dry ice (surely due for retirement). On the other hand the balletic
treatment of the strange episode where Mexican gods unavailingly churn up
the waters to repel the advancing caravels, was a great success - here as
elsewhere the choreography of Olga Roriz was better than one usually finds
in opera.
The orchestra pit was covered, no doubt a wise precaution in view of the
exuberance of much of Milhaud music. The result, with obviously careful
preparation, was perfectly clear. Remembering its past excellence in Lisbon
I was a little disappointed with the chorus. Perhaps there were too few
voices in that gallant group. Milhaud wrote expertly for voices but he
expects endless stamina over long stretches. There was some flagging, some
sour intonation, and too few audible words - the simple, all-important
phrases greeting the moment of discovery were mumbled.
The Columbus, Laurent Naouri, is a most promising, musical baritone with a
strong, tireless voice - the role is long and demanding. He has a good
presence, but his white, centrally parted wig, aquiline features and long
cassock reminded me fatally of a later and different kind of explorer - the
Abbe Liszt. Naouri's jerky movements contrasted with the remarkable physical
control of the narrator, Michel Hermon, an accomplished actor-singer who
also (rather confusingly) sang the role of Columbus's alter ego.
Mary Saint-Palais, a useful high soprano, had her moments as Queen Isabella
but the right degree of limpidity for her rapt phrases was not always
forthcoming. Pascal Mesle dealt ably with a number of tenor character roles.
The fine passage describing 'the eye of the storm' lay low for him. It was
unwise to have big, floppy programmes that they could hardly be opened
without damaging the coiffure in front. Even then there was too little light
to read them comfortably. A worth-while event in spite of minor flaws - and
a shame there were only two public performances.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So what then happened? Did grizzled old Isak at last save his honour by
killing young Fazli or some hapless male relative? Or did Isak instead yield
to the combined pressure of his village hodja and a bunch of intellectuals
from the city, and agree to 'forgive the blood'? It is a mark of just how
good Forgiving the Blood (Friday, BBC 2) was that it has left me burning to
know how it all ended.
But art mirrored life all too closely in this compelling documentary by
Melissa Llewelyn-Davies, first part of a trilogy called 'Tribes of Europe'.
(Germans and Scots are yet to come.) No one knows how it will end in Kosovo,
the former Yugoslav territory ruled by Serbia. Isak and Fazli are (although
in the latter's case the past tense might be more apt) ethnic Albanians who
outnumber Serbs seven to one.
However, as a group of Serbian Orthodox monks explained, Kosovo is regarded
as the birthplace of their nation, as sacred to them as Jerusalem to the
Jews. The memory of centuries of Moslem oppression can never be expunged,
and land stained by Serbian blood, sweat and tears will never be
relinquished.
Quite obviously, the ceiling is about to fall on the heads of the Albanians
and they know it. The rational move in such a situation is for people to
bury their differences and take arms against the common foe. But that, in
the context of rural Albania, is easier said than done.
Two years before the film was made, Fazli had wantonly stabbed Isak's son to
death for telling him to take his cow out of their vineyard. The State
demonstrated its manifest indifference to justice when a Serbian judge
sentenced the murderer to a mere six weeks in jail. In those circumstances,
it was quite understandable why the bereaved father should turn to a far
older, unwritten legal code: the blood-feud or vendetta.
Now feud is a subject dear to the heart of anthropologists and medieval
historians. In their Finals' papers generations of undergraduates have
trounced the notion that feuding is messy, pointless, barbarism. Quite the
contrary, they explain. Feuding, whether it be among the biblical
Israelites, in Beowulf's England or among the Marsh Arabs of Iraq in happier
times when they played host to Wilfrid Thesiger, is a social mechanism
perfectly adapted to small, clan-dominated communities. Feud satisfies the
innate sense of justice but it also limits and contains violence.
Forgiving the Blood brought out so much that the bland text-book
sociological account of feud overlooks - the feelings of grief constantly
inflamed, of guilt, and the pressure exerted on the avenger by the
neighbours' whispers. What is more, we saw how wiping the slate clean can be
a devilishly slow business. Fazli and his male relatives cowered behind the
high stone wall of their farmstead - or sneaked off to work in Germany -
leaving their women to do all the outside work.
But the particular excellence of this film was to set the private dilemma of
an individual against the larger fate of a nation. We saw Isak and his
family (the men, needless to say) debating in the Men's Room of their house
as to whether he might not after all commute his feud in the interests of
Albanian solidarity against the Serbs.
'Action for Forgiveness' is a movement dreamed up by a group of young
Albanian political activists during one of their frequent spells in gaol.
Its head is a professor of folklore, Anton Cetta, who came up with a
satisfying public ritual which could save face all round. It would have been
nice to learn a little more about what historical precedence, if any, there
was for Cetta's solution. At mass-meetings - until they were outlawed by the
Serbian authorities - some 1200 feuds have been settled as villagers
embraced the professor and 'forgave the blood'.
But in the case of Isak and Fazli, it seemed there was to be no such
renunciation of violence, despite the envoys from the league who joined
forces with the hodja, the Moslem priest. Isak's proposal was that the
murderer's family should have the grace to move away.
But they, in the privacy of their Men's Room, decided that resettling 25
people was going to be hopeless. The property market in Kosovo is, to say
the least, depressed. But at least Isak was left gloomily chewing over the
knowledge that Fazli's lot were even worse than he thought. 'By refusing to
move they've done wrong not only to me but to the nation.'
Avenging honour was one of the themes in the best of a clutch of programmes
about sleaze - about its purveyors, victims and consumers. Living Off the
Game in BBC 2's series, 'East' (BBC 2) examined the growing problem of
prostitution among Asian women. Last week's announcement that Birmingham
city fathers are considering creating a legalised red-light district only
made the topic more relevant.
It seems that life for Asian girls who go 'on the game' is more difficult
than for white co-workers because of the risk from enraged co-religionists,
tempted to avenge the stain on Islam. Quite how severe a form this vengeance
takes was not made clear - ostracism one might expect, but violence, too?
And of course, hypocrisy huffs and puffs. A prostitute in Bradford talked
wrily about custom from 'pious elders' with long beards and Sufi robes.
Well, 'twas ever thus, which is rather the sentiment I was left with by The
Women Trade (Wednesday, BBC 1). However, if you are looking for one good
reason why the UK should keep its own immigration laws, here it is. Every
year, thousands of under-age girls and women are flown in from the Third
World, via Greece, on so-called 'entertainment' visas. As the film
established, a proportion of these poor wretches are ignorant of the true
nature of the jobs - to work as strippers and prostitutes in the clubs of
Antwerp and Brussels.
Depressing fare and so albeit to a far lesser degree was World in Action's
expose of David Sullivan, king of sleaze (ITV, Sunday). The huff of
hypocrisy was audible throughout this boring account of the publisher of
Sunday Sport and other tawdry gems of popular literature.
I am reasonably sure I would not enjoy having Sullivan to dinner. But the
mere fact that he is a nasty, vulgar fellow surely does not merit this kind
of pathetic, plodding, 'shock-horror' expose. Nasty and vulgar is also, by
definition in my view, anyone who buys his sleazy publications which a
surprising number of my social contacts do.
What a relief to turn from the bloated features of porn-merchants to the
refined AN Wilson, interrogating New Testament scholars as to whether Christ
was the Messiah and did really ascend into heaven (C4, Tuesday). This was
good stuff, even if Wilson did make a howler in suggesting that Jesus would
have used his smattering of Greek to buy tomatoes. Whoops . . .

FT  23 SEP 92 / Arts: Solo performers - New York Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two solo performers have been giving audiences a look at contemporary life
in productions playing in New York this summer. With Fires in the Mirror
Anna Deavere Smith holds the glass to the 1991 Brooklyn race riots showing
the audience its own reflection; violence in our cities, she reminds us, is
everyone's problem. David Drake's The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me is both a
window onto gay life and a crystal ball that lets us picture a world beyond
AIDS.
Fires in the Mirror just finished a sell-out run at the New York Shakespeare
Festival's Public Theater. Smith will perform the piece in Boston and San
Francisco this autumn, and at London's Royal Court Theatre next February,
and is creating a similar piece about the recent Los Angeles riots for that
city's Mark Taper Forum. She has become so well known that she has been
given that most American accolade: she is posing for a Gap poster.
For Fires in the Mirror Smith interviewed dozens of people about the events
of August, 1991, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in which blacks and Jews turned
against each other in several days of violence after a Hasidic motorcade ran
over and killed a 7-year-old black boy. She edited 29 of the interviews into
vignettes, and, as directed by Christopher Ashley, performs them using
minimal props and costumes to suggest the speakers and their milieux. One
minute, she is the spread-legged, head-cocking Reverend Al Sharpton exuding
bravado; the next, she is the leather-jacketed University of Santa Cruz
professor Angela Davis spouting theory, and the next she's the
spangled-sweatered Jewish matron Roz Malamud pleading for peace.
Smith is a skilled actress who inhabits her characters with ease and
assuredness. The range and flexibility of her voice is particularly
impressive; she switches between regional and cultural accents as deftly as
she swaps a Hasid's fedora for a rapper's kinte cloth cap. The effectiveness
of Fires in the Mirror lies in her skill as a collagist. Though she performs
her subjects' words without her own verbal commentary, her message comes
through in her choice and ordering of material and in the cumulative effect
of so many takes on the same events. Far from placing blame in the Crown
Heights case, Smith powerfully instructs that right or wrong is not the
point. Her work communicates the need for mutual understanding more
effectively than any political harangue.
In The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me, playing at the Perry Street Theatre,
David Drake reveals and revels in twentysomething urban gay life. That
Drake's series of vignettes is laced through with the language of AIDS
activism - 'The truth will set you free,' he says, 'but first it will piss
you off' - brings home where much of his community's energies lie. For
Drake, as he explains in his first vignette, Larry Kramer's ground-breaking
1985 drama The Normal Heart, kissed him and thousands of others awake to the
reality of the AIDS epidemic and called them to political action to end the
crisis.
At times in The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me one senses the bounds of
Drake's imagination and his experience. In the post-Spalding Gray profusion
of autobiographical solo performance, one longs for formal innovation, for
the see-what-I'm-doing postmodern wink, but Drake remains safely and
disappointingly within his work's artifice. His autobiographical passages
come off as wide-eyed and simple as Drake's persona in them. The vignettes
in which he plays himself at eight years old are syrupy sweet.
But when Drake investigates an aspect of gay life by embodying several
characters and points of view, the results are stunning, particularly his
part-send-up, part-expose of gay night life and the personal ads, '12'
Single'. As directed by Chuck Brown against Steve Sandberg's throbbing
score, '12' Single' is a prose-poem of intoxicating theatricality in which
Drake reveals both the elation and the self-destructiveness of the club
scene.
Drake's final vignette is a simple fantasy and his coup de theatre. On New
Year's Eve, 1999, the happy, healthy Drake natters to us, his party guests,
about the last decade. Barbra just directed her son in a homosexual remake
of The Way We Were, Drake's parents have worn out their home video of his
legal domestic partnership ceremony, and a cure for AIDS was found years
ago. 'It's better here,' says Drake, breaking the fourth wall for the first
time, 'you'll see.' All too seldom in the theatre do we look beyond today to
a better time; that Drake allows us to do so is an act of generosity that
makes great theatre.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Jobs: Much ado about little of real importance - Controversy
over vitamins and intelligence resembles disputations about angels on
pinheads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHT then, as Jobs-column readers are evidently so clever, perhaps you
would like to have a try at this puzzle.
Like the one I printed eight weeks ago - which many of you said was too easy
 -it is a coded division sum, the task being to find the original numerals.
But there is a noteworthy difference.
Last time, each figure was represented by a particular letter of the
alphabet, which always denoted the same figure wherever in the sum it
occurred. Today, except for a single occurrence in the 'answer', all the
numerals are represented by the symbol X.
If any of you can't wait to try the problem, however, please read on
afterwards because it has a bearing on serious questions raised by a
controversial trade descriptions case being heard by magistrates in
Shrewsbury.
XX 7 XX
XXX
XXXXXXXXXXX
XXX
XXX XXXX
XXXX
The link with the trade descriptions case lies through something many people
clearly think highly important, not least in selecting people for desirable
jobs: the gauge of mental ability known as Intelligence Quotient.
Although the problem does not appear in any IQ tests as such, it calls for
the same sort of reasoning that they assess. In this case, since no words
are involved, the reasoning required is of a non-verbal kind.
Non-verbal reasoning is also at the hub of the Shrewsbury case, which
originates with a study by psychologist David Benton of University College,
Swansea. After IQ testing two groups of 12-year-olds, he fed one set pills
containing a mixture of mineral-vitamin supplements, and the other set pills
which while they looked alike were just placebos, with no real substance. On
being re-tested eight months later, both groups scored higher in non-verbal
IQ. But the average gain of those given the supplements was about seven
points greater than the gain of the placebo group.
The findings, revealed in 1988, were featured on TV. Parents flocked to buy
the same mix of supplements, enterprisingly marketed as 'Tandem IQ' by
Larkhall Laboratories of London. Then, although Dr Benton's results were
supported by other studies, there appeared further research denying that
such supplements increased IQ. And now, since Larkhall has gone on marketing
its product in much the same style, it is being accused in Shrewsbury of
infringing the Trade Descriptions Act.
But, while sympathising with the magistrates trying to judge between
clashing researchers, the Jobs column is not concerned with the case itself.
The only question that bothers me is what - apart from achieving it in an IQ
test - does an extra seven or so points on the scale enable anyone actually
to do?
Try as I might, I cannot find anything. For example, although IQ-type
testing is evidently one of the better tools for recruiting for jobs
requiring mental skill, I'm authoritatively assured that a seven- or
eight-point difference would be within the margin of error, and not enough
to count.
So if any of you who've solved the puzzle can cite instances where a bit
more or less of the requisite reasoning power makes a decisive difference in
life, I'd be glad to hear. Otherwise, however, all the fuss typified by the
Shrewsbury case would seem to have no more real importance than medieval
disputations about angels on pinheads.
NOW to the table alongside, indicating managerial pay-levels in Britain as
measured by the Reward consultancy's latest survey. Anyone wanting more data
should contact Steve Flather at Reward House, Diamond Way, Stone, Staffs
ST15 0SD; tel 0785 813566, fax 0785 817007.
My extracts focus solely on executives ranked immediately below director,
except in small firms where they could be on the board, and show both salary
and total cash pay including bonuses. The lower quartile section refers to
the manager a quarter up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same type
of job, the median to the one ranked mid-way, and the upper quartile to the
one a quarter down from the top. To allow for recent rises, all pay figures
should be upped by 0.33 per cent, and by a further 0.25 per cent for each
month from November 1.
Regional variations from the overall median salary of Pounds 30,000 were:
Higher - London by 20 per cent, and Scotland by 10.8. No variance -
South-east England. Lower - Northern Ireland by 3.2 per cent, west midlands
by 3.3, south-west England by 6.1, east-ern counties by 6.7, north-east by
7.6, and north-west by 8.3.
Variances from the median by company sales were: Higher - Pounds 100m-plus
by 22.1 per cent, and Pounds 40m-Pounds 100m by 2.5. Lower - Pounds
15m-Pounds 40m by 3.2 per cent, Pounds 5m-Pounds 15m by 7.6, and up to
Pounds 5m by 16.7 per cent.

FT  23 SEP 92 / SNP keeps its strategy under wraps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish National party gathers in Perth today for its annual conference
with only three MPs compared with five last year, but with its confidence
apparently unshaken.
The party is keeping strictly private any recriminations over its
performance in the general election - in which it failed to make inroads
into Labour's industrial heartlands, in spite of seeing its share of the
vote rise by 7 percentage points to 21 per cent. Private, too, are wrangles
over its future strategy.
The only scheduled discussion of the party's national plan is during a
90-minute session tomorrow afternoon, from which the press and public are
banned.
Reports from national office bearers, including a brief appearance by the
former deputy leader, Mr Jim Sillars, will also be heard in closed session.
Mr Sillars resigned from the deputyship after losing his Glasgow Govan seat
to Labour, and condemning the Scottish electorate as '90-minute pat-riots'.
The list of resolutions for public debate shows the usual SNP preoccupations
with agriculture, forestry, fishing and dampness in housing, but the subject
that seems set to provoke fiercest argument is privatisation.
Possible privatisation of the Scottish water industry has been touted as the
next big issue to rouse the Scottish public as the poll tax did.
That has yet to be demonstrated, but the issue is certain to excite
delegates. Fanning the flames will be an amendment that calls on the party
to face up to the reality of privatisation and drop its commitment to
renationalise all utilities if elected.
A resolution supporting a referendum on Maastricht will attract interest,
but is likely to cause less agitation in Perth than it would in Brighton or
Blackpool in the coming weeks, as the SNP has the distinction of being one
of the most solidly pro-European parties in Britain.

FT  23 SEP 92 / Serb refugees suffer the full absurdities of civil war: Judy
Dempsey reports from the Baranja in Croatia, where Serbs treat their fellow
Serbs as pawns in a policy of ethnic cleansing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE BARANJA, CROATIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Stoya Ivcic is a 73-year-old Serb. She lives in Miokevicevo, a small,
western Slavonian village in central Croatia.
Before fighting started here a year ago between Serb irregulars, backed by
the Yugoslav army, and Croatian forces, more than 35 per cent of the village
was Serb. Today, few Serbs remain.
Some were forced out by the Croats. Others were ordered out of the village
by Serb nationalists and the army who sent them to neighbouring
Bosnia-Hercegovina. But these innocent peasants, whose forebears had lived
for centuries in this part of Croatia, found no peace in Bosnia when war
started there earlier this year.
They had little in common with the Bosnian Serbs and even if they wanted to
return to Croatia, which is no longer at war, they would face intimidation
and treatment as second class citizens. Their homes are likely to have been
destroyed by the Croat authorities as a means of stopping Serbs from
returning to Croatia.
These peasants have thus become pawns in the Serb policy of colonising
Serb-controlled regions of Croatia aimed at driving out non-Serbs.
Over the past six weeks, Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia, have been
transferred by the Serb authorities to the Baranja, a rich, agricultural
region of north-eastern Croatia which Serb forces seized last year and made
part of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina.
But even in the Baranja, which today is one of the three United Nations
Protected Areas in Croatia, these poor peasant refugees have still to find a
place to call their own.
This is because the Serb administration there is determined to prevent
Croatia from regaining this part of its northern territory: and it is just
as determined to prevent Croatian and Bosnian ethnic Serb refugees from
leaving the region.
The means used to implement this two-pronged strategy is a law passed by the
republic of Krajina in September 1991.
This law stipulates that any Croats from the Baranja who fought on the
Croatian side during the war no longer have the right to return. Moreover,
Croats still living in Baranja whose relatives fought in the Croatian army
no longer have the right to property, or work, in the Baranja. Local Serbs
are also affected by the law: those who refused to join the Serbian forces
have no right to return to the region.
As a result, many of the 10,000 Serb refugees have been given jobs taken
from the local Croat population, which now totals only 6,000; or jobs
formerly held by Croats who either fled, or fought in the war and did not
return. The latter's houses have been allocated to the refugees.
The influx of refugees and the exodus of non-Serbs has radically changed the
ethnic composition of the Baranja - to the advantage of Serbian extremists.
Before the war, Serbs made up 25 per cent of the 54,000 strong population,
and Croats 40 per cent. During the war, 25,000 Croats and Hungarians fled.
Today, Serbs make up 70 per cent of the population, and are close to
achieving their aim of an ethnically homogenous region.
Serb refugees, who are afraid to speak out openly against the local Serb
Baranja administration, want to return home, eventually. But they are
prevented from leaving the Baranja. It is sealed by the Drava river on the
west, the Danube on the east (which runs along the Serb-controlled province
of Vojvodina), and a bridge which spans the Drava to the south.
One end of the bridge is manned by UN troops and local Serb policemen; the
other end, only by the Serbs. Every one needs a pass to enter and leave the
region. In short, the refugees have become virtual prisoners in the Baranja.
This policy of colonisation has created tensions between the Serb refugees,
local Serbs, the local non-Serb population, and the Croatian government.
The Serb refugees want to leave. Work is scarce, and besides, they have no
roots. The local Serbs want the United Nations to leave so that they can
expel the remaining non-Serbs. The non-Serb population, already denied their
rights, want the UN to protect them, get their jobs and homes back, and live
in peace.
Meanwhile, the Croatian government want all Croat refugees allowed back into
the Baranja as a means of regaining control over the region.
But the likelihood of any group achieving their goals peacefully are as
remote as the guns falling silent in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina, or Mrs
Ivcic ever seeing her Serb neighbours again. The policy of colonisation has
created tensions between the Serb refugees, local Serbs, the local non-Serb
population, and the Croatian government

<TEXT>
TECNIMONT, the plant-building subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi-Montedison
group, has won a Dollars 200m (Pounds 112.9m) turnkey contract to build a
polypropylene plant in Moscow.
The deal comprises a plant able to produce 100,000 tonnes of polypropylene a
year, with auxiliary equipment. The unit will be fed from an existing
refinery and will make value-added plastics such as film for packaging,
household items and the motor industry, most of it for use in Russia.
Financing will come through exports of unspecified refinery products not
used on the domestic market. The project should be completed by March 1995.
Breda, the Italian railway equipment company which is part of the
state-owned Efim group, now in liquidation, has won a Dollars 161.5m
contract to rebuild 298 carriages used for the past 20 years on the
Washington DC subway system.
The work is expected to take four years. The contract for the carriages,
originally built by the US Rohr group, will be done at Breda's US subsidiary
in New Jersey.
Benetton, the Italian clothing group, has given further details of its joint
venture in India with Delhi Clothes Mills (DCM).
They have set up a jointly-owned company to make Benetton-badged goods for
the Indian market. Sales will be through a chain of 200 shops expected to be
opened within the next three years.

</HEADLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority has awarded a contract to build the
country's first nuclear reactor in more than 30 years to the Argentinian
company Investigaciones Aplicadas (INVAP).
Egypt's only existing nuclear plant, built by the Soviet Union in 1961 at
Inshas (55km north-east of Cairo), is to be dismantled.
INVAP won the tender for the 22-MW research plant over rival bids from
General Atomics, the US group, Atomic Energy of Canada, and a Franco-German
consortium of Siemens and Framaton.
Mr Maher Abaza, Egypt's minister of power and electricity, said the
five-year project will cost Dollars 44.47m (Pounds 25.1m), plus Dollars
16.6m for sub-contracted construction and locally-manufactured components.
Work on the first phase will begin before the end of the year.
Mr Jorge de Belaustegui, Argentina's ambassador to Egypt, joined the
Egyptians in stressing that the new reactor would carry out no military
research, and would be built and run under the auspices of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The two countries were previously linked in a military capacity in the
aborted development of the Condor-2 missile in the late 1980s.
Egypt had ambitious plans in the early 1980s for several power-generating
plants but these were shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
It remains to be seen whether the new research plant will lead to new
contracts for power generators.
The official media in China reported in July that Egypt was ready to order a
300-MW reactor. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is due to make an official
visit to China in October.

EVA Airways, Taiwan's first private international carrier, yesterday

The airline, a subsidiary of Evergreen Group, which owns the world's biggest

Boeing 767-300ERs, flying to eight destinations in the Asia-Pacific region,
and to Vienna.
EVA will take delivery of the first two 747-400s in November, and intends to
use the aircraft on its first trans-Pacific service to Los Angeles in
December. The Dollars 345m includes spares and training. The jets will be
powered by General Electric engines.
Taiwan and Russia have agreed to establish air links to boost trade and
tourism, foreign ministry officials said. Reuter reports from Taipei.
Taiwan's Vice-Foreign Minister John Chang and Mr Oleg Lobov, visiting

FT  23 SEP 92 / People: Sir Eric Pountain steps back from full-time role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Eric Pountain is to become non-executive chairman of TARMAC at the end
of this year.
Until last year Sir Eric combined the role of chief executive and chairman,
but relinquished day-to-day running of the company when Neville Simms was
appointed chief executive.
This followed criticism of Sir Eric's stewardship of Britain's biggest
housebuilder during the late 1980s when the expansion of its UK
housebuilding operations left it exposed to the collapse of house prices and
sales.
Yesterday Sir Eric said that the appointment of Neville Simms had worked out
very well for both of them, but 'I have found lately that there is not
enough for me to do on a full-time basis. I also intend to accept other
non-executive directorships.'
Sir Eric's career moves mirror those of Sir Clifford Chetwood, the former
chief executive and chairman of WIMPEY who, in November 1990, stood down as
chief executive in favour of Joe Dwyer who, like Simms, is battling to
reduce group debt through a programme of disposals and tighter control over
spending.
The question is whether these are the final acts of both men. Sir Eric is 60
next year - the normal retirement age for Tarmac executives. Recently, there
has been speculation over Sir Clifford's role as non-executive chairman of
Wimpey following the appointment of Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays
Bank, as a non-executive director.

Philip Brown has been appointed group company secretary of HARRISON &amp;
CROSFIELD.

Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers and chairman of its

1987 bid for Extel. Charles Stern, United Newspapers' new finance director,

FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (10): Three reasons given for
move / Relocation Profile of Holiday Inn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW companies have a closer historical association with Memphis than Holiday
Inn, pioneer of the standardised family motel. But there, on the north side
of Atlanta and surrounded with a mass of foliage and flowers, is a sparkling
new office block. 'Holiday Inn Worldwide,' it declares.
The Holiday Inn headquarters shifted from Memphis to Atlanta last year -
although the move was months in the planning. The last executives only
switched offices at the beginning of 1992.
The corporate relocation was intrinsically linked to a change in ownership.
Holiday Inn, the world's largest hotel franchise operation, had been
progressively acquired by Bass, the British brewing and hotels group. Having
bought the brand name outside the US, Bass purchased rights to the franchise
system within the domestic US via a Dollars 2bn deal in 1989.
At that stage, Holiday Inns' headquarters were in Memphis, home town of the
chain's founder, Mr Kemmons Wilson. Mr Wilson, a builder/property
entrepreneur, had devised the Holiday Inn's notion out of frustration with
the service he received on a motoring trip. The first Holiday Inn opened in
the Tennessee city in 1952 and, by the time Bass moved in, about 2,400
people were employed at the group's HQ.
Bass said it made the decision to move almost immediately after acquiring
the US Holiday Inn business. Today, it gives three clear reasons for picking
Atlanta.
The first was communications. Holiday Inn, an international brand name, is
likely to become an increasingly global. It is already owned by a British
company, has outlets across Europe and is looking to expand aggressively in
the Far East. Easy access to international travel was a must for executives.
Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, the world's fourth largest in terms of
take-offs and landings, was clearly good news The largest operator at the
airport is Delta Air Lines, one of the the three US 'mega-carriers' with a
comprehensive domestic route network. Delta, like all the big US carriers,
was actively looking to expand its international presence: in mid-1991, it
bought Pan Am's European route authorities and became the largest
transatlantic carrier.
Meanwhile, according to airport officials, British Airways is the second
largest international operator at Hartsfield and other scheduled airlines
functioning there include Japan Airlines, KLM, Lufthansa, Sabena and
Swissair.
Memphis, it should be noted, is also a hub city - but for Northwest
Airlines, which is smaller than Delta and financially troubled. Northwest
boasts a better route network in Far East, but has far less to offer in
terms of flights to Europe.
A second reason for selecting Atlanta, says the hotel franchise operator,
was the quality and availability of employees in the hospitality industry.
In reality, the position may have been a shade more complicated. In the
process of moving the Holiday Inn headquarters, Bass reassessed its
functions, with the result that the office today employs just over 1,000
people, less than half the figure at the Memphis office. Despite the fairly
close proximity of Memphis and Atlanta, only 300 employees moved with the
headquarters.
Finally, the new owners say the 'quality of life' issue played a significant
part in the decision. Housing was affordable, the environment pleasant and
the cultural facilities good. Holiday Inn admits looking closely at three
other cities - Washington DC, New York and Chicago - but Atlanta proved the
winner.

A&amp;J MUCKLOW Group, the West Midlands-based property investor and developer,
reported pre-tax profits slightly ahead at Pounds 10.9m for the year to June
30, against Pounds 10.8m.
The company said that the industrial and commercial property market was weak
and housebuilding showed little improvement.
A revaluation of its industrial and commercial property left a reduction in
the revaluation reserve of Pounds 5.47m which has been incorporated into the
accounts. A revaluation of other properties resulted in a surplus of Pounds
10.4m which has not been taken into the accounts.
Earnings per share were 7.66p (8.11p). A final dividend of 3.103p is
proposed for a total of 5.925p (5.643p).

<TEXT>
GROUP premiums at Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS), the Italian insurance
company controlled by Allianz of Germany, rose by 13.1 per cent to L2,590bn
(Dollars 2.07bn) in the first half of this year.
The improvement contributed to a 15.2 per cent increase in underwriting
earnings to L96.2bn from L83.5bn in the first half of last year. RAS
predicted the upturn would continue to the end of the year, in spite of the
continuing slow recovery in the loss-making motor sector owing to weak
premiums.
The group shied away from forecasting the trend for overall profits this
year because of the extreme volatility of financial markets and the unclear
prospects for extraordinary items by year-end.
Parent company premiums rose by 11.3 per cent to L1,730bn, while
directly-written Italian business grew by 12.7 per cent to L1,467bn. Growth
rates for life insurance were faster for private individuals than for groups
or companies. Premium growth on the non-life side was 'satisfactory' in
spite of steps to weed out non-profitable lines.
Alenia, the stock market-listed aerospace and defence company which is part
of the state-owned Finmeccanica group, reported a plunge in pre-tax group
profits in the first half to just L2.6bn (Dollars 2.07m) from L10bn in the
same period last year. Group sales were L2,370bn, against L2,650bn.
Earnings have been hit by the worldwide crisis in the civil and military
aviation industry and the fall in the value of the dollar. However, Alenia
claimed profits had been supported by cost-cutting and exchange-rate
hedging, leaving its results in line with expectations.
The sharpest falls in production had come on the military side, while output
levels on civil aviation projects and sub-contracting work had been
maintained. The group said new orders in the first half reached L1,740bn,
leaving the order book unchanged at about L11,600bn.
Sogefi, the auto components concern controlled by Carlo De Benedetti's CIR
group, raised pre-tax profits before minority interests in the first half by
almost 119 per cent to L39.5bn (Dollars 31.5m) from L21.4bn in the same
period last year.
The surge came largely through the L19.9bn in extraordinary earnings from
the DM160m sale of Sogefi's stake in Boge, the German car parts group, to
Mannesmann earlier this year.
The bulk of the proceeds have been used to reduce the group's borrowings,
which fell to L86bn at the end of June from L199.2bn at end-December 1991.
First-half group sales rose by 11.5 per cent to L344bn.

FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: National Mutual to list HK arm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Mutual, the Australian insurance and investment group, plans to
list its Hong Kong insurance subsidiary on the colony's stock exchange.
Mr Gil Hoskins, group managing director, said yesterday the listing would be
the first in Hong Kong of a leading domestically-based insurer and would
thus establish a new sector of the colony's investment market.
Mr Hoskins gave no indication of the size of the flotation, but he said
National Mutual would float a 25 per cent share of the business. National
Mutual says the Hong Kong business's annual premium income grew to HKDollars
2.5bn (USDollars 325m) in fiscal 1992 from HKDollars 250m in 1986. It
employs about 500 staff and 3,400 agents.
Mr Hoskins suggested National Mutual would use the Hong Kong flotation as a
platform for further Asian expansion. 'The Asian Pacific region is where we
see our main growth coming from in future years,' he said.
'We plan to grow elsewhere in the region, initially targetting Taiwan and
Indonesia. In the long term, the greater China market, once it opens up,
would be of interest to the group.'
National Mutual is also a significant funds manager in Asia through its
Meridian Global Funds Management arm which manages assets of more than
HKDollars 5bn.
Simon Holberton in Hong Kong adds: The National Mutual float is expected to
be the largest public offering in the colony since the 1990 flotation of 49
per cent of the South China Morning Post by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
International which raised HKDollars 800m.
National Mutual has received preliminary positive indications from the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange and the colony's insurance commissioner for the float.
Mr Geoff Tomlinson, associate director for National Mutual's international
operations, said that the issue would be a combination of new and old
shares. Capital raised through the issue of new shares would be retained
within the company, while the proceeds from the sale of existing scrip would
be repatriated to Australia.
He said in the longer term, National Mutual's Hong Kong subsidiary would
make an ideal vehicle for the life office's ambitions in the China market.

CERUS, the French holding company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian
financier, yesterday announced fresh problems with a FFr377m (Dollars
74.46m) loss for the first half, due to heavy provisions at its banking arm.
The shortfall, which compares with a FFr315m loss in the first six months of
1991, comes despite the strong gains recorded by the holding company's main
investment, Valeo, the French car components maker.
*****
Dumenil-Leble, Cerus' 76 per cent owned banking subsidiary, recorded a
FFr492m loss, after FFr540m of provisions for losses on property investments
and the closure of its Swiss unit.
Cerus announced that it planned to inject fresh funds into Dumenil-Leble,
which had FFr650m of shareholders' capital before these results.
The amount of the recapitalisation has yet to be decid-ed.
*****
Mrs Edith Cresson, the former French prime minister, is to chair a
French-owned international consulting company for which she worked briefly
before becoming prime minister in May 1991, Reuter reports from Paris.
Her new employer, Services Industries Strategies International et
Environnement (SISIE), belongs to the Schneider engineering and building
group.
*****
Burda, the German privately-owned newspaper publishing group, said its
parent company's pre-tax profit in 1991 rose to DM76.1m (Dollars 51.33m)
from DM71.6m, while group sales rose 10.3 per cent to DM1.37bn.
The company said business with printing and electronic media was
satisfactory in 1991; advertising was difficult due to increasing
competition from television.
Burda expects its results for 1992 to be similar to 1991. It said it would
continue to use profits for investments. Capital spending in printing and
computer equipment should rise to almost DM300m over the next four years.

Shareholders in Andrews Sykes, the industrial services and environmental
products group, will meet next month to consider a bid by a dissident
minority shareholder to gain control of the board, writes Paul Taylor.
The company set October 16 as the date for an extraordinary meeting called
at the request of Mr Jacques Murray, who holds a 26.63 per cent stake in the
group.
Mr Murray has called for the removal of Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and Mr
David Crowe, a non-executive director, from Sykes' 5-man board and their
replacement by himself and three of his associates.
In a letter to shareholders yesterday, Mr Hubbard 'strongly recommended'
them to vote against Mr Murray's resolutions, which he described as an
'unmerited and unwelcome attempt to gain control of the company.'

FT  23 SEP 92 / BMW warns of 12% price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is little prospect of any significant recovery in the UK new car
market next year, even if interest rates are cut quickly by another 1 or 2
percentage points, Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB) warned
yesterday.
Mr Purves predicted that total new car sales next year would reach only
1.6m, unchanged from 1991 and only 50,000 more than the industry expects
this year.
He also warned that BMW's UK prices would have to rise in about three months
to compensate for the sharp fall in sterling against the D-Mark.
BMW (GB), a wholly owned subsidiary of the German executive car maker, would
have to increase prices by an average of 12 per cent to 14 per cent fully to
compensate for sterling's 18 per cent fall since the start of the ERM
crisis. Highly competitive conditions in the savagely depressed UK market
meant actual increases would have to be considerably lower, Mr Purves told
reporters.
In some cases, cars would be produced to a lower specification if necessary
to keep them below the Pounds 19,250 threshold, above which company car
taxation for employees rises sharply. More than 70 per cent of BMW's UK
sales are to business users.
BMW's UK prices rose only a few weeks ago, by an average of 4.2 per cent ,
although the increases reflected higher specification on some models.

THE US Air Force yesterday confirmed the award of a Dollars 50m (Pounds
28.2m) contract to Slingsby, the small Yorkshire aircraft maker, to supply
in partnership with the US Northrop group up to 113 Slingsby T67 Firefly
training aircraft.
Slingsby, a subsidiary of ML Holdings, originally won the US Air Force
contract last April. The deal was frozen by the US authorities after
protests by unsuccessful bidders that the US Air Force had not followed its
own criteria for selection of the new training aircraft. Slingsby was among
six bidders for the contract to replace the US Air Force's fleet of Cessna
T-41 aircraft.
ML Holdings said yesterday that the General Accounting Office of the US
Congress had rejected all the protests, clearing the way for the contract to
supply 113 Firefly single-piston-engine training aircraft to the US Air
Force. This year the Canadian armed forces also selected the Firefly as its
primary training aircraft.
Slingsby teamed with Northrop, the US defence contractor, to compete for the
US Air Force order. It will be prime contractor, supplying Firefly airframes
from its North Yorkshire plant, for assembly in the US by Northrop.
EVA Airways, Taiwan's first private international carrier, yesterday
confirmed a Dollars 345m (Pounds 194.9m) order to Boeing for two 747-400
passenger jets, writes Luisetta Mudie in Taipei. This follows previous firm
orders for six of the widebody jets, and two extra options.
The airline, an Evergreen Group subsidiary, began operations last year with
a fleet of Boeing 767-300ERs, flying to destinations in the Asia-Pacific
region, and to Vienna. EVA will take delivery of the first two 747-400s in
November, and will use the aircraft on its first trans-Pacific service to
Los Angeles in December.

higher earnings

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PECHINEY Group, the French state-owned aluminium company, and Pechiney
International, its separately listed can-making subsidiary, both reported
sharp increases in first-half net profits yesterday.
Net earnings at Pechiney Group rose from a restated FFr429m (Dollars 83.5m)
to FFr782m in the first six months of the year, thanks to one-off gains from
a complex asset re-organisation and injection of fresh capital carried out
in May and June.
Operating profits fell from a restated FFr2.44bn to FFr1.79bn, due to low
aluminium prices and technical problems in starting-up extra capacity. Sales
fell from FFr36.36bn to FFr34.06bn on the same basis.
Under the asset reshuffle, Pechiney Group took over its subsidiary's
aluminium and trading businesses, to leave Pechiney International as a
packaging and turbine component company. The aim is to make Pechiney
International more attractive to investors by reducing its exposure to
volatile aluminium prices.
Pechiney International saw a more than five-fold increase in its earnings,
from a restated FFr266m to FFr1.41bn over the same period, reflecting heavy
exceptional gains. Net sales fell from FFr18.66bn to FFr18.29bn over the
same period.
It forecast a full-year profit of more than FFr1bn, excluding exceptional
gains, as against the FFr890m Pechiney International recorded on a
comparable structure in 1991. This is based on a forecast that earnings from
packaging - 85 per cent of operating profits in the first half - should rise
about 10 per cent in dollar terms this year, while debt payments have fallen
due to the asset reorganisation.
Excluding exceptional items, Pechiney International's net earnings were
roughly static in the first half, while operating profits fell by 8.9 per
cent to FFr1.37bn, reflecting falling demand for turbine components from the
depressed aircraft industry. Its packaging division lifted operating profit
3.7 per cent to FFr1.17bn.
Spie-Batignolles, the troubled French construction group, expects a net loss
of between FFr150m and FFr200m this year, but will break even at the
operating level, said Mr Claude Coppin, group president.

<TEXT>
CLUB Mediterranee, the leading French holiday and leisure group, yesterday
warned that it may not be able to meet its profit forecast for 1992 because
of an unexpectedly steep fall in profits from its US subsidiary.
Earlier this summer, Mr Gilbert Trigano, chairman of Club Med, predicted
that the group would bounce back into the black with net profits of around
FFr240m (Dollars 44.44m) for the year ending October, after a FFr17m loss
last year.
However, Club Med Inc, the US company which is 72 per cent owned by the
French group, yesterday announced a 21 per cent fall in net profits from
Dollars 27.8m to Dollars 21.9m on stable sales of Dollars 105m for the first
nine months of 1992.
The US business, which owns 25 holiday villages and a cruise ship, made a
loss in the third quarter of the year. It has been hit by higher transport
costs and retail price inflation, but also by the impact of the dollar's
decline against the franc.
Club Med said in Paris yesterday that the problems of the US company meant
that it would not meet its own FFr240m profit forecast this year. However,
it stressed that it would still be profitable. Last year, Club Med, like
other holiday companies, was badly affected by the impact of the Gulf war on
travel.
The group, which recently launched a FFr1bn bond issue to finance the
expansion and renovation of its holiday villages, earlier this month
reported a return to profits for the first half with a credit of FFr20.3m
for the six months to April 30, compared with a net loss of FFr87.5m for the
same period in the previous year.
Avenir Havas Media, the subsidiary of the Havas media group specialising in
poster advertising and free newspapers, yesterday announced a sharp 74.4 per
cent fall in interim net profits to FFr21.4m on sales which slipped by 2.8
per cent to FFr3.26bn.

MR Willem Scherpenhuijsen Rom, chairman of ING, the Dutch banking and
insurance group, resigned unexpectedly yesterday in response to a series of
reports in the Dutch press about the private investments of former senior
executives from the group's banking arm.
Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom, who took over as ING's chairman just 12 week ago,
said he was stepping down because he had increasingly become the focus of
negative press publicity in the Netherlands.
His successor in one of the Netherlands' top financial posts is Mr Aad
Jacobs, who until now was vice-chairman and head of the group's insurance
operations.
Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom decided to resign after weekend consultations with
ING's supervisory board. The move followed recent allegations in the press
that he knew about the personal investments of Mr Ton Soetekow, who resigned
from ING's board in the summer, as well as a report on Saturday in the
newspaper De Volkskrant that Mr Scherpenhuijsen had made private investments
in the late 1970s in a small property company that had a banking
relationship with NMB Bank, which he then chaired.
An ING spokesman said that Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom's property investment was
ended in 1981. The investment was legal but Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom pulled
out after a few years at a time when the Dutch financial community began
debating the propriety of bankers investing in clients, the spokesman said.
This summer, four former senior executives at NMB Bank, which has since been
renamed ING Bank, resigned or retired early.

YVES Saint Laurent (YSL), one of the most famous Paris fashion houses,
suffered a sharp fall in net profits from FFr41m in the first half of 1991
to FFr2.6m (Dollars 506,000) in the same period this year, reflecting the
depressed state of the global luxury goods market.
The company stressed that the first half was traditionally the slackest part
of its year, given that the bulk of its perfume sales were made during the
Christmas season. However YSL, like its rivals, had also been hit by the
economic instability of Japan and North America, and by the slowdown in
western Europe.
Turnover rose by 6.8 per cent to FFr1.39bn during the interim period due to
the contribution of the new YSL skin care range. However the cost of
marketing the range - in an advertising campaign devised by Jean-Paul
Mondino, a leading stylist - eroded operating profits, which fell from
FFr130.6m to FFr94.9m.
The skin care range is expected to make a positive contribution to profits
from next year onwards. The group, plans in late 1993 to launch a new
women's scent.

<TEXT>
BANKAMERICA, the leading bank in the western US, yesterday moved to
strengthen its modest presence in the important Texas market with the
purchase of 130 branches and Dollars 7.5bn of deposits from First Gibraltar
Bank, a large savings institution controlled by the financier Mr Ronald
Perelman.
The deal, part of the consolidation of the fragmented US banking industry,
came as North Carolina-based First Union agreed to buy Virginia-based
Dominion Bankshares for stock valued at Dollars 850m.
Californian-based BankAmerica said the cost of the First Gibraltar deal was
expected to be around Dollars 110m, mainly in cash, paid to MacAndrews &amp;
Forbes Holdings, the parent company behind Mr Perelman's privately-owned
empire.
Mr Perelman's acquisition of First Gibraltar four years ago created immense
controversy because of the favourable terms he won from a government agency
overseeing the national crisis of failed savings and loans institutions.
He pieced together First Gibraltar from failed thrifts acquired for Dollars
355m, while gaining Dollars 900m in tax breaks and a contract to manage
distressed loans held by the institutions. He now appears to have utilised
most of the tax breaks and management fees.
First Gibraltar was put up for sale earlier this year. But despite its
extensive branch network, its attractions for potential purchasers were
reduced by its relatively slim loan book and lack of business customers.
BankAmerica said it would be buying some Dollars 225m of commercial loans
and Dollars 640m of consumer loans. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes would retain First
Gibraltar's federal savings bank charter, four branches in Plano,Texas, and
non-banking subsidiaries.
BankAmerica operates 130 branches in Texas and has some Dollars 3.7bn of
deposits. It claimed the deal would boost it to second place in the state in
terms of branches, behind North Carolina-based NationsBank, and fourth
position in terms of deposits.
The Californian bank moved into Texas in 1991, buying the assets of a
troubled Houston bank, and followed this up with deals involving two
thrifts.

YVES Saint Laurent (YSL), the Paris fashion house, suffered a sharp fall in
net profits from FFr41m in the first half of 1991 to FFr2.6m (Dollars
506,000) in the same period this year, reflecting the depressed state of the
global luxury goods market, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The company stressed that the first half was traditionally the slackest part
of its year.

FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Primerica takes stake in
Travelers

SHARES in Travelers Corporation jumped on US stock markets yesterday on the
news that Primerica, the financial services group, had taken a big stake in
the troubled insurance company, and Mr Sanford Weill, Primerica's chairman,
would assume a significant role in Travelers.
By the close, Travelers' share price was up Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 20 5/8
in heavy trading after the announcement that Primerica would invest Dollars
722.5m (Pounds 408.1m) in Travelers in return for a 27 per cent stake.
Investors and analysts welcomed the deal. Mr Weill's appointment to
Travelers' board was seen as a much-needed vote of confidence.
The insurer, suffering big losses on property investments, agreed to elect
Mr Weill to its board and as chairman of the finance committee.
Travelers unveiled a restructuring involving 3,500 job losses, or 10 per
cent of its workforce. It will take a Dollars 132m after-tax charge in the
third quarter to pay for the lay-offs, but it will also report a special net
gain of Dollars 135m as a result of an accounting change.
The agreement, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, gives
Primerica 38m shares of Travelers common stock, valued at Dollars 19 a
share, in return for Dollars 550m cash, a 50 per cent equity stake in
Primerica's Gulf Insurance property-casualty subsidiary and 100 per cent in
health insurance operations of Primerica's Transport Life/Voyager Group.
The deal increases to Dollars 1.4bn the capital Travelers has raised this
year to shore up its shaky position. In the first half of this year it sold
Dollars 675m of stock and bonds. More than a third of Travelers' Dollars
13.8bn book of property loans was characterised as underperforming by the
end of the second quarter.

losses in second half

<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the struggling German airline which is shedding staff to help
stem heavy losses, said yesterday that its second-half loss should be much
lower than in the first half as a result of improved business and capacity
cuts.
It also intends to operate a less conservative depreciation policy, which
will save around DM350m (Dollars 233.30m) this year.
The airline has already announced a pre-tax loss of DM542m for the first six
months, up from DM331m in the same period last year. Lufthansa said the
decision to take aircraft out of service and reduce jobs - by 6,000 over the
next two years after cutting 1,800 this year - would have an increasing
impact in the second half.
The company said traffic performance in July had improved, with bookings
until end-October also rising.
The airline said savings from its new, simplified Lufthansa Express
division, which will take over eight busy domestic flights this winter,
would initially total DM90m a year.

FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Swedish bank's future on the
line: Sara Webb examines the options which Gota Bank is considering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PER Lundberg has had a baptism of fire. Since taking over as managing
director of Gota Bank, Sweden's fourth-largest commercial bank, at the
beginning of September, he has had to turn to the government and the central
bank for help in sorting out the bank's financial woes. Now a question mark
hangs over the form in which Gota Bank will continue to operate - whether it
will survive under its own name or be forced to merge with another banking
group.
Last week, Gota Bank announced that credit losses for 1992 would reach
SKr8bn (Dollars 1.4bn) - or double its previous estimate. Non-performing
loans (defined as those where no interest has been paid for 60 days or where
the interest payment is less than originally agreed with the bank) have
escalated to SKr20bn, compared with about SKr10bn at the start of the year,
out of a total loan portfolio of SKr70bn. As a result, the bank expects to
see an operating loss of between SKr3bn and SKr4bn this year.
Sweden's centre-right government has promised to guarantee Gota Bank's
commitments to private individuals, companies and all other creditors and
counterparties. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, also promised to
continue normal dealings with the bank, ensuring that Gota Bank has access
to the liquidity required.
However, the bank's management and owner must prepare to discuss Gota Bank's
future with officials from the finance ministry. So far, two possible
options have emerged:
To place the bad debts in the separate company, leaving the relatively
healthy parts of Gota Bank to continue as a normal bank.
Mr Lundberg says that Gota Bank has already started to place its
non-performing loans - of which about 85 per cent are related to the
troubled real estate sector - in a separate division. The bank hopes that
the government will step in to reduce the financial burden, possibly with
the division containing the non-performing loans being spun off and
receiving an injection of funds from the government.
The plan is broadly similar to the rescue seen at Nordbanken, another
Swedish bank which is in the process of transferring its bad debts to a new
company called Securum that will be capitalised with state funds. However,
some of the other Swedish commercial banks have complained that it is unfair
for the government to take bad debts off Gota Bank's hands when nearly every
bank has been hit by heavy credit losses and exposure to the property
sector.
To find a new owner or shareholder for Gota Bank.
Gota Bank is 100 per cent owned by a holding company called Gota, which in
turn is owned by Trygg Hansa SPP Holding, an insurance group. Trygg Hansa
SPP originally thought its stake in Gota would help to boost its own
position in the financial services sector as the insurance group hoped to
sell its products through Gota Bank's large branch network.
However, as Gota Bank's financial difficulties grew more acute, Trygg Hansa
SPP was forced to provide financial support and acquire the whole of the
Gota group.
If Trygg Hansa SPP is to benefit from selling its insurance-linked products
through the bank's network, it will probably have to remain as a shareholder
in Gota, although it could reduce its stake if another bank or insurance
group were to come in as a shareholder in the Gota group.
One solution being considered is for a foreign bank to take a stake in the
Gota group as a way of gaining a presence in the Swedish market. However,
foreign bankers are likely to be wary: those foreign banks which won
government approval to set up subsidiaries in Sweden have found the banking
climate tough, and some pulled out because of the losses incurred.
In the absence of a foreign suitor, it is possible that Gota will be merged
with another Swedish bank - with the state-owned Nordbanken topping the list
of likely candidates.
Gota Bank's bad debts could then be combined with those of Nordbanken (in
the separate company Securum) and Trygg Hansa SPP could then take a stake in
the combined banking group, with the state as the other main shareholder.
The government has already said it is keen to privatise Nordbanken as soon
as the bank returns to profitability - and some bankers point out bringing
Trygg Hansa SPP in as a shareholder in a newly-merged Gota/Nordbanken group
could provide the first step towards achieving that goal.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Pressure grows on Collor: President must present his defence
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   RIO DE JANEIRO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE impeachment process against Brazil's President Fernando Collor reaches a
critical phase today  - the deadline for Mr Collor to present to Congress
his defence against sweeping corruption charges.
Over the past week, pressure has been mounting on Mr Collor, with daily
pro-impeachment demonstrations throughout Brazil, and the return from Miami
of his younger brother Pedro, whose accusations in May prompted the
congressional inquiry now threatening to bring down the president.
Mr Collor's mother, Dona Leda, suffered three heart attacks last week after
Pedro renewed his charges against his older brother, and is on a
life-support machine in a Rio hospital.
A congressional commission must present its recommendation on impeachment
tomorrow. The final vote is expected next week, when a two-thirds majority
is needed to unseat the president. The Supreme Court will rule tomorrow on
whether this vote will be secret, which would aid Mr Collor by reducing
public pressure on congressmen.
Mr Collor's strategy is to try to delay the process through legal challenges
while trying to win support in congress by releasing funds for assorted
projects.
With the impeachment clock ticking against him, Mr Collor is starting to
show signs of losing control. At a dinner for congressmen last week he
shocked guests with an outburst of coarse language against leading political
figures, including Mr Ulysses Guimaraes, Brazil's most respected
congressman. Mr Collor's spokesman explained: 'It was letting off steam by a
man who has been suffering a process of lynching, injustice and slander for
over 100 days.'
Brazil and its creditor banks said yesterday they had completed negotiations
on a Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.8bn) debt deal, Reuter reports from Washington.
But bankers say the accord, although important, is being held hostage by the
political crisis facing Mr Collor. The crisis is affecting the country's
chances of meeting targets of a recent IMF accord, without which the deal
with the banks cannot go through.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO and the Vatican have established full diplomatic relations, putting
an official end to more than 130 years of church-state hostility.
Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a tersely worded communique that the
decision was based on constitutional reforms last year that gave legal
recognition to religious institutions for the first time in more than 70
years.
The reforms overturned Mexico's anti-clerical 1917 constitution and allowed
churches to own property and run schools. They also gave priests the right
to vote and wear clerical attire in public.
While nearly 90 per cent of Mexicans are Catholic, the church and state have
been in conflict since 1861, when President Benito Juarez expelled the Papal
Nuncio. In the last century the Catholic church owned half Mexico's land and
opposed independence from Spain, making it the favourite target of reformers
such as President Juarez.
The church also opposed Mexico's 1910 revolution, from which sprang the
political party that, under a different name, still runs Mexico. The
church-state conflict led to open warfare in the late 1920s as conservative
peasants, known as Cristeros, took up arms against the government.
President Carlos Salinas, however, has been determined to leave behind the
old, anti-clerical and nationalist Mexico and has sought reconciliation with
the church.
His legal changes in part clarify what was already common practice with
laws, such as those against private religious education, ignored.

<TEXT>
ENTINA'S leading creditor banks are holding emergency meetings in an attempt
to complete restructuring of the country's Dollars 23bn (Pounds 12.9bn)
commercial bank debt, writes Robert Peston in Washington.
Senior bank executives are in Washington for the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund. Citibank, which chairs the advisory committee
of Argentina's banks, has called many of them together in midnight meetings
at its Washington office in the hope of ending the impasse which has
prevented completion of the debt restructuring.
However, a banker present at the first meeting, which finished at 2am
yesterday, said progress was 'painfully slow'.
In spring the banks had agreed that Argentina's debt would be converted into
two types of bond  - discount and par. The deal could not be completed as
the banks wanted to convert too much of their debt  - 80 per cent of it  -
into the par bonds.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister, is making it clear to banks
this week that, because of expense, they must take more of the discount
bonds; the government has to provide more collateral for the par bonds than
for the discount bonds.

<TEXT>
UNITED TECHNOLOGIES of the US has won a long-running battle to supply
helicopters to the Turkish armed forces, with the issue of a letter of
intent yesterday for co-production of its Sikorsky Black Hawk, a deal worth
Dollars 855m (Pounds 483m).
More than two years after the initial tender, Turkey's Defence Industry
Executive Committee, headed by Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister,
announced Sikorsky had been selected to negotiate terms for the joint
manufacture of 50 S-70 A multi-purpose Black Hawks, with a further 25 sold
for immediate delivery.
Agusta of Italy and a French-German consortium of Aerospatiale and
Messerschmitt-Bolkow Blohm were also in competition. However Sikorsky won
vital support from the US Export Import Bank which is to provide export
credit guarantees for 80 per cent of the contract. US officials say Eximbank
has offered Dollars 1.3bn in support of the Sikorsky bid.
US officials say the long-term nature of the co-production deal paves the
way for an additional supply of 75 helicopters.
The Sikorsky contract, originally for 200 helicopters, was tendered six
times, before being scaled back because of budgetary considerations.
The deal is one of several contracts under consideration as Turkey enhances
its rapid reaction capability in its eight-year struggle with Kurdish
separatists along its borders with Iran and Iraq.
Turkey is likely to delay its long-standing ambition of full customs union
with the European Community set for 1996, in a bid to protect key domestic
industries, according to a senior government official.
Professor Emre Gonensay, the prime minister's key economic adviser, said in
an interview with the Financial Times that Turkey was on line to eliminate
tariffs and introduce a common external tariff but that Ankara would
negotiate to extend import protection for 'some sectors' beyond the 1996
deadline.
This is the first admission that Turkey is considering rescheduling the
phased elimination of tariff barriers under a 1963 association agreement
with Brussels, which is the first step to full accession to Community
membership. More than half Turkey's trade is with the EC.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S National Assembly may resume normal operations this week
following President Roh Tae Woo's promise that December's presidential
election will be conducted fairly under a neutral caretaker government.
The two main opposition parties have been boycotting the assembly since the
spring in protest at the government's decision to postpone the election of
local officials until 1995.
The opposition charges that senior local officials, who are at present
appointed by the government, would use their influence to support the ruling
Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) candidate, Mr Kim Young Sam, in the
presidential election.
Opposition fears were given credence when it was disclosed that local
officials in one county bribed voters to support an unsuccessful DLP
candidate in last March's parliamentary election. This followed other
allegations that intelligence agency and military officials engaged in
illegal practices to support DLP candidates during that election.
The growing election scandal forced Mr Roh on Friday to announce that a
neutral caretaker cabinet would be formed early next month to ensure a fair
presidential election, while he would quit the DLP.
The appointment of independent ministers to head the Home Affairs Ministry,
which is in charge of local government, and National Security Planning, the
intelligence agency, would theoretically guarantee that the government would
not use these key agencies to influence the election in favour of the DLP.
Mr Kim Dae Jung, the presidential candidate of the main opposition
Democratic Party, yesterday welcomed Mr Roh's decision and promised to end
the boycott of the assembly.
The National Assembly must consider several important economic measures,
including the 1993 budget, before its current session ends in December.
Mr Roh made his decision under pressure from Mr Kim Young Sam, a former
opposition leader who merged his party into the DLP in 1990. Mr Kim has been
concerned that the election scandal would harm his popularity among voters
and reduce his lead over Mr Kim Dae Jung.
Mr Kim has also been concerned that allegations of political favouritism
regarding the award of government contracts this year could hurt his
election chances.
He recently insisted on the cancellation of a lucrative mobile telephone
licence to Sunkyong after the opposition charged that the contract was
awarded to the Korean conglomerate because its chairman is an in-law of Mr
Roh.
Some officials in Mr Roh's majority faction of the party are expressing
worries about the growing influence of Mr Kim and the possibility that many
influential bureaucratic positions may be filled by Mr Kim's supporters if
he wins the presidential election.
One new threat to Mr Kim emerged yesterday with the announcement that Mr Lee
Jong Chan, who stood against Mr Kim for the DLP presidential nomination,
will form a new political party and possibly field a presidential candidate.
Mr Lee's party could attract dissatisfied elements within the DLP.

FT  22 SEP 92 / TV debate perils for both Bush and Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL CLINTON will appear on a platform in East Lansing, Michigan, tonight
but President George Bush will not be alongside him. Indeed the question of
when and where the two US presidential candidates will confront each other
in debate has become one of the most intriguing tactical issues of the
campaign.
According to the schedule proposed by a bipartisan commission of five
prominent Republicans and five Democrats, Mr Clinton and Mr Bush were to
start a three-match series tonight in East Lansing, followed by a second in
San Diego, California, on October 4 and a final in Richmond, Virginia, on
October 15. Senator Al Gore and Mr Dan Quayle, the vice-presidential
candidates, were to square off on September 29 in Louisville, Kentucky.
The commission recommended that the format of previous debates be changed,
with a single moderator, rather than a panel of three or four journalists,
serving as the buffer between the two candidates. The Clinton side accepted
the proposal, but the Bush team, under Mr James Baker, campaign supremo,
said no.
Mr Baker, whose hand is omnipresent but largely invisible, has not gone
public with his reasons for backing out of the first confrontation. Mr
Robert Zoellick, his right hand man, merely said in a weekend television
interview that he could not see why a tried and trusted format needed to be
changed.
Speculation centres on three main reasons for the reluctance of the Bush
camp to participate. The first is the fear that Mr Clinton, adept with
words, might show to advantage against Mr Bush, who is often not. Giving the
challenger an equal platform with the incumbent only enhances his stature.
The second argument is that a single self-effacing moderator is less likely
to ask the outlandish 'character' question most likely to embarrass Mr
Clinton than a journalist on the panel, the selection of which can be
influenced by both campaigns. In 1988, Mr Bernie Shaw, of CNN, asked
Democratic runner Mr Michael Dukakis a question concerning the hypothetical
rape of a member of his family that put the candidate hopelessly on the
defensive.
Finally, if the 1988 experience is anything to go by, Mr Baker is known to
believe that the mere announcement of a debate at a definite future date
freezes public opinion for several critical days. Well behind in the polls,
Mr Bush can hardly afford that.
The latest evidence of this deficit was furnished yesterday by six state
polls. The two candidates were dead even in Mr Quayle's home state of
Indiana, which the Democrats have not carried since 1964, and in Florida, a
Republican stronghold. But Mr Clinton was leading by 21 points in Missouri,
19 in Illinois, 14 in Delaware, and eight in Ohio.
This also suggests that Mr Clinton has something to lose by debating Mr Bush
and doing badly, which is why his campaign prefers the single moderator
approach. The probable reality is that he will debate with the president in
any event, for the obvious reason that whoever ducks out becomes an easy
target.
The general expectation is that the two will debate, either once or twice,
in October, as will Senator Gore and Vice-President Quayle. Much may hang on
it. At least three recent elections - 1960, 1976 and 1980 - may be said to
have been decisively swayed by the debates and it is certainly true that
four years ago Mr Dukakis lost an opportunity to restore fading fortunes.

FT  22 SEP 92 / US gives pledge to emphasise peace role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday promised that the US would place greater
emphasis on international peace-keeping and proposed a special summit of the
United Nations Security Council to discuss proposals in this field.
Mr Bush's speech on the opening day of the UN General Assembly's annual
general debate identified the need for enhanced international peace-keeping
capabilities, the prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, and promotion of economic prosperity as the three greatest
challenges facing the international community.
'Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective
engagement to transform our collective institutions and will require each of
us to look seriously at our own governments and how we conduct our
international affairs,' he said.
His speech, which rejected isolationism and stressed the need for nations to
adopt outward-looking policies, was seen as a powerful endorsement of the
'Agenda for Peace' published earlier this year by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
UN secretary-general, at the request of the Security Council summit in
January this year.
Specifically, Mr Bush endorsed the proposal for standby military forces to
be made available by member countries at short notice to the UN
secretary-general for peace-keeping and humanitarian relief operations,
subject to the approval of governments providing these forces.
The president underlined the need for these forces to be able to train
together and for joint planning, crisis management and intelligence
capabilities.
The US was prepared to make available its bases and other military
facilities for training and field exercises and he had instructed Mr Dick
Cheney, defence secretary, to work closely with the UN to see how US air
transport, logistics and intelligence capabilities could best be employed to
support peace-keeping roles.
Mr Bush also promised that the US, which owes a total of Dollars 733m
(Pounds 414.1m) in regular and peace-keeping contributions to the UN and is
the world organisation's biggest debtor, would in future ensure that
adequate US financial support would be provided for UN peacekeeping and
humanitarian activities.
Mr Boutros Ghali has proposed that funding should be provided from member
states' defence budgets in order to prevent delays in transfers of financial
contributions.
Emphasising that 20 countries were currently developing nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons and ways to deliver them, Mr Bush proposed that the
Security Council give assurances to non-nuclear weapon states that its
members would help any such state party to the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty which was a victim of aggression or the threat of aggression
involving nuclear weapons.
In the economic field, the president urged a strengthening of the Group of
Seven industrialised states' co-ordination process, although he gave no
details.
In a clear reference to France's endorsement of the Maastricht treaty, Mr
Bush said the exact form of European economic integration was for the
Europeans to decide. But he pledged the US would stand by the Europeans.
He also promised a reform of US aid policy, moving to a more effective form
of economic partnership. He proposed setting up a Dollars 1bn economic
growth fund which would provide grants and credits to support businesses in
need in countries which had undertaken to restructure their economies.

FT  22 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Disposal benefits Sears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORES group Sears advanced 5 to 69p in heavy trading after announcing it
was disposing of its loss-making menswear division. Rumours of the sale, the
subject of a management buyout, had been doing the rounds in the market and
trade press in recent weeks, and pre-empted an announcement with Sears'
results next week.
The disposal of the menswear division, which lost Pounds 9m last year and
includes the Fosters brand, was largely welcomed by the market. However,
analysts also pointed to improved sentiment towards the sector as a whole
because of the expected cut in interest rates, and part of the Sears rise
was due to that. Turnover was a hefty 13m shares.
Bryant in demand
Bryant Group, the West Midlands based housebuilder, provided a welcome
relief from the recent series of dividend cuts, falling profits and hefty
provisions now commonplace in the contracting area of the market.
A near-doubling of profits, from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 20.3m, and a same
again dividend triggered a sharp rise in the shares, which ran up to 93p
before easing back to settle a net 8 ahead at 89p. Turnover in the stock was
a good 1.8m shares. Building specialists said the results were at the top
end of the market range.
Mr Mark Hake, building analyst at Nikko Securities, said that while the
market accepted that Bryant was undoubtedly one of the best-run contracting
groups in the sector, 'much of the good news is already in the price'.
Racal/Chubb
'Grey market' activity commenced in 'Racal Special-Ex' and 'Chubb When
Issued', the two stocks that will emerge from the split of Chubb from Racal
Electronics when it becomes effective on October 5, subject to shareholder
approval.
After the demerger Racal shares will be consolidated on a five-for-one
basis. For every five Racal shares held on October 2, shareholders will
recieve one consolidated Racal share and one Chubb share.
Racal Special-Ex traded at 141p early in the session but later slipped to
close at 134p, with 878,000 shares changing hands. Chubb When Issued
finished around 193p after strong turnover of 2.1m, including a single
purchase of 1m shares at 195p. Racal 'old' attracted keen support all day,
ending a busy session 2 1/4 higher at 65 3/4 p after 9.6m traded.
Upgrades in Thorn EMI continued, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew the latest to move
its figures. UBS was said to be recommending a switch out of Rank
Organisation and into Thorn. Kleinwort Benson was also said to have raised
its expectations for Thorn, whose shares jumped 27 to 747p.
In addition, there was speculation that the group's talks with Williams
Holdings concerning the sale of Thorn's lighting business had made progress.
Rank, which benefited from interest rate cut hopes, rose 7 to 546p.
Merchant banks ran up strongly, reflecting the remarkable upsurge in
institutional activity in the markets last week, but did not hold their best
levels.
Among the fund management groups, Templeton Galbraith put on 10 to 339p, M &amp;
G 23 to 537p and Mercury Asset Management 11 to 304p.
Refuge Assurance's preliminary results and new business figures were given a
warm reception in the market, with the shares closing 20 higher at 670p.
Insurance brokers drew further strength from the latest rally by the dollar.
Lloyd Thompson, reporting this morning, moved ahead 14 to 207p and Lowndes
Lambert put on 16 to 272p.
Lasmo surged ahead again, closing 12 1/2 up at 160p on heavy turnover of
5.4m. US and domestic institutions remained focused on the benefits to Lasmo
of the continued steep decline in sterling against the dollar.
BP, responding to vague hints that the group may yet attract the attentions
of a predator, gained 4 1/2 at 219p on 19m traded. British Gas was barely
changed at 235p with 16m shares changing hands.
Utilities, widely viewed by the market as defensive stocks and immune to
currency shifts, were roughly handled.
Strong two-way business was seen in British Steel, with UK investors taking
profits after last week's good performance but demand from US buyers once
again a feature. Turnover expanded to 20m as the shares added 3 1/4 at 67p.
On its first day as a non FT-SE constituent, British Aerospace bounced 7 to
196p on speculation that a deal with Taiwan Aerospace concerning BAe's
regional aircraft division would be announced shortly. Talk, however, that
the company will reveal big provisions when it reports interim figures
tomorrow continued to circulate.
Investors were still taking a poor view of Vickers ahead of Thursday's
figures and the shares surrendered a further 3 to 85p. Vague bid talk was
heard in Avon Rubber, finally 32 stronger at 355p. Lucas Industries moved
forward 7 to 101p in brisk trade of 9.8m shares.
Among transports, P &amp; O was a good market and volume reached 3.4m with the
shares closing at 361p ex-dividend.
News that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its Suprane drug
helped lift BOC, the shares climbing 14 to 684p. Hickson International was
knocked in late trading following a fire at a plant in Yorkshire. The shares
dropped 11 to 183p.
There were further good gains across the board in the contracting and
building materials areas.
Tarmac, scheduled to report interims today, finished unchanged at 70p ahead
of an expected lapse into losses of up to Pounds 20m, plus a deep cut in the
dividend. Barratt Developments, where many analysts are looking for a return
to profitability when it publishes preliminary numbers tomorrow, moved up 6
to 50p.
A large line of stock, said to be held by Swiss Bank Corporation, unsettled
Cadbury Schweppes shares, which retreated 15 to 464p xd.
Tesco lost ground following adverse press comment ahead of its results, due
today. Analysts expect to downgrade the supermarket group following tough
trading conditions. The shares later recovered to close steady at 225p.

FT  22 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Advance checked as optimism cools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGHLY erratic session in UK equities yesterday left share prices drifting
lower as investors suspected that their enthusiasm for substantial
reductions in domestic interest rates might have been overdone.
Lukewarm Maastricht treaty support in France, discouraging comments on
interest rate prospects from the Bundesbank president, and the con-tinued
slide in sterling all suggested that the two percentage-point cut in UK base
rates effectively factored into the UK market last week might have to be
postponed.
However, it was only the timing of such interest rate cuts which came under
scrutiny. Market strategists remained convinced that base rates will come
down and that yesterday's fall of 6.9 points to 2,560.1 in the FT-SE Index
represented nothing more than mild profit-taking in a stock market which has
risen by nearly 10 per cent since the middle of last week and has attracted
heavy investment interest from the institutions.
The final picture did little justice to a session which saw the Footsie
trade through a near 50-point turnround. The day started early, with some
marketmakers open for telephone trading at 6.30am, when shares moved up
quickly as they reflected an optimistic response to the French Maastricht
vote and US buying orders which had been left with brokers overnight, on
instructions to 'buy if the French vote yes'. The Footsie is not calculated
at that hour but dealers estimated the early gain at around 25 points.
Then, at 8.30am, the Seaq electronic system was switched on and the Footsie
was immediately pulled back by ex-dividend quotations on 15 per cent of its
components, including such big names as Shell Transport, Glaxo and Guinness.
UK institutions then took a look at share prices boosted by their US
counterparts and decided not to play. Within a few moments, the early gain
had been replaced by a fall of 15.1 on the first official cal-culation of
the Footsie.
Five minutes later, the stock index futures market opened and a strong
premium on the December contract on the FT-SE Index, which took over
leadership only on Friday, reignited some of the buying frenzy seen in
equities last week.
Some London analysts believed that comments by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer, following the International Monetary Fund
meeting in Washington gave some encouragement for the market's base rate
hopes. By mid-morning, the Footsie was 44.2 points up.
However, suggestions that rates might be cut during the course of yesterday
soon faded. The market topped out and traded less aggressively for the rest
of the day. Later, refusal by Mr Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, to
make any forecast of future interest rate reductions was taken as a signal
for profit-taking.
Seaq trading volume reached 953.4m shares yesterday, below the 1bn-plus
figures recorded last Thursday and Friday. Retail business on Friday was
worth Pounds 2.8bn, making a total of Pounds 6.5bn since last Tuesday.

FT  22 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand for stock index futures early in the session tailed off at
mid-morning, leaving the contract to move erratically for the rest of the
day, writes Joel Kibazo.
The December contract on the FT-SE was in demand from the moment it opened
at 2,620, with Salomon, the US securities house, said to have been the main
buyer, sending the contract sharply forward.
The buying interest, however, tailed off by mid-morning, leaving December to
drift lower over the next few hours. By lunchtime the contract had fallen to
2,590, which proved to be the low of the day.
Renewed buying shortly after led to a squeeze which helped curtail some of
the earlier losses, but this only proved to be a temporary respite. A dull
Wall Street, poor trading in the fixed interest markets and profit-taking
all combined to send December into retreat.
December closed at 2,607, around its fair value estimate to cash of about
45. Turnover fell to a modest 13,200.
Traded options remained busy though total volume, at 44,058 lots, was down
from last Friday's impressive 73,698. Some 19,998 contracts were dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option, while Tesco was the day's busiest stock option.

FT  22 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow softens on doubts over EC
prospects
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
SHARE PRICES eased slightly in light trading yesterday as investors
struggled to digest the implications for US markets of the French referendum
on the Maastricht agreement, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 6.22 at
3,320.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.79 to 422.14, while the Nasdaq
composite lost 0.54 at 588.58. NYSE turnover was 154m shares.
The narrow margin in the French vote on Maastricht  - 51 per cent in favour
of the agreement, 49 per cent against  - eased tensions on world financial
markets, but in the eyes of US investors the result failed to clear away
doubts about the long-term viability of either the treaty or the whole
question of closer European economic integration. Analysts said the key was
the future direction of German interest rates.
Equity market sentiment was also undermined by the dollar's weakness and
losses on domestic bond markets. The US currency slid about 1 1/2 pfennigs
to DM1.4835 as international investors bought D-Marks following the French
vote, while fears that lower interest rates in Europe might rekindle
inflationary pressures in the world economy left US Treasury prices lower.
The benchmark 30-year bond was down half a point in early afternoon trading
but recovered to end only a quarter-point lower.
Those same fears of inflation have led some analysts to suggest that
investors might shift out of interest rate-sensitive sectors of the stock
market and into cyclical areas such as energy and technology stocks to
protect against the long-term threat of higher prices worldwide.
Among the busiest stocks yesterday was insurance group Travelers. After a
delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side, the stock jumped
Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 in turnover of 2.2m shares as investors
welcomed Sunday's news that financial services group Primerica had invested
Dollars 722.5m in Travelers in return for a 27 per cent stake in the
troubled insurer. The market was particularly impressed by the news that Mr
Sanford Weill, chairman of Primerica, will play a key role in the running of
Travelers' operations. Primerica was down in early trading but ended Dollars
 1/4 ahead on balance at Dollars 41 1/8 .
AT&amp;T put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 in spite of broking house
Paine-Webber lowering its 1993 earnings estimate for the telecommunications
giant because of sluggishness in equipment sales. PaineWebber still has a
'buy' rating out on the stock, however.
Canada
A RENEWED drop in the Canadian dollar returned traders' thoughts to domestic
ills and pulled Toronto stocks sharply lower. The long-awaited Maastricht
vote in France ended up having little direct effect on the market.
Investors instead were concerned about Canada's own referendum on the unity
deal. Former prime minister Mr Pierre Trudeau entered the debate with an
article slamming the deal.
The TSE 300 index fell 25.0 to 3,420.0 and declines led rises by 363 to 212
after volume of 27.4m shares.

FT  22 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Investors sell on outcome of
Maastricht vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES returned to basics, writes Our Markets Staff. Having risen last week
on the prospect of a French Yes vote on the Maastricht treaty, they sold
yesterday on the outcome and the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index fell by 1.75 per
cent.
The French franc came under pressure again, shaking the Paris bourse as
French and Spanish ministers pushed for another cut in German interest rates
and the Bundesbank continued to stall
Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, saw a difficult choice
in prospect for the Franco-German alliance at the hard core of the ERM: 'If
the future of the Franc against the D-Mark becomes a matter of exploiting
tensions within the ERM rather than a rational valuation of one currency
against another,' he said, 'it could become a choice between theFranc
parity, and a DM easing.'
In the meantime, he said, dollar stocks and interest rate-sensitive
situations continued to appeal, but prospects were looking difficult for
cyclicals yet again.
PARIS retreated 3 per cent on the view that the wafer-thin majority in the
Maastricht vote was the worst possible outcome. Some analysts commented that
with the franc coming under intense pressure during the day there may well
have to be an increase in interest rates as the government acts to support
the currency. The CAC-40 index lost 56.88 to 1,826.06 in turnover of
FFr2.4bn.
Activity was further depressed by disappointing corporate results. Canal
Plus was one of the day's biggest losers, shedding 16.4 per cent following a
profits warning. The shares were briefly suspended after opening limit down,
and closed down FFr214 at FFr1090.00. Havas, which holds a 25 per cent stake
in the subscription television group, declined FFr37.80 or 7.6 per cent to
FFr454.80.
A profits warning from Club Mediterranee left the shares down FFr30.80, or
7.3 per cent at FFr392.20. Financials weakened with Societe Generale down
FFr21 to FFr521 and Paribas off FFr12.50 at FFr346.00.
FRANKFURT lost less than 1 per cent during the session, the DAX index
closing 14.47 lower at 1,573.86, but it followed late closing markets
further down in the afternoon.
Volume more than halved, from DM9.7bn to DM4.6bn. Banks, obviously interest
rate-sensitive, held their ground but carmakers, engineers and steels all
fell as dealers said that the D-Mark's rise in Europe had become a severe
threat to corporate earnings.
BMW, recently favoured against Volkswagen, dropped DM14.50 to DM537; the
tyremaker, Continental, whose margins may be under threat as the carmakers
squeeze their suppliers, ended DM8 lower at DM241. In engineering, Linde
dropped DM19 to DM755 and in steels, which face a new 7.5 per cent annual
wage demand from IG Metall, Hoesch dropped DM13.50 to DM200.
MILAN rose by nearly 3 per cent in an early rally, closed the official
session with the Comit index 4.77, or 1.3 per cent higher at 380.28, and
ended in the London post-bourse with the Italian component of the Eurotrack
100 down by 2.7 per cent in lira terms.
The French vote did nothing for the lira, or prospects for Italy's interest
rates.
Profit-taking during the session hit Credito Italiano and Nuovo Pignone, the
two privatisation candidates, which fell by 2.8 per cent, and 4.7 per cent
respectively.
AMSTERDAM remained resilient against other European markets as the CBS
Tendency index lost just 0.6 to 113.0. Mr Philip van den Berg, Dutch analyst
at Goldman Sachs, said that the stronger dollar and hopes of lower German
interest helped the market resist a steeper fall.
Elsevier came back after suffering from last week's merger announcement with
Reed of the UK and the shares picked up Fl 2.30 to Fl 105.00. Philips and
Royal Dutch also went against the trend, gaining Fl 70 cents and 60 cents
respectively to Fl 23.50 and Fl 148.60.
MADRID was disappointed in theMaastricht vote and the general index slipped
4.19 to 210.78 while the Ibex index was down 2.3 per cent. Turnover swelled
to Pta16bn.
Utilities were weak on concerns over the effect of devaluation on earnings,
as they have a lot of foreign currency debt in issue. Iberdrola I lost Pta35
to Pta685 in volume of 4.5m shares. Repsol fell Pta20 to Pta2,325 with 1.4m
shares traded as US investors switched into the convertible bond issue.
BRUSSELS followed neighbouring bourses lower as the Bel-20 index lost 6.36
to 1,123.88. Clabecq was the day's main feature, losing BFr230 or 30 per
cent at BFr550 but in low volume. The steel group said last week that it was
in partnership talks.
ZURICH saw rising Swiss franc money market rates and profit-taking in banks;
the SMI index, which peaked at 1,904.5 in early trading, closed 9.0 lower at
1,887.3.
OSLO fell in nervous trade, shipping shares leading the way down as
investors held back amid renewed concern over the European currencies and
higher Norwegian short-term money market rates. The all-share index fell
2.73 to 333.42 in thin trading with the shipping index down 5.96 to 284.04.
STOCKHOLM fell in late trading in spite of the central bank's lowering of
its marginal lending rate from 500 per cent to 50 per cent. The
Affarsvarlden index shed 13.6 to 745.1 in turnover of SKr380m.
Handelsbanken's B shares fell by SKr4 to SKr25 while Electrolux B shares
dropped SKr5 to SKr215 in turnover of SKr44bn.
VIENNA reversed direction towards the end of the day as the ATX index
finished up 4.03 at 839.73.

FT  22 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Politics move Pacific
Basin equities as Nikkei eases
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE AFTERNOON arbitrage selling left the Nikkei average lower yesterday, in
slow trading ahead of a national holiday tomorrow, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei shed 100.56 to 18,066.24, dragged down by the fall in the futures
market in the final hour, after setting a day's high of 18,414.09 in the
morning on dealer buying, and a low of 18,050.48 just before the close.
Volume was still thin, at 280m shares against 333m, as most institutional
investors remained inactive. Rises maintained a small lead over falls by 489
to 450, with 184 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first
section stocks closed a slight 1.46 up at 1,355.51. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 1.41 to 1,088.57.
Rumours that a second tier broker was liquidating an arbitrage portfolio
depressed the futures market. But traders said overall sentiment stayed firm
as many investors believe that public funds will be invested in the equity
market at the end of this month.
Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities said: 'It is a historically firm
period. Share price movements will be dependent on progress of the land
buying corporation and interest rate movements.' Last week's comments by
Prime Minister Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, supporting the use of public funds to
finance a Japanese version of the Resolution Trust Corp-oration in the US,
have indicated that the plans for the establishment of the organisation are
progressing.
Trading was short term. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the day's most active
issue, fell Y30 to Y440 on profit-taking. Mining shares gained last week on
reports of a gold mine discovery in southern Japan.
Aoki, the construction company, jumped Y46 to Y550 on active buying. The
issue will replace Nippon Stainless Steel later this week as a component of
the Nikkei 225-stock average. Speculators sought issues rumoured as
candidates for inclusion in the near future. Minebea rose Y16 to Y500 and
Seika, a machinery trader, advanced Y26 to Y684.
Itoman, the Osaka based textile trading concern, did not trade due to the
lack of buyers, and closed offered at Y268, down Y80. The company, under
financial restructuring due to losses on its extensive property and stock
speculation, last week announced that it will be merged with Sumikin Bussan,
a steel trading subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Industries, a core company of
the Sumitomo group, which is aiding the restructuring.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 92.87 to 19,484.02 in volume of 14.8m
shares. Roundup
DOMESTIC AND international politics had a lot to do with the way markets in
the region moved yesterday.
BANGKOK trading attained a new record, and stocks climbed by 4 per cent on
weekend progress towards the formation of a new government coalition,
following the general election nine days ago.
The busiest day in the 17-year history of the Thai stock market saw turnover
of Bt22.62bn as the SET index closed 33.30 higher at 868.75, bringing the
total gain to 15 per cent since September 1.
HONG KONG was pleased with the French Yes vote on Maastricht, and the Hang
Seng index added 52.21 at 5,741.53, following Friday's 51-point gain, as
turnover eased from HKDollars 1.81bn to HKDollars 1.754bn.
Conglomerates and properties showed above-average rises.
AUSTRALIA was also influenced by the French vote, as well as by stronger
markets abroad last Friday. The All Ordinaries index firmed 7.9 to 1,531.6
but turnover was thin, falling from ADollars 166m to ADollars 136m as
investors awaited international reaction to European events.
SEOUL dropped 3.5 per cent amid political uncertainty. The composite index
shed 19.01 to 521.54 in active turnover of Won240bn on the after-shock
following President Roh Tae-woo's decision last week to leave the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party and form a neutral cabinet to ensure fairness in
the presidential election late this year.
BOMBAY saw heavy selling after last week's gains, the BSE index losing
108.88, or 3.2 per cent, to 3,274.74. MANILA blamed flash floods in the city
as the composite index slid 10.68 to 1,410.65.
TAIWAN heard that Lei Po-lung, who plays a leading role in a TDollars 8.1bn
default case, had been arrested on Sunday and that Oung Ta-ming, textile
tycoon and head of the Hualon group, was too ill to attend a court hearing
yesterday, and the weighted index receded 88.03 to 3,481.90 after a
132-point gain on Saturday.

FT  22 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Devaluation brings divergence to
bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European bourses diverged last week as currency turmoil pushed the UK, Italy
and Spain into devaluation. With the FT-Actuaries World Indices measured in
local currency terms, fluctuations in these markets tended to obscure clear
gains in the strong D-Mark bloc - Germany, the Benelux countries and
Switzerland - and in France.
In dollar terms, however, another picture emerges which reflects the
comparative strengths and weaknesses of European currencies. In these terms,
Austria, which is also firmly locked into the D-Mark, stands out as one of
last week's best performers, while the UK's 8.5 per cent gain in sterling is
translated into a fall of 1.8 per cent, reflecting its effective 13 per cent
depreciation since last week. Similarly, Italy is 8.2 per cent weaker in
dollar terms.
Austria's solid performance was made in an illiquid market, with very little
foreign or domestic institutional activity, said Mr James Stratton of
Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott in London. Turnover was higher than average
throughout the week, but much of the trading came from short-covering and
interbank business. 'There was also the fact that the market was due for a
technical correction,' he said, 'having dropped some 30 per cent from its
high earlier this year.'
The situation in Italy, where last Monday's devaluation led the BCI index to
an eight-year low on Wednesday in exceptionally large turnover of some
L200bn, was followed by a rally as the market welcomed Thursday's tough
budget proposals. There was also some satisfaction, said Marie Christine
Keith, Italian analyst at County NatWest, that the lira had left the ERM.
However, in spite of the budget measures receiving support from
non-coalition parties, which may ease their passage through parliament, the
release of a batch of first-half results over the next few weeks is expected
to bring further disappointment.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES IN the sterling cash market softened considerably yesterday, as
dealers wondered whether the Bundesbank's support of the French franc in the
European exchange rate mechanism might force the German central bank to cut
short-term interest rates.
With the UK out of the ERM, the result of the French referendum on the
Maastricht treaty had little impact on the sterling money market. Indeed,
one dealer commented yesterday that a No vote might have made the market
more bullish about the prospect of a UK base rate cut. That result would
have split the ERM apart, and other central banks could have reduced lending
rates.
Although sterling is floating freely, the UK authorities have not yet
outlined what their policy on the currency is. The market's assumption is
that base rates will soon be lowered by at least  1/2 percentage point, and
3-month money ended yesterday at 9 7/16 per cent on the offered side, after
a Friday close of 10 1/2 per cent.
One factor which might allow the UK to cut rates with impunity would be a
fall in the Bundesbank's Lombard rate. This is still deemed unlikely in the
near term, and yesterday the Bundesbank cancelled this week's tender for
securities and repurchase funds, effectively draining DM20bn from the
market. This move helped to sterilise the massive intervention by the
Bundesbank on the foreign exchanges recently to support the lira and dollar.
However, overt support for the French franc from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, suggests that the Germans do not want to see the EMS
fall apart. Given the continuing pressures on the ERM, some dealers
suspected yesterday that the Bundesbank could be forced to cut rates to prop
up the remaining currencies.
The Bank of England was quick to confirm that there would be no interest
rate cut yesterday. After forecasting an Pounds 800m shortage, the Bank
calmed the market by buying Pounds 200m in a repurchase agreement (repo) at
9 15/16 per cent at the established rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank then
purchased Pounds 126m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 200m
in a repo.
The forecast was revised to Pounds 950m and the Bank bought Pounds 116m of
Band 1 bank bills and provided Pounds 330m late assistance.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc remains under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France inter-vened to support the franc on the foreign exchanges
for the third trading day running yesterday, but the currency remained under
pressure in Europe's exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
France's decision to vote Yes to European monetary union, even though it was
by the slimmest of majorities, probably saved the ERM from an instant
realignment. The strains in the system have not disappeared, however, and
the French franc was one of a number of currencies which the market tested
yesterday, in spite of a big rally in the immediate aftermath of the
referendum result.
The franc was supported by heavy intervention from the Bank of France, when
the currency was a centime above its ERM floor. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, said the franc was a healthy and stable currency, in
contrast to the ambiguous comments he reputedly made about sterling last
week. The fundamental strength of the French economy, including its strong
trade balance, also makes the currency more resistant to pressure.
However, analysts believe that, in the current climate, the franc's future
remains uncertain. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corp in
London, said there is still a 25 per cent chance that the pressure on the
franc could turn into a full-blown crisis. Mr Mike Gallagher, director of
economic research at the IDEA group, said pressures are likely to intensify
until German interest rates are cut. Last night the franc closed at
FFr3.4150 to the D-Mark, 1 1/2 centimes above its ERM floor against the
German unit.
Even if the franc holds in the ERM, several other European currencies are
under pressure. According to Mr O'Neill, the next most vulnerable is the
Irish punt, which closed in London at DM2.6210, just  1/2 pfennig above its
ERM floor.
More worrying for the Irish authorities is the punt's higher rate against
the devalued British pound. Analysts said the Irish authorities are unhappy
to allow it to rise above IPounds 1.05 to the UK currency, because more than
40 per cent of Irish trade is with the UK. Last night the punt had
strengthened to IPounds 1.03.
Both sterling and the Italian lira were victims of heavy selling following
the uncertain French referendum result, and the Bank of Italy confirmed that
it would not re-enter the ERM as originally planned.
Sterling ended in London 7 1/2 pfennigs down from Friday's close at
DM2.5375, an historic low against the D-Mark and an effective 14 per cent
devaluation from the old ERM central rate. According to the IDEA research
group, the pound could go as low as DM2.33 before the end of the year.
The Italian lira finished at L845.2 per D-Mark, after a previous close of
L836.1.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (9): Yes, we have too many bananas -
Farmers are switching to new products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Belize has taken to buying old bulls in an effort to beef
up its livestock industry.
It buys them from farmers, and then provides the farmers with access to
younger stock of a higher quality.
Small livestock farmers can also benefit from the loan of a young cow. When
the beast has gained significant weight it is sold, with the farmer keeping
the value added while it was in his care.
Such innovations are part of Belize's attempt to deal with three problems
which trouble agriculture:
over-reliance on the traditional and now uncertain sectors of sugar, bananas
and citrus;
high operating costs;
access to credit for small farmers.
'Farm credit is a major problem for agriculture,' says Mr Michael Espat, the
minister of agriculture and fisheries.
'Commercial banks are not keen to give credit to the sector, and are
interested more in short term credit at high interest rates. We are trying
to get a small farmers' bank established which will give loans at 8 per
cent, against the market rate of 12 per cent to 13 per cent. It will be
established with BDollars 5m from the divestment of the government's
holdings in state enterprises.'
Bankers say there is no reluctance to lend for agriculture. 'People with
good projects and good track records are not turned away,' says Mr Geoffrey
Hart, the manager of Barclays Bank in Belize.
'The government's agencies handle many such loans and the farmers' bank is
planned. These are more than adequate for developmental purposes in Belize.'
In spite of these problems, non-traditional agriculture has been expanding.
Beef production, for example, has grown to allow exports, on the hoof, over
the border to Mexico's Cancun province.
Mr Espat reports that the country is self-sufficient in poultry meat and
eggs, and an expected 50 per cent increase in rice production this year,
lifting output to 15m pounds, will satisfy local demand.
The country's proximity to the US and Canada offers a growing market for
tropical and exotic fruit. Officials report increasing local and foreign
interest in cashews, pineapples, ginger, papayas and avocado.
More significant, however, is the promise of continuing expansion of seafood
production and exports, and which earned the country BDollars 20m last year,
15 per cent more than 1990.
Lobster, shrimp and fish are finding markets in North America, Europe and
the Far East.
Shrimp exports are set for significant growth in volume from last year's
500,000 pounds. Two shrimp farms have been established which, at full
production, will each produce 1m pounds a year.
In addition to their headaches over credit, farmers face a few other
difficulties. Although official figures point to a labour surplus, the
farming sector has difficulty finding enough workers.
The shortage has been eased by the influx of refugees from Belize's
neighbours, who are willing to do work refused by some native Belizeans.
Expansion of agro-industry is also difficult. The minimum wage of Belizean
workers is twice as big as in neighbouring countries.
Electricity costs will remain high for several years until a hydro-electric
station which is being constructed becomes fully operational.
Large-scale, commercial processing and refrigeration of meat products, for
example, is not attractive.
'The inputs for agriculture in Belize are very costly,' says Mr Joe Smith,
director of agricultural projects. 'There is a high cost for fuel, wages and
chemicals, for example, and this puts agriculture at a significant
disadvantage.'
In spite of the promise of rapid and significant expansion in the
non-traditional products, Belizean agriculture will continue to depend for
some time on its main sectors. But these face an uncertain future. Sugar,
bananas and citrus are dependent on preferential markets in North America
and Europe.
Current changes in international commerce such as the global tendency to
freer trade, the emergence of the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA),
and the creation of a single European market in January all threaten a
sector which accounts for one fifth of the economy.
Raw sugar, totalling just over 91,000 tonnes last year, is sold under quota
to the European Community and the US,and at prices significantly higher than
those prevailing on the world market.
The country also sells to the world market after domestic demand has been
satisfied. While there is no immediate concern over the future of the EC
sugar quota, there are already doubts over continuing preferential access to
the US with the emergence of NAFTA. Indications of increased access to the
US for Mexican sugar has left Belize and its neighbours concerned that their
quotas will be phased out.
There is similar concern about exports of orange and grapefruit concentrate,
most of which go to the US under a preferential trade programme for several
Caribbean Basin countries.
Easier access to the US for the Mexican product will damage Belizean citrus
which suffered last year from poor weather, but which is expected to do
better this year. Like other traditional suppliers of bananas to the EC,
Belize is caught up in a battle to retain preferential access after next
January.
Its neighbours, who produce at a lower cost, are arguing for an open market
on which the Belizean fruit will not be able to compete. 'We have been told
our access to the EC will be at the 1990 level of our exports but the
growers are asking for the access to be at that which we expect to be
exporting in 1997,' says Mr Espat. '1990 was a bad year for exports as
floods and disease depressed production.'
The acreage under bananas has expanded by a third since 1989, and the
industry's goal is to lift exports to 100,000 tonnes, six times the 1989
level, by 1997.
While agriculture has a central role in the country's economy, there is no
political consensus about its future. 'We have a simple economic plan, and
that is to grow as much food as we can,' says Mr George Price, the prime
minister. 'We must meet our local demand for food, and then look to
exporting.'
Mr Manuel Esquivel, the opposition leader, disagrees: 'there is over
dependence on agriculture in the economy,' he argues. 'Agriculture is
important, but we cannot hang our hat on this alone as we cannot do anything
about the market.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (11): Beautiful, multi-faceted jewel - The
country's 450 cayes are a paradise for scuba divers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD JOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATION and tourism have become almost synonymous in Belize. Mr Glenn
Godfrey, minister of tourism, calls the country a beautiful, multi-faceted
jewel.
It boasts the longest barrier reef in the western hemisphere, and has 450
beautiful cayes which are a paradise for snorkellers and scuba divers. It
also has some of the best preserved rain forests in the world in spite of
extensive logging, as well as the beautiful Mayan mountains and their
archaeological remains.
Government tourism policy does not aim at large-scale ritzy developments
such as Mexico's Cancun and Ixtapa but smaller-scale projects, where
possible under Belizean ownership and retaining maximum added value for the
country while respecting its traditional, eccentric social fabric.
The commitment to conservation has developed in a fairly haphazard,
incoherent way. Foreign institutions have played a significant role - most
notably the World Life Conservation International, an offshoot of the New
York Zoological Society. Nationally, the driving force has been the Belize
Audebon Society.
US conservationists are concerned about birds which emigrate north. Experts
believe Belize may have as many as 500 species, many of which are
endangered.
Individuals have also played a big part in conservation projects. Alan
Rabinovitch's fanatical and hair-raising research on jaguars and determined
lobbying led to the establishment of the Cockscomb basin wildlife reserve
where up to 100 are believed to survive.
Another notable contributor has been Dr Robert Horwich who helped establish
the somewhat inaptly named Community Baboon Sanctuary devoted to the
threatened Black Howler monkey.
He has also assisted in resettling the primates at Cockscomb where they were
wiped out by yellow fever and Hurricane Hattie.
The Programme for Belize, funded with foreign donations, now has 200,000
acres under management in the Rio Bravo area. Coca Cola Foods donated 92,000
acres having purchased the land from Mr Barry Bowen, a leading entrepreneur.
The company renounced plans to plant citrus there after German
conservationists objected.
In turn, Mr Bowen, has cleared only 2,200 acres of his magnificent jungle
territory, leaving another 130,000 virgin for the cause and adjoining the
Rio Bravo estate. At the last official count Belize had 33 reserves under
varying degrees of protection and management totalling 2.2m acres or about a
quarter of the country's territory.
'Everyone has been encouraged by the reaction of the public,' says Mrs Janet
Gibson, who is assisting the fisheries department in drawing up the coastal
zone management plan.
Developments on the coastal strip are threatening a vital eco-system
including the mangroves with their capacity to contribute to fisheries. They
cover an estimated 80 per cent of the shoreline. The fate of the manatee, or
sea cow, and other marine creatures, are also at stake. Ambergris is the
main tourist centre but it is overpriced and has serious water and sewage
problems. A plan to increase its potential is about to be submitted to the
cabinet.
Belize's small population is probably the main reason why it remains an
environmental paradise. However, this could be threatened by demographic
changes, which may result from the arrival of some 40,000 Guatemalan and
Salvadorean refugees.
They, like the indigenous Mayans (about 11 per cent of the population),
practise slash-and-burn agriculture while shooting and eating monkeys and
parrots.
Devising ways of tapping timber resources without wholesale destruction of
forests is also a problem. So, too, is finding the manpower resources to
police the reserves.
For the time being, therefore, it may be advantageous that the country's
tourist infrastructure remains relatively undeveloped.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (10): Chewing gum regains its old-time
flavour - Forestry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANGING tastes of gum chewers are playing a small part in the
revitalisation of Belize's once valuable market for forest products.
The country had been a significant supplier of chicle, the base for chewing
gum, but lost the market to synthetic substitutes. Chewers again favour the
natural material and Belize is looking at an increase in chicle production.
There is unlikely to be any similar expansion in the export of other
forestry products, including hardwoods and dyes, which were once the
mainstay of the economy.
This activity, and the use of 'slash and burn' techniques by peasant
farmers, damaged significant areas of woodland. Now there is a more
enlightened approach with the emphasis on sustainable development which
seeks a careful balance between exploitation and natural and artificial
regeneration of the forest.
The concerns were dramatically illustrated a few years ago when
environmentalists objected to plans by the Coca Cola Company of the US to
grow citrus on a large tract of land it had bought in Belize.
There were threats to boycott Coca Cola products internationally. The
company balked and presented the land as a nature reserve to the Programme
for Belize, a private, non-profit corporation which is trying to achieve a
balance between conservation and sustainable economic development over the
200,000 acres which it manages.
'We are trying to get sustainable forest projects in which there is a
balance between the business aspect and concern for the environment,' says
Ms Joy Grant, managing director of the Programme for Belize. 'For example,
we would like to extract chicle and manufacture gum locally.'
Belize's forests are also being put to work by the growing tourist industry,
in particular, for holidays with an environmentalist theme. Officials say
nature trails have become more popular and that Belize has a growing
reputation among bird watchers and nature lovers.
Traditional forest industries still continue, but at a reduced level. 'There
is production of pine, mahogany, rosewood and a range of hardwoods,' reports
Mr Joe Smith, director of agricultural projects. 'These are used for local
industry and some for export. Resin from pine is being extracted and
exported for use in chemicals and adhesives.'
Exports of sawn wood products last year reached 3.8m board feet, 65 per cent
more than 1990 exports. The trend is continuing, with exports in the second
quarter of this year being 25 per cent higher than the same period of 1991.
The government is keen on adding value to exports by increasing the quantity
of processed wood and furniture, while reducing shipments of sawn timber.
The production of wood veneers has started, but the forestry sector suffers
from inadequate curing milling and facilities.
'It is the concern over the indiscriminate use of the forest which has
caused the decline in the export of forest products over the past few
years,' explains Mr Smith. 'The forest has not yet fully recovered from
exploitation. Our approach to forestry now is more enlightened because of
our concern over the impact on the environment.'

VISITORS arriving at the international airport see an immediate and graphic
illustration of Belize's relations with its neighbours.
On either side of the runway and around the airport are camouflage netting,
anti-aircraft guns, helicopters and fighter aircraft ready for action.
The trappings of the British military garrison in Belize, they represent a
passing phase in the country's foreign policy. The garrison's purpose had
been to deter aggression by Guatemala which had threatened to invade in
pursuit of a 130-year-old territorial claim.
Now, however, Belize and Guatemala are heading towards a diplomatic solution
of their differences. Belize is also hoping to make friends of other Central
American countries which had backed Guatemala's claim. The role of the
British troops will then change: they are likely to stay for training
purposes.
Belize is both Caribbean and Central American. It sits between two regions
which have been economically, politically and culturally poles apart.
Once the dispute with Guatemala is settled, Belize should be able to act as
an economic and political bridge between its immediate neighbours and the
archipelago to the east.
It is a member of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) which is
struggling to create a customs union, a monetary union and a common market.
It shares with its antillean neighbours many of the economic difficulties
and uncertainties of small economies. Belize might even become involved in
other efforts at economic integration, such as the emerging common market in
Central America.
Mr George Price, Belize's prime minister, and his predecessor in office, Mr
Manuel Esquivel, have attended summits of the Caribbean Community. Recently,
Mr Price was invited to observe summits of Belize's Latin neighbours.
'Belize is now is a position to do more in Central America because we have
now established diplomatic relations with Guatemala,' says the prime
minister. 'There have been two meetings of Caribbean and Central American
ministers to discuss bananas. Belize has also attended two Central American
summits.'
The West Indian Commission, which has been studying ways of increasing the
level of integration of Caribbean economies, also concluded that Belize can
play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between the Caribbean and Central
America.
'A further objective of Caricom policy must be the exploration of possible
levels of economic relationships with the Central American countries,' the
Commission concludes. 'Here, in fact, are the makings of a system of
competition between the two sub-groupings of the Caribbean Basin  .. in
industrial and agricultural exports.'
It says that thanks to its location and its political inclinations Belize is
naturally at the forefront of co-operation between the two regions. But Mr
Esquivel feels that too much is being made of the role which Belize can play
in bringing the Caribbean and Central America closer together.
Belize, he says, cannot be an effective bridge between the two regions
because it has no influence in Central America. 'Because of the Guatemalan
claim we have been ostracised by Central America and we have kept out of
Central American affairs, so we cannot claim any influence in Central
America,' he concludes.
'Our political and economic influence in the Caribbean is minimal as well
because of our geography. Rather than being a bridge, we are desperately
trying to straddle two regions to keep our balance.' There is one very real
and seemingly intractable problem which divides the Caribbean islands and
Central America, and which could determine the value of a friendship with
Belize.
The creation of a single European market in January has put a question mark
over the preferential market for bananas which Belize, the Caribbean islands
and other developing countries have in Europe. The EC is struggling with a
formula which satisfies the desires of the traditional suppliers, such as
Belize, to maintain preferential access, while meeting the demands of the
tendency towards freer international trade, as being demanded by Latin
American producers, including Belize's immediate neighbours.
The disagreement threatens to abort any hopes of meaningful co-operation
between the Caribbean and Central America. Mr Price has attempted to close
the gap on bananas through meetings of government officials and ministers
from the two regions.
Inevitably, there has been effective technical co-operation between Belize
and its Central American neighbours. Matters such as dealing with Latin
America's cholera epidemic, a common approach to the problems of refugees in
the region, and restoration and preservation of Amercan Indian artefacts,
have provided ground for Belize's integration into the region in the wake of
better relations with Guatemala.
Mr Ismael Garcia, Belize's ambassador to Central America, has concluded that
there is now an opportunity for meaningful co-operation in trade and
agriculture. Belize once gained substantially from transhipment of exports
and imports for southern Mexico.
'Belize could prosper from the fact that it is English-speaking and could be
an entrepot such as Panama was,' says Mr Geoffrey Hart, the manager of
Barclays Bank in Belize. 'This country could, for example, warehouse
material for distribution to Central America. There are opportunities for
Belize to be Europe's gateway to North American Free Trade Area.'
The next stage in Belize's efforts at being a good neighbour, however, will
be determined by others. The Guatemalan government's proposals for resolving
the territorial dispute are being contested in a constitutional court. Much
hangs on the court's decision. Belize's relations with its Central American
neighbours still hinge on its ties with Guatemala.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (7): Haven for refugees - The open door
policy is under strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL AMERICA's dirty wars have left Belize with one of the world's least
known refugee problems: Belize has absorbed in 10 years an influx of
foreigners equivalent to one-fifth of its population.
In most countries, this would have brought about a surge of resentment and
possibly riots. In Belize, in part because of its sparse population, it has
been viewed with equanimity. There are signs, however, that the early
tolerance to the newcomers is wearing thin, which has forced the government
to shift its laisser faire stance on the issue.
According to Mr Ismael Garcia, the country's ambassador to central America
and Panama, most of the migrants to Belize are from El Salvador, accounting
for perhaps 75 per cent of the estimated 30,000 to 40,000 foreigners who
have entered Belize to settle.
Some 20 per cent are from Guatemala, and the remainder from Honduras and
Nicaragua. Honduras used to provide the seasonal workers for agriculture in
Belize but the place of these transient workers has now largely been taken
by more permanent residents.
Mr Garcia said refugee cards are held by about 7,500 heads of households,
suggesting perhaps 20,000 people would be officially defined as refugees.
The children of other migrants born in Belize would also be entitled to
citizenship.
Belize has never established refugee camps, and refugees are free to move
across the country. Many take over land and set up small farms, a practice
generally tolerated by the government. However, relations between the
previous government and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees did
at times become tense. They have since relaxed, with the government signing
in 1990 the UN convention of 1951 and the 1967 protocol that governs
refugees' rights.
The pace of immigration has slowed since the peak years in the mid-1980s.
With the prospect of peace settling over central America, some migrants have
started to trickle home.
However, there is little doubt that the settlers are overstretching the
country's education and health services. At least 60-70 per cent of the
people using Belmopan's hospital, for example, are migrants. An estimated 90
per cent of the immigrants to Belize are illiterate and unskilled.
Even though the migrants are recognised as making an important contribution
to the growth of the agricultural sector in the last decade - taking jobs
for pay most Belizeans would not consider working for - there is a growing
sentiment that the newcomers are depriving Belizeans of jobs.
The government's recent statements have reflected this disquiet. The foreign
minister, Mr Said Musa, said in June: 'The time has now come for us to make
a clear distinction between those who are genuine refugees and those who are
economic migrants.' This policy aims at restricting entry of economic
migrants and enforcing the law concerning illegal aliens. Voluntary
repatriation will be encouraged.
The policy is, however, more easily stated than enacted. The border between
Belize and Guatemala is highly porous and difficult to police, and the
prospect of round-ups of 'illegal aliens' is not one the government
relishes.
However, economics will continue to make Belize attractive for most central
American peasants: farm workers can more than double the Dollars 4 a day
they earn in Guatemala. Neither do the population pressures in the other
countries exist in Belize.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (8): Streams of history - Stephen Fidler
discusses the diverse ethnic mixture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO important developments are putting strains on the traditional harmonious
relations between Belize's diverse ethnic groups.
In the last decade, the country has absorbed between 30,000-40,000 migrants,
the equivalent of 20 per cent of its population, from elsewhere in central
America. Meanwhile, emigration to the US continues among Creoles, the group
that traditionally dominates the business and political elites.
These changes are having a profound impact on the country's economy and its
demographic make-up. The new settlers are putting pressure on the
overstretched hospital, social and education systems.
The ancestors of the Creole population carved out what in 1862 became the
colony of British Honduras from an Hispanic hinterland. But as a result of
the growing numbers of settlers, they fear that they are 'losing their
country' to Spanish speakers who form a majority of the population.
The migrants have, however, provided this sparsely-populated country with an
important resource, agricultural labour, which has underpinned the last
decade of growth. The Creoles have no tradition of agricultural work, partly
because they were discouraged from doing so by the British who were solely
interested in the region's logging potential, and prefer better-paying jobs
in management, transport and government.
Remittances from Belizeans in the US - amounting to an estimated Dollars
15m-17m a year, about 4 per cent of gross domestic product - also help to
balance the country's chronic trade deficit. But the emigration deprives the
country of many of the most promising products of its education system and
one-third of all Belizeans now live in the US.
Forty-four per cent of the population is under 15 years of age. A priority
for the government, according to the prime minister, Mr George Price, is to
encourage Belizeans to stay at home. But it will be a tough task. Just as
Belize's relative wealth provides an irresistible attraction to the poor
peasants of neighbouring Guatemala - Belize's per capita income is more than
double Guatemala's Dollars 900 a year - so the prospects of riches in the US
(whose per capita income is more than 10 times that of Belize) will continue
to lure Belizeans.
The country's main ethnic groups are as follows:
Creoles: this group now makes up slightly less than 30 per cent of the
population, according to the 1991 census, published this month. Speakers of
English and an English-derived patois, they are descendants of slaves
brought over from Jamaica and baymen, the British who settled around the Bay
of Honduras. They are concentrated around Belize City, where they make up
about 68 per cent of the population.
Mestizos: now the largest group, the mestizos account for just under 44 per
cent of the population, compared with 33.4 per cent who defined themselves
as of mixed blood in the previous census in 1980. This group, which speaks
Spanish as a first language, is largely descended from the mixed-blood
Mexicans and Mayan indians who fled Mexico in the 19th century. Their
numbers are being supplemented by more recent migrants, escaping conflict
and poverty in other parts of central America.
Garifunas: concentrated in the Stann Creek area to the south of Belize City,
the Garifunas are the descendants of mixed-blood Africans, Carib indians and
Europeans, who arrived in the area in the 19th century. Speaking English and
a language of their own, the Garinagu, as they call themselves, make up
about 6.6 per cent of the country's population, according to the 1991
census.
Mayans: people who define themselves as Indian or Mayan make up 14.6 per
cent of the population, according to the latest census. They are
concentrated in northern, western and southern Belize and form several
groups, some of whose languages are mutually incomprehensible. While an
effort is under way to preserve their culture, many are adopting Spanish or
English as a first language.
Mennonites: This group of fair-skinned Europeans began arriving from Mexico
and Canada in the late-1950s, seeking freedom of religion and freedom from
state interference. Concentrated in the north and north-west of the country
and retaining their German language, they make up 3.1 per cent of the
population. Easily recognised by the men's dark trousers and check shirts
and the women's long dresses and headscarves, the Mennonites have made
significant contributions to the country's agriculture.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (3): A dominating personality - Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MORE than 40 years, the politics of Belize has been dominated by one man
and one party. Mr George Price helped to form the People's United Party in
1949. This move - a response to the devaluation of the British Honduras
dollar which hit the pockets of Belizeans - established an anti-colonialist
party which the British originally viewed with suspicion.
This suspicion lifted over the next 15 years, and Belize would undoubtedly
have claimed full independence in the 1960s were it not for the Guatemalan
claim over Belize. In 1964, the country became self-governing, except for
foreign policy, defence and internal security. Full independence was gained
on September 21, 1981.
The PUP won the six general elections held from 1954 to 1979, losing to the
opposition United Democratic Party in 1984. Against the odds, it narrowly
won the 1989 general election - with a narrow 15-13 majority in the House of
Representatives. Its majority was strengthened after one opposition deputy
switched to the government benches.
Unmarried, austere and a devout Catholic, Mr Price, 73, is seen as likely to
fight the next election, which must be held by 1994. The prime minister, the
last of the generation of post-independence commonwealth leaders, has no
obvious successor within the party. Those seen as most likely to succeed him
are Mr Said Musa, foreign minister, and Mr Florencio Marin.
Although the party rhetoric would suggest otherwise, the policies of the two
main parties have proved hard to distinguish. Although ostensibly more
populist than the pro-market UDP, the PUP in government has followed similar
policies in favour of privatisation and continued investment.
This has calmed the disquiet among investors following the 1989 election
which the PUP won by appealing to nationalist sentiment with the slogan
'Belizeans first' and charges that the UDP had allowed foreign speculators
to dominate the economy. The US embassy's assessment of the investment
climate in the country remains 'excellent'.
Mr Manuel Esquivel, the UDP leader and former prime minister, agrees the
'PUP were more effective in fighting the election than we were'.
Since the election the opposition has split over the aimed-for settlement
with Guatemala, which Mr Esquivel's party has supported. A faction, led by
Mr Philip Goldson, a respected senior politician, has ceded from the UDP and
formed a new party, the National Alliance for Belizean Rights.
Mr Esquivel says his party sacrificed 'party integrity in favour of national
integrity' in supporting the government over the Guatemalan settlement. 'We
felt this was an opportunity to end this problem once and for all by making
a minor concession to solve a major problem.'
This may add to his problems in fighting the municipal elections in March.
But he says that in the the long run the UDP will not be hurt, since the
NABR is a one-issue party.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (2): Dependence on agriculture - Many
factors outside the country's control influence the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELIZE faces an array of formidable short-term economic challenges.
Presenting this year's budget to parliament, Mr George Price, the prime
minister and finance minister, said: 'Not only is Belize a much more
developing nation today, but we have started the process of preparing for
the challenges of the 21st Century.'
Many of the factors influencing the economy are outside the country's
control. However, the country appears much more capable than many of its
neighbours of dealing with the uncertainties of economic change.
The foreign debt of Belize, for example, is comparatively light. The per
capita debt of Dollars 750 is less than half that of Jamaica to the east.
And Guatemala, to the west, carries a ratio of debt service to exports of 25
per cent, against Belize's 8 per cent.
Businessmen credit the present government and its predecessors with managing
the economy in an enlightened way.
Some aspects of economic policy have aroused trenchant debate, but there has
been remarkable consistency in spite of changes of administration.
Greater efficiency and economic expansion appear to be the common
objectives. The economy is narrowly based on agriculture and tourism.
Expansion in both sectors last year led to overall growth of 4.2 per cent.
Inflation was 5.6 per cent against three per cent in 1990.
Last year, the economy grew at only half the average rate of the previous
three years. Officials feel that this is preferable to the risk of
overheating by over-rapid growth or of the inflationary tendencies in
neighbouring countries.
The economy's biggest weakness is its lopsidedness, being dangerously
dependent on agriculture which accounts for a fifth of the gross domestic
product and three quarters of the country's export earnings.
Agriculture has three main supports - cane sugar, bananas and citrus - with
seafood emerging as a fourth pillar. This is the focus of the uncertainty of
which Mr Price speaks.
Belize depends on preferential access to food markets, all of which are
subject to the globalisation of international trade. It sells sugar under
quota to the European Community and the US. There is no immediate threat to
its EC sugar market, but the emergence of the North American Free Trade Area
has raised questions about continued access to the US being thwarted by
Mexico.
Belize's citrus concentrate market, mainly in Florida, has been developed
within the protection of a trade programme under which the US allows
countries in the Caribbean Basin to ship a range of products duty free.
Belizeans officials fear Mexican citrus will kill their market - the same
fear they express for the small garment sector.
There is even more uncertainty over Belize's sales of bananas in Europe
following the creation in January of the EC's single market. Belize, and the
other traditional suppliers in the Caribbean Basin, are trying to maintain
preferential access in the face of demands from Latin American exporters
that there should be open trading in the fruit.
Higher wages and other costs make Belizean bananas more expensive, and less
able to compete with cheaper Latin fruit. Mr Ralph Fonseca, the junior
finance minister, says that while Belize is worried about the impact of free
trade on its export markets, it is not against the principle of free trade.
'Belize can respond to the changes, but we need time,' says Mr Fonseca.
'There must be a gradualist approach to all of this or small countries such
as ours will not be able to survive.'
The dangers were illustrated last year when poor weather depressed citrus
and bananas, and the global recession cut the number tourists, contributing
to the slowdown in economic growth.
Efforts are being made to widen the base of the economy. However, this is
impeded by some fundamental infrastructural deficiencies such as lack of
energy. High energy costs, for example, are an obstacle to an expansion of
agro-industry and commerce. A Dollars 180m hydro-power station is under
construction which, it is hoped, will provide more power more reliably, and
eventually at cheaper rates.
This, with expansion of the new offshore financial services sector, plans
for attracting foreign investment in information services and data
processing, and Belize's potential for being an entrepot for Central America
with the coming end of the territorial dispute with Guatemala, promise some
relief from the often fickle traditional sectors of the economy.
There is also a controversial trend towards privatisation of state
enterprises. The government has sold off the public telecommunications
company, and also plans to privatise the electricity utility.
There is even a possibility the main port in Belize City will go on sale,
followed, at some stage, by the country's international airport.
Mr Price talks of a 'dynamic partnership' between government and the private
sector, in which the private sector gains a bigger role and the government
concentrates on managing those things which it has to do.
'Privatisation is part of a gradual move to liberalise the economy in
keeping with what is happening in the rest of the world,' says Mr Fonseca.
However, his enthusiasm is not shared by Mr Manuel Esquivel, the opposition
leader. 'People who see what the government is doing have realised that this
is not a genuine privatisation,' he says. 'The government appears to be
making these decisions without regard to the consequences and to public
opinion. The government has not yet brought itself to say publicly that
privatisation is the result of a correct policy to which it is committed.'
Much of the debate over privatisation centres on Mr Michael Ashcroft,
chairman of the UK/Bermuda ADT Group, and whose Belize Holdings ,registered
as an offshore company, is a large investor in the telecommunications
industry.
Businessmen say they would not be surprised if Belize Holdings also took a
significant share in the power company. 'Privatisation so far is a compact
between the government and one individual, Mr Ashcroft,' claims Mr Esquivel.
This is denied by Mr Fonseca who says: 'It was Mr Esquivel's administration
which invited Mr Ashcroft to invest in Belize.'
Deregulation is also evident in parts of the foreign exchange market where
commercial banks are allowed to settle some current payments. No such
latitude is being allowed over more fundamental matters such as the exchange
rate which has been fixed at BDollars 2 to the US dollar since 1976.
However, there are also danger signals. The deficit on visible earnings has
been widening and last year there was an overall balance of payments deficit
for the first time in seven years.
There is also concern at trends in the fiscal accounts. 'We are concerned
over revenue and expenditure,' says Mr Keith Arnold, governor of the Central
Bank. 'Revenue growth is not improving but there is expansion in
expenditure, especially for wages and salaries and capital expenditure.'
Yet even these indicators cause little overt alarm. The general feeling is
that Belize is doing well.
'Economically, we are not running, but we are crawling,' says Mr Barry
Bowen, a leading businessman. 'We are babies and we are just beginning to
learn how to move.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (5): Change on the way - Banks and
financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE steady expansion of Belize's economy over the past decade has placed new
demands on its financial services sector.
Changes are being made to domestic banking and the government is putting
into place legislation to develop an offshore financial services sector.
The 20-year-old Banking Act has worked well, says Mr Keith Arnold, governor
of the central bank, but aspects of it need to be updated. The new act,
similar to legislation in the Caribbean islands, will be completed by the
end of next year.
'We are making sure that we do not encounter any problems, and we have
learned lessons from developments such as those which have accompanied the
operations of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,' says Mr
Arnold.
The new legislation will strengthen the central bank's supervisory systems,
allow greater protection of the clients of financial institutions, and
changes mandatory capital requirements. The impending changes, officials are
keen to emphasise, are merely protective.
Belize's one bank closure recently was that of a branch of a state-owned
Mexican institution which was divested. There are four commercial banks, two
of which are locally owned. 'The country is adequately banked and is
well-served by the number of banks it has,' says Mr Geoffrey Hart, the
manager of Barclays Bank in Belize.
New legislation is also planned to improve the country's offshore financial
services sector. 'We need to look at the possibilities of offshore banking,'
says Mr Arnold. 'We recently had a few inquiries about setting up offshore
banks in Belize but our legislation does not provide for these institutions
and we need the regulatory framework.'
The indications of interest in offshore banking followed the opening of an
International Business Companies register in 1990, similar to that of the
British Virgin Islands. The 350 companies registered so far do not pay taxes
and are not allowed to do business in Belize.
The emergent offshore business sector has also had success with its shipping
register which lists 129 vessels. New legislation has been enacted to
encourage the creation of trusts. 'This new law . . . applies to all trusts
including charitable, non-charitable purpose trusts and offshore trusts,'
explains Mr Glenn Godfrey, the attorney-general. 'The trustee is regarded as
non-resident in Belize for the purposes of exchange control.'
Thought was given by the government to the creation of a stock exchange, but
there was not enough business to support a market. An alternative was found
in the creation of public investment companies .

industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL considerations are likely to have a decisive influence over
the future of the energy industry, according to participants in the World
Energy Congress which began here yesterday.
It will shape the way energy companies operate, as well as the use to which
customers put their products. In each case, the industry could be the loser
through higher regulatory costs, or changing patterns of demand.
The industry's anxieties about environmental issues were set out by Mr David
Simon, the chief executive of BP, who said: 'There has been a change in the
standards demanded by customers - although not necessarily in the amounts
they are prepared to pay for them.'
He argued that oil companies were more environmentally aware than usually
given credit for. And by investing in new oil supplies they were
contributing towards the economic growth that enabled the world to afford
higher environmental standards. If the public did not like fossil fuels it
could always stop using them. But that was unrealistic. So the public must
expect prices to rise to pay for higher standards, or else the oil industry
would not be able to attract investment money.
Nor would a proposed carbon tax achieve desired environmental results,
especially if it was merely added to the range of taxes which already
distorted the energy market.
Mr Simon's keynote speech to the congress, held once every three years, was
accompanied by a forecast from the World Energy Commission that energy
supplies will be plentiful well into the next century, and that ecological
pressures could be the sharpest factor depressing energy demand.
Mr Henrik Ager-Hanssen, senior vice-president of Statoil, said this scenario
implied enormous increases in energy efficiency, particularly among former
communist countries, and the third world. But he doubted whether sufficient
quantities of technology and finance could be transferred to these countries
to achieve the necessary efficiency gains.
'There is major uncertainty as to whether or not such a development will be
given priority as compared to policy actions which are more energy-supply
oriented,' he said.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia faces Dollars 6.6bn bill
to update aluminium smelters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT USDollars 6.6bn was needed to update Russia's four biggest aluminium
smelters, Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing, for VAW
Aluminium, said yesterday. He suggested that a better use for the cash would
be the construction of three new smelters with a capacity of 400,000 tonnes
each.
Mr Peters said Russia's aluminium fabricating industry also required
substantial capital to convert defence-oriented plants to the production of
consumer products such as aluminium for cans and packaging materials. At
least one new hot mill was necessary with a capacity of 700,000 tonnes which
would cost Dollars 500m. About the same amount of capital was required for
other downstream aluminium projects.
'But who is prepared to spend substantial amounts of money for the Russian
aluminium industry?' asked Mr Peters. He said it was unlikely that foreign
governments would place a high priority on investment in the Russian
aluminium industry. But the western aluminium industry could perhaps help by
transfering technology to modernise smelters and fabricating plants, and
developing joint projects in line with western standards.
In a paper for Metal Bulletin's aluminium conference in Oslo, Mr Peters said
the Russian aluminium industry's main asset was the 25,000 megawatts of
power generated by hydro electric projects in the Yennisei area of Siberia.
The 14 aluminium smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States had a
total annual capacity of about 3.8m tonnes but they were 'physically
outdated - using old technologies with unattractive technical parameters'.
The smelters were not able to meet existing Russian pollution standards and
if environmental laws were enforced 'nearly all the smelters in Russia would
have to be closed or have to substantially reduce production'.
Mr Peters said that, even if three new aluminium smelters were built in
Russia, alumina, an essential raw material, would have to be transported
from the Japanese Sea, adding up to Dollars 300 a tonne to the cost of
aluminium production. This would have to be offset by 'nearly zero charges
for electricity'.
The CIS's ten alumina plants had a combined annual capacity of 5.25m tonnes
but were using processes which pushed production costs up to 100 to 260 per
cent above those in Western Australia, the lowest-cost producer.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIAN mining unions have voted to occupy mines subject to joint venture
deals in protest at the government's drive to slim down Comibol, the state
mining corporation, and open it up to private investment.
The unions want to stop Comibol going ahead with joint venture and leasing
deals with private companies. Since the concept of joint venture contracts
was first touted last year, only two have been signed.
Private companies that have signed deals with Comibol, including Minproc and
Cominesa, have been unable to start operations because of industrial action.
Mr Alvaro Rejas, the Bolivian mining minister, has warned that the
government will shut down any mine which is occupied, and dismiss any miners
taking action. However, both Mr Rejas and Comibol's management lack
government backing to confront the unions and speed up the joint venture
process.
Mr Rejas said the action would be an act of suicide for Bolivian mining.
Several potential private mining investors cite labour troubles as a
significant problem.

Three-month NICKEL fell to a 2 1/2 -year low of Dollars 6,905 a tonne in
early trading on the LME following Chinese hedge liquidation. Traders said
that the Chinese had been the market's main source of support. If they were
no longer there as buyers, the market would be likely see lower prices in
the near future unless producers took some action. Meanwhile, the dollar's
firmness continued to hang over the LME as buyers faced dearer prices in
local currency terms. The most marked example continued to be COPPER;
three-month metal closed at Dollars 2,435 a tonne, up just Dollars 8. A
further rise in Comex stocks on Friday and reports that the Polish copper
miners had lifted their strike threat were both ignored. GOLD retreated
below Dollars 350 a troy ounce on the London bullion market, and the Comex
active December futures contract was off more than Dollars 4 at Dollars
348.60 in late trading in New York. US fund liquidation emerged in New York
after the French referendum at the weekend. London's second postion robusta
COFFEE contract broke through resistance at Dollars 800 a tonne, boosted by
French trade house buying. Dealers said charts now seemed to point to
further gains.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Once again Opec shoots itself
in the foot - Neil Buckley examines the tensions now surfacing in the oil
producers cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES continued to drift lower yesterday, on uncertainty following
Iran's refusal to sign the agreement reached by the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries last week and Ecuador's announcement that it
intended to leave the cartel.
Brent crude for October delivery fell 15 cents on the day to Dollars 20.20 -
leaving it about 30 cents lower than before Opec's ministerial monitoring
meeting in Geneva.
The markets' uncertainty is understandable. Last week's meeting again
demonstrated Opec's capacity for shooting itself in the foot.
Even pessimistic Opec-watchers had forecast an easy meeting. In theory, all
members had to do was quickly agree to hold production at current levels of
around 24.3m barrels a day - allowing a little more for Kuwait - and then
either roll over their February/May production ceiling of 22.98m b/d and
continue to ignore it, or formally raise the ceiling to a more realistic
level of, say, 24.5m b/d.
That, analysts believed, would have given oil prices an upwards shove of up
to Dollars 1 a barrel in the face of expected higher demand in the fourth
quarter. Opec members could have gone home ready to fight another day -
namely in November, when thornier issues such as members' market shares, and
how to deal with the eventual return of Iraq to the export market are
expected to be discussed.
Instead, Opec wrangled for two days, emerging with a somewhat wishy-washy
communique which one member refused to endorse, and with another member
threatening to pull out of the organisation. The final irony was that Mr
Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister and Opec's fiercest price
hawk, actually managed to talk oil prices down 40 cents through his comments
after the meeting.
The markets may yet change their mind, however. As one analyst in Geneva put
it: 'This was actually a good deal, poorly packaged.'
Analysts and traders both believe that while oil prices did not get an
immediate boost from the Opec meeting, they will start to rise on strong
market fundamentals in the next few weeks.
Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London, said he
saw Brent crude reaching Dollars 22 before Opec's next meeting in November.
Opec's communique pledged its fourth-quarter 'market share' should be 24.2m
b/d, with Kuwait allowed to continue to increase output. The aim was 'to
attain the minimum reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel' for the Opec
basket of crudes (equivalent to more than Dollars 22 for Brent crude).
With estimates of fourth-quarter demand for Opec oil, including production
and stocks, at more than 25m b/d, this should produce a tight market. Oil
stocks, moreover, are at a four-year low.
The big question is whether Opec will stick to the agreement. Traders were,
for example, concerned about the use of the vague phrase 'market share'
instead of 'production ceiling' in the communique.
Opec ministers were anxious to play down the significance of this. Mr Hisham
Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, suggested it was simply a term 'that comes at
the end of the day when most people are very tired.
'It is a ceiling,' he added.
A more serious concern is possible 'leakage'. But those countries who have
surplus capacity - apart from Kuwait, which will increase production by up
to 300,000 b/d as it rebuilds its oil industry - are seen by analysts as
unlikely to lift production significantly.
Iran's Mr Aghazadeh said he had 'no intention' of doing anything to disrupt
the market, in spite of his criticisms of the agreement.
He said Iran would adjust production according to world demand. Analysts
suggest Iran is likely to continue to produce at between 3.2m and 3.4m b/d,
and are sceptical of its claims that it already has capacity of 4m b/d.
Mr Nazer of Saudi Arabia refused to comment on production plans, but the
kingdom is not seen increasing production much above the 8.4m b/d it claimed
in August.
The sting in the tail at last week's meeting was, however, Ecuador's
announcement that it intended to give up full membership of Opec and seek to
become only an associate member - the first country to do so since Opec was
formed in 1960. Mr Andres Barreiro Vivas, Ecuador's energy minister, said
the matter would be discussed at Opec's next meeting in Vienna.
Ecuador's ostensible reason for leaving is that it is unhappy with its quota
and wants to increase oil revenues to help pay off its Dollars 13bn foreign
debt.
Paris-based consultants Cambridge Energy Research Associates suggests
Ecuador may be wondering if its hopes for economic improvement would be
better served by other organisations such as the International Monetary
Fund, where not being an Opec member could strengthen its negotiating
position.
In itself, Ecuador's withdrawal would be unlikely to have more than a
symbolic impact on Opec. It is the second-smallest producer, with only 1.3
per cent of total output. The danger, however, is that other members suffer
from the same revenue constraints and frustration about Opec's failure to
raise prices.
Gabon and Qatar are seen as most likely to be tempted to follow Ecuador's
lead, but Mr Peter Bogin of CERA says even this would not cause serious harm
to Opec.
'The only people that really matter in Opec are the big producers. It has
been an organisation of six members and not 13 for some time now.'
However, Mr Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington,
suggests larger producers such as Nigeria or Venezuela might also be tempted
to follow Ecuador, which could pose a serious threat to Opec.
'These countries see themselves as weak and uninfluential members who just
turn up, take a lot of abuse from the Gulf countries and go home. They may
start to think hard about what's in it for them.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia seeks to boost
domestic gas consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia's main island of Java is set to increase its consumption of
natural gas by 242 per cent to 975m cubic feet a day with the commissioning
of three new electric power stations, a urea plant and a gas system for the
city of Surabaya in East Java, writes William Keeling in Jakarta.
Speaking to a recent meeting of the Indonesian Gas Association, Mr Wijarso,
a senior official of the Department of Mines and Energy, said the planned
expansion was backed up by proven reserves of 4.5 trillion cubic feet.
He said Arco International is developing new offshore fields to deliver 260m
cf a day to the newly built 1,350 MW combined cycle power plants in Muara
Karang and Tanjung Priok, and to the Kujang II urea plant in Cikampek.
The ARBNI Pagerungan field will soon supply 390m cf a day to the city of
Surabaya and to a 1,080 MW power plant and urea plant in Gresik.
Mr Wijarso estimated that consumption by the year 2000 in Java, which has a
population of 108m and is the economic centre of Indonesia, would be close
to 1,500m cf a day.
A recent World Bank study estimated that gas fields in Java and its offshore
surrounds could be proven up by an additional 2.1-8.1 trillion cf. Even at
the low 2.1 trillion cf figure, an additional delivery of 500m cf a day of
gas could be brought on line by the end of the decade, Mr Wijarso said.
The government's policy is to, whenever possible, substitute domestic oil
consumption with gas. Indonesia would save 250,000 barrels of oil a day if
domestic gas consumption in Java could be increased to 1,470m cf a day.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather hits Canadian harvest
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNUSUALLY wet and cool weather has seriously delayed Canada's prairie grain
harvest and is expected to affect both the volume and quality of this year's
crop.
Farmers in Alberta suffered a summer snowfall last month, and frost has
already hit most other parts of the prairies. Scientists blame the freak
weather, which has given many parts of Canada east of the Rockies their
wettest and coolest summer in a century, on dust spewed into the atmosphere
by last year's eruption of Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines.
Mr Ken Budzak, crop analyst at the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, said the
province's farmers had harvested only 8 per cent of their crop by the end of
last week. In a normal season, close to 80 per cent would be in the bins by
mid-September. Mr Budzak estimated that harvesting would take another month
or so.
An official at Manitoba Pool Elevators said the wheat harvest in that
province had ranged between zero and 45 per cent so far. He added that 'very
little' oilseed, rape and flax had been taken in.
Analysts stress that it is still too early to assess fully the weather's
impact on yields and quality. While some damage has undoubtedly been done,
it appears that fears of a disaster after the late-August snowfall were
exaggerated.
'We're not in a position where we have to panic yet,' Mr Budzak said. But he
added that estimates of the size of the crop 'keep dropping every day'.
Mr Budzak expects Saskatchewan's crop of six main grains and oilseeds to be
somewhere below 20m tonnes, down from earlier estimates of 20.9m tonnes.
The Alberta Wheat Pool's most recent estimate of the total harvest in that
province is 14.7m tonnes, compared with a 10-year average of 15.4m. But the
final figure is expected to be somewhat lower. The late harvest will not
necessarily do further damage, provided that rain does not germinate crops.

MANDARIN Oriental International, the hotels arm of Jardine Matheson,
yesterday reported a 10.3 per cent rise in net profits to Dollars 19.2m for
the half-year to June, from Dollars 17.4m a year earlier.
The profits were struck on a 22.6 per cent rise in turnover to Dollars 72.5m
from Dollars 59.1m. The directors declared an unchanged interim dividend of
1.41 cents a share.
Higher net interest charges and tax ate into net margins, reducing them to
26.4 per cent from 29.4 per cent. Gross margins were broadly unchanged.
The company said that the main factor behind the improved performance was
the growth of travel both from within the Asia-Pacific region and from
Europe.
These gains were, however, partly offset by continued weakness in US demand
and increased competition from new hotels in Macao and Jakarta. In Bangkok,
the abortive military coup in the second quarter hit occupancy severely.
The company said that its hotels in Hong Kong, Manila and Singapore improved
their results year-on-year. Occupancy levels were higher but they were not
able to increase prices.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said the better performance of these hotels
should enable the company to achieve profit growth for the year as a whole.
Jardine Strategic, an investment vehicle for the Jardine group, owns 50 per
cent of Mandarin Oriental International.

HINO MOTORS, Japan's leading truck maker, confirmed last night that it has
held partnership talks with Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, but
said the negotiations were part of broad-ranging contacts with truck makers
in Europe and the US.
The Japanese company, bruised by the domestic economic slowdown, said it was
negotiating 'sales and production' joint ventures with international truck
makers, but insisted that 'nothing has been decided'.
Hino, part of the Toyota Motor group, has been encouraged to broaden its
international base by falling capital spending at home, which resulted in a
2.4 per cent decline in truck sales, by volume, for the first quarter
beginning in April.
Domestic difficulties led Hino, which exports about 15 per cent of
production, to forecast a 57 per cent fall to Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in pre-tax
profit for the first half to end-September. The company said another reason
for the fall, and a reason for it to expand overseas production, was a
stronger-than-expected yen this year.
Japan's truck industry reported sharply increased sales during the late
1980s, when construction orders surged and companies were generally
expanding capital investment.

DAEWOO, the South Korean conglomerate, is expected next month to end its
auto manufacturing joint venture, Daewoo Motor, with General Motors (GM) by
purchasing the US car maker's 50 per cent shareholding for an estimated
Dollars 170m.
Daewoo and GM have been negotiating the terms of the joint venture's
dissolution over the past year after disagreements surfaced over the future
management of the troubled company.
Daewoo Motor, which is unlisted, has been overtaken by Kia Motors as South
Korea's second largest vehicle maker and is suffering losses of about
Won50bn (Dollars 64m) for the first half of 1992. Daewoo has been hurt by
labour disputes and rising wages.
Daewoo and GM agreed to end the joint venture, formed in 1983, after GM
refused to inject an extra Dollars 100m of capital into the company to
expand production and develop overseas marketing.
Daewoo also wanted to end GM's exclusive right to sell Daewoo cars abroad.
Daewoo Motor cars are produced under an agreement with GM.
Under the proposed settlement, Daewoo will be able to continue to use GM's
sales network in the US and other countries, including Brazil and South
Africa, and will continue to sell its cars elsewhere without restrictions.
Daewoo's purchase of GM's shareholding will be made in several installments.
Daewoo will take over complete ownership of Daewoo Motor, although it is
negotiating with Nissan to replace GM as a possible joint venture partner.

FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Air New Zealand stages strong
recovery

<TEXT>
AIR New Zealand yesterday reported a strong recovery in net profits to
NZDollars 121.16m (USDollars 65.8m) for the year to June 30. This compares
with NZDollars 19.97m for the previous 15 months.
The company turned operating losses of NZDollars 14.47m in the previous 15
months to profits of NZDollars 134.3m following what the directors said was
a significant turnaround in core costs. This included a further cut in staff
by 590 to 8,825 and was in spite of an 8 per cent rise in seat-kilometres
flown.
Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, said wide-ranging changes in work practices had
led to productivity improvements. Significant growth was achieved in
international revenues, especially in Asia, Japan and Europe.
However, Mr Matthew said the growth was offset 'by stubborn recessionary
pressures' which hit sales in North America, Australia and New Zealand. Net
yields remained under pressure on most routes, with the Tasman and the
Atlantic routes suffering from 'aggressive discounting by American-based and
other carriers'.
Mr Matthew said progress had been made in achieving a permanently lower cost
base which would help Air NZ cope with recently-announced regulatory and
structural changes in airline policy in Australia and New Zealand to be
implemented over the next few years.
He said international conditions remained volatile and highly competitive
and Air NZ's domestic market was yet to show a rise in trading volumes. The
group's trading performance so far this year was 'mixed', with earnings in
line with expectations.
However, the directors were optimistic that the airline could continue its
recovery towards 'more acceptable' levels of profits.
Sales and other gross operating revenues rose 13.1 per cent to NZDollars
2.21bn. Abnormal items - relating to redundancy costs and the sale of the
airline's Fokker Friendship fleet - showed losses of NZDollars 13.1m
compared with profits of NZDollars 26.3m.
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 6 cents, making 10 cents
for the year. This is 2 cents higher than forecast.
Air NZ and Brierley Investments (BIL) are bidding for a strategic stake in
Qantas Airways, the Australian government-owned airline, AP-DJ reports from
Wellington.
Mr Matthew said his airline and BIL, a New Zealand hotel and investments
concern, were carrying out a due diligence examination on Qantas.
Due diligence involves a detailed study by a potential suitor of a takeover
target's financial accounts to assess its value.
A bidding process for the sale by the Australian government of a strategic
stake in Qantas was likely to start 'within the next few days,' Mr Matthew
said.
Qantas, Australia's national airline, is 100 per cent owned by the
Australian government. But the government intends to sell up to 49 per cent
of Qantas in a trade sale, and is looking for international airlines and
other companies to obtain strategic shareholdings in Qantas.
The rest of Qantas will be sold through an initial public offering in
Australia at a later date.

CIRCLE K, the Arizona-based convenience store chain which has been operating
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1990, yesterday turned in
first-quarter operating profits of Dollars 8.2m, compared with Dollars 6.4m
a year earlier.
The company, which has agreed to be acquired for about Dollars 402m by an
investor group, CK Acquisitions, led by Bahrain-based Investcorp, said it
expected to file an amended reorganisation plan by the end of this month.
The company suffered a net loss of Dollars 2.7m, or 10 cents a share, in the
quarter, reflecting the costs associated with its reorganisation.
A year earlier, Circle K recorded a net loss of Dollars 500,000, or 5 cents
a share.
Mr Bart Brown, chairman, said: 'Given the costs and complications associated
with the Chapter 11 process, we are pleased with these first-quarter
results.'

CS HOLDING, the holding company for Credit Suisse and other financial and
industrial companies, suffered an 11 per cent decline in consolidated net
earnings to SFr534m (Dollars 407.60m) in the first half, mainly because of
increased provisions for bad debts.
Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, said the group's aim was to maintain earnings at
last year's level, a downward revision from his last statement in April
anticipating 'further improvement' this year.
Gross income for the first half jumped 13 per cent to SFr4.5bn, due mainly
to a 36 per cent rise in commission income. Trading income was up 6 per cent
to SFr1.26bn and interest income was flat at SFr1.36bn. Pre-tax profit was
up 5 per cent to SFr1.8bn but provisions for bad debts, arising from the
weak Swiss economy and the Canary Wharf bankruptcy in London, rose 11 per
cent to SFr827m. The group tax bill jumped 30 per cent to SFr351m after the
elimination of tax losses carried forward at CS First Boston.

FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: More feelers out for
international syndicated loans / Assessing European states' options for
supporting their currencies if market turbulence persists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED tension within the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System may force some European countries to follow the example of
the UK and Sweden, both of which tapped the international syndicated loans
market earlier this month to support their domestic currencies.
Following the turbulence in the financial markets last week, other sovereign
borrowers are understood to be looking at ways of raising finance at short
notice in case further bouts of currency speculation occur.
Since Sunday's referendum in France on economic and monetary union, some
European currencies have come under pressure again in the foreign exchange
markets. The French franc, Irish punt and Italian lira (which has been
suspended from the ERM) came under most pressure, with the Spanish peseta
and Danish krone suffering more modestly yesterday.
On September 3, the UK government announced plans to borrow Ecu10bn in
D-Marks and a range of other currencies, using the money to support sterling
and to fund government spending. The Ecu10bn consists of an Ecu5bn
three-year multi-currency revolving credit facility and a longer-term
multi-currency note issue programme. It is expected that the first tranche
 -the Ecu5bn revolving credit facility  - will be fully drawn within the
next few days.
A week after the UK announcement, Sweden arranged an Ecu8bn syndicated
credit as part of the central bank's Ecu16bn programme to bolster the krona
and crush rumours that the Swedish currency was about to be devalued, while
Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the central bank, pushed the marginal lending
rate up to 500 per cent to halt currency speculation. The syndicated
facility consists of an Ecu3bn 364-day loan and an Ecu5bn three-year
multi-currency revolving credit.
Bankers cite Italy, Spain, France, Denmark and Ireland  - whose currencies
have all come under pressure in recent days  - as the obvious candidates for
such borrowings.
Of them, Spain is understood to have fairly substantial foreign exchange
reserves which have not been too depleted by recent market turmoil. Spain
launched a Dollars 1.5bn seven-year Eurobond last week which is expected to
be be priced today. The borrowing is part of Spain's general borrowing
programme to fund its public sector deficit, but the proceeds will help to
build up Spain's foreign currency reserves.
France, whose currency came under further pressure yesterday, had foreign
exchange reserves of Dollars 30.5bn in June, the most recent figures
available. Mr Jim O'Neill, economist at Swiss Bank Corporation, points out
that France would probably be more likely to use the combination of
intervention and higher interest rates to protect the currency than a
syndicated credit facility. 'Even if the French did choose the loan route,
they would want to keep it quiet after seeing how dreadfully it backfired
with the UK,' he said.
In his view, the countries most likely to want to use the loan route to
raise funds for intervention are Italy and Ireland. Italy's foreign exchange
reserves were thought to be almost depleted last week when the lira was
taken out of the ERM of the EMS.
Ironically, Italy is probably least likely to receive support from the
international banking community. Many international banks were furious about
Italy's handling of the situation with Efim, the state holding company which
was put into voluntary liquidation in July. Lenders are still trying to
negotiate the terms of repayment on Efim's substantial debts.
Ireland, which according to IMF figures had foreign exchange reserves of
Dollars 4.97bn in July, could also consider a loan to help replenish
reserves, especially if the currency comes under further pressure. However,
Mr O'Neill believes Ireland would be more likely to raise interest rates to
support the currency.
'There is a lot of talk of other potential borrowers in the loans market,'
according to a senior banker at one of the big US houses which specialises
in sovereign borrowing. He emphasised, though, that at this stage the
enquiries have mainly been concerned with which market to use if borrowing
were to prove necessary.
Some bankers warn that European sovereign names could find it difficult to
persuade banks to lend them the money. One banker said: 'Even though they
are zero risk-weighted names (from the point of capital adequacy
requirements) the return is not that good, so you have to have good business
reasons for doing such a deal.' Most banks who participate in such deals
would hope to compensate for the low return by winning other business.
For example, banks which participated in the loan to Sweden may hope to
further their business interests by playing a role in the government's
privatisation programme.
Borrowing in the syndicated loans market tends to be more expensive than in
the bond market. However, it has the advantage of allowing more flexibility
on when the loan is drawn, and a borrower can usually raise a larger amount
and at shorter notice.
While European sovereign borrowers appear at this stage only to be making
initial enquiries about raising funds, some may be deterred by the UK's
experience. The announcement of an Ecu10bn borrowing certainly helped to
instill confidence in sterling at the time  - but the effect was
embarrassingly short-lived.

NIKE, the US sports shoe and apparel maker, saw its share price fluctuate
yesterday after reporting an improvement in first-quarter profits.
Nike lifted net income to Dollars 122.6m, or Dollars 1.60 a share, a 7 per
cent improvement from the Dollars 114.4m, or Dollars 1.50, reported a year
earlier.
Although earnings were strong in a difficult retail climate, they
disappointed Wall Street initially. Analysts had been looking for earnings
of about Dollars 1.70 a share and, by mid-session, its shares had slipped
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 74 3/4 , but reversed direction to close at Dollars
76 3/8 , up Dollars  7/8 .
The company said first-quarter expenses were unusually high, reflecting
increased advertising linked to the Barcelona Olympics and the launch of new
brands. Mr Philip Knight, chairman, said: 'Management strongly believe that
these investments will add to Nike's momentum in key international markets
and allow us to achieve out stated full-year earnings growth objective of 15
per cent.'
During the quarter, revenues rose 16 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn from Dollars
947.2m. Growth was led by international sales, which soared 44 per cent to
Dollars 357.7m.
Excluding the impact of dollar translations, overseas revenues rose 32 per
cent. In contrast, domestic footwear and apparel revenues advanced only 5
per cent to Dollars 687.7m, while revenues from other brands jumped 30 per
cent to Dollars 54.4m. Orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for
delivery between September 1992 and January 1993 rose 27 per cent to Dollars
1.36bn.
Nike's consolidated gross margin improved to 39.4 per cent, against 38.7 per
cent the previous year.

<TEXT>
SENIOR Labour frontbenchers sought yesterday to go on the offensive over
Europe by accusing the government of a return to Thatcherism that would be
disastrous both politically and economically.
Their efforts were undermined, however, by renewed evidence of dissent
within the shadow cabinet.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, called on Mr John Major to make clear
either that he still believed that Britain's place was at the heart of
Europe, or that his words then had been merely a statement of expediency
whose time had passed.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, joined those warning of the dangers of a
return to monetarism and isolationism by challenging the government to
explain its policy on inflation now that sterling had been suspended from
the European exchange rate mechanism.
Labour's frontbench Euro-sceptics, however, continued to speak out on Europe
yesterday in what may be their last opportunity to do so. Tomorrow Mr John
Smith, party leader, is set to secure collective agreement to a clear policy
on Europe at meetings of the national executive committee, Labour's ruling
body, and the shadow cabinet. Party chiefs have made clear that shadow
cabinet members will have to abide by an agreed policy.
Yesterday, however, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow national heritage secretary,
renewed his call for a referendum in Britain. 'If we were to face the
prospect of having to endorse the treaty, I would certainly take the view
that it should not be done without consulting the British people,' he said.
He described the treaty as fatally wounded by the closeness of the French
referendum result. 'The trouble is that it won't lie down and die,' he said.
'What it needs is for our political leaders to have the courage to give it a
decent burial.'

</HEADLINE>

LORD TEBBIT, former Conservative party chairman, yesterday warned that the
Maastricht debate could tear the party apart.
Speaking on BBC Television's Panorama programme, Lord Tebbit said: 'The
prime minister has seen the collapse of his policy towards the parity of
sterling. That is sufficient humiliation for a Conservative government in
one year. I hope he will not risk a further humiliation by splitting his
party in suffering defeat in parliament.'
Lord Tebbit described the Maastricht treaty as a dead parrot. 'In short,
right now it seems to me that Maastricht is like that famous dead parrot,'
he said. 'They may try to nail it on to the perch again, but nobody will
believe that it is still alive.'
Earlier yesterday Lord Tebbit had renewed his call for a referendum on the
treaty, saying the result of the French vote had knocked progress to
monetary union 'completely off the rails'.
He added: 'Perhaps it is time for the people of Britain to have a say. A
referendum on the issue would clear the air and make it much easier for John
Major to speak for the country in the certainty that he was speaking for all
the people.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: City looks for clues to shape of
new economic policy - Ways in which Treasury strategy may change after
Britain's ERM withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS expectations in the City about an early cut in interest rates faded
slightly yesterday, the focus of attention swung towards the likely building
blocks for any new government economic strategy.
With Britain likely to wait some months before looking to rejoin the
European exchange rate mechanism, the Treasury will want to pay more
attention to the direction of fiscal and monetary policy and the level of
the pound in its efforts to influence demand. At the same time it will try
to keep a close eye on trends in inflation, possibly with new ways to
monitor money supply and asset prices.
The word from the Treasury is that it will be in no hurry to finalise the
details. In his address to parliament on Thursday, Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, is expected to concentrate on the background to last week's
humiliating decision to suspend ERM membership, rather than to come up with
any grand designs for future policymaking.
That partly stems from a sense of torpor at the Treasury, which is coming to
terms with having lost its main economic rudder in the shape of ERM
membership. The department will also want time to assess how the devaluation
of sterling may be helping to buoy the economy, even while base rates remain
relatively high at 10 per cent. In tune with the lower expectations of a cut
in borrowing costs, the FT-SE 100 share index fell back yesterday, after
having gained nearly 200 points on Thursday and Friday last week. Last
night, the pound closed in London down 7 1/2 pfennigs at DM2.5375, or about
24 pfennigs below its ERM floor of DM2.778.
A rule of thumb among some economists is that a depreciation of 4 per cent
in the pound as measured by the Bank of England's trade-weighted sterling
index  - which tracks the pound against important currencies including the
D-Mark and dollar  - is equivalent to a cut in interest rates of 1
percentage point.
Applying that rule to what has happened to sterling over the past four
months provides the sense of a considerable loosening in economic policy.
Since May 27  - when sterling closed in London at DM2.945, just below its
DM2.95 central ERM rate  - the pound has declined against the D-Mark by 14
per cent. According to the sterling index, the depreciation has been
slightly lower at 10 per cent. If the economists' rule is taken seriously,
that is equivalent to more than 2 points off interest rates.
Calculations of this kind may explain why the government appears to be
acting cautiously over cutting base rates. However, in spite of the less
bullish tone in the City yesterday about immediate cuts in loan costs, many
private-sector economists believe base rates will come down to 9 per cent by
the start of the Conservative party conference on October 6, with possibly a
further cut by the end of the year.
A fall in the exchange rate influences the economy largely by reducing the
price of exports and by making imports more expensive. It thus helps
exporters, mainly in the manufacturing sector, and also reduces price
competition for UK-based companies in the domestic market.
That last factor is important for many smaller manufacturers which earn the
lion's share of their profits from UK sales.
With exports and imports of tradable goods each accounting for roughly a
fifth of the economy, the short-term effects of a devaluation can be
significant. The worry for policymakers, however, is that the benefits may
be quickly eaten up through higher import prices pushing up inflation and
thus influencing the level of wage costs, cancelling any gains to
productivity among manufacturers.
Mr Douglas Godden, economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said:
'With unemployment at 2.8m and the labour market extremely weak, there is a
good chance that companies may be in a better position than in previous
devaluations to resist inflationary pressures feeding into wages.'
In the new efforts to manage the economy outside the ERM, fiscal policy will
also be more important. According to Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at
the London office of Salomon Brothers, the New York bank, fiscal policy has
been considerably loosened in recent years as the government has eased
restraints on public spending and has been forced to step up social security
spending for jobless people and their families.
According to the latest consensus of City forecasts, general government
spending, which accounts for about a quarter of the economy, will increase
by 1.6 per cent this year in the context of a contraction in gross domestic
product likely to total 0.6 per cent.
In an environment in which demand is likely to be boosted both by the
effects of a likely easing in monetary policy and by the large sterling
devaluation, Mr Saunders thinks the government will need to tighten its
fiscal policy to keep the economy on an even keel and prevent a build-up in
inflationary pressures.
'If I were the Treasury I would be trying to cut into the Pounds 244.5bn
planning total for public spending due in 1993-94,' Mr Saunders said. Even
with some cuts, Mr Saunders is still pencilling in a public-sector borrowing
requirement in 1993-94 running to about Pounds 40bn, representing more than
6 per cent of GDP.
With the pound's depreciation having given the economy a considerable boost,
the Treasury will be keen to prevent the currency going into a further fall
 - another reason for caution about cutting interest rates. Many economists
feel that the Treasury would ideally like to stabilise the pound at about
DM2.60, a level it might make sense to seek as a central rate if sterling
rejoins the ERM over the next six months.
Assuming interest rates were to fall by 2 percentage points by the end of
the year, sterling could be expected to decline to as low as DM2.40.
However, the currency could then find support on expectations about lower
German interest rates next year.
As for inflation, that is one area where Mr Lamont can fairly claim some
success. In the 12 months to the end of August, the increase in the retail
prices index was 3.6 per cent, as opposed to nearly 11 per cent around the
end of 1990. However, some economists are worried that, should Mr Lamont let
sterling drift too much and switch too quickly to lower interest rates,
inflationary forces might once again be a concern.
According to Mr David Smith, UK economist at brokers Williams de Broe, the
correct course for Mr Lamont is to treat pleas to cut credit rates with
extreme caution and to concentrate on ways to help exporters via a lower
exchange rate.
'There is a lot of money sitting in interest-bearing deposits in the
consumer sector which, should interest rates come down too quickly, could
quickly find its way into the economy and give a big boost to inflation,'
said Mr Smith. 'Mr Lamont has to be extremely careful about the consequences
for inflation of whatever he decides on economic strategy.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: Tory middle ground applauds
slowdown - Ivo Dawnay and Alison Smith gauge backbench views on John Major's
European policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT TOOK that always rare creature, a fully paid-up Tory intellectual, to
make the simple but perhaps most revealing observation.
After the French Yes vote, MP Mr David Willetts, one-time director of the
Centre for Policy Studies, remarked that the prime minister was now sounding
a great deal less gung-ho on Europe than he had done after the Danish No
vote in June.
Much the same could be said for the vast bulk of Conservative MPs who regard
themselves as neither Euro-sceptic nor Euro-enthusiast.
Plucky little Denmark can bleat as much as it likes. But when the pound has
been sandbagged by the D-Mark and the French  - quintessential apologists
for the European Community  - express doubts, then the ramifications are
profound.
Talking to a selection of backbench MPs not clearly identified with either
camp in the great Maastricht debate demonstrated yesterday that Mr John
Major was wise in his decision to put on the brakes.
Initial inquiries showed a surprising consistency in opinions on the central
consequences of the past week. First, not one of the five MPs contacted had
dissented from the economic and European policies peddled by the government
up to just a week ago.
None, also, would level criticism either at the prime minister or the
chancellor for the conduct of those policies or the attempt to see them
through, in spite of Black Wednesday.
All also endorsed Mr Major's call for a summit and his warnings that the UK
could not go back into the European exchange rate mechanism until it was
reformed.
Acknowledging that the events had proved a watershed, three of the five
agreed that if the consequences mean Britain must now accept life in the
slow lane of a two-speed Europe, then so be it. Caution was the watchword.
Mr Willetts, MP for Havant, argued that party feeling was 'not a mood to
rush into a ringing endorsement' of Maastricht. He thought the domestic
circumstances of Germany and France made the prospect of a two-tier Europe
less likely than it had seemed in the past.
Another member of the new intake, Mr Edward Garnier, MP for Harborough, took
a similar view, claiming that the ambivalence of the French referendum
result had 'altered the scenery'. He added: 'There is scepticism in France
and concern in Germany about the D-Mark. The road towards union has
steepened and hairpin bends have been put in the track.' Everything would
now slow down.
Only one of the MPs interviewed admitted to having made a 180-degree turn
into outright opposition to the Maastricht blueprint. Mr Gary Streeter, MP
for Plymouth Sutton, confessed to having shifted 'dramatically' over three
months into the No camp.
'A close federation will end in tears,' he said. 'There is no heart in this
country for political and economic union.'
If Britain were to return to the ERM it could only be on the basis of an
entirely reformed system where flexibility was emphasised. Even that Mr
Streeter regarded as unlikely, urging that the government instead seize the
opportunity to lower interest rates and stimulate industry with tax
incentives.
While accepting the inevitability of Britain's ERM withdrawal, Mr Peter
Atkinson, MP for Hexham, confessed that the UK would now have a more
volatile and less stable economy.
He added: 'If Britain's European partners are not prepared to alter the
system, we cannot go back to it.'
In the present circumstances, Mr Willetts said he believed that the priority
must be to establish a credible financial framework that can deliver low
inflation. His own preference would be for a return to monetary targets.
Unlike those of his colleagues who are panting for dramatic cuts in interest
rates, Mr Willetts is expecting the government to strike a 'sober' note on
future reductions, in Thursday's emergency Commons debate on the economy.
'Having been on a starvation diet, we can't go on a binge,' he said.
Such a pragmatic approach among the new intake of MPs appears to endorse the
prime minister's approach in the wake of the currency turmoil and the French
plebiscite.
It also gells with the views of a veteran observer of the international
scene, Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the cross-party foreign affairs
committee.
He interprets events as pointing towards 'if not an actual precise
renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty, then a whole range of modifications
to it  - add-ons and codicils  - to bring it into the sort of shape needed
to address the situation that has now emerged'.
The Tory party, he said, wanted a positive path out of the difficulties. 'If
the new policy of rethinking Maastricht is now developed with vigour, I
think the party will follow that.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: Uncertain future for pay
bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANNUAL PAY increases over the last 18 months have halved
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
from about 9 per cent to just over 4 per cent  - and unit labour cost
increases in manufacturing industry have fallen to 2 per cent.
Most analysts attribute that primarily to falling inflation and recession
but some, including many union officials, argue that the speed of the fall
would not have been attainable without British membership of the exchange
rate mechanism.
With no prospect of employers being bailed out by devaluation, and with low
inflation locked in, pay bargainers were beginning to shake off an
'inflation-plus' mentality and were even comparing pay rises more directly
with similar groups in other ERM member countries.
Will Britain's withdrawal from the ERM undermine the discipline of the last
two years? The short answer is that nobody knows, but as withdrawal is
almost certain to lead to higher inflation and greater uncertainty, union
bargainers will be pushing harder to compensate their members.
In the short term they will not necessarily succeed. Britain has withdrawn
from the ERM at the end of a wage round in which large groups of workers  -
such as the 900,000 local government manual workers  - have settled for a
rise of about 4 per cent on the understanding that inflation was heading
down, not up.
If inflation does now rise, those workers will suffer a cut in real pay.
With unemployment set to rise for another two years at least, they may not
be in a strong position to claw that back next year. Indeed, an analysis of
the relationship between wages and prices over the past 10 years by Mr Chris
Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, found that the lowest growth in
real wages came in 1989 and 1990 when inflation took off, briefly, catching
many bargainers by surprise. Conversely, the strongest real earnings growth
came in the mid 1980s, when inflation was relatively low.
Seeking lessons from previous devaluations  - such as 1967 or 1976  - is
difficult. On both these occasions incomes policies, at least temporarily,
prevented a wages catch-up.
Also, as the Confederation of British Industry points out, the bargaining
system is now far more flexible. For example about 20 national pay
agreements, which usually provided an inflation-covering floor for plant
bargainers, have been phased out since the 1970s, and pay in the current
recession has been far more sensitive to the performance of different
sectors than in previous years.
It is not necessary to agree with the CBI that the link with the retail
prices index has been broken to accept that wage rises in the private sector
are now more closely linked to company performance.
That means that pay trends are likely to follow the pattern of corporate
winners and losers from the present devaluation  - with employees in
exporting companies benefiting most.
The story may be different in the public sector. Although the Civil Service
unions have just settled for modest rises, the pay review bodies  - which
cover nearly a third of public-sector workers  - are just starting to hear
evidence.
The government's case for a low rise in its submission to the pay review
body for teachers is based on the argument that inflation is defeated
because 'within the discipline of the ERM there is no prospect of employers
being bailed out by a lower exchange rate'.
That argument has now been overtaken by events, and without another one to
put in its place the government might well have to reject the findings of
some of the pay review bodies if it intends to hold down public-sector pay.
In the longer run, leaving the ERM will probably mean losing some of the
benefits to rational bargaining of permanently low inflation and
international comparisons with related groups in Europe. The extent of the
loss depends on how much progress had already been made in absorbing ERM
disciplines, and that would not have become clear until the new attitudes
had been tested in an upturn.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: Major lives to fight another day
in Europe
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BATTERED Mr John Major will live to fight another day  - and the rest of
Europe is not rushing to write him off. In capitals throughout the European
Community, officials and commentators show more sympathy than Schadenfreude
at Britain's grand economic U-turn.
EC officials in Brussels are emphasising their understanding for the way
that Mr Major is caught between domestic realities and the need to show
leadership during Britain's presidency of the Community
One acerbic comment, however, came from a European ambassador. Pointing to
Britain's stream of requests that the Bundesbank cut lending rates in the
interests of the rest of Europe, the ambassador said: 'It is ironic that the
one country who doesn't want a European central bank is asking the
Bundesbank to behave like one.'
There has been irritation in Bonn over Britain's attempts to make Germany
the scapegoat for its withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism.
In contrast to the raucous mass-circulation newspaper Bild, which last week
called the UK 'the great loser of the currency battle', German government
officials have been couching their remarks in tones of studied politeness.
German journalists show similar compunction. Mr Josef Joffe, foreign policy
commentator of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Munich-based daily newspaper,
said Mr Major's position had not been devalued. He praised the decision to
break the D-Mark link, saying: 'Sometimes realism is the better part of
valour.'
He said that when the EC's 12 heads of government met at their emergency
summit next month, Mr Major would 'be in good company'. He added: 'Every
single member of the group will be groggy and on the ropes. They all have to
think about what to do next. Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl might say that the
train to Europe has not stopped  - but it has stopped.'
Mr Robert Leicht, deputy editor of Die Zeit in Hamburg, said he believed Mr
Kohl's relationship with Mr Major would not suffer as a result of the
recriminations over sterling. 'Kohl was very proud to have better links with
Major than with Mrs Thatcher (the former prime minister, now Lady Thatcher).
It will soon return to business as usual,' he said. Provided Mr Major could
steer his way through the coming Conservative party conference, his position
would not be unduly weakened, Mr Leicht suggested.
Instead of suggesting that Germany could take a more independent foreign
policy, Mr Leicht said: 'Kohl is now much more reliant on a good
relationship with Major over foreign policy. The whole process of German
unification is dependent on foreign acceptance. We cannot go it alone.'
Mr Gunther Nonnenmacher, foreign commentator of the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung, pointed yesterday to growing opposition to Mr Major from
parliamentary supporters of Lady Thatcher. But he also warned that Germany
itself could suffer from a continuation of the currency turbulence that sank
the pound.
French commentators, uneasily aware that the franc might be the next to
experience the tender attention of currency speculators, are also in no mood
to sling arrows. Politicians and the press, absorbed by the referendum, have
paid so little attention to the UK's ERM withdrawal that they are now rather
surprised at the domestic impact.
'We are rather astonished to see so many British commentators virtually
writing off Mr Major politically,' said a French foreign ministry official
said yesterday. He added: 'Surely French approval of Maastricht will now
give the markets a chance to calm, and Mr Major a breathing space.'

THE executive of the TGWU, Britain's largest union, called for an emergency
summit meeting involving employers, government and unions in the wake of the

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (1): A bridge to the future - Belize is a
richer and more just society than many of its South American neighbours. Its
judicial, political and educational systems work reasonably well. In spite
of growing social problems, Stephen Fidler says it is possible to be
optimistic about tomorrow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE civil war ravaged the rest of central America in the 1980s, Belize
remained an oasis of calm. As heavy debt and economic crisis engulfed Latin
America, Belize achieved high growth and single-digit inflation. In a zone
with a history of military regimes and political instability, Belize offered
democracy and respect for the rule of law.
Belizeans are proud of what differentiates them from their neighbours; but
their destiny will probably lie as much with the Hispanic countries
surrounding them as it does with their traditional allies in the
English-speaking Caribbean.
Belize is becoming, ethnically at least, more like its neighbours. An
estimated 40,000 people - a fifth of the population - have arrived from
neighbouring states over the past decade, fugitives from civil war or
economic deprivation. The influence of the creoles - the Afro-European group
that has traditionally dominated Belizean society - has meanwhile weakened
because of emigration.
This has caused tension: the newcomers have provided the manpower for
agriculture, the engine for growth in the 1980s. But they have put pressure
on health services and schools.
The prime minister, Mr George Price, who with his People's United Party has
dominated Belizean politics for 40 years, has spoken of the country as a
bridge between central America and the Caribbean. This is a long way from
reality, but it is part of a growing recognition among the mini-states of
the two sub-regions of the costs of isolation.
Until last year, practical co-operation with the rest of central America was
impossible because of Guatemala's claim over the territory of Belize. The
claim delayed independence of Belize - known until 1973 as British Honduras
 -until 1981 and was the reason for Britain's maintenance of a garrison of
1,800 men and a squadron of Harrier jets.
Following guidelines hammered out between the two sides, Guatemala last year
recognised Belize's independence. A final settlement will require further
steps, including ratification in a referendum in Belize and concessions to
guarantee Guatemala access through the Gulf of Honduras to the Caribbean.
These moves have allowed a lifting of the veto on Belize's membership of the
Organisation of American States, to which it acceded in January 1991. Belize
will also join the InterAmerican Development Bank in November.
The garrison still provides 8-10 per cent of the country's GDP, but its
departure will not necessarily mean an end to the British military presence.
As a training ground, Belize's jungle terrain is excellent.
A withdrawal would anyway have less economic impact now than in the past
thanks in large part to the growth of agriculture. Agriculture and
agro-processing account for a quarter of GDP, 40 per cent of employment and
nearly 70 per cent of exports. However, four-fifths of all Belize's exports
benefit from preferential market arrangements, some of which are threatened.
As a member of the Commonwealth, Belize exports to EC markets at low tariffs
under the Lome convention. Its agricultural products also have tariff-free
access to the US under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the country
also belongs to the Caribbean common market, Caricom.
The North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico is
one threat. It may encourage Mexico to become a big citrus producer. A
further extension of US free trade agreements to other countries in Latin
America, proposed under President George Bush's Enterprise for Americas
Initiative, would also erode the special position of CBI countries.
According to Mr Ralph Fonseca, minister of state in the ministry of finance:
'The main tenet of our trade policy has been gradualism. We are saying give
us to the year 2000 and we can take on anybody.'
This approach recognises the country's still heavy dependence on a few
export products and its chronic trade deficits. Remittances from overseas -
estimated to bring in USDollars 15m to Dollars 17m a year - help balance
this. So does tourism, which has grown to become the country's second most
important source of foreign exchange.
Tourist attractions - rain forest, long expanses of coral reef and important
Mayan sites - have potential for further development. Belize has, however,
neither the desire, the labour force nor the beaches necessary to become a
mass tourist destination.
The country also provides a positive reception for foreign investment. There
are constraints such as a small labour force and mixed infrastructure: good
telephones but poor roads and no access for large ships. Electricity is
costly: 21 US cents per kilowatt-hour, almost three times that of the US.
It can also offer stability. Government handovers of power in 1984 and 1989
were achieved without big shifts in policy. The Belize dollar has been fixed
since 1976 at two to the US dollar and inflation has been low. The
government is fairly free of corruption. According to one businessman: 'The
worst thing you can say is that occasionally it favours its friends.'
However, the bureaucracy is often slow. One businessman describes it as
'expert in procrastination' and Mr Fonseca says the government recognises a
need to modernise it.
The government is also selling commercial assets. The telephone company has
been privatised, although the government retains a significant stake, and
plans to sell the electricity company are being finalised. The privatisation
programme has critics. Mr Manuel Esquivel, leader of the opposition, says
that it risks being dominated by one company: Belize Holdings, controlled by
Mr Michael Ashcroft, the controversial chairman of the British car auction
and security group, ADT.
The government has also attempted to speed up development by increasing
capital spending. This and its pay award to public sector workers of an
annual 10 per cent for the next three years have increased anxieties that
the government is forgetting its traditional fiscal conservatism.
Mr Keith Arnold, the central bank president, is worried that the
government's revenues are falling behind its spending: 'The government has
sufficient funds for the next two to three years, but beyond that it will
have to take care.'
This will accelerate talk of fiscal reform. Although legislation has been
passed to enable imposition of a value added tax, the government has been
reluctant to implement it. Yet the tax system is outdated: most revenue is
raised through taxing international trade.
The government also faces growing social problems. As migrants put pressure
on health and education services, emigration to the US is tearing at the
social fabric. Into this environment, cocaine has found its way. Belize has
resolved one drugs problem - in the 1980s it was one of the top five
suppliers of marijuana to the US; now most of the plantations have been
eradicated. But it has developed another: on a line between Colombia and the
US, Belize is used for cocaine trans-shipment. The Belizean middle men are
paid in kind and they have seen to it that a cocaine habit has developed. As
a result, crime, particularly in Belize City, is on the increase.
Yet, in spite of these problems, it is possible to be optimistic about the
future. With per capita income of USDollars 2,000 a year and a reasonable
income distribution, Belize is a richer and more just society than many of
its neighbours. Its institutions - its judicial, political and educational
systems - work reasonably well. As Mr Geoffrey Hart, manager of Barclays
Bank in Belize, says: 'This country is not going to be a Singapore. It's no
tiger but it has a lot going for it.'

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, yesterday promised that the
government would tighten monetary policy over the next six months.
Speaking to a group of pro-reform deputies, Mr Gaidar admitted the budget
deficit was now 'very bad' after a sharp drop in revenues and a rise in
payments during the summer.
The deficit is estimated to be running at around 17 per cent of GDP for the
first six months, with inflation at about 25 per cent a month and production
falling sharply.
Mr Gaidar will have to defend this record, and call for renewed monetary
discipline to a sceptical parliament which opens today.
He seems certain to face calls for his resignation from hard line deputies.
Both Mr Ivan Rybkin, co-ordinator of the Communists of Russia faction and Mr
Vladimir Isakov, head of Russian Unity, were quoted yesterday by Interfax as
calling for his dismissal.
The prime minister echoed some government colleagues in blaming Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, acting head of the Russian Central Bank, for loosening the
floodgates of credit.
Mr Gaidar said: 'He is responsible for the stability of the financial
system.' Elections of a new parliament and president in Estonia have
produced a parliament with a right-nationalist party as biggest group and an
inconclusive result on the president.
The Fatherland Alliance won just over 20 per cent of the vote, making it the
largest party with 28 seats. However, Mr Lennart Meri, leader of the party,
came second to Mr Arnold Ruutel, the present parliamentary chairman, in the
presidential vote - with 28.8 per cent to 42.7 per cent. Parliament must now
choose between them.

MR Milan Panic, prime minister of the rump state of Yugoslavia, flew to New
York yesterday to plead his country's case at the United Nations.
He held urgent talks with diplomats as the UN General Assembly prepared to
consider ousting the delegation of Serbia and Montenegro, whose claim to
succeed to the Yugoslav seat has been rejected by the Security Council.
Diplomats said last night they had little doubt the 179-nation body would
endorse the decision, making it necessary for Belgrade to re-apply for
membership.
Mr Panic argued that expulsion of Yugoslavia would be 'wholly
unprecedented', adding: 'Countries at war like Iraq and Iran were never
expelled even though they committed atrocities.'
President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia-Hercegovina meanwhile urged the
General Assembly to lift the arms embargo imposed when his republic was
still part of Yugoslavia. Now, he said, his nation was being strangled by
the ban, deprived of means to respond to an aggressor.
Mr Izetbegovic flew to New York after attending peace talks in Geneva
sponsored by the UN and the European Community. The Geneva negotiations will
continue between lower-ranking officials.
The co-chairmen of the Geneva conference, Mr Cyrus Vance, for the UN, and
Lord Owen, representing the EC, fly to Athens today to discuss the situation
in the former Yugo-slav republic of Macedonia with Greek Prime Minister
Konstantinos Mitsotakis. Greece has blocked international recognition of
Macedonia, for fear the newly independent republic could pursue claims to
Greek territory of the same name.
Mr James Grant, executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund
(Unicef), said yesterday that all parties to the Yugoslav conflict had
agreed special measures to protect children from violence.
This would culminate in a 'children's week' in the first week of November,
by which time Unicef hoped to have distributed clothing, restarted the
immunisation programme and got children back to school. However, he admitted
that he had nothing in writing.
More than 1,000 children have died, and 30,000 have been wounded, in the
Bosnian conflict.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Poland's hero strikers fall from grace: A sea-change in the
country's labour relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S reputation for powerful, strike-prone trade unions is due for
revision after the collapse of a seven-week strike at the FSM-Fiat car plant
in southern Poland.
The strike began as one of a clutch of labour stoppages in coal and copper
mines and at the Mielec aircraft factory which greeted the new coalition
government headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka in mid-July.
All have now ended without direct government intervention, sending a clear
signal to workers and foreign investors of the new government's intention to
change the basic rules of labour relations.
The outlines of the policy were revealed earlier this month when Ms Suchocka
unveiled an 'enterprise pact' calling on the unions and workers to draw up
privatisation plans for their enterprises and involve themselves in
collective wage bargaining with management.
The government's refusal to get drawn into the summer strikes, even that at
FSM which threatened to derail Fiat's planned Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
takeover of the company, was the first sign of its determination to change
the political and emotional climate surrounding labour issues.
Mr Henryk Goryszewski, the deputy prime minister with overall responsibility
for economic matters, said: 'We have to do away with the old idea that
strikers are national heroes, fighting for a free Poland against communism.
Poland is now a normal country. Strikers' rights to wave the national flag
really ended with the first free elections.'
Such forthright views represent a sea-change in a country headed by Mr Lech
Walesa, probably the most famous strike leader in history, where strikes
were the main weapon against the regime for decades.
The groundwork for the new policy was laid by former Solidarity activists
like Mr Jacek Kuron, now the labour minister. He not only has to wean the
unions away from strike action but also persuade pensioners that their
payments must be cut to avoid an inflationary budget deficit.
All these unexpected new developments were only dimly perceived by strikers
at FSM demanding wage increases which, if granted, would have driven a coach
and horses through the government's economic strategy.
A deal which the strikers could have claimed as a victory would have fuelled
inflation and discouraged potential foreign investors already put off by a
year of political uncertainty.
For the strikers, however, it was difficult to understand how achieving a
'decent living wage' could have had such catastrophic consequences for the
Polish economy. 'We are producing cars of a European quality on the latest
machinery. So why can't we be paid more like our counterparts in Italy?' one
of the workers asked.
But the demand for wages equivalent to 10 per cent of the retail value of
Fiat's new Cinquencento model lost them support from unions representing
workers in other state enterprises who have seen their real wages fall by
more than 15 per cent over the last year. Having already been promised a 30
per cent increase by Fiat, the FSM strikers demand for more was perceived as
both unrealistic and excessive by other unions.
The still-Polish management, backed by Fiat, agreed during talks in July to
raise pay 30 per cent above the current average gross wage of around 3m
zlotys (Pounds 113) per month.
Fiat agreed to pay the rises only when it took over its 90 per cent
ownership of the plant. This it refused to do while the strike continued,
leaving the financial costs to be borne by the Polish government. But the
strike lost Fiat the production of more than 15,000 of its newest and most
popular models and ruined an expensive advertising campaign.
To its chagrin, Fiat saw Subaru of Japan grab a toehold in a key sector of
the Italian market by selling 6,000 of its own small cars in a market
deprived of the Polish-made Cinquencento.
The strike also stopped recruitment of an additional 2,000 Polish workers
needed to man a third shift designed to raise output from 160,000 to 240,000
cars a year.
Faced with government refusal to intervene, lack of support from the
Catholic church and growing pressure from the 18,000 non-striking workers at
FSM and the older plant at nearby Bialsko Biala, the isolated strikers
finally accepted defeat.
But the actors in the drama have paid a high price for the resolution of a
conflict.
Polish labour relations will never be quite the same again, but it will take
all Fiat's management skills to erase the legacy of bitterness.

punt

THE prospect of a realignment of the Irish punt, despite emphatic rejections
of such a measure by the Dublin government, continued to put the currency
and Irish government bonds under pressure yesterday as markets grappled with
the implications of France's narrow Yes vote.
The punt fell to its floor of DM2.619 in the European exchange rate
mechanism again yesterday, in thin trading, but heavy dealings were reported
in government stock.
The weakness in sterling is the key factor bearing down on the Irish
currency. More than 30 per cent of Irish exports go to the UK.
Mr Brendan Lynch, a senior economist at the specialist bonds trading firm
Bloxham in Dublin, said: 'The market is very bearish. There is a prospect of
realignment hanging over the market. Where sterling is going is very
important to us.'
He said trading in Irish government bonds yesterday was again high. The
benchmark nine-year 2001 stock, in which German investors are most active,
has seen its yield rise by 0.6 points to 9.57 per cent in the last week,
indicating heavy selling pressure. The longer-term stocks, mostly held by
Irish institutions, have seen yields rise by around 0.3 points in the past
week.
'There are similarities between now and 1986, when tremendous weakness of
sterling forced a unilateral realignment of the punt within the ERM,' Mr
Lynch said.
Sterling fell by some 16 per cent against the punt in late 1985 and early
1986, before a devaluation of the punt was forced on the Irish authorities.
Sterling has now fallen by almost 12 per cent against the punt since the
summer.
Mr Alan McCarthy, chief executive of the Irish Trade Board, said: 'It is
clear the profitability of Irish exporters to Britain will suffer in the
short term and there will be increased pressure in the Irish market as
British firms become more competitive here.' He said that over the past five
years Irish exports to Britain, excluding automatic data processing
equipment, had increased by 83 per cent. For indigenous Irish companies the
UK market accounts for 45 per cent of exports, and 30.7 per cent of Irish
exports overall.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, again emphasised yesterday there
would be no devaluation of the punt and said the turbulence of recent weeks
'demonstrates the need and benefits of a single European central bank and a
single European currency'. The sooner there was a single currency the
better, he added.
He conceded at the weekend, however, that should sterling fall by more than
14 per cent against the punt this would erode all the margin of
competitiveness that Ireland had built up against the UK economy over the
past five years.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Two crucial questions
ahead for the EMS - Can order be restored to Europe's currency markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN ever, the future of the European Monetary System (EMS) lies in the
hands of the German Bundesbank. After the devaluations of the past fortnight
and the indecisive French referendum result, currency markets face two
crucial questions.
Does the German central bank care enough about the short-term stability of
the system to make life easier for the 'hard core' of currencies which
remain linked to the D-Mark? And will this month's devaluations by Italy,
Britain and Spain  - whose combined gross national product makes up 43 per
cent of overall EC output  - lead inevitably to further pressure on weaker
currencies to follow suit?
To the first question, the Bundesbank yesterday responded with a polite but
firm No. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, a veteran of the
tortuous discussions at the end of the 1970s on how the system would affect
the Bundesbank's freedom of manoeuvre, ruled out EMS reforms. Speaking in
Washington, he warned that EMS partners could not expect Germany to cut
interest rates in the interests of the weaker members of the system.
To the second question, currency dealers came up with their own answer: Yes.
By driving down the French franc, as well as other softer currencies such as
the Irish punt, against the D-Mark, the foreign exchanges are signalling the
risk of more devaluations to come.
After the narrow vote in favour of Maastricht, France remains hopeful that
the Bundesbank can be persuaded to take a more conciliatory monetary stance,
as part of further development of the EMS. Mr Jean-Paul Betbeze, chief
economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris, said the system needed to evolve into
'a more political and less technocratic' arrangement. He was confident that
further cuts in German interest rates in coming months would be accompanied
by a narrowing of the interest rate differential between the D-Mark and the
French franc.
A less sanguine view was taken by Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. He said the ambivalent French
result and the departure of sterling and the Italian lira from the Exchange
Rate Mechanism may spell the death of the EMS.
'For five years, fund managers and currency investors have assumed that
there will be a single European currency and that they could invest in
Spanish equities, Irish gilts and Danish mortgage bonds with impunity,' he
said. 'That view has been damaged by the French vote.' The Bundesbank will
clearly be taking time to ponder the opportunity for interest rate cuts  -
even though these may become necessary for the good of Germany's own
sluggish economy.
The Bundesbank and other central banks have carried out an unprecedented
DM60bn of intervention to prop up weak European currencies during the last
few weeks. As a result, the Bundesbank is withdrawing liquidity from the
German money markets to 'sterilise' the effect of the intervention on
domestic liquidity  - a factor adding to the strength of the D-Mark.
Another area of concern on the exchange markets is that countries with
currencies which have not yet devalued, but which carry out significant
trade with 'softer currency' nations, may be forced into devaluation to
maintain competitiveness.
This has undermined confidence in the weaker currencies in the EMS,
including the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the Irish punt.
Investors had bought them in the belief that their respective countries
would abide by the stringent convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht
treaty.
Market attention yesterday was focused on the French franc. The franc
appreciated to FFr3.39 against the D-Mark in the immediate aftermath of the
referendum result, but later came under renewed pressure and fell to within
a centime of its ERM floor of FFr3.4320, despite intervention by the Bank of
France.
Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in
London, said that he did not expect to see the franc come under the kind of
speculative attack that afflicted the lira and sterling. 'There is no
obvious case for a franc devaluation, and the strength of the French economy
makes me think that there is even some reason to expect a revaluation,' he
said.
However, the departure of sterling and the lira has made dealers question
whether other EMS parities can be kept unchanged. 'If the market builds up a
head of steam against the French franc it could still blow the Bank of
France off course,' Mr Chertkow said.
The franc could be undermined if the August figure for M3 money supply in
Germany, due out this week, turns out higher than expected.
Even if the franc manages to stay above its floor, the weaker ERM currencies
could still be tested.
The Irish punt is particularly vulnerable because of the recent devaluation
of sterling. The UK accounts for nearly 40 per cent of Irish trade, and some
analysts believe that sterling's devaluation will upset the country's
trading position unless the Bank of Ireland carries out a similar move.
The Danish krone is suspect, because of the high risk that the Swedish krona
will be devalued. Among Denmark's main trading partners are Sweden, Finland
and the UK, all of whose currencies are among Europe's softest.
The future of the system may ultimately depend on whether political leaders
are prepared to refashion it. After the turmoil of the last week, foreign
exchange analysts believe that, at best, the EMS will develop into a
two-speed system, in which the currencies of France and the Benelux
countries are linked closely to the D-Mark and the remainder, including
sterling and the lira, float within very broad parameters.
However, last night currency dealers were not in the mood to take wagers on
whether even a two-speed system would prove durable.

European concern lingers

EUROPEAN business leaders, reacting on the whole with relief to the French
referendum result, yesterday assessed the impact of the narrow Yes vote on
their national economies and currencies.
In Spain the initial positive reaction from business was replaced by concern
over how the government would respond to the continued threat to the value
of the peseta.
Mr Jose Maria Cuevas, leader of the CEOE employers' federation, said that
while 'the referendum result clears away some of the uncertainties after
such great drama', the government had to begin implementing measures which
would complement the 5 per cent devaluation in the peseta, agreed in
Brussels last week.
This, he said, would not only involve the tight budget promised for 1993 but
also tackling structural rigidities in the labour market: 'We have to be
humble and admit that our economy is not sufficiently competitive.'
Mr Enrique Portocarrero, president of the Circulo de Empresarios Vascos, an
influential Basque employers' group, said despite the French vote: 'We are
still worried. The vote does not clear the horizon for us, especially as the
finance minister appears not to have ruled out a further devaluation.' That
would assist exporters but the inflationary consequences would delay any
interest rate cuts.
The question in France itself was how the franc would fare and whether Mr
Michel Sapin, France's finance minister, would be able to fulfil his aim of
reducing interest rates.
Mr Robert Lion, chairman of Caisse des Depots, one of France's largest
financial institutions, said the referendum 'paved the way for the French
economy to return to growth'. However, he warned that the government should
not be tempted to relax its tight control over the economy.
In Italy, business leaders said the result might help reduce the currency
market turmoil affecting the lira, which along with sterling was withdrawn
last week from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). However, they
also stressed that the outcome would maintain the pressure on Italy to
pursue monetary and fiscal discipline.
Mr Cesare Geronzi, managing director of Banca di Roma, Italy's biggest
banking group, said the French decision had led to 'the disappearance of a
first cloud over the political and economic future of our countries. Now we
need to straighten out the economic and financial situation and re-focus our
concentration on Italy's own financial recovery'.
Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, the chairman of Ferruzzi Finanaziaria, the holding
company controlling Italy's second biggest private sector group, said:
'France has again given Europe a chance. But this opportunity needs to be
managed with great prudence, because it will probably be the last.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, said the opportunity
remained for Europe 'to coalesce into a large and strong single currency
region'. However, 'it would be irresponsible to try to squeeze all EC
nations into the programme at the same time.'
British business leaders' focused on the greater freedom of economic policy
action provided by the suspension of sterling's ERM membership.
Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, said that the immediate priority for the UK
economy, had to be a reduction in UK interest rates. 'There is no point
looking over our shoulders and blaming the Germans. We need to put our own
house in order.'
Mr Roger Wood, financial director of construction company Wimpey, said: 'The
effect on our sector is at best marginal. What is needed most is early
clarification by the British government of its political and fiscal strategy
and how it intends to restore confidence.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Lira to remain outside
EMS

<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday decided against returning the lira to the
European Monetary System today for fear of further instability and costly
interventions.
The decision to let the lira continue floating was announced by Mr Piero
Barucci, the treasury minister, before returning from Sunday's meeting of
Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington. It is a reversal of a pledge
last Wednesday by the treasury and the Bank of Italy when the lira left the
ERM, after falling through the floor set earlier in a realignment against
the D-Mark.
Mr Barucci refused to be tied to a timetable for the re-entry of the lira
into the EMS. However, officials in Rome said this was unlikely to a matter
of days or even weeks. They said the authorities would be waiting to see
whether the markets stabilised, while monitoring moves by Italy's partners
to reassess the workings of the EMS in the wake of the turbulence of the
last ten days.
The Italian government could now wait until parliament approves the 1993
budget, which was outlined on Thursday. The budget has to be approved by the
end of the year and traditionally the parliamentary debate has lasted at
least three months. If this is the case the lira could float until
Christmas.
'It is better like this than risking a new fall (of the lira inside the
EMS),' Mr Pier Carlo Marengo, managing director of the commercial bank
Comit, said.
However, Italian officials were anxious to distance themselves from the
British stance on an indefinite float of the pound. Mr Barucci said he was
aware of Italy's obligations and was anxious to re-enter the EMS as soon as
possible. The Italians recognise that without such a commitment they risk
alienating further the markets.
Indeed, this desire to signal good intentions appears to have been behind
Italy's pledge to return to the EMS today. At the time the markets were
surprised the Italians could even contemplate returning so soon after the
French referendum on Maastricht and when the outlook for European currencies
remained unstable.
Yesterday the lira was trading at L838.98 against the D-Mark, showing
marginally improved sentiment following the narrow French approval of
Maastricht. But this represents a 10 per cent devaluation against the
D-Mark, compared to the 7 per cent realignment permitted last Monday. One
economist suggested a realistic floor might be L850 against the D-Mark.
The 1993 budget proposals, aiming to raise an extra L93,000bn in revenues
and spending cuts, were discussed yesterday between the prime minister and
representatives of the main trade union confederations, CGIL, UIL and CISL.
The unions have called a series of rolling four hour strikes by regions
beginning today, to protest the severity of some of the measures. They are
attempting to force the government to water down its intention to freeze
public sector employment, ease the cap of pension outlays and reduce the
cuts in free health care.
The unions are concerned that the inflationary impact of devaluation will
undermine the agreement signed at the end of July with the government and
the employers abolishing indexed wages. The preliminary inflation figures
for September show an annualised rate of 5.3 per cent.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Meanwhile ..the single
market plods on - The lifting of internal barriers on December 31 may give
EC leaders a rallying point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN recent weeks the erratic course of the Maastricht hare has inevitably
distracted spectators from the plodding progress of the single market
tortoise, now less than four months from the finish line.
The French Yes is not even on the formal agenda of EC internal market
ministers, meeting in Brussels today. But the lessons of the referendum
campaign - and of the Danish vote in June - have important implications for
the single market programme.
First, many of the anxieties are less a response to the Maastricht Treaty
than a belated reaction to the 1986 Single European Act, which launched the
internal market project.
In France, only the most protectionist No campaigners attacked the grand
marche itself. But claims of meddling from Brussels - for example, over
unpasteurised Camembert cheese - or dark apocalyptic fears of, say,
unrestricted immigration, sprang from suspicions of what a barrier-free
Europe might involve.
Some Brussels officials believe a No vote would have prompted widespread
resistance to existing legislation, with subsidiarity as the rallying cry,
and national self-interest as the real driving force.
'With a Yes vote, the temptation will now be less great, but nevertheless it
is still there,' warned one Commission official yesterday. 'Many people have
realised they can indulge in an exercise of Brussels-bashing without really
getting kicked back.'
Continuing sensitivity about Brussels' image in the EC could still hamper
installation of the final pieces of the single market - including some of
the controversial and most far-reaching elements.
It is worth asking, for example, whether the Commission and the British
presidency will maintain the pressure on reluctant member states to open up
the energy market. The Commission's plans to encourage wider access to gas
and electricity networks, a particular aim of the British government, have
already been watered down. But even in their dilute state they brought
thousands of French energy workers to the streets of Brussels.
Similarly, fragility of the political consensus could temper Commission
attacks on public monopolies under Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome. That
article - which could be used against energy, postal and telecommunications
monopolies - allows the Commission to legislate without approval of member
states.
Advocates of Article 90 - of whom the most prominent is Sir Leon Brittan,
the competition commissioner - say nothing has changed. 'In fact, if you
look at it from a positive point of view, (Article 90) opens up previously
monopolised sectors to competitions, to the benefit of consumers,' says one
competition official.
An incomplete and uneven internal market is the gloomy scenario. But it is
also possible that having scraped through the French referendum, member
states will rally round the project. That would be one way of demonstrating
the mutual trust which has recently been lacking in other areas of Community
co-operation. Britain, in spite of everything, is still best placed to lead
such a rally, given its long-standing support for the internal market.
Exactly what will happen at midnight on December 31, let alone beyond,
depends on the willingness of national governments to champion the single
market. But with the Community still in turmoil, officials say the value of
a symbolic, 12-strong lowering of internal EC barriers should not be
underestimated.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Floating pound not an
option, says Pohl
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FREELY floating exchange rate is not a realistic option for any European
country, according to Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president.
In a pointed reference to Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate
mechanism, he said decoupling an exchange rate from the D-Mark would not
allow greater freedom in the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy.
The US was big enough to float its currency but any European country trying
to float would fall into a 'vicious circle' of depreciation, inflation and
more depreciation.
After 'the failure of British exchange rate policy last week', the only way
forward lay in re-establishing 'near fixed rates' and moving toward a common
European monetary policy.
He remained optimistic that Europe would move towards a common currency and
central bank. However, only a 'multi-speed' approach to economic and
monetary union now looked feasible.
Mr Pohl, who was delivering the annual Per Jacobsson lecture at the
IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington, said the Bundesbank should not bear
all the blame for last week's debacle. It was 'generally acknowledged that
the UK joined the ERM at too high an exchange rate. DM2.95 was wishful
thinking.'
He also criticised the timing of British entry into the ERM, arguing that it
was predictable that German unification would impose strains on the system.
Last week's events reminded him of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods
exchange system in the early 1970s. The latest crisis 'was not very well
managed'. As in the 1970s there was 'no co-ordination and no leadership'.
He was convinced the crisis could have been avoided had European finance
ministers agreed a 'credible' package ahead of the Maastricht vote. This
should have included a realignment involving more currencies than the lira
and a more substantial cut in German interest rates.
Mr Pohl said problems had been caused by failing to exploit the flexibility
built into the European Monetary System. In the absence of a monetary union,
exchange rate adjustments were sometimes desirable and necessary.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: EC must regain its
street credibility / A look at the implications of the French vote for
Community democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'EITHER Europe will become more and more democratic. . . or Europe will be
no more,' Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, forecast
five days before Sunday's marginal victory for Maastricht in France's
referendum.
Appropriately enough, he was speaking in Strasbourg at the 40th anniversary
ceremony of the European Parliament, the body which is supposed to act as
the EC's democratic watchdog and antennae, but which has signally failed to
establish its legitimacy with Europe's citizens.
The parliament's failure, however, is only part of the democratic
shortcomings of a Community which, while sincerely defending the values of
democracy, legislates and decides in ways which are becoming more and more
removed from the people, and beyond their control.
Since 'Europe' came into being 40 years ago, it has been the enterprise of
the elites  - 'benign despotism', Mr Delors called it in his Strasbourg
speech. France's Le Nouvel Observateur last week caught how probably most
people visualise EC workings, publishing a photograph of a sharp-suited man
against a backdrop of the 12-starred Community flag and with a paper bag
over his head.
EC paper bag-wearers include not only the 'faceless bureaucrats' of
Brussels, or the 'lost tribes' of Euro-MPs in Strasbourg, but national
ministers and officials who come to Brussels almost weekly to reach
decisions they seldom seek, or are required, to justify before anybody. The
divisions across Europe exposed by the campaigns to ratify Maastricht
suggest either that this game is up, or, as Mr Delors suggests, European
union will never win popular legitimacy.
The Commission and the 12 are seeking a remedy in 'subsidiarity'. This
typically non-user-friendly concept means decisions should be brought closer
to the people. The EC would act  - with the Commission proposing and the 12
deciding through the Council of Ministers, subject to some amendment by the
European Parliament  - only when national action would be demonstrably less
effective.
But subsidiarity, while needed to delineate responsibility and avoid clashes
which fuel popular suspicion of 'Brussels', is unlikely to make the EC
democratic. That would at least require reforming the operations of Council,
Commission and parliament, a greater role for national parliaments in
holding EC lawmakers to account, more open decision-making and debate, and
better explanation.
The Commission is already studying how to shrink itself into a more
effective, politically alert body. The parliament is working on similar
lines, in an attempt to transform its cumbersome and too often frivolous
procedures.
Despite what one of the driving forces in the Commission describes as its
'millenarian ideology', the Brussels bureaucracy is probably savvy enough to
mutate sufficiently to survive as a shaping force in the EC.
The parliament is in worse shape. The 518 MEPs, and indeed member states
like Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium, were unhappy at the
modest increase in power which Maastricht gives Strasbourg. It now has
amendment rights it exploits insufficiently. Under the treaty it would get
more equal say on EC laws with the Council, more control over the
Commission, and a review of its powers in 1996.
But the most lucid minds in Strasbourg recognise that the parliament has
failed to connect with its dwindling electors. 'At the moment this
parliament has no priorities,' says Mr David Martin, a respected Labour MEP
and vice-president of the parliament. 'You have to identify where you can
wield influence.
'We have to admit that we're not using properly the powers that we already
have,' he says. If Maastricht gets through, he argues, MEPs should put aside
ambition for more power from the 1996 review, and 'justify our new powers,
demonstrate that we are an effective body, not say we are not effective
because we have insufficient powers.'
Denmark's rejection of Maastricht in June, he adds, 'could be just the
bucket of cold water we need, rather like it has been for the Commission.'
There is so far, however, little sign of the cold shower the Council needs.
The Council, as well as making law behind closed doors, frequently passes
the buck to the Commission for unpopular national policy, discrediting the
whole EC enterprise. France recently, for instance, asked the Commission to
propose an EC driving penalty points system, similar to the one which
provoked French truckers to gridlock France's roads in the summer. Brussels
sensibly invoked subsidiarity and refused.
Maastricht compounds the democratic shortcomings of the Council by placing
the new foreign and internal security policies outside the EC remit. This
provides for member states to act jointly, outside the effective oversight
of either national parliaments or Strasbourg.
Ideas to staunch this leakage of accountability range from opening up
Council lawmaking to the public, to a greater role for national assemblies.
The compromise is likely to involve greater national parliamentary control
over the Council. 'We must exploit the legitimacy of national parliaments
through ways and means which depend on each country,' a senior Commission
official says. 'The idea that the European Parliament is the only source of
legitimacy in the Community is dead.'
But it is far from clear whether such a national parliamentary role will do
more than massage national MPs' egos. The same official, formerly a
high-flier in the French administration, acknowledges that Paris and
Brussels always deal direct, without even passing reference to the French
National Assembly. Denmark's Folketing, which keeps the closest watch on EC
law, revealingly favoured more powers for Strasbourg in the Maastricht
Treaty.
The UK House of Commons is, to say the least, lively on Europe, but MPs seem
more concerned to score points than examine detailed measures.
One of its better-known practitioners, Mr John Biffen, said after the Danish
vote: 'The instinctive prejudices and wisdom of street politicians hold the
key to Europe's future, not those of the good and the great.' If he is
right, the EC does not have much time left to get down to street level.

TRADE negotiators involved in the stalled Uruguay Round of global trade
talks in Geneva were yesterday downbeat in assessing post-referendum
prospects.
'I'm not sure the French vote is going to be all that helpful,' said one
European official, pointing to continuing political uncertainties on both
sides of the Atlantic. The six-year-old multilateral negotiations have been
moribund for months because of failure by the US and the European Community
to resolve differences over farm trade reform.
EC farm ministers meeting in Brussels also saw little prospect of an early
breakthrough. France's Mr Louis Mermaz was quoted as saying only that 'the
US must change its position'. Senior trade officials from the 'quad'
countries - US, EC, Japan and Canada - meet in Geneva tomorrow to assess
prospects for the round.
Earlier this month, US and EC negotiators agreed to give their bilateral
negotiations a 'final push' immediately after the Maastricht vote in France,
in the hope of reaching accord by mid-October. Washington officials have
said they want a deal ahead of the US presidential election on November 3.
This would pave the way for conclusion of a Uruguay Round package in Geneva
before the end of February 1993, when the US administration's 'fast track'
negotiating authority expires. Failure to reach agreement by then would
almost certainly sink the 108-nation round.
But senior trade diplomats in Geneva worry that politicians may still be
unready to make the often painful compromises needed for a settlement. 'I
see no evidence the EC will be ready to deal,' said one.
Continued anti-Maastricht feeling in Europe, including Britain which holds
the EC presidency, along with currency turmoil and domestic difficulties
affecting Germany, France, Britain and Italy will continue to paralyse trade
decision-making, some negotiators believe.
There is also a question mark over US credibility as a negotiating partner,
since President George Bush is trailing Democratic challenger Bill Clinton
in the polls. Mr Clinton has been silent on the Uruguay Round but the
assumption is that he would want to put his own stamp on the outcome if he
wins. This risks upsetting the delicately balanced package, much of which
has already been drafted.

ON Maastricht, the German body politic seems to want to eat its cake and
have it.
One side - Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his government and the main parties  -
says full steam ahead: lingering doubts about the meaning of Maastricht, and
the implications for the D-Mark, must be subsumed in a rapid ratification
process.
'Maastricht is not going to fail because of Germany,' says Mrs Heidemarie
Wieczorek-Zeul, EC spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats (SPD),
normally die-hard opponents of the chancellor.
The other side - many of the same people, plus business and industry, the
financial establishment, and politicians outside the Bonn hot-house  -
simultaneously wants a breathing space, time for some fine-tuning, even for
a little reconsideration about the revolution implied by economic and
monetary union (Emu).
'The direction of Maastricht is the right one, but the speed will depend on
how quickly we can solve the problems,' Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister and
close associate of Mr Kohl, said yesterday. One cannot create a European
currency 'artificially', he said.
Outside the establishment there are those who want nothing to do with
Maastricht at all. In spite of growing public sympathy, they have made no
impact on Bonn. Their campaign for a referendum does not look likely to
succeed - partly because of the shambles of the French referendum and, more
important, because of bitter memories of the misuse of referendums in the
Weimar republic, when they undermined the elected parties and contributed to
the rise of Hitler.
Even those fighting for ratification admit that the process - due to begin
with a first reading in the Bundestag on October 7 - is no longer the end of
the issue. For the demand by both houses of parliament to have another
debate before moving to the final stage of Emu, in 1997 or 1999, is now
recognised as a chance to halt any automatic move to a single currency.
'No German government will go ahead (to Emu) if the Bundestag refuses to
accept that the economic convergence criteria have been fulfilled,' a senior
government official said yesterday. 'And Emu without Germany would not
happen.'
The view that is gathering momentum, however, is that the EC is condemned to
become a multiple-speed community.
As a result of the divided establishment view, there is something of a
love-hate relationship towards those seen as complicating the process: first
Denmark, then France, and now Britain.
The Danish No vote was welcomed by many pro-Europeans for forcing the German
public to focus on the Maastricht Treaty for the first time. It was welcomed
by opponents for liberating the debate and allowing Germans to dare to say
No in the opinion polls.
The French referendum was watched in trepidation throughout the
establishment for fear it would undermine Germany's most important partner
in all Community affairs. With the result out, no one is quite sure the tiny
majority for the Yes vote will not have the same effect: sapping the French
government's will-power as one half of the 'motor' of European integration.
Attention is turning to the British reservations, just as the British are
indulging in a dose of Germany-bashing. One voice of the establishment says:
'Press on regardless. They will never be true Europeans.' Another voice
says: 'How can we help them stay on board? For we sink or swim together.'
'Great Britain must decide,' says Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman
of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats. 'There is a growing temptation for people
to pull back into their national snails' shells. It is an illusion. It is an
expression of fears, a flight from reality. The reality is called Europe.'
What Germany can do for British Prime Minister John Major is return to the
issue on which the two stand relatively united: the need to reinforce
so-called subsidiarity - maximum devolution of decision-making - and the
protection of national identities in the Maastricht Treaty.
That was the key new element in Mr Kohl's statements on Sunday night and
yesterday, in the wake of the referendum result. Otherwise he was merely
insisting that Maastricht must be ratified by all member states, and that
European political union must move hand-in-hand with economic union.
'We must all ensure that the Europe of Maastricht is a democratic and
citizen-friendly Europe, which respects and promotes the national identity,
history and culture of all member states and their regions, a Europe which
is built on the basis of 'unity in diversity',' he said.
However, the simultaneous German concern is that UK fury at the fall of the
pound, and its accusations of German complicity, may fatally undermine
British willingness to find ways of pushing the Maastricht process forward.
That would be serious if Britain were just one of 12 members round the
table. It could be disastrous with Britain currently occupying the
presidential chair and so responsible for promoting compromise.
In particular, Mr Major's suggestion that the emergency summit in October
might consider ways of reforming the European Monetary System and its
exchange rate mechanism is regarded as wild and dangerous in Bonn.
'If you want to torpedo the EMS, you just do what the British prime minister
seems to suggest,' one German official said yesterday. 'I don't see how you
can negotiate at a European summit, in front of 5,000 journalists, about the
future of the monetary system. The markets would go wild.
'We need a summit meeting well prepared to do some stock-taking and to agree
on how to get the ratification process through. We need to answer the
problems of both Denmark and the UK. We still have not given up hope with
the UK.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Poll reveals gulf
between French leaders and voters

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S 51.05 per cent majority vote for European monetary and political
union has given President Francois Mitterrand a reprieve, but signals a
profound change for French politics.
The first outlines of the new landscape started to emerge yesterday as the
broadly pro-European political establishment, both left and right, began to
take in the sombre message of the vote. It showed that the main parties'
policies on the wide range of subjects in the Maastricht treaty are out of
kilter with the views of nearly half the electorate.
'The problem of Maastricht has been sorted out, but the problem of France is
another story. This country is manifestly troubled,' warned former president
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the centre-right UDF. Mr Laurent Fabius,
first secretary of the Socialist party, added: 'We will have to take account
of the French who voted No.'
Alarmed party leaders were already starting to reposition themselves
yesterday for legislative elections due next March. The governing committees
of the Socialists, RPR Gaullists and Communists are all to meet in the next
week.
There were reports that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, was urging
a snap parliamentary poll, before the RPR Gaullist party had time to
reconcile the internal splits opened by the campaign. Mr Fabius disagreed,
partly on the grounds that the Socialists need more time to seek an alliance
with the ecology parties, both of which are mainly pro-Maastricht and which
represent a combined 14 per cent of the electorate.
Meanwhile Mr Jacques Chirac, the pro-Maastricht president of the mainly
anti-treaty RPR Gaullist party, is set to demand a vote of confidence in his
leadership at a meeting of the party's national council tomorrow. Supporters
of Mr Philippe Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, the leading anti-treaty rebels
in the RPR, yesterday called on Mr Chirac to negotiate a fresh European
policy with them.
For the time being, it looks as if a presidential election is not on the
agenda. Mr Mitterrand has won the European gamble, and will probably want to
take a hand in steering the remains of Maastricht or its successor through
the EC. In theory, he can stay in the Elysee until April 1995, though few
observers believe he will, in view of his illness and the thrashing the
Socialists are expected to receive at the legislative election.
According to exit polls on Sunday night, the Socialists and their allies
would pull in a mere 22 per cent of the votes in a legislative election,
while the RPR and UDF would get a solid relative majority of 45 per cent.
The big challenge facing all the main parties as they prepare for the
election campaign is how to tackle the deep regional, class and economic
divisions opened up by the referendum debate. Sunday night's voting
statistics reveal a sobering pattern, decribed by Mr Giscard d'Estaing as a
map of the haves and have-nots.
As an indication of just how easily the result could have swung the other
way, 54 of France's 96 departements - 56 per cent of the total - produced a
majority No vote. It was perilously close; only 50.82 per cent of the
electorate in mainland France voted in favour of the treaty. The final votes
from the overseas territories and domains, in the South Pacific and
Caribbean, lifted the total to 51.05 per cent.
Generally, the treaty got the thumbs-up from rich regions and cities such as
Paris, Strasbourg, eastern France along the German border and Rhone-Alpes.
The big surprise here is that Brittany, with its poor agricultural and
fishing communities, was among those regions to follow its politicians'
advice and come out with a solid Yes. Maastricht even won the day in La
Trinite-sur-Mer, the birthplace of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the
extreme right-wing National Front and one of the treaty's most outspoken
opponents.
The Noes were to be found in economically depressed regions like
Nord-Pas-de-Calais, hit by the decline of traditional industries; Picardy,
north of Paris; and Corsica and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. The poor port
cities of Marseilles and Calais were also confirmed as hotbeds of
Euro-scepticism.
Generally, the pattern shows that economically vulnerable areas gave the
thumbs down to their political leaders' Euro-enthusiasm. Exit polls
reinforce that idea, showing majority opposition to the treaty among farmers
and industrial workers, with support from executives and the professional
classes.
The exit polls also showed that the RPR is not the only party to split over
Europe, though it is the one with the deepest divisions. Around 60 per cent
of RPR voters ignored Mr Chirac's pro-Maastricht policy and voted against,
while around 40 per cent of UDF supporters ignored Mr Giscard d'Estaing's
line and voted against. Among Socialist voters, 20 per cent defected into
the anti-Maastricht camp.
In the days and weeks to come, the main parties' leaders have some hard
thinking to do if they are to respond to their supporters' doubts in time
for the legislative election.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Major moves to regain initiative over Euro-sceptics: Cabinet
strains emerge after French vote - Pounds falls to new low against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR sought yester-day to recover a grip on his party by signalling
to Tory Euro-sceptics that economic recovery in Britain would now take
precedence over European integration.
As a still-falling pound reduced the scope for lower interest rates, there
were signs that French approval of the Maastricht treaty was creating new
strains within the cabinet over its approach to Europe.
Mr Major did little to dispel the impression of disarray in Whitehall after
sterling's enforced departure from the ERM and the narrow French vote.
The discordant notes sounded in recent days by Tory Euro-sceptics were
matched yesterday by alarm on the pro-European wing that policy is lurching
towards narrow nationalism.
The anxiety that Britain risks being stranded on the fringes of the
Community was heightened by the announcement that German chancellor Helmut
Kohl and French president Francois Mitterrand will meet for a bilateral
summit later today.
Writing in the London Evening Standard, Mr Major stated bluntly that
sterling would not return to the exchange rate mechanism 'until it (the
mechanism) has been reformed'. He underlined that there was no question of
Britain ratifying Maastricht until after next month's emergency summit and
following Denmark's clarification of its position.
Downing Street signalled that the issues of ERM re-entry and Maastricht
ratification may now have become inextricably entangled, with little
prospect of the treaty gaining parliamentary approval while the pound is
floating.
Mr Major said the battle against inflation would remain the priority of
economic policy. But, in an apparent softening of his previous absolute
commitment to stable prices, he referred to the goal of 'low inflation and a
prosperous economy'.
As Whitehall officials acknowledged that a lower pound would eventually lead
to higher price rises, Mr Major encouraged speculation about possible
reductions in interest rates. He said if the government kept a firm grip on
public spending it would be able 'to bring down interest rates without
risking our success against inflation'.
Strong hopes of a rate cut fuelled a rise of 44.2 points in the FT-SE 100
share index early yesterday, although prices fell back once it became clear
that the Bank of England did not intend to cut rates immediately. Shares
ended the day 6.9 points lower at 2,560.1.
While there is no prospect of the rapid and sharp reduction in borrowing
costs demanded by some on the Tory right, Mr Major may judge it impossible
to restore party unity over Europe unless he delivers the long-promised end
to recession.
The prime minister said that other EC leaders should reflect on the concerns
of their electorates before pushing ahead with integration: 'All of Europe's
governments need to reflect hard on the lessons of the last weeks and months
and on the future direction of the Community.'
That sentiment was echoed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, and Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who are both staunchly pro-European.
But the tenor of the two ministers' assessment appeared markedly less
hostile than that of Mr Major.
Mr Clarke, speaking on BBC Radio's World At One, underlined the government's
commitment to Maastricht. Other ministers are dismayed at the much more
sceptical stance adopted by Mr Major and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, last night denied
that the cabinet was split over Europe. But in an interview with Channel 4
news he acknowledged that there were differences of view among his
colleagues.
One suggestion at Westminster last night was that the prime minister was
engaged in a 'tactical retreat' with the aim of restoring Tory party unity
and then moving on to reassert an essentially pro-European policy.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, added to the tension last night
with a demand that Mr Major demonstrate 'leadership' in steering the
Conservatives back to a pro-European stance. He called for the prime
minister to push ahead immediately with ratification of Maastricht.
Lord Tebbit, a leading Euro-sceptic, warned last night that any attempt by
Mr Major to bring the bill back could lead to the party tearing itself
apart.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Students say no to taxing careers with the Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY be one of the world's oldest professions, but life as a tax inspector
is the last thing graduates crave, according to the latest annual Mori poll
of final-year university students.
Only 5 per cent  - down from 8 per cent in 1989  - said they were at least
fairly interested in the tax inspectorate, with 79 per cent saying they were
not interested at all. Next in unpopularity were the Royal Navy, the Army
and the Royal Marines.
The news is a blow for the Inland Revenue, which has tried hard to spruce up
its image in the last two years with the use of corporate identity
consultants and the launch of its taxpayers' charter.
'We have an image problem,' one official conceded last night. 'People think
we're bureaucratic and dull. In reality nothing could be further from the
truth. We are changing our image and are seen within the Civil Service as
one of the more dynamic departments.'
The Mori survey was based on interviews with 1,024 final-year students from
18 universities in March this year. It found that there was most interest  -
49 per cent  - in broadcasting and journalism, 39 per cent in public
relations and 38 per cent in teaching. At least one third were interested in
management consultancy, advertising and the Civil Service.
Asked more generally about what they would like to do, 22 per cent said
research and development, followed by general management and scientific
research. The proportion interested in finance was 17 per cent, 2 per cent
lower than last year.
Intellectual challenge was the main influence on the choice of a job at 55
per cent. More than one third mentioned the opportunity to be creative and
original, and to work with people rather than things.
Only 20 per cent rated a high starting salary as important. The average
expected starting salary was Pounds 12,330, 2 per cent in real terms below
the level a year ago. Women expected significantly less than men - Pounds
11,590 compared with Pounds 12,830.
When deciding on specific employers, three-quarters said the most important
factor was the opportunity to progress on merit. More than one third also
mentioned long-term career development, company culture and style of
management, training and long-term rewards.
Most graduates considered themselves responsible with a broad outlook on
life. Nearly half said they were realistic, imaginative, had initiative and
wanted to do something useful.
But 11 per cent  - up from 7 per cent 12 months ago  - described themselves
as 'desperate for a job'.
Only 56 per cent of the sample had picked a career field by Easter, down 4
per cent on the previous year, but 17 per cent had decided before university
and 16 per cent in their first or second academic year.
The most popular technique for applying for a job  - for 51 per cent  - was
speculative applications, while about 40 per cent replied to advertisements.
Only 13 per cent expected to use a summer recruitment fair.
London remains the most desired location for a job.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Franco-German bid to revive Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE AND Germany are expected to launch an initiative to revive the
Maastricht treaty after a mini-summit in Paris today between President
Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The initiative will concentrate on reinforcing democratic control over EC
institutions, reassuring those who fear the loss of national identity and
taking in new member states.
Senior German officials dismissed the suggestion that the talks might
produce a formal initiative, but French officials said they expected 'a
classic Franco-German move'.
One French official said the meeting could help Mr John Major ahead of his
proposed emergency EC summit, which is likely to be held in London on
October 16, because it would address issues of particular concern to
Britain.
European Community foreign ministers meanwhile said they gave high priority
to 'speedy and successful conclusion' of member countries' ratification of
the treaty on closer economic and political union.
But at their meeting in New York, Britain succeeded in preventing any
commitment to a precise date for ratification.
An aspect of Mr Major's proposed summit arousing the hostility of among some
EC governments is his suggestion that it should consider changes within the
European Monetary System.
'If you want to torpedo the EMS, you just do what the British prime minister
seems to suggest', one German official said. 'I don't see how you can
negotiate at a European summit, in front of 5,000 journalists, about the
future of the monetary system. The markets would go wild.
'We need a summit meeting well-prepared to do some stock-taking and to agree
on how to get the ratification process through. We need to answer the
problems of both Denmark and the UK.'
French officials deny that France and Germany might plan a slimmed-down
version of economic and monetary union.
Officials in Paris and Bonn stressed that the intention of Mr Kohl and Mr
Mitterrand was to ease the forthcoming ratification debates in Britain and
Germany, and start the process of answering Denmark's objections to the
Maastricht treaty.
'The French vote (on Maastricht) should help relaunch the ratification
process', Mr Mitterrand's spokesman said.
He also said the two leaders would discuss ways of ensuring greater control
by national governments and parliaments over the Brussels bureaucracy and
the injection of more democracy.
In a televised reaction to the French referendum, Mr Kohl said: 'We have to
learn from the experience of the past few weeks. We also have not only to
talk about possible mistakes, but to correct them.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / German bank says UK must negotiate re-entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON AND LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Bundesbank yesterday served notice that the UK will have to
negotiate sterling's re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism at
an appropriate parity as the currency fell to a new low against the D-Mark.
In remarks which are likely to irritate the British government, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said that the re-entry of sterling
and the lira into the ERM would have to be on terms approved by all other
participants.
The ERM remained under heavy strain yesterday after France's narrow approval
of the Maastricht treaty failed to allay investors' fears about the future
of European monetary union.
The French franc dropped to within two centimes of its ERM floor against the
D-Mark, in spite of continuous intervention by the Bank of France, and
supportive comments from Mr Schlesinger.
Ireland's punt was again the victim of heavy selling as investors continued
to buy D-Marks.
In Italy, the central bank's announcement that it would not rejoin the ERM
today, as it suggested last week, triggered another heavy sell-off of the
Italian currency against the D-Mark. It closed in London at L845.2, from a
previous close of L836.2, although it picked up in early Far East trading
today where it was quoted at about L842.2.
Sterling, which left the ERM last week, fell as speculators anticipated an
early cut in UK base rates.
The pound closed in London 7 1/2 pfennigs down from Friday's close at
DM2.5375, an historic low against the D-Mark and an effective 10 per cent
devaluation from the old ERM central rate. In New York it finished the day
at DM2.5338, and slipped a shade further to around DM2.53 as Far East
trading opened.
Sterling also fell against the dollar, finishing in New York at Dollars
1.7080, more than 2 1/2 cents down on Friday's close. Early today in the Far
East it gained slightly to about Dollars 1.7130.
Without specifically naming the pound, Mr Schlesinger said it was 'very
important' that countries entering the ERM should choose a parity that
'would be right from the beginning'. This had not happened in the past.
Mr Schlesinger's remarks reflect the continued distaste the Bundesbank has
for the way the UK entered the ERM in October 1990. At that time UK
unilaterally decided that sterling's parity would be DM2.95 and announced
the rate before the weekend meetings of EC officials which were to discuss
UK entry.
Mr Schlesinger's insistence that the UK submit its proposed entry terms to
its EC partners is in line with ERM rules.
But it is likely to irritate Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who at the
weekend made clear the UK wanted changes in the ERM before again submitting
sterling to its disciplines.
Last night he voiced hopes that the French vote would help calm the markets.
He added that although sterling was outside the ERM, 'our policies will
continue to be directed at achieving the objective of sustained
non-inflationary growth over the medium term, and of meeting the convergence
conditions set out in the Maastricht treaty'.
The ERM had difficulty coping with the D-Mark as its anchor currency after
German union, he said, and called on the EC to address the 'rationale' of
the ERM. One issue was whether it should revert to a system of fixed but
adjustable parities, as was the case before 1987, or 'a glide path towards a
single currency'.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Markets weaken on narrow result in
referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets weakened yesterday on disappointment that
the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty had resulted in only a narrow
majority in favour.
The result was seen as prolonging uncertainty over the future course of
European monetary union and did little to ease tensions within the exchange
rate mechanism.
French government bonds fell 1 1/2 points from the peaks on Sunday night in
the immediate aftermath of the vote. However, 10-year bonds finished only
marginally down on Friday's closing levels.
The 10-year benchmark bond closed on a yield of 8.62 per cent, from 8.57 per
cent on Friday. The narrow margin in favour of Maastricht left the franc
under pressure on the foreign exchange markets and investors remained
nervous that the French currency could still be devalued within the ERM. The
franc closed at FFr3.42 against the German currency, against a floor in the
ERM of FFr3.4305.
The Bank of France left its money market intervention rate unchanged at 9.6
per cent. Some traders had been anticipating a small cut in rates if the
referendum resulted in a vote in favour of Maastricht. However, any easing
of monetary conditions is unlikely until the franc climbs further above its
ERM floor.
GERMAN government bonds traded lower as the French referendum result killed
off hopes of an interest rate cut by the Bundesbank.
Traders said the bund market had been overbought at the end of last week on
hopes of an easing in German rates. If France had rejected European economic
and monetary union on Sunday, the Bundesbank might have lowered rates to
help support the French Franc.
However, given the small majority in favour of the Maastricht treaty, the
Bundesbank looks less likely to lower interest rates. Bunds suffered heavy
selling pressure, especially longer-dated issues, resulting in a flattening
of the yield curve.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, told reporters in
Washington that the central bank's policy-making council would review German
interest rates at its meeting next week, but dealers remained sceptical
about whether this would lead to an easing. The Bundesbank cut its discount
and Lombard rates at the beginning of last week to reduce tensions in the
ERM.
The bund futures contract opened at 90.75 and fell to a low of 90.41 before
ending at around 90.72. Traders said the market will be watching the August
money supply figures which are due to be released this week. M3 money supply
for August is expected to show growth of about 8.5 per cent, unchanged on
the July figure.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds continued to rally at the shorter maturities yesterday,
but gilts fell back sharply at the long end on fears of renewed inflationary
pressures in the economy.
The 9 per cent bond maturing 2008, the benchmark long-dated gilt, fell over
1 1/2 points. The stock closed at 98 1/32 for a yield of 9.23 per cent. In
contrast, the 12 per cent gilt maturing 1995 closed up  1/3 of a point on
the day for a yield of 8.6 per cent.
Analysts are anticipating Thursday's parliamentary debate on the economy, at
which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, is expected to
outline plans for the future conduct of monetary policy. Mr Lamont has
indicated that he would return to a policy based on the targeting of
monetary aggregates rather than exchange rates.
In addition to fears about inflation, long-dated gilts prices were also
depressed by fears that overseas investors will desert the market now that
sterling is floating outside the ERM.
The government may have to fund the public sector borrowing requirement at
higher yields if domestic institutions are the only substantial buyers of
gilts.
The sharp rally in shorter maturity stocks since sterling was suspended from
the exchange rate mechanism last Wednesday means that short-dated gilt
yields are lower than long-dated yields for the first time since 1988, when
base lending rates were cut briefly to 7 1/2 per cent. The gilt yield curve
was last 'disinverted' for a protracted period in the early 1980s.
The rally in short-dated stocks reflects hopes that interest rates will be
cut sharply to stimulate economic activity. The December short sterling
contract on Liffe traded at around 91.65, implying base lending rates of
8.35 per cent by the year end against a current rate of 10 per cent. This
view was also reflected in the interbank loans market, where three-month
funds were trading at 9 7/16  - 9 5/16 per cent.
EUROPE'S traditional high-yielding markets  - Spain and Italy  - weakened on
disappointment over the outcome of the French referendum.
The small Yes majority and resulting pressure on the French franc has dashed
hopes of lower interest rates in France and Germany, which means that the
Italian and Spanish currencies will remain under pressure. Dealers
speculated that the lira would probably be devalued further before
re-entering the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS.
SWEDISH government bonds fell sharply as the market ignored the government's
sweeping austerity package  - announced on Sunday  - and the cut in the
marginal lending rate yesterday from 500 per cent to 50 per cent.
Traders said the SKr40bn budget-cutting programme was viewed with some
disappointment by the market, as the government had already publicised its
intention to cut spending. Domestic and foreign investors took profits
yesterday and yields closed higher.
Yields on three-month treasury bills climbed from 18 per cent to 27 per
cent, while the yield on the 10.25 per cent bond due 2003 rose to 11.55 per
cent from 10.75 per cent at Friday's close. Adding to the poor sentiment,
yesterday's auction of nine-year bonds saw poor interest: SKr5.5bn of bonds
were offered but only SKr5.23bn were sold.
UNCERTAINTY surrounding events in Europe in the wake of the French weekend
vote and concern about this week's trial version of Dutch auctions in the
sale of two and five-year notes left Treasury prices slightly lower across
the board yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/32 at 98
13/16 , to yield 7.343 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/8 at 100, to
carry a yield of 3.861 per cent.
Although analysts had expected the markets to receive a boost if the French
voted in favour of Maastricht, the close nature of the referendum, with 51
per cent voting Yes and 49 per cent No, failed to clear up the uncertainty
surrounding the outlook for economic integration in Europe. Consequently,
many investors chose to stay on the sidelines yesterday, and prices slipped
lower in very light trading.
Market participants were also cautious ahead of the Treasury auctions, in
which the government plans to experiment with a new method of selling its
securities in which all bidders will receive their securities at a single
price.

FT  22 SEP 92 / International Bonds: ERM strains overshadow Kingdom of
Spain's Dollars 1.5bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Spain's first venture into the US dollar sector of the
international bond market was still receiving only lukewarm support for
investors yester-day as attention remained focused on the fate of the
European exchange rate mechanism.
The Dollars 1.5bn bond issue, launched last Tuesday as European markets
lurched into crisis, is due to be priced today.
The issuer had hoped that stability would return to the markets following
the French referendum on Sunday, but it seemed yesterday that Spain's offer
was still likely to be overshadowed by events elsewhere.
The launch has been made all the more difficult by a widening of spreads in
the bond market since the issue was launched. With little activity in the
secondary market, dealers have tended to widen spreads in recent days.
The Dollars 2bn issue from Province of Ontario, brought last Monday at a
spread of 48 basis points over US treasuries, was quoted yesterday at 56
basis points over.
Italy's announcement last Friday that it was introducing a 12.5 per cent
withholding tax on repurchase agreements also pushed up spreads sharply on
supranational agencies such as the the European Investment Bank and World
Bank.
This has reversed a tightening of spreads on bonds issued by these agencies,
which at first seemed likely to escape entirely from the Italian
authorities' decision to impose tax only on bonds issued from now.
The Kingdom of Spain's deal is expected to be priced at the upper end of the
indicated spread of 42 to 45 basis points over US Treasuries.
Even then, the lead managers could find themselves having to support the
issue if the spread is not to widen further.

FT  22 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Little relief seen for
investors after Maastricht vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE poor performance of French government bonds yesterday underlined that
Sunday's narrow vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty will bring little
early relief to bond market investors.
For the market to flourish, France must still succeed where the UK and Italy
failed: defending its hard-pressed currency within the EMS while delivering
lower interest rates demanded by a weak domestic economy.
The Bank of France certainly disappointed bond market optimists yesterday by
keeping its money market intervention rate unchanged at 9.6 per cent, a
level which has prevailed since December.
But the foreign exchange markets dictated that interest rates could not be
cut.
The franc closed the day at FFr3.42 against the D-Mark, still too close to
its EMS floor for any unilateral easing of interest rates. Indeed, the Bank
of France was rumoured to have intervened in support of the franc.
'The credibility of the 'franc fort' policy remains under severe strain,'
commented Mr Philip Tyson, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London.
The risk of a devaluation has already been partially factored into French
government bond prices. The yield spread over German bonds at the benchmark
10-year maturity stood at 112 basis points at the close yesterday, from a
low of 40 basis points at the start of this year and 58 basis points before
Danish voters rejected Maastricht.
Analysts believe the French may be able to cut interest rates unilaterally
by perhaps  1/4 percentage point this year if pressure on the franc eases.
But any further cuts will depend on the pace of interest rate reductions in
Germany.
There is also a danger that politics will again unsettle the foreign
exchange and bond markets in the run-up to parliamentary elections next
spring.
The conservative parties which urged the French electorate to vote No on
Sunday may be more likely to accept a devaluation as an unavoidable cost of
lower interest rates.
Alternatively, the Socialist government may feel compelled to embark on a
reflationary fiscal policy to combat high unemployment.
But, in spite of the risks, there are strong reasons to believe the franc
can be defended. On most measures France offers better economic fundamentals
even than Germany, boasting lower inflation and a lower budget deficit. In
contrast to the UK, the French trade balance shows a healthy surplus.
The German government, in particular, has a strong political incentive to
keep the franc within the system and keep France in the fast track towards a
single currency. A devaluation of the franc would also be more damaging to
German industry than a devaluation of sterling or the lira.
If a devaluation can be averted, logic dictates the yield spread between
French and German government bonds should fall to the levels seen earlier
this year.
Indeed, the yield spread could narrow to less than 40 basis points. After
all, the current crisis could be an opportunity for Paris to build a
valuable store of credibility, a commodity in short supply in London and
Rome.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Business Law: Down a well-travelled road on insider dealing
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Company Law Committee of the Law Society last week called for public
consultation on the proposed law on insider dealing. The problems with the
legislation are an example of what happens when technical legislation is
brought to parliament without public consultation on the draft clauses.
There is a convention that primary legislation should not be the subject of
public consultation before it is introduced to parliament. There is
consultation on the principles involved, but not on the legislation itself.
The Company Law Committee believes that this convention has not served us
well and has contributed to the enactment of legislation which does not
achieve its aims. Parts of the Companies Act 1989 provide a good example.
With the legislation on insider dealing we appear to be headed down the same
road.
The committee has commented extensively on the draft clauses. There are two
kinds of problems - a basic problem which arises because we are trying to
implement a European Community directive which has no clear principle behind
it; and technical problems which mean that we are in danger of making a bad
position worse.
At the moment, an individual is not an 'insider' unless he or she is
connected with the issuer of the securities, or connected with some other
body which is involved in a transaction with the issuer, or unless the
individual is a 'tippee' - a person who receives the inside information from
someone who has such a connection.
The directive does away with this connection, and an individual will now be
an insider if he or she 'has access to such information by virtue of the
exercise of his employment, profession or duties'. The principle behind this
is very hard to pin down.
Added to this, both the directive and the draft legislation alter the kinds
of information which will in future be regarded as 'inside' information. The
effect is to make it much more uncertain whether particular facts - or
rumours - are caught.
The combination of the removal of the connection requirement and the new
wide class of inside information leads to difficult and often uncertain
results.
If, for example, a diligent analyst discovers information about a company
with the aid of the resources of his firm, does this amount to information
which he has obtained 'by virtue of the exercise of his employment'?
Arguably it is not - the fact that he is paid to do this sort of work does
not mean that he obtains access to the information by virtue of his
employment if it could have been discovered by anyone.
On the other hand, suppose the analyst tells other people in his
organisation. Those individuals then do obtain access to the information by
virtue of their employment. Are they forbidden to deal, and more important,
forbidden to encourage others to do so?
Similar problems arise with journalists who discover unpublished facts about
companies.
If we are to extend the class of insider in this way then it is very
important that we set out the principle behind what we are doing and define
clearly whom we are trying to catch.
Then there are the technical problems. Under our present law there is an
exception which, in some circumstances, allows an insider to deal where the
inside information relates to a transaction and the dealing is to facilitate
that transaction. This is the exception which allows, for example, a bidder
to buy shares in the target in advance of a bid.
The directive contemplates such an exception and the committee believes that
there is to be a clause along these lines in the legislation. But the
committee has not seen it yet and it is likely to raise difficult technical
problems (as does the present law). The committee believes firmly that there
is no substitute for public consultation on a point such as this.
At present, the law only applies to deals on the Stock Exchange or through
an off-market dealer who is making a market in the securities. The new law
will apparently also apply to deals through or by a professional
intermediary.
The result of this can be anomalous. It will mean that a private individual
can deal with another, face to face, on the basis of inside information, and
not commit an offence. However, if he sells to a professional in exactly the
same circumstances, he will be committing an offence. This is irrespective
of the size of the dealing and whether or not it affects the market.
Taken to its logical conclusion this seems to mean that a private investor
can safely take advantage of another private investor when dealing face to
face but can not take advantage of a hardened City professional. This is a
very odd result.
This may also cause problems in relation to underwriting where a
professional intermediary will agree, by signing an underwriting agreement,
to acquire securities at a time when the information relating to the issue
has not been made public.
At the moment there is no offence because the dealing does not take place on
market, but it is clear that if this definition is going to change then
underwriting will have to be catered for.
There are many other problems and none of them is simple. The solution
depends on clearly establishing the principles behind the draft legislation
and then discussing its ramifications thoroughly with those who are familiar
with the workings of the securities market.
Only if this is done can the UK hope to achieve legislation which is clear
enough to catch the insider, but does not impede legitimate business
transactions or interfere with the capital raising function of the market.
London already has a reputation as a heavily regulated market. It is very
important that UK rules are clear, well understood and well known and that
legitimate transactions are not affected by quirks in the law.
It is only if the government is prepared to consult publicly on the draft
legislation that it can hope to get it right and to present parliament with
a bill which does not cause more problems than it solves.
The author is a partner of City solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons and chairman of
the Law Society's Company Law Committee.

FT  22 SEP 92 / People: Progenitor joins ICI Bioscience
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The man from SG Warburg who played a central role in advising the planned
break-up of ICI is joining the chemicals and pharmaceuticals company next
week and will become finance director of ICI Bio-science in January when ICI
Bio is split from ICI.
John Mayo, 36, a corporate finance director at Warburgs, ICI's lead banker,
was called in at the beginning of the year to look at the various options
for ICI - which, at the time, was hard-pressed by the 2.8 per cent stake
Lord Hanson had taken in the company. The plans for the split, the largest
demerger ever in the UK, were announced at the end of July.
Mayo will report to David Barnes, 56, a main board director and long-serving
ICI man, who has been named as the chief executive of Bioscience.
The appointment marks another departure from the conglomerate's tradition of
producing its own senior executives. While Mayo is not coming on to the
board, his will be a senior position, and among current directors, only
Colin Short, finance director, joined from outside in 1990. Before that, the
last external appointment was Sir Paul Chambers (chairman from 1960-1968) in
the 1950s. 'Times are different now,' says ICI, partly reflecting the
changes wrought by the presence of Hanson - which sold its stake in May.
Mayo, a graduate in economics and economic policy from Loughborough
University, joined Arthur Andersen in 1978 as an articled clerk. Six years
later he moved to Warburgs.

FRANCE and Germany, the two strongest remaining members of the Exchange Rate

as it fell on currency markets following the Maastricht vote.
The support came amid rumours in Washington of a big flight of funds from
France into the D-Mark. Yesterday, despite Bank of France intervention, the
franc dropped to within one centime of its ERM floor against the D-Mark.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, predicted that the financial
markets would calm down when they took the full measure of the French
referendum.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, insisted the franc was a
fundamentally healthy currency. He underlined that France had a lower
inflation rate than Germany and that the rate of wage inflation in its
public sector was half the German level.
Mr Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance minister, said there was no reason to doubt
the French franc and predicted that speculators against the currency would
suffer.
Mr Sapin said the European Monetary System had not emerged unscathed from
last week's turmoil, and dampened expectations of a rapid cut in French
interest rates. 'I said a Yes would open the prospect of a reduction in
interest rates. That remains profoundly true,' Mr Sapin said, noting that
last week's Bundesbank interest rate cut, although small, was an 'absolutely
considerable reversal of trend'. But he said Europe would have to 'bandage
its wounds' after the currency market turmoil.
Privately, French officials are pleased by what they see as new respect for
the franc's solidity after its test last week. 'The Americans don't talk to
us about the franc the way they used to. The Germans don't talk to us about
the franc the way they used to. If the German monetary authorities, who are
notoriously demanding, notice that, then others will have noticed too,' said
a finance ministry official.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Interest rate gap
'should be reduced' - IMF in Washington
</HEADLINE>

GERMAN interest rates should be lowered and US rates increased, Mr Carlos
Solchaga, Spain's finance minister and chairman of the IMF's policy-making
interim committee, indicated yesterday.
He said world economic recovery was being held back because 'German rates
are too high and US rates too low'. The differential in rates had to be
reduced if countries were to achieve sustained growth and greater currency
stability.
Countries would have to co-ordinate their policies more effectively if the
kind of turbulence in financial markets experienced last week was to be
avoided, he said. Mr Solchaga was speaking at a press conference in
Washington to release the communique of the IMF's interim committee.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, echoed Mr Solchaga's call for
greater economic co-operation, arguing that recent events had shown with
'crystal clarity' the interdependent nature of countries' policies.
Mr Camdessus said he was not pressing for an immediate raising of US
interest rates. However, the Federal Reserve should ensure that economic
recovery was promptly accompanied by 'moderate and progressive' increases in
rates.
The importance of policy co-ordination and the need for economic convergence
within Europe was underlined in the communique. It said countries had to
improve the balance between fiscal and monetary policies if they were to
achieve a narrowing of interest rate differentials.
Mr Camdessus said yesterday that President George Bush's suggestion on
Sunday that greater use be made of commodity price indicators in
co-ordinating economic policies was 'timely' and would be explored further.
However, the IMF already made use of commodity prices, including gold, as a
'forward-looking indicator' of economic developments.
Mr Camdessus again called on industrial countries to consolidate their
budgets. The route to sustained growth lay in reducing long-term interest
rates by cutting the proportion of national savings absorbed by public
sectors.
Turning to the outlook for developing countries, Mr Camdessus said
substantial progress had been made in reducing debt burdens. The ratio of
debt to gross domestic product had fallen by a third  - from 180 per cent to
120 per cent  - in the past seven years. In many countries debt was 'no
longer an impediment to growth'.
The communique also praised the reform efforts under way in central and
eastern Europe.
Questioned about the narrow Yes vote in France's referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty, Mr Solchaga said that having received a democratic Yes in
France the ratification process should continue.
Mr Solchaga expressed confidence that the Italian lira would return to the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism soon but he believed the British
authorities had no intention of an early return for the pound.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: US puts commodities
index at centre-stage - Plans for stabilising currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
That at any rate seems to be the motto of Mr James Baker, President George
Bush's chief of staff and sometime US Treasury secretary.
Mr Baker is deemed to be the man behind President Bush's proposal that
countries use a basket of commodities, including gold, as a means of
co-ordinating exchange rate movements.
The president put the idea to finance ministers assembled in Washington for
the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in a speech on Sunday.
The US put forward a similar idea at an IMF annual meeting five years ago
when Mr Baker was in charge of the Treasury.
But what is the basket of commodities supposed to do, and how could it help
stabilise currencies?
In spite of the tantalising reference to gold, the US suggestion does not
amount to a proposal to restore the gold standard for currencies of
pre-first world war days.
Instead, the US idea is a development of the process, which exists at
present in a low-key form, by which the leading industrial countries are
supposed to co-ordinate their economic policies with reference to an agreed
batch of economic indicators.
An index of commodity prices, including gold, already exists. The US wants
countries to monitor this index as a 'reference point' in the exchange rate
system.
Too sharp a change in the index in any given currency could indicate whether
an economy was moving out of line with other industrialised economies. The
basket could, in this way, stimulate or even trigger corrective action.
The US idea is to create a new element of discipline in international
monetary relations that is not as rigid as the fixed or semi-fixed exchange
rate regime of the European Monetary System.
The commodity basket with gold would, however, be more effective than simple
peer group pressure exercised in meetings of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries. The present divergences of economic policy among the
Group of Seven are a poor advertisement for peer group activities.
There is a thirst for new ideas on how to manage the world economy. Mr
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the IMF, has urged member
countries to come up with proposals.
Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, in his speech to
the IMF's policy-making interim committee, underlined that countries 'need
to improve co-operation and redouble efforts at policy co-ordination' on a
worldwide basis.
Last week's crisis in the European Monetary System has shown the dangers of
a fixed or semi-fixed rate regime when economic fundamentals get out of
kilter with exchange rates.
But is a commodity index the right approach? America's trading partners tend
to be sceptical.
Commodity prices can be very volatile, making such an index an unreliable
guide to economic conditions. There is also a suspicion that the US as a
leading producer of primary commodities and gold would benefit from the
scheme more than other industrial countries.
Other nations are uncertain how far the US, or any other country, would be
bound to act by any movements in the index.
There is also a puzzle over the economic rationale behind the proposal.
When the US first advanced the idea in 1987, its interest rates were in
double digits and it was seen as a way of possibly justifying lower
borrowing costs. Now short-term US interest rates are at their lowest level
since 1963.
The rebirth of the idea probably owes far more to electoral politics. The
hint of a new gold standard could appeal to the right wing of the Republican
party and probably win President Bush some approving editorial coverage in
the Wall Street Journal.
The president's intervention also has given the impression that the US has a
constructive role to play in the present uncertain international monetary
climate, at little cost to the US Treasury.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: 'Recovery is under way
but sluggish and uneven'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extracts follow from the communique of the interim committee of the board of
governors of the International Monetary Fund:
'IN industrial countries, recovery is under way, but it remains sluggish and
uneven, unemployment is unacceptably high, and recent exchange market
tensions have increased uncertainty. Inflation and interest rates have
declined significantly in a number of countries. . . the recent currency
turmoil forcefully illustrates the importance of reinforced policy
co-ordination, a firm implementation of the medium-term strategy, and
continuing efforts toward economic convergence in Europe.
The committee welcomed the actions recently taken to reduce market tensions
and noted the resolve of major industrial countries to co-operate closely
and to take appropriate additional actions as needed to strengthen growth
without rekindling inflation and to foster greater currency stability. . .
key countries need to co-operate closely. . . to bolster confidence and
improve the balance between their fiscal and monetary policies, thereby
facilitating a narrowing of interest rate differentials.
Monetary and fiscal policies should aim at a lasting decline in long-term
interest rates through a reduction in public sector borrowing and a further
lowering of inflation expectations. Vigorous action must be taken to
eliminate structural rigidities that impede employment and productivity
growth. An early, successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round (of trade
reform) would be an invaluable contribution.
The committee welcomed the steady and successful implementation in many
developing countries of sound economic policies and structural reforms.
The committee praised the progress being made by the countries of central
and eastern Europe in reforming their economies under Fund-supported
programmes. There has been progress against inflation and there is some
evidence that the sharp contraction of output may be coming to an end.
However, the prolonged weakness of activity in some countries underlines the
need to carry through further reforms quickly.
The committee welcomed the evidence of further gains under the debt
strategy. A number of developing countries, however, have yet to secure
decisive solutions to their debt problems. The committee commended the Paris
Club's provision of greater debt relief for low-income countries in the
framework of strong adjustment programmes, and its readiness to consider a
reduction of the stock of debt after a suitable period of adjustment.'

Operating profit was static at Pounds 154,000 but a reduced interest charge

Edinburgh Fund Managers, the international fund management group, reported a
23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 1.89m in the
six months to July 31.
Mr Colin Ross, chairman, said the decline reflected reduced profit from unit
trust trading, lower income on cash deposits and increased administrative
costs associated with an imminent office move.
He said the full year was expected to show a comparable decline in profits
as that experienced in the first half. The interim dividend, however, is
held at 5p and a maintained final of 8p forecast.
New business totalling Pounds 100m was won in the period, but this was
partially offset by a 3 per cent fall in funds under management to Pounds
1.84bn, as world stock markets declined in sterling terms.
Earnings per share dropped from 9.5p to 6.9p.

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: A man with his finger on the pulse /
Profile of Pierre Vinken, the Elsevier chief with global ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU MAY have run into Mr Pierre Vinken in the past without ever realising
it. It would have been on London's Piccadilly Line somewhere between
Heathrow Airport and Green Park station and Mr Vinken, chairman of Elsevier,
the Dutch publisher, would almost certainly have been wearing a sober blue
suit and be on his way to a meeting at Reed International, the international
publishing and information group.
'It was beautiful when Reed was right beside Green Park station,' says Mr
Vinken, a former neurosurgeon turned publisher who still often travels from
the airport into London by tube.
If it is very cold, or he has a lot of paperwork to get through, Mr Vinken
will, however, hail a cab.
The quietly-spoken Mr Vinken is not only a millionaire; if all goes to plan,
from January he will also be chairman of one of the largest publishing
groups in the world - Reed Elsevier, the Pounds 5bn group being created by
the merger of the two companies.
An important part of his ambition to make Elsevier a truly global company
has been fulfilled by the merger agreement.
'The bigger, the vaster, the organism the more you can do with it. There is
an endless string of possibilities for improving businesses. With 35,000
people there are always people with ideas. If you are fishing this is an
enormous net you are casting into the ocean. You always catch something,'
says Mr Vinken in a rare interview.
He has never appeared on television and says he never will. Despite Elsevier
owning several influential Dutch newspapers Mr Vinken, who is 64, says he
never voluntarily speaks to the press. He is, he insists, a private person.
Mr Vinken, whose father was a coal mine security officer, graduated in
medicine in 1955 and between then and 1963 did post graduate studies in
psychiatry, neurology, neuroradiology and neurosurgery. And that was how he
turned to publishing.
'I was working day and night and had no money. What I did to escape was
spend my weekends and free evenings working for a medical publisher indexing
journals - the lowest you could be.
Within a few years he was editor-in-chief of 50 journals and for five years
maintained a dual career as publisher and neurosurgeon.
'I would operate between 7am and 12 noon, then I would go for lunch to the
publishing company where they were waiting. I would work there from 12.30 to
6pm and then I would go home and do either of my homeworks,' he says.
When Mr Vinken was forced to choose by Elsevier in 1970 there was no doubt
in his mind.
'I think there is something editorial born in me which somehow makes a
publishing company attractive to me. I know how each of these products are
made and I could stand in for any of the jobs save for book keeping,' he
says.
The Elsevier chairman was an early exponent of electronic data bases for
medical use and was also chief editor of the 27-volume Handbook of Clinical
Neurology.
But he can also point to a growth of operating income that has averaged 20
per cent a year and operating income per share of 15 per cent.
He is due to become the first chairman of Reed Elsevier and will then be
succeeded by Mr Peter Davis, the Reed chairman who will be chief executive
of the merged company.
'The chances for effectiveness and efficiency are enormous but I will not be
the one to bring this into the next century. Peter will do that. But I will
contribute experience and a sense of strategy and direction as far as
necessary,' Mr Vinken said.
Together they would be saving costs and developing strategies, including
acquisition strategies, designed to boost profit per share.
'That is good for the company, good for everyone. You get the best
personnel, the best products in an almost Darwenian process of natural
selection and improvement,' says the former neurosurgeon who claims never to
look backwards and is already looking forward to the first meeting of Reed
Elsevier.

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West hit by fourfold jump in bad
debt charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Bristol &amp; West, the UK's 10th largest building society,
plunged by 67 per cent during the first six months of the year after it was
forced to make a fourfold increase in its bad debt charge.
Profits for the six months to June 30 1992 amounted to Pounds 13.1m, down
from Pounds 39.2m last time.
The bad debt charge was up from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 29.7m.
Almost all the provisions were against residential lending as a result of
the fall in the value of repossessed homes.
They also included a general provision of Pounds 9m.
Mr Tony Fitzsimons, chief executive, said the society had decided to make
substantial provisions at the interim stage this year, even though it had
been fully provided at the end of 1991.
'We expect a better second half and the figure for the full year should show
an improvement on last year provided there is no further deterioration in
the housing market,' he said.
City analysts said the result was not so bad as had been feared in some
quarters. The fall in profits should be treated as a one-off event because
of Bristol &amp; West's decision to introduce a new provisioning formula.
Total assets of the society rose from Pounds 6.2bn in June last year to
Pounds 7.3bn, although part of the increase came from the takeover of
Cheshunt Building Society.
Interest income was up by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 64.2m, but non-interest
income dropped by 8 per cent to Pounds 34.2m.
The society's mortgage book grew from Pounds 5.7bn at the start of the year
to Pounds 6bn.
There had been a good inflow of retail savings despite the general trend in
the industry, said Mr Fitzsimons.
Management costs rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 55.6m.
This partly reflected the society's policy of opening new retail financial
centres and a new non-retail mortgage distribution arm.
Hamptons, Bristol &amp; West's 100-branch estate agency chain, incurred a Pounds
2m loss. This was said to be lower than last time.

group profits from overseas. North America was the biggest profit earner in
geographic terms last year with Pounds 33.2m of the Pounds 71.2m pre-tax
total. The UK contributed Pounds 22.1m. While money and securities broking
provided the majority of the profits, the smaller divisions contributed as
follows: retail financial services  - mainly credit for car purchases and
car insurance  - made Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 6.9m); information, Pounds 4.7m
(Pounds 3m); media (the Avenir stake), Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 6.6m); property,
Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2.3m).

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Loss of licence helps TVS return to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS ENTERTAINMENT, the ITV broadcaster for the south of England, achieved
pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.6m for the six months to June 30, compared with
losses of Pounds 10.9m last time.
The results accompanied an agreed Pounds 38.2m offer for the company from
International Family Entertainment which runs The Family Channel, a general
entertainment cable channel in the US.
The offer, which values each TVS ordinary at 25p and each preference share
at 45p, has the support of main shareholders such as Canal Plus. Mr James
Gatward, a founder and former chief executive of the company is leading
opposition to the bid on the grounds that TVS is worth much more.
The offer is partly in cash and partly in shares in IFE, which was listed on
the New York Stock Exchange in April.
TVS has come on the market because it failed to win a new broadcasting
licence in last's year's competitive tenders for ITV franchises and ceases
to be a broadcaster from the end of this year.
The loss of the licence is the main explanation for the improved financial
position. The company has reduced its UK broadcasting activities and cost
base as quickly as possible.
The sale of its 50 per cent stake in the CBS/MTM studio company in Los
Angeles for Dollars 27m in February has also helped to reduce group
borrowings to Pounds 3.5m at the end of June, compared with Pounds 25.4m at
the end of 1991.
Losses at MTM, the US independent production company whose purchase caused
many of TVS Entertainment's problems, have increased although sales
marginally improved. MTM reported a loss of Pounds 5.7m in the first half,
against Pounds 2.4m, because of the weak dollar and an increase in the
amortisation of US programme costs.
Turnover was up from Pounds 102.1m to Pounds 106.3m. Because TVS continues
to have a deficit on its own profit and loss account no dividend is
declared.
Mr Rudolf Agnew, TVS chairman, said that the process of winding down UK
broadcasting operations and cutting costs would continue in the second half,
'with a view to leaving the group in as strong a financial position
following the expiry of its Channel 3 licence as is possible in all the
circumstances'.
If the IFE offer is confirmed the American company will take over on January
1 and base its operation at the TVS studios at Maidstone, Kent. TVS has
already sold its Southampton studios to its successor.
For each TVS ordinary, the offer is worth 0.041195 of the new IFE shares,
while each TVS preference share is worth 0.074152 of the new IFE shares.
The partial cash alternative offer is worth a maximum of 23p for each
ordinary and 43p for each preference. The maximum amount of cash available
under the partial cash alternative is Pounds 18.5m, with Pounds 6.3m being
available for ordinary shares and the rest for preference shareholders.
If all TVS shareholders elect for cash, then the cash offer for ordinary
shares will be scaled down to a minimum of 10p cash plus 0.021422 new IFE
shares, while preference shareholders will receive a minimum of 25p in cash
plus 0.029661 new IFE shares.

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ross surges to Pounds 1.35m and lifts
interim by 33%
</HEADLINE>

   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
ROSS GROUP, the acquisitive consumer electronics and packaging services
company, yesterday announced sharply higher first-half profits and turnover,
and lifted its interim dividend by 33 per cent.
The company, brought to the main market through a reverse takeover of the
Whittington giftware group in March last year, reported pre-tax profits in
the six months to June 30 of Pounds 1.35m.
This compared with Pounds 101,000 in the same period last year when profits
were reduced by Pounds 400,000 of restructuring costs.
Turnover jumped to Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 8.52m) and operating profits
increased to Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 766,000), but were partly offset by higher
net interest charges of Pounds 468,000 (Pounds 265,000).
Mr Noel Hayes, chairman, said substantial progress had again been achieved
despite difficult trading condit-ions.
Earnings per share of 0.73p, or 0.76p per share fully diluted, compared to
losses of 0.15p per share last time, out of which an increased interim
dividend of 0.2p (equivalent 0.15p) will be paid.
Mr Hayes said the electronics division experienced testing trading
conditions because of the depressed level of high street spending, but
continued to broaden its customer base and secure new product listings.
The acquisition of Stellar, completed in November, which introduced car
security into the group, is now 'well integrated and considerable benefits
are being derived both from cost savings and ongoing investment.'
Gemini Car Alarms produced another strong performance and the acquisition of
Sonicare in August has consolidated car security as an important growth area
for the group, as well as giving it a presence in the in-car entertainment
market.
The packaging division again made steady progress with the Pounds 7m modular
prefabricated avionics buildings contract progressing 'on time and on
budget'.
Looking ahead, Mr Hayes said trading conditions showed few signs of
improving, but expressed confidence that by controlling costs and marketing
effectively the group will produce 'a very strong second half performance.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: HSBC plans changes at top - Purves to step
down as chief executive but retain chairmanship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW chief executive officer for HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank and Midland Bank, is likely be appointed early in the New
Year, Hongkong Bank said yesterday.
60-year-old Mr William Purves, currently chairman and chief executive, will
relinquish day-to-day management of the group while retaining the post of
executive chairman, he indicated in an interview with the South China
Morning Post yesterday.
The front runners for the group chief executive position are all Hongkong
Bank men and hold positions on the bank's 'policy unit', or executive
management board.
The two front-runners appear to be Mr John Bond, executive director for the
Americas, who is considered the front runner inside the bank after turning
around Marine Midland, the group's formerly ailing US subsidiary, and Mr
Paul Selway-Swift, who is responsible for the group's operations in Hong
Kong and China and was promoted to the main board earlier this summer.
Mr Bernard Asher, executive director of capital markets, and Mr John
Strickland, executive director in charge of information technology, are also
possibilities.
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, while highly rated personally by
Mr Purves, is considered as a remote outsider, partly because of his age,
but also because Midland is seen as the junior partner in the merger of the
two groups.
It was a condition of Bank of England approval for Hongkong Bank's takeover
of Midland that senior HSBC management be resident in London. Timing of the
management shuffle is linked to a change in HSBC's tax residency; the group
becomes a UK tax resident on January 1.
Mr Purves, who does not move to London until August or September next year,
will stay on as executive chairman during the transition period. He has said
he will serve in that role thereafter for as long as the board of the bank
deems fit. It is expected that Mr Purves will hold the chairmanship of HSBC
for some years to come.
In his interview with the Post, Mr Purves said the merger with Midland was
going 'remarkably well'. He said a great deal had been achieved in a short
time but that a lot remained to be done at Midland where Mr Pearse was
'getting on well with it'.
'We have a policy of delegating responsibility to individuals depending on
experience,' he said.
'The bank is not run by committees. This is something that is a change for
Midland. There were many more committees and many more committee decisions
were being made in Midland than we had.
'But I think they are welcoming the change. I think Mr Pearse himself is not
a great committee man.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bryant bounces back with 97% advance to
Pounds 20.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRYANT GROUP bounced back in the 12 months to May 31 with a 97 per cent
advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 20.3m, against a depressed Pounds
10.3m.
Last time the West Midlands-based housebuilding and construction company
made provisions of Pounds 12m  - Pounds 8m for house sites and Pounds 4m for
property developments. In the period under review, this had fallen to Pounds
5m, split Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m respectively. Operating profits rose 37
per cent to Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 15.6m).
The Pounds 10m pre-tax increase was struck on turnover ahead at Pounds
322.9m (Pounds 282.8m) and against a background of continued depressed
confidence in the housing market.
However, Mr Andrew Mackenzie, managing director, said that the company would
continue to expand organically  - in Yorkshire, where Bryant has seven
sites, and in the north-west, where it has six. Although further
geographical spread, especially in the north, is likely, acquisitions are
'extremely unlikely', he said.
House sales increased 25 per cent to 2,330, split evenly between the south
and the core central areas, even though the average selling price fell to
Pounds 86,000 (Pounds 90,000). This produced a 73 per cent climb in
operating profits to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 9m) on turnover of Pounds 196.6m
(Pounds 159m). However, house sales had slowed recently, Mr Mackenzie said.
With prices in the land market becoming 'more realistic', Mr Chris Bryant,
chairman, said that the land bank had grown to nearly 10,000 plots with
planning status.
Year-end borrowings were Pounds 15.6m, giving gearing of 8 per cent (5 per
cent). It would not, according to Mr Michael Chapman, finance director, be
pushed above 20 per cent by future land purchases, Associated undertakings'
borrowings fell to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 25.4m).
'A broad mix to spread the risk,' said Mr Chapman, was the recipe in the
construction side, where operating profits rose by Pounds 2m to Pounds 4.6m.
Turnover was Pounds 100.5m (Pounds 97.4m) but is likely to fall to the
Pounds 60m mark in the current year.
There were Pounds 24m of property sales, and lettings stand at 80 per cent.
Profits declined to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 4m) on turnover of Pounds 27.3m
(Pounds 32.7m).
The final dividend is unchanged at 3.4p for a total of 4.8p, covered 1.2
times by earnings of 5.5p per share.
COMMENT
With the housing market still in deep recession, Bryant has helped itself
with prudent provisioning made extensive enough  - some Pounds 30m so far  -
and, more importantly, early enough. It has made a virtue of selling at a
price to find buyers and avoiding having to rely on sweetening deals to make
sales. Its low plot costs have let this strategy work, as the results show.
Although house prices have slipped, Bryant has increased volumes with more
or less the same overhead  - the number of sites rose from 85 to 90.
Forecast profits of Pounds 22m pre-tax for the current year give a multiple
of 15.9. That, and a safe yield of about 7 per cent make the stock
attractive within the sector.

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Brent Chemicals overcomes recession with
39% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT CHEMICALS Inter-national reported interim pre-tax profits up by 39 per
cent to Pounds 6.4m in spite of continuing recessionary conditions in most
of the speciality chemical group's markets.
The Buckinghamshire-based group, which took heavy redundancy and
reorganisation costs at its 1991 year-end, increased earnings per share 21
per cent to 5.3p (4.4p). The interim dividend is held at 1.6p.
The shares closed 7p higher at 139p.
Turnover, boosted by acquisitions, increased from Pounds 49.9m to Pounds
59.9m in the six months to June 30. The group said sales and profits growth
were par-ticularly strong in packaging, graphic arts and aerospace
activities. Business to the electronics industry had also been expanded, in
spite of continuing weakness in that market.
Mr Stephen Cuthbert, chief executive, said Brent's two most recent
metal-finishing acquisitions - Hebro in Germany and CWC in the US - had
exceeded expectations, with the former's sales and profits up by more than
15 per cent.
Lord Lane of Horsell, chairman, said UK business remained under pressure but
achieved increased profits on reduced volume following efficiency
improvements.
Overall the group continued to gain market share and maintained its gross
margin. This, together with the overhead reductions achieved in 1991,
increased the return on sales to more than 10 per cent.
Lord Lane said: 'We believe the trading performance supports our strategy of
realigning the group away from low-growth UK markets to a more broadly-based
international business.'
The group, which raised Pounds 15.6m in a rights issue last November, had
net cash of Pounds 4m at June 30, but most of that will be paid out in
deferred considerations during the second half.
Lord Lane said: 'Whilst the short-term outlook remain uncertain, our
geographic and market spread will enable us to benefit from the eventual
market upturn.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Metalrax improves margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALRAX, the engineering components, housewares and storage equipment
group, improved its margins in the first half of 1992 by 'matching costs to
volume', according to Mr Eric Moore, managing director.
Pre-tax profits rose by Pounds 13,000 to Pounds 3.32m on turnover lower by
Pounds 1.8m at Pounds 30m.
In the branded storage equipment and housewares divisions, which each
account for a quarter of the business, Mr Moore said heavy discounting had
been avoided and that product development was the key.
In components, where the shrinkage in volumes was not unexpected, the
investment in plant and equipment helped the group stay competitive.
Mr Moore said the group was 'keeping its nose in front' in its trading in
the second half, though the third quarter was traditionally quiet.
Earnings were unchanged at 3p per share and a rise in the interim dividend
to 1p is declared (0.91p adjusted).

FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Microvitec returns to black with Pounds
62,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICROVITEC, the USM-quoted computer peripherals manufacturer and software
group, returned to profit in the first half of 1992 after two years of
consecutive losses.
The turnround came despite continuing losses in its distribution division
and higher net interest costs.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 62,000 compared to losses of Pounds 2.21m,
including Pounds 267,000 of rationalisation costs, last time. Earnings per
share came to 0.1p against losses of 4.8p. No dividend has been paid since
1990.
In the latest period the group reported operating profits of Pounds 439,000
(Pounds 1.67m losses) on turnover which more than doubled to Pounds 25.5m,
mainly reflecting the acquisition in May last year of Logitek, the computer
services company.
Mr James Bailey, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We have continued to
reduce costs and improve efficiency and these, together with our changing
product mix, have improved gross profit margin to 26.3 per cent.'
'This has been achieved despite the effects of the continuing recession,
price reductions by computer manufacturers and fierce discounting by
competitors.'
Net interest charges more than doubled to Pounds 377,000 (Pounds 183,000)
mainly as a result of debt acquired with Logitek. However, Mr Bailey said
the company was committed to reducing the level of gearing, which had
improved to 72 per cent at the end of June.
All divisions of the company, except the Logitek distribution business which
is operating in a 'hostile environment', operated profitably in the first
half. A new management team has been appointed in the distribution division
and costs are being reduced.
The monitor and display division returned to profit following the successful
implementation of a joint venture with Electrohome of Canada, and the launch
of the new AlphaWindows terminal.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Liam Strong moves to shed Sears' men's wear division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the group behind such UK high street names as Wallis, Dolcis and
Olympus, is shedding its men's wear division with the sale of Fosters and
Your Price.
This is the latest move by Mr Liam Strong, Sears' chief executive, who has
been reviewing all parts of the poorly performing retail business since his
arrival from British Airways in February. Last year Sears made a pre-tax
profit of only Pounds 81.2m on sales of nearly Pounds 2bn from roughly 3,700
outlets.
Mr Strong said the men's wear business was small and 'was not going to be an
area of significant profit growth'. The group intended to 'concentrate on
areas where we have or can build market leadership'.
Fosters' management, headed by Mr David Carter Johnson, is paying Pounds 1
for the fittings, stock and other working capital. Sears will face an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 82m, of which Pounds 42m is a write-off of
goodwill related to a change in accountancy rules on acquisitions.
The cash cost to Sears is Pounds 18m in professionals' fees, redundancy
costs, the purchase of preference shares in Fosters and eliminating
liabilities.
It said it was shedding a business that had cost Pounds 30m over the past 2
1/2 years. Last year's trading losses were Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds
128m. So far this year it has lost nearly Pounds 11m more.
The Fosters business, with 340 outlets, has 2.5 per cent of a UK men's wear
market laid low by recession. Verdict, a market research organisation
specialising in the retail sector, says the mens and boys' wear market
contracted 9 per cent last year, and nearly 4 per cent in both 1989 and
1990. This year is also expected to be poor.
Men's wear has always been a small part of Sears, which includes the
Selfridges department store, womens fashion and childrens' wear and the
Freemans mail order operation.
The British Shoe Corporation is seen as a problem area and Mr Strong said
the decision here was 'to improve and build'.
Mr Carter Johnson has already spent 18 months trying to turn Fosters around.
The Your Price stores would either be converted into Fosters shops or
closed.
The management buy-out is being backed by Hambro European Ventures.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Enron thwarted in North Sea move: Group had ambitions to
expand in UK gas marketing and natural gas liquids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENRON, one of the largest US gas companies, has been thwarted in its attempt
to buy a block of North Sea gas production from Chevron, the oil company.
The co-venturers  - British Gas, Phillips Petroleum and Agip  - have
exercised their pre-emption rights. The operating agreement allows them to
pre-empt for the same cash value as any offer received by Chevron.
British Gas said that the purchase was not intended to keep a competitor out
of the market but was made to secure further gas supplies.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Enron had characterised its offer for the block, known as J- Block
containing the Joanna and Judy fields, as its first big step into the UK gas
marketing and natural gas liquids business.
The deal would have given it about 190bn cubic feet of gas, and 12.5m
barrels of natural gas liquids, and established the company in both the
upstream and downstream sides of the energy business.
It would have allowed Enron to market large quantities of gas to power
generators and big industrial users in north-east England, where it is
leading a consortium to build one of the biggest power stations in the UK.
Enron already had plans to market surplus gas from that project  - a 1,725
megawatt gas-fired power station at Imperial Chemical Industries' Site on
Teesside, which will be supplied by the Amoco-operated Everest and Lomond
fields.
Mr Howard Martin, vice-president of Enron Europe, said he was disappointed
that his company's J-Block ambitions had come to nothing, although it would
continue to look aggressively for other opportunities to grow in the North
Sea.
He added that Enron was negotiating with the field partners over the
possible purchase of gas from the J-Block development.
Although it was known British Gas had a 6.34 per cent stake in the field,
and hence the power to pre-empt the deal, many industry observers believed
it was unlikely to do so because of the current Monopolies and Mergers
Commission inquiry into the UK gas market.
They felt it would be a political error for British Gas to be seen to be
trying to block potential competitors.

FT  22 SEP 92 / MAI lifts profits by 7% to Pounds 71.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the UK-based financial services group headed by Lord Hollick, the
Labour peer, increased its pre-tax profit by 7 per cent to Pounds 71.2m in
the year to June 30.
Growth came mainly from money and securities broking, which accounted for
two thirds of group sales, and from the much smaller information division,
which includes the NOP market research organisation.
With Pounds 100m cash in hand, interest income rose from Pounds 7.9m to
Pounds 10.4m. Lord Hollick, managing director, said the year-end cash
position was unchanged in spite of capital spending of Pounds 62m, up from
Pounds 24m a year earlier.
MAI's main investment project is Meridian Broadcasting, which won the ITV
licence for the south and south-east of England, replacing TVS
Entertainment. MAI has 61 per cent of Meridian, which will begin
broadcasting next January.
Lord Hollick said MAI's share of the investment in studios and start-up
capital would amount to Pounds 30m. TVS's Southampton studios had been
bought for Pounds 7.5m and another site had been leased, saving about Pounds
20m compared with the cost of building new facilities. Meridian, which would
have annual turnover of more than Pounds 150m, should start to contribute to
profit in 1993-94.
Operating profit from the main part of the business grew by Pounds 9.6m to
Pounds 55.2m on turnover of Pounds 389m, up from Pounds 361.5m. But a
disappointing result from Avenir, the French media business in which it has
reduced its stake to 15.5 per cent, dragged down the proceeds from
associates.
Wholesale broking contributed Pounds 44m to operating profit, up 11 per
cent. Lord Hollick said the US wing had done well in money broking and
corporate bonds. The cut in dollar interest rates had stimulated activity.
The weaker pound would help MAI's earnings this year. 'With nearly 50 per
cent of our profits in US dollars, we were having to peddle very fast to
stay abreast.'
The group would also benefit from the recent high level of activity in the
money markets. 'A reduction in European interest rates would also help the
markets,' he said.
Earnings per share rose to 13.7p, from 12.6p. A final dividend of 4.6p makes
a total of 6p, up 9 per cent.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Lord Hanson to put son on board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is planning to promote Mr Robert Hanson,
son of its chairman, Lord Hanson, on to its board as a director.
The move is part of a number of proposed board changes to be announced by
the end of the month.
Mr Hanson, aged 31, who is currently an associate director, joined the group
in 1990 from NM Rothschild, the investment bank which advises Hanson.
He is expected to be appointed to the board along with Mr Graham Dransfield,
aged 40, Hanson's senior solicitor, who joined the group in 1982.
Mr Alan Hagdrup, aged 59, a director since 1974, is expected to step down
from the board.
One of Hanson's advisers yesterday confirmed the board changes.
'The decision to promote Mr Hanson has been taken by the senior directors of
the group and not just by his father.'
If appointed, Mr Hanson will be by far the youngest director.
Mr John Raos, aged 42, who is chief operating officer of Hanson Industries,
the US arm of Hanson, is the youngest member of the board.
The board appointments still have to be ratified by the non-executive
members.
They are not expected to oppose the moves.
The appointments will then go to shareholders for ratification.
Mr Hanson has been part of the conglomerate's acquisition team reporting to
the vice-chairmen, Mr Martin Taylor and Mr Derek Rosling.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Investors query the rewards of risk: Unease over fees for
venture capital fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody is surprised to hear that venture capital has offered rich returns to
investors during the past two decades. But the scale of the rewards
available to venture capital fund managers may come as a surprise to those
used to the less generous world of conventional investment management.
The difference between the two worlds surfaced recently when a rival drew
attention to the guidelines governing fund managers' personal investments at
CinVen, Europe's second-largest venture capital fund manager.
CinVen, which is part of the coal board's in-house pension fund management,
allows its fund managers to invest their own money in the highest-risk but
also highest-yielding portion of each transaction, known as sweet equity,
while eschewing the lower-risk but less lucrative loan stock which typically
accompanies it. CinVen fund managers may not pick and choose among
investments but must invest in each one and in the same proportion.
The practice is not uncommon in the venture capital industry, but it
illustrates why remuneration in the industry has become a touchy subject. In
the early years of venture capital - a sector in which investments may take
10 to 12 years to realise their full value - investors had to make sure the
fund manager stayed around long enough to see each project through to
fruition.
Out of that has grown an elaborate remuneration structure where fees greatly
exceed those of traditional fund management. Typically, venture capital
firms receive a basic management fee of 2 1/2 per cent compared with the
0.15 per cent to 0.25 per cent charged by conventional fund managers on the
more run-of-the-mill business of managing balanced pooled funds. Because the
fees are paid on funds raised rather than on funds invested, the effective
rate on funds under management is closer to 4 1/2 per cent. Typically, pools
leave some funds lying idle while suitable projects are being found.
Additionally, the fund managers earn a cut, known as 'carried interest',
typically 20 per cent of all profits once the investors have earned back
their full investment.
CinVen says that because it does not operate a pool, it is administratively
impossible to offer its fund managers carried interest. So it has offered
co-investment in sweet equity to attract and keep the best managers.
Mr John McCrory, partner at Crossroads, a Birmingham-based firm which
advises investors on venture capital projects, said venture capital fund
managers 'need to have significant commercial and industrial experience plus
deal construction and 'realisation' skills - the ability to sell a company
for what it is worth.' Individuals with those skills are at a premium and
fee structures arose to tie fund managers into projects for long periods.
Now some investors are unhappy with these arrangements.
'We are pressing hard for the economics to work,' said Mr John Brakell,
director of Postel Development Capital, the venture capital arm of the giant
PosTel pension fund which has roughly Pounds 350m invested in that sector.
'The remuneration is probably larger than the achievements of the industry
so far,' Mr Brakell said.
'I don't believe there is any other sector of the fund management industry
which is as highly rewarded as the venture capital sector,' said Mr Maurice
Anslow, editor of the UK and European Venture Capital Journals. 'Somebody in
their early 30s can earn Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 80,000 per year and all
they are doing is looking at business plans.'
Why investors agreed to pay such generous fees to venture capital fund
managers may be explained by looking at returns. No UK figures are
available, but data from the US show that during the past 20 years, the
average annual return has been 15 per cent with the top quartile earning
21.3 per cent. But over the past five years, the average returns have been
5.8 per cent although the highest performing quartile of funds have annual
returns of 13.1 per cent. Increasingly, investors are insisting that fund
managers' carried interest should not take effect until investors have
earned a so-called hurdle rate of return, typically the same as on a
low-risk government bond.
Underlying the investors' changing view of remuneration for venture capital
fund managers is the changing nature of the business. The recession has
taken a harsh toll of start-up and developing companies and the bulk of
venture capital investment opportunities now lie in management buy-outs of
established companies or refinancing debts. The skills required in assessing
such investments are much closer to traditional fund management than to the
glamorous world of risky start-ups. 'These are not the sort of people who
could run off and start up another Apple Computer,' says Mr McCrory.
If these two activities are different, perhaps they should be rewarded
differently? 'Investors are challenging remuneration structures because
increasingly they see the difference between the two,' says Mr Andrew Sells,
partner at venture capital managers Nash, Sells and Partners.
There is much tinkering with fee structures, but wholesale revisions have
yet to occur. Mr Brakell is hopeful: 'If the issue of remuneration gets
enough publicity, then I think they will be forced to change it.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Sea pollution treaty close after N-deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to salvage a new international treaty on sea pollution appeared
close to success last night.
Ministers from the 12 countries bordering the north-east Atlantic, were
locked in talks until the early hours of this morning to try to find a
solution in time for the scheduled signing of the new treaty at noon today.
The talks made progress after those campaigning for a complete ban on the
dumping of radioactive waste at sea gave way to calls instead for a
moratorium on such dumping. Discussions were continuing to try to agree on
the period of a moratorium.
The treaty, which covers all dumping and discharges into the sea, has been
dominated by the radioactivity issue.
Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Spain have voiced the fiercest opposition to
Britain's position, partly because waters near them were used for dumping
low-level radioactive waste from the 1950s until the present moratorium
began in 1982.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, had said last weekend that
Germany might accept a temporary ban, but that it would press for a longer
ban than the 10 years that Britain is suggesting.
Mrs Segolene Royal, the French environment minister who is chairing the
conference, is also understood to favour an extension of the present
moratorium.
The UK Department of the Environment said last night: 'The UK very much
wants to see the new convention signed.
'It has at present no intention of dumping any radioactive waste . . . .
(but) at the moment it does not have a workable land-based alternative to
sea-disposal.'
The DoE added that its proposal covered only low- and medium-level
radioactive waste and that before considering any dumping it would promise
to consult other signatories to the treaty and the IAEA, the international
nuclear watchdog.
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure groups,
yesterday accused the conference and the British government of threatening
to reduce the amount of publicly available data on pollution in the
Atlantic.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Chemicals explosion leaves two people dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FULL inquiry is to be carried out into yesterday's explosion at a
chemicals plant in Castleford, West Yorkshire, which left two people dead
and 15 injured, four seriously.
The blast occurred at 1.30pm at the manufacturing plant of Hickson and
Welch, an organic chemicals subsidiary of Hickson International, the
Yorkshire-based chemicals group.
In addition to a health and safety executive inquiry, the company is to
conduct its own investigation of the incident. The full extent and likely
cost of the damage is not yet known.
Initial reports said the incident happened as workers at the plant carried
out routine maintenance work on a distillation column used to purify
nitrotoluene.
Nitrotoluene is a flammable, toxic liquid produced as a feedstock for many
of Hickson's products, particularly pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs, pigments and
photographic products. Industrial grade toluene has a flash point of 2
degrees to 5 degrees centigrade.
One of the two maintenance workers was killed instantly in the explosion,
which destroyed the distillation column and set alight an adjoining
four-storey office block.
The other fatality and most of the injuries occurred in the office block.
Many more casualties could have been expected if the building had not been
almost empty during the lunchbreak.
Around 100 firefighters and 17 pumps attended the blaze, which was rapidly
extinguished, leaving a cloud of thick black smoke above the town. Residents
were advised to stay indoors and keep windows shut, but police later
confirmed that the smoke was not toxic.
Buildings near the plant were shaken by the blast.
Hickson International is Castleford's largest employer, providing around 800
jobs, and has been in the area for more than 50 years.
The company has recently undergone a series of board changes and been
reorganised after several poor acquisitions in the late 1980s. Pre-tax
profits more than doubled to Pounds 16.9m in the first half of this year.
Its shares fell 11p to 183p yesterday in late trading.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Japan's economy at zero growth: Second-quarter figures point
to possibility of worst recession in 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN may be on the verge of its worst recession for almost 20 years with
the economy failing to grow in the second quarter of 1992, official figures
to be published this afternoon suggest.
Official statistics measuring gross national product will show zero growth
for the second quarter, according to senior government officials.
The figures, to be released by the Economic Planning Agency, will confirm
that the economy has run into the sand after the rapid expansion of the late
1980s which fuelled growth of at least 4 per cent for 4 1/2 years.
The situation is not yet as serious as during the first oil shock of 1974,
when the economy contracted for three successive quarters. GNP, however, did
not fall during the downturn of 1981-82 or during that of three years later.
The economy is delicately poised; the next three months could determine
whether it recovers or slips deeper into depression.
Government economists insist the figures mark the bottom of the downturn
which began more than a year ago. They believe the announcement last month
of an emergency Y10,700bn (Pounds 50bn) public spending package  - aimed at
boosting confidence in the financial system and stimulating public
investment  - will ease the economy to a soft landing with growth of about 3
per cent next year.
Many private sector economists, however, believe the economy faces such
serious problems  - overcapacity in manufacturing, huge bad debts which
could disable the banking system, and stagnant private consumption  - that
it will fall further unless the government takes additional action.
The fragility of Japan's economic miracle was underlined by figures showing
that, this year, average land prices fell for the first time since 1975 when
the National Land Agency started compiling statistics.
The agency's report, based on a survey of 26,000 locations, found that
residential land prices fell by 3.8 per cent and commercial prices by 4.9
per cent compared with a similar survey in July 1991.
In the Tokyo area, residential and commercial prices fell by 12 per cent,
while in Osaka prices fell by about 23 per cent.
The fall in prices, which began in Tokyo and Osaka in 1991, has now started
to spread to regional cities, which reported price rises of just 0.3 per
cent against an increase of around 5.2 per cent last year.
Sales at Tokyo department stores fell by 5.7 per cent in August compared
with the same month in 1991, the sixth successive monthly fall.
The Japan Department Stores Association reported that furniture sales were
14.4 per cent down on July, electric appliances 16.4 per cent down and
clothing sales 6 per cent lower. Only spending on food and in coffee shops
had increased.
One factor behind the sluggish store sales is the recovery in Japanese
savings, which rose by 8.1 per cent in the year to July according to results
of a poll of 6,000 households published by the Bank of Japan.

FT  22 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The volume of red ink which has flowed from Fosters is reason enough for
Sears to dispose of the business. Menswear retailing is having an awful time
and Fosters was ill-placed to compete, even in good market conditions.
Still, the exit price is high. Sears must write off Pounds 42m of goodwill
through the profit and loss account, which had been previously charged to
reserves. Then there are Pounds 40m of other extraordinary losses associated
with the withdrawal, including Pounds 5.3m of trading losses since May.
Whatever one thinks of the zealous way Sears has thrown everything into the
extraordinary line, at least the pain is now visible. There is also relief
that under Mr Liam Strong's management deep-seated problems are at last
being tackled.
Next week Sears is expected to announce further provisions against the
British Shoe Corporation along with its interim results. This again raises
the question of whether the company will maintain its dividend. It may be
argued this would be inappropriate when the payout is uncovered. However,
Sears' balance sheet is strong. Cutting the dividend could send the wrong
message to the market when the company's fortunes are near their nadir - a
point with which other managements may have to grapple in a post-ERM world.
On top of that the management is in a ticklish position. If they provide for
a clean-out and then cut the dividend, a falling share price may just tempt
in a predator.

FT  22 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: MAI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite moneybroking's reputation for producing poor quality earnings, MAI
seems to do consistently well, as yesterday's preliminary results
reaffirmed. With a particularly strong niche in the New York-based US
Treasury bond market and operations in deposit and securities broking in
London, MAI is as well placed as it is possible to be in such a footloose
industry. Automation may cut margins in some more straightforward areas of
broking, but governments' habit of issuing ever-increasing volumes of debt
and the volatility of markets are all grist to MAI's turnover-driven mill.
Even if the market still worries about profits from the main broking
business, the company has good cash flow and a strong balance sheet.
Diversification into television also adds another profits stream. Meridian,
the new ITV franchisee for the south of England in which it holds a majority
stake, should break even this year and enhance profits thereafter. Yet MAI
is a people-based service business of the type which has been deeply
unfashionable with investors in recent years. That alone may be enough to
keep it on a rating below the market average.

FT  22 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gilts market is responding with curious ambivalence to the possibility
of lower UK base rates. The short end continues to discount a rather
aggressive cut: the yield on the 12 per cent stock due 1995 has fallen by
nearly 2 percentage points to 8.6 per cent since last Wednesday night. The
long end appears relatively unruffled by the inflationary consequences of
easier money. Over the same period, the yield on 25 year paper has risen by
only 0.4 points to 9.2 per cent.
Perhaps the actual rate cuts will be less than the markets were originally
expecting. Mr Major again yesterday stressed his commitment to the fight
against inflation. If he is to be believed, the price pressures unleashed by
the devaluation will be held in check. Still, the long end of the gilts
market may be too sanguine. The borrowing requirement will remain large over
the next few years and foreign investors can no longer be so easily counted
on to fund it.
Last week's intervention has taken care of immediate funding needs, but even
with some pick-up in growth next year, the PSBR could still be in the Pounds
35bn range. The trouble is that foreigners may blow hot and cold on gilts,
depending on their perception of the exchange rate, while domestic
institutions are again enthused by equities. Two conclusions follow. First,
funding constraints point to sharply tighter fiscal policy - a point which,
incidentally, should not be lost on contractors and other companies
dependent on public sector business. Second, the gilt/equity yield ratio,
still just under two, may return to its more normal range of two to 2.5
after the devaluation. But it may be more a question of higher real yields
on gilts than lower ones on equities.

FT  22 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: The franc under fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc's honeymoon period looks to have been even briefer than
sterling's. At least the pound managed to struggle back above DM2.81 last
Monday in response to that wafer-thin German interest rate cut - into what
laughably seemed like reasonably safe territory at the time. But the
euphoria which initially greeted the wafer-thin French majority in favour of
Maastricht yesterday was quickly replaced by fresh doubts over the currency.
The Bank of France can hardly have been pleased to see the franc back within
a centime of its ERM floor despite heavy intervention after touching
FF3.3910 earlier in the day.
Given the speed and savagery with which Messrs Major and Lamont were swept
away, it would be idle to assume that the French Government can easily
withstand the tide. There is admittedly much more will in Paris than there
was in London, and much greater credibility behind the commitment to defend
existing parities. But the markets again scent blood and the weekend's
lukewarm endorsement of the treaty can only encourage further testing of the
defences. With an election just six months away the speculators may
calculate that the government's nerve is likely to crack.
Much will depend, though, on the attitude of the Germans. The current crisis
is, after all, as much as anything a test for the Bonn/Paris alliance which
lies at the core of the European Community, and even a modest German cut
could stave off the need for a French interest rate rise. Whilst the Germans
might be reasonably sanguine about British and Italian devaluations, they
may conclude that letting the franc go the same way would be handing the
French a clear competitive advantage. Yesterday's fresh bout of
disappointing news from the French corporate sector was another reminder
that the tensions between German monetary policy and growth priorities
elsewhere must ultimately snap.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Letter: Carriers less restricted at US airports than at
Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CYRIL MURPHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'After the US, the world' (September 17), discussing
British Airways' global ambitions, presents a very misleading picture of
BA's access to US airports.
The impression given in the article is that US carriers dominate slot access
at key US airports to the detriment of foreign competitors while enjoying
unlimited slot access to Heathrow. Nothing could be further from the truth.
What you have failed to advise your readers is that none of the US airports
mentioned  - with the exception of Chicago  - is slot restricted at all. All
carriers, including BA, enjoy as much international access to these airports
as is justified by traffic demand.
Chicago O'Hare is one of only two slot restricted international airports in
the US. There, US carriers are forced by law to give up slots to enable
their foreign competitors, including BA, to fly any services they wish.
At Heathrow, by comparison, all carriers  - included United  - suffer from
slot restrictions, and often can not fly the services permitted by
international agreement.
The BA-USAir transaction provides a unique opportunity for the US and UK
governments to negotiate a liberalised agreement presenting real
opportunities to carriers from both countries. It is important that the
arguments on both sides are presented fairly, if the governments are to
achieve their goal.

A conga line of Cuban political refugees looks to be forming in Argentina
behind the three dancers from Havana's Tropicana nightclub revue who decided
to stay on after performing in Buenos Aires recently.
No sooner had the trio been spirited off to a safe house in the city than
their footsteps were followed by two aircrew from the Cubana airline, a
computer programmer who'd overstayed his tourist visa and three other
miscellaneous defectors.
With the country's immigration chief saying he wouldn't be surprised if all
400-odd Cubans now in Argentina on tourist visas soon applied for refugee
status, President Carlos Menem must be dancing his own gleeful jig. Besides
scoring brownie points in Washington, he's doing down his arch enemy Fidel

David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, has a
suggestion for Norman Lamont as he hammers out his new 'British' economic
policy.
The government's implacable opposition to granting independence to the Bank
of England, combined with its continued desire to target the exchange rate,
really leaves it with only one solution, the American economist argues.
The pound should be pegged forthwith to the New Zealand dollar.
Not only does he reckon the British might feel more comfortable aligning
themselves to their kith and kin, but he also points out how the Kiwis
happen to have on offer one of the world's most independent central banks.

There seems to be something of a tradition of old Midland Bank hands ending
up in retailing. Michael Julien, the former finance director, joined
Storehouse (via Eurotunnel and Guinness) and John Harris, another former
Midland high-flyer, spent a spell on the board of Great Universal Stores.
Now Geoffrey Taylor, a former group chief executive and boss of the other
two, has resurfaced as the new non-executive chairman of Fosters, a
management buy-out from Sears. The 65-year-old Taylor has kept a low profile
since he retired in 1986 after an unhappy period at Midland's helm. Apart
from the chairmanship of Daiwa Europe Bank, he sits on the board of Y J
Lovell and a Bermuda-based investment company.
'Clearing banking is partly retailing,' says Taylor, echoing a view commonly
held during Midland's more go-go years. Whereas Midland is one of the Big
Four clearing banks, the loss-making Fosters is a relative minnow in its
industry with only 2.5 per cent of the UK menswear market and an annual
turnover of not much more than Pounds 100m.

The rise of Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat Party leader who is set to become
Thailand's next prime minister, is dealing a heavy blow to the country's
reputation for having an exotic and incomprehensible political system
staffed by gangsters, retired generals and fanatical Buddhists.
The mild-mannered Chuan  - whose pastimes include playing darts alone at
home  - has startled the neighbours in the squalid quarter of Bangkok where
he lives by appearing on television and turning out to be quite important.
He is, in short, Thailand's answer to John Major.
'He is very quiet. He doesn't mind when the drunken neighbours make a lot of
noise, breaking glass or singing late at night,' according to one local taxi
driver quoted in The Nation newspaper.
Chuan's critics say he is as incapable of making important political
decisions as he is of getting angry with the neighbours, but most Thais seem
relieved at the prospect of being led by such an unremarkable man.
The alternatives include the aforementioned generals and gangsters and
Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist who led the street protests in May
(when 50 demonstrators were killed) and who abstains from sex  - even with
his wife.

It is no use asking what the British government will do next. As we can all
see, the prime minister and the chancellor are living from day to day. When
it comes to the long term - to, say, next week - they show every sign of not
having the foggiest notion of what strategy to propose. For the time being
we can forget about new directions for Britain. We will be lucky if we get
any direction at all. The objective of both the organ-grinder and the
marmoset who goes around with the little tin cup is clear. They want to keep
their jobs. If they manage to achieve that they will try to rebuild their
reputations.
When parliament meets on Thursday Mr John Major will remind the opposition
behind him that he has set the Maastricht treaty aside until further notice.
He is already committed to doing nothing until the Danes have demonstrated
that they have a plan for reversing their No vote. He had the foresight to
build that particular hidey-hole into a speech he delivered on September 7.
Now he has found another escape-hatch. He has used his presidency of the EC
to convene a meeting of European leaders early next month.
There are good European reasons for calling such a summit, but to the prime
minister its principal function will be that of air-raid shelter. He needs
one, to protect himself from the bombardment of his own back-benchers. His
current state of mind is evident. It is nervous, the disposition of a man
who has had the stuffing knocked out of him. You do not have to read very
far between the lines of his article in yesterday's Evening Standard to
conclude that while Mr Major remains a European, sort of, ('we cannot cut
ourselves off from the European continent') it is the anti-EC Tory right he
most fears ('now even the French have shown they have serious doubts about
the extent of control from Brussels'). He wants the summit to 'take a
profound look at where Europe is going'.
As to the exchange rate mechanism, it turns out that there are 'fault lines'
in the way it is run. Presumably these were not discerned two years ago
when, as chancellor, Mr Major proudly announced that Britain was going in.
'We shall not go back into the system until the flaws have been put right,'
he now asserts, making assurance doubly sure by adding, 'we cannot return to
the ERM until it has been reformed'. The genius whose experiment blew up is
blaming the laboratory.
There is, however, a cunning plan to save the government's skin. It is
patently a work of genius. The other 11 members of the EC are to be asked to
rewrite the Maastricht treaty, or add clauses to it, or abandon parts of it,
in the interest of restoring unity to the Conservative party. At the same
time the Bundesbank is to be requested to pledge itself to rules of ERM
behaviour that take into account British Tory needs. There is a flaw.
Without the ERM, with not even a symbolic commitment to monetary union, the
structure of European Union agreed at Maastricht falls down. Britain
reserved the right to opt out of Emu; now it is taking a step backwards by
staying out of the ERM itself. Never mind. All will be well, provided that
the foreigners adjust their thinking.
Don't laugh. This is a serious matter. The fatal weakness of the Tories is
their propensity to indulge themselves in illusions of grandeur. Do not take
my word for it. Consider the words of Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman,
at a Conservative Political Centre summer school in July. 'It is not just a
British contribution that we will be making,' said Sir Norman. 'It will be a
Conservative contribution - a lead for Europe based on the proven experience
of Britain over the last decade.' That was BD, before devaluation. It
sounded grandiose even then. Repeated today, AD, the assertion sounds merely
pathetic.
Yet there is a real chance that aspects of Maastricht will be rethought. The
other 11 members of the EC are indeed concerned about the degree to which
the treaty meets the aspirations of their own electorates. The Danes said
No; the French very nearly did. The Germans are clearly uncomfortable. As
the third or fourth most important member of the Community Britain can
expect a hearing for its views, particularly while it holds the presidency,
and especially if it shows that it knows its place. But Mr Major should be
aware that it is the Germans and the French, in that order, who will
determine whether any changes are acceptable.
These could then be negotiated by the prime minister, as was the original
deal last year. There is no doubting his skill in handling the
pre-Maastricht horse-trading. We must hope that his natural self-confidence
returns in time for the next round. Mr Major is, after all, the only prime
minister we have. He has demonstrated that he will not resign, even if
forced to devalue within a week of swearing that he would never do so. This
may not be glorious, but it is his choice. There is no prospect of an
election, so we can rule out the leader of the opposition. In any event, Mr
John Smith is as tied to Maastricht and the ERM as, BD, Mr Major was. So far
no Conservative challenger has appeared.
There are several potential successors in the Cabinet, but these would only
step forward if Mr Major were to be removed by some unfortunate accident. In
that circumstance Mr Kenneth Clarke would probably be front-runner, against,
perhaps, Mr Michael Heseltine. Since both are Euro-enthusiasts, there is
little point in the anti-Maastricht Right plotting Mr Major's downfall. Lady
Thatcher is, fingers crossed, safely tucked away in the Lords. Anyhow, the
country likes the prime minister it appears to be stuck with.
Whether it likes him better as the winter draws on may depend on who wins
the economic argument: the angel whispering in his right ear that he must
keep interest rates high to combat inflation, or the devil on his left
urging him to cut loose and dash for growth. Popularity is there for the
buying, if he but succumbs. Thus there is no way of establishing whether the
ambition, restated by the prime minister yesterday, of achieving 'low
inflation and a prosperous economy' will be matched by as inflexible a
resolve outside the ERM as it was within it.
In short there is no telling where Britain is heading. It could be in the
direction of another bust-up with the EC. Even if a fresh Maastricht deal is
renegotiated, there is no guarantee that it would get through the Commons.
In spite of the government's repeated rejection of a British referendum, it
is quite possible that Mr Major will once again be mugged by events and
obliged to call one. He must rely on Mr Smith to save him from that, as from
so much else. Five months after Mr Major's election triumph his government
is rudderless, driverless, lost.

Sir, Why all the criticism of Britain's chancellor? Has he not achieved
momentous feats in recent days? How many chancellors can claim to have cut
interest rates by 5 per cent, twice confounded commentators by perfectly
executed U-turns, and lost Pounds 11,000 a second, all within 24 hours.
Moreover, it is a singularly generous act, on our chancellor's part, to
allow the Germans and French to take the lion's share of the glory for these
achievements, and to understate his own role in bringing about this return
to traditional values (such as a falling pound).

<TEXT>
Sir, Your review, 'What the economists have to say now' (September 18),
highlighted a shameful about-face by people who really ought to know better.
Only two or three had a proper sense of perspective. Euro-sceptics have the
excuse of having opposed consistently ERM membership. Politicians may be
expected to jump ship and take opportunistic advantage of changing
circumstances. Most economists, however, and a large part of the media,
cannot claim such immunity. They hailed ERM membership in 1990 as necessary,
long-overdue, the only route to stable growth and low inflation etc, and
many persisted with the 'stick with it' view right up to the government's
decision to suspend membership.
Now that sterling has devalued, lo and behold, these same voices can be
heard saying that the UK should stay out of the ERM. Doubtless, some have
assumed that the ERM will break down completely and that the UK should fend
for itself.
We concede that German unification has changed Europe to a degree
unimaginable in 1990 and financial markets have been reacting violently to
suppressed pressures. Had the German government not relied on massive
borrowing to finance unification and had other European governments adopted
a more flexible approach to exchange rate management, these pressures may
have been released without the crisis that has erupted this summer.
So much for the past. Now that sterling (and the lira) are outside the ERM,
it is vital that it should rejoin a reconstituted ERM. The UK could stay out
for a while longer, awaiting further falls in German interest rates. It
seems to us, though, that these will now come much more quickly than
expected, having regard for the crisis itself and Germany's gathering
recessionary forces.
It may, therefore, take rather longer to secure the next 2 to 3 per cent
reduction in UK rates than under a free float - but to do so under a float
is short-termism and myopic. After the crisis is over, Europeans will try
again to find the means to integrate (albeit different from the Maastricht
economic blueprint), the EMS will still be there, the US dollar will not
reel because of sharp US rate cuts and a UK and European economic recovery
is bound to happen eventually. Under these circumstances, the economic and
political arguments for UK membership of the ERM will be as strong as they
ever were in the 1980s. An independent Bank of England would help too.
We are not saying the UK should re-enter immediately - merely that long-term
UK interests are still best served inside the ERM and that the UK should do
so in the context of decisions made on a wider European basis. Whatever rate
is chosen at the time, this policy is the only one that will cement lower
inflation. We may yet be surprised by the speed of change in Europe's
interest rate environment in the months to come - and perhaps in economists'
views about the ERM again]

FT  22 SEP 92 / Letter: Concern raised by executive share option proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROL ARROWSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although the consultative approach to share schemes taken by the
National Association of Pension Funds ('Stock option schemes queried',
September 16) is welcome there are a number of points of principle which may
cause concern. The use of share price as a measure to determine whether an
option is exercisable is, by its nature, volatile. For companies which are
at, or close to, the threshold for success, the option may be exercisable on
Wednesday, barred on Thursday and exercisable again on Friday.
The option benefit is itself dependent on share price. To make access to
that benefit dependent on share price performance as well seems to imply
that it is acceptable to make really big money on the roulette wheel of the
market, but not just big money.
The executive option introduced the concept of executive reward related to
shareholder gain. To date, executive options have not always satisfied
executives and have often been seen by shareholders as failing to deliver
the intended shareholding benefits, but they will ensure that any gain
enjoyed by executives is matched by a rise in the value of shareholders'
investment over that period. Moreover, companies sensitive to the transitory
nature of executive shareholding have developed innovative approaches to
encouraging and reinforcing shareholding by executives. It is unfortunate
the NAPF has not broadened the debate by supporting such initiatives.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Leading Article: UK policy after the debacle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEPRESSING feature of the economic prospects before the UK is that both
the people and the institutions responsible for the ERM debacle are
apparently to remain in charge. Little less disturbing is the clamour for
dramatically lower interest rates. The UK looks set to embark on another
'go' phase in the series of stop-go cycles that mark its decline. Yet there
are alternatives. The question is whether the country is too frivolous to
choose them.
Judged by their pronouncements after the pound's exit from the ERM, neither
the prime minister nor the chancellor fully understood what they were
engaged in. To complain of 'fault lines' in the ERM as if nobody had ever
noticed that the Bundesbank is the pivotal central bank and Germany the main
player is peculiar. The Bundesbank's role was the justification for entering
the system. Nor can the UK complain persuasively about the unforeseen
consequences of German unification, since it was the only member, apart from
Portugal, to enter after that event.
Still less reasonable are the government's comments about the unforeseeable
nature of last week's events. The tendency for semi-fixed exchange rate
systems to generate overwhelming runs on weak currencies is hardly news. Has
the Treasury forgotten what happened in 1931?
Nor can blame for the catastrophe be cast on the Bundesbank's whispers
against sterling. With little prospect of a domestic recovery, it was the
credibility of a commitment to do whatever was necessary to defend sterling
 - not, as officials insisted, the chance of devaluation  - that was seen to
be zero.
Limited confidence
Strange though it may now seem, the prime minister was recently musing about
when sterling might displace the D-Mark as the ERM's anchor. Now sterling is
plummeting fast, to DM2.5375 by last night. But wisely, in view of the
damage already done to the UK's relations with Germany, the government does
not intend an early return to the ERM. As the chancellor of the exchequer
has pointed out, this means that 'judgment has to be applied'.
Unfortunately, there can now be limited confidence in that judgment.
Mr Lamont proposes to look at a number of financial indicators, including
narrow money, broad money, asset prices including housing and the sterling
exchange rate. Provided emphasis is put on broad money and the exchange
rate, this list is sensible enough. The problem is that such a list will
allow the chancellor to justify doing whatever he may find convenient at the
time.
Open debate
The more judgment, rather than rules, are at the heart of policy, the more
important become improved institutional arrangements. The traditional
British policy-making structure  - ill-suited, it now appears, to a policy
as simple as ERM membership  - is completely inappropriate when judgment
must be brought to bear. The combination of official secrecy, unchallenged
Treasury supremacy and complete political control over economic policy has
failed again and again. Who can doubt that it will fail once more?
What is needed, instead, is open debate of the options, an independent
council of economic advisers, a reduction in the powers of the Treasury and
an attempt to depoliticise monetary policy. What is needed, in short, is the
arrangements Germany has enjoyed since the second world war.
Since policy can never be divorced from politics, such changes are no
panacea. The UK may well prove to be irretrievably addicted to inflation.
But if the country is about to choose inflation once more, let it at least
make that choice openly.
What Mr Lamont chooses to do in the next few weeks is much less important
than such reform. But the UK does have a good opportunity for long term
growth based, first and foremost, on the expansion of the supply of traded
goods. Unlike in the much more closed US economy, consumer demand does not
have to be revived at all costs. Since the UK suffers from more deeply
entrenched inflationary expectations than does the US, the government should
also avoid giving the impression that it wants yet another dash for growth.
But who now believes that this government will either choose or stick to the
right policy?

FT  22 SEP 92 / Europe's tactical time-out: Resolving the problems which are
confronting the EC will take more than a summit meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now comes the hard part. The razor-thin French endorsement of the Maastricht
treaty has given a temporary reprieve to the European Community's plans for
political and monetary union; but the political credibility and economic
feasibility of the enterprise remain in doubt.
Unity was the theme echoing throughout European capitals yesterday. The
first test of resolve will come next month when the heads of the 12 EC
members states hold a summit in London to discuss what one EC official
described yesterday as 'Europe's foggy future'.
The question is whether the Community can regain its equilibrium after the
stunning political and economic reverses of recent weeks. The onslaught in
the money markets which forced sterling's bloody retreat from the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System was bad enough; then came a
public slanging match between the UK and German governments over Britain's
charges that the Bundesbank had effectively sabotaged its economic policy by
talking down sterling.
Amid this atmosphere of mistrust and recrimination, the Community's member
states face a second daunting challenge: how to recapture the confidence of
their own people, many of whom remain deeply ambivalent about the goal of
European Union set out in the Maastricht treaty.
This is especially true of Britain, whose on-off relationship with the
Community has been dogged by mutual misunderstanding. Now, at the very
moment the EC faces its most serious political challenge since the oil
crisis in the 1970s, perfidious Albion holds the rotating six-month-long EC
presidency.
Whether Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, can recover from the
humiliating collapse of his Euro-centric economic policy is, therefore, not
only of interest in London. Whether he can stick to his pledge to keep
Britain 'at the heart of Europe' directly concerns the heads of government
in the remaining 11 EC states.
In the immediate aftermath of the French referendum, there are two principal
issues to be addressed by the Community: the functioning of the ERM, and the
longer-term commitment to political and monetary union which all 12 EC
member states signed on to last December.
The tidal wave of speculation which hit the ERM last week led not only to
sterling's withdrawal, but also to the suspension of the Italian lira and a
5 per cent devaluation of the Spanish peseta. The currency realignment
sparked immediate fears of a 'two-speed' Europe, with the weaker currencies
falling behind a stronger D-Mark bloc including France and Benelux.
What is often overlooked is that the Maastricht treaty specifically holds
out the prospect of a Europe a deux vitesses, says Mr Peter Ludlow, director
of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. The treaty's
provisions not only include an opt-out clause for Britain, but also strict
economic convergence criteria, under which qualified candidates should move
to locked exchange rates, at the earliest by 1997 and supposedly by 1999 at
the latest.
Mr Ludlow says the recent turmoil in the currency markets raises the
prospect of a joint Franco-German initiative to accelerate moves toward
fixed exchange rates among the 'hard-core' currencies, with a public
declaration that other European countries such as Italy could join in the
future.
The first clues will come today when Chancellor Kohl holds talks with
President Mitterrand in Paris. Though the franc is still under pressure, the
impetus for a high-profile Franco-German declaration, which risked being
seen as actively encouraging the creation of a two-speed Europe, may have
receded. More likely, the two leaders will focus on the prospects for
enlarging the Community and making it more accountable  - partly in an
effort to bolster Mr Major's position.
Yet the recent shift in public opinion in Germany against abandonment of the
D-Mark  - the symbol of post-second world war stability and prosperity in
Germany  - may make it more difficult for Chancellor Kohl to offer much more
to his European colleagues.
Already, there are calls for a referendum on Maastricht in Germany, and both
the Bundestag and Bundesrat may reserve a 'right of approval' before
allowing Germany to move to fixed exchange rates, as laid down in stage
three of Emu.
The cloudy prospect for Emu is made all the murkier by the British
government's demand for ERM reform summed up by Norman Lamont, the
chancellor of the exchequer. Last Friday, Mr Lamont declared that he wanted
to be 'satisfied that German policy that has produced many of the tensions
in the ERM is going to have some changes', leading to a more stable
environment. In addition, he wants to correct structural 'fault-lines'
within the ERM, including better co-ordination and intervention in the money
markets.
These are the minimum conditions which the British intend to put forward
before re-entering the ERM. The difficulty is that there is substantial
mistrust about British motives which, in turn, risks severely reducing
British influence in the Maastricht debate.
First, EC diplomats are scathing about Britain's efforts to bully the German
government and the Bundesbank into reducing German interest rates. Mr Lamont
is singled out for criticism. First he used the EC presidency to mobilise 11
member states against the Germans at the recent finance ministers' meeting
in Bath; then he presented the outcome as a victory for Britain. 'This
approach to Community matters is damaging,' says a senior EC official, 'and
it was bound to backfire.'
Mr Lamont's earlier predicament  - an overvalued currency and crippling high
real interest rates in the middle of a recession  - was, nevertheless viewed
with sympathy in Brussels. Some adjustment had to be made. But many agree
with Sir Roy Denman, former EC ambassador to the US, who says ERM membership
was a short-term ploy to secure a reduction in interest rates, as well as a
long-term commitment by Mr Major to Europe. 'Britain entered the ERM for the
wrong reasons, at the wrong rate, and at the wrong time,' he says.
The challenge for the British is to convince their partners that they are
not intent on playing a spoiling game. This applies not just to the ERM, but
also to the broader debate about the future of the Community and the fate of
Maastricht. In this respect, the issue of how to finesse the problems raised
by the Danish rejection of Maastricht in last June's referendum is
paramount.
Mr Major has already declared that he will not put the Maastricht treaty
before parliament until the Danish government presents a clear plan for
resolving this dilemma. In Brussels, mistrust of Mr Major's motives is rife.
'It looks as if he is deliberately dragging his feet because his own party
is split on Maastricht,' said one EC official on Sunday night.
Another Commission official said British delays were certain to encourage
the Danes to hold back too. 'We can solve one problem,' said this official,
'but we can't solve a British and a Danish problem at the same time.'
Mr Major is understood to be contemplating a vote by the House of Commons on
the 'principle' of Maastricht sometime before the Edinburgh summit. This
would have the advantage of steadying frayed nerves, including his own,
while preparing for a month-long vote at committee stage sometime next year,
perhaps around the same time as a second Danish referendum. All this assumes
that the Danes will come up with reservations on Maastricht which are
negotiable in the eyes of the rest of the Community. A protocol, not
included in the treaty, which stated that Danes would not serve in a common
European army is viewed as acceptable  - but a renegotiation of Maastricht
is not. In Brussels, the hope is that the Danes will outline their thoughts
at the London summit next month. Again the tension will be between the
desire of members such as France, Spain and Italy to press ahead with
ratification and those such as Britain urging a 'go-slow' approach. 'The
timing is extremely delicate,' says a senior EC official.
Behind the Danish dilemma lie serious questions about the merits of
Maastricht and the way the EC does business.
The national debate in France was sobering for the entire Community. For the
first time since the Treaty of Rome, the French  - the driving force behind
European integration  - held a debate on the future of Europe, a debate
conducted on national terms.
The result was that 58 per cent of those who voted No to Maastricht cited
fears about the loss of national sovereignty; 57 per cent voiced opposition
to technocrats in Brussels; and 41 per cent voiced concern about the threat
of German hegemony in Europe, which both supporters and opponents of the
treaty invoked in order to galvanise support for their cause.
How to bring the EC closer to the European citizen is one of the most urgent
tasks of the next few months. Part of the answer is subsidiarity  - the
notion that the EC should exercise restraint in its application of Community
law and devolve more power to member states. Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission, has instructed his officials to draw up concrete
plans in time for discussion at the London summit.
Yet subsidiarity has a price. Some member states may use it to roll back
intrusive but beneficial policies such as the aggressive enforcement of
competition law; others may seek to re-open the debate on state aid, arguing
that more attention to national sovereignty means more support for national
businesses. If this were to gain force, the single integrated market, the
great achievement of the Community in the 1980s, could be at risk.
Moreover, subsidiarity does not address the question of accountability. For
all the debate about whether Maastricht awarded more power to the
Commission, the real winners were the politicians in the European Council.
Ministers and their civil servants  - not Mr Delors  - will benefit from the
expansion of inter-governmental co-operation outside of Community law.
Resolving these conundrums in the Community will take more than a summit.
According to Mr Ludlow, the director of the Centre for European Policy
Studies, they may require a US-style constitution, transparent and
accessible to the ordinary EC citizen.
At this stage, such ideas may seem far-fetched. But unless the Twelve can
reach a consensus on how to resolve the Maastricht muddle, the uncertainty
will increase, sapping their will to co-operate and increasing the risk of
drifting apart.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Carrots and sticks: As the Russian parliament reconvenes,
John Lloyd sees signs of compromise as well as confrontation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening of the Russian parliament today has been preceded by Byzantine
political manoeuvres.
On the one hand, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president, has taken care to be seen
to be emollient; he has promised the deputies that they need not face
election for more than two years (many would not survive) and sought to make
up with Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the leader of the parliament and the most
venomous foe of the government and its economic reform programme.
At the same time, the Civic Forum, which unites the three centrist parties,
said after a meeting of its executive committee on Sunday that it would
harshly criticise the government's programme, but would not seek to
overthrow it. This may be no more than a recognition that governing Russia
is likely to be such a torment for the foreseeable future that it is better
done by one's enemies than one's friends. Even so, Civic Forum's position
represents an apparent limit on hostilities.
However, as the opening of parliament has drawn nearer, so the bitterness
has deepened. The Parliamentary Coalition for Reforms, a group of radical
reformist deputies, meeting yesterday, said it would seek to remove Mr
Khasbulatov, or even have him arraigned by the Constitutional Court for
exceeding his authority. Meanwhile, the Nationalist-Communist bloc, happily
in alliance and agreeing on most things, has said it will try to impeach the
president.
The stakes are high this session. For the Communists and the Nationalists,
the government is far too open to the capitalist west, encouraging a
mafia-entrepreneurial class which has already dethroned the old nomenklatura
and appears to becoming a permanent fixture of Russian society.
For the industrialists, who are the most powerful group within the centrist
parties, the government is a threatening force, pushing them out too fast
into the market and holding the spectre of bankruptcy above their heads.
Their pressure, however, has stopped the government from cutting off
subsidies to state enterprises and from carrying out a policy of mass
unemployment.
For the reformers in and out of government, time is running out. The figures
on the progress of the economy are awful. The budget deficit was estimated
at the end of the second quarter at Rbs950bn (or about 17 per cent of gross
domestic product) against a total budget for the first half of the year of
Rbs3,300bn. Inflation is said by the government to be running at 20 to 25
per cent a month, and Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the government's Centre
for Economic Reform, said it could be at 50 per cent as soon as next month.
Production is still falling in most sectors by between 15 and 20 per cent
annually.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, yesterday told reformist
deputies that he would again tighten the screw on credits, and that the
restrictions would last for at least the next six months. He admitted,
however, that his policy must gain wide support - a difficult trick for such
an unpopular measure.
His determination shows that the government has not given up on its reform
programme and does not intend simply to compromise itself into stasis. It
will seek to get parliament to pass a bankruptcy law, allowing it to make
'showcase' closures in the big industrial sector. Mr Yeltsin, who continues
to support Mr Gaidar's now divided reformist cabinet, will try to get
through a new constitution enlarging the scope of his power, for example,
allowing him to rule by decree. The president will also propose legislation
giving him the final say in appointing ministers.
At the same time, the government is trying to rein in Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, the acting chairman of the Central Bank, which has dispensed
credits to enterprises and to other former Soviet republics with a liberal
hand over the summer. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the vice-premier in charge of
privatisation, told the news agency Interfax yesterday that a special
committee headed by Mr Gaidar had been set up last week to enforce some
'fairly harsh decisions' on stopping the flow of credit, at least to
republics. This is likely to mean telling the republics that they must abide
by strict financial discipline or leave the rouble zone. But how the cabinet
will stop Mr Gerashchenko, who is responsible to the parliament rather than
the cabinet or the president, remains unclear.
The governing of Russia is a continuous and increasingly sharp struggle for
power, and for the right to exercise it. In the absence of a constitution,
the presidential, executive and legislative branches of government have
ample scope to upstage each other and cancel out each other's decrees and
actions.
The evidence of the long summer recess has pointed to a certain weakening of
executive will and a gathering of the opposition forces. But the government
now seems ready to steel itself for a further advance. It is shaping up to
be a classic Russian campaign - hard, brutal, merciless. By the end of the
year, in deep mid-winter, it will become more clear how the tide of battle
is running.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Good omens from Poland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While western Europe has been holding its breath over the future of the
Maastricht treaty, a document based on concepts worked out before the
collapse of communism, significant developments have been taking place
beyond the eastern borders of Germany.
Some are negative or ambivalent. The conflicts in former Yugoslavia have
become more intractable. Czechs and Slovaks have pressed ahead with a
divorce which will probably leave Slovakia in growing economic and political
difficulties. The rise of Slovak nationalism, coupled with re-awakened
concern for the fate of ethnic Hungarians in Romania and the border lands of
former Yugoslavia, is causing concern in Budapest. Hungary's own progress
towards market democracy has been marred by signs of ethnic intolerance.
But it is in Poland, the biggest and most populous of the three central
European states aiming for full European Community membership by the start
of the 21st century, where the last few months have seen the biggest
changes. Happily, they have been mostly changes for the good.
For much of this year Poland seemed paralysed by political infighting
between President Lech Walesa, the government and the fractious parliament.
This issued from last October's general elections, fought on a flawed
proportional representation system which still needs reform. The main symbol
of the government's failure to get to grips with Poland's problems was a
soaring budget deficit.
Impressive coalition
So a degree of scepticism was in order when Mr Walesa asked the previously
little known Ms Hanna Suchochka to form a government three months ago. But
Ms Suchochka has succeeded in putting together an impressive coalition which
contains a former prime minister and several experienced senior cabinet
ministers. Ignoring a rash of strikes in the coal and copper mines and the
FSM-Fiat car plant, they spent the summer holiday working out their
political and economic strategy. It is designed to re-activate the stalled
mass privatisation programme, get public spending under control and reassure
both Polish and foreign investors and the International Monetary Fund.
An IMF team had the first chance to assess the government and its programme
earlier this month. It left Warsaw impressed by the performance of the new
ministers, encouraged by evidence of an export-led recovery in industrial
output and willing to be persuaded that the government was capable of
cutting the budget deficit from an expected 8.5 per cent of GNP this year to
5.5 per cent next.
Enterprise plan
To achieve this the government plans to cut spending on social programmes,
mainly pensions and unemployment pay, while raising revenue through reforms
to the tax system and better collection, especially from the private sector
which now accounts for over half the economy.
It will not be easy. The success of the strategy depends heavily on the
labour minister, Mr Jacek Kuron. He is the main author of the government's
'enterprise plan' which aims to persuade workers to join in the task of
privatising and improving the management of state-owned enterprises rather
than strike for wage rises unmatched by higher productivity.
Warsaw has been able to achieve export-led growth through a combination of
lower real wages and a managed devaluation of the zloty. Consolidating these
gains requires labour co-operation, more foreign investment and continuing
access to prosperous EC markets.
Prospects for the former should improve when Poland and the IMF sign a new
loan agreement, possibly next month. But what Poland and the other countries
of east and central Europe also need is a reappraisal of the European idea
which would allow them to participate in framing an enlarged community.
Such a community, in which Germany's size and power would be
counter-balanced on the east as well as the west, would not only benefit the
east. The participation of enthusiastic Europeans from the east could create
a better framework for dealing with the resurgence of nationalist feeling
all over Europe.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Arts: Rigoletto and Faust - Opera Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid a riot of noise and colour the auditorium was filled with a throng of
masked revellers. They were the guests at the masquerade, one with horns,
several top-hatted, a bare-chested cardinal and a few in drag among them,
all heading for what was evidently promising to be a night of uninhibited
orgiastic excess.
This was the opening of Opera Northern Ireland's new production of
Rigoletto. In the last few years the company has been winning a reputation
for capturing some of the younger operatic talent. The risk has paid off
with a run of shows which have been innovative and eye-catching, successes
that have increasingly gone towards a strong company profile. That sense of
excitement is in the air again this season.
The new Rigoletto has been targetted with a keen eye for the company's
adventurous style. Sometimes there were fears that the producer, Tim
Coleman, would go too far, but in general he knows when to pull back from
the brink and the theatrical expertise on display was considerable: he
created real people; the series of duets which is at the heart of this opera
put before us a succession of moving encounters.
The relationship between Rigoletto and Gilda could hardly have been more
tender, the pain they shared after her abduction as clear to see as an open
wound. Kimm Julian is arguably too tall and commanding a figure to make an
ideal Rigoletto, but the inexperienced Gilda was nicely caught by Susannah
Waters.
In this production Peter Riberi had no trouble putting across the arrogance
of the Duke, although his tenor is on the tense side for Verdi. After the
seduction of Gilda he emerged from the shower, the apogee of the
narcissistic man in the all-male club of the officers' changing room  - one
scene where the producer had overdone it. Rachel Hallawell's notably
well-Sung Maddalena and Alan Ewing's Sparafucile were more restrained.
With Kenneth Montgomery giving the orchestra a decisive lead, the opera
built to a powerful conclusion. The scene of Gilda's midnight murder,
strikingly designed by Lez Brotherston and lit by Paul Pyant, was theatre at
its most compelling: the thunderstorm roared from the pit, while Sparafucile
stood in the moonlight, refreshing himself in the rain and washing the blood
from his body. Chilling stuff.
The other opera was a revival of Faust. This amounts to a less daring vision
of Gounod's opera, but the production never muffs any of the difficult
moments and has its own touches of originality. The steeples of a medieval
German town loom over a market-place and the drama is enacted there, watched
by the townsfolk. Using the spoken dialogue was also a bold step.
The outstanding feature here was the singing of Maureen O'Flynn as
Marguerite, whose beautiful soprano with its effortless top was a constant
pleasure. Claude Corbeil was the sensitive tenor, who has the makings of a
fine Faust if only he can master his nerves. Guy Belanger made a stylish
Mephistopheles, for whom Enid Hartle's devilishly naughty Marthe looked more
than a match. Karl Morgan Daymond played a nicely insolent Valentin, with a
good top to the voice.
The high standard of the Ulster Orchestra's playing, this time under Stephen
Barlow, was again an asset; the chorus is a weaker feature. On this year's
showing Opera Northern Ireland is on the right track and its aspirations
deserve wholehearted encouragement.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Arts: Decorative follower of cubism - William Packer on Juan
Gris at the Whitechapel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER and JUAN GRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish painter, Juan Gris, died in 1927 at the age of 40, was mourned
by, among others, his compatriot and friend of nearly 20 years, Picasso, and
his dealer, Henry Kahnweiler. The young artist had arrived in Paris at the
age of 20, to be introduced almost at once to the inner circle of the
Parisian avant-garde, at the centre of which sat Picasso, himself barely 26
and already a hero, the blue and rose periods long past, the proto-cubism of
'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon' behind him and the great cubist experiment about
to begin.
Gris was clearly no such prodigy as Picasso, but he showed from the start a
certain technical self-assurance and a precocious sophistication in his
work. Close as he was to Picasso, however, who for a while occupied the
studio next door in the Bateau Lavoir, he took some time to assimilate the
currency of what was going on in Paris in general, and in particular to come
to terms with the high-cubist example being proffered just under his nose.
His first tentative essays in cubist principles, with the object but
modestly refracted and fragmented, date only from 1910 and 1911, following a
series of wonderfully dramatic and monumental still-life drawings in the
old, grand, traditional manner. Thereafter, through 1911 and 1912, his
development into cubism was as rapid as it was assured, and his contract
with Kahnweiler soon followed. Yet certain questions remain, for we find
little sign in the work of Gris' personal resolution of the formal and
imaginative problems posed so profoundly by Braque and Picasso, even before
1910. The sense is of the conscious adoption of a style, and a decorative
style at that.
It would be unfair to suggest that Gris was unique in this respect, for
Paris was full of young cubist acolytes, some good, rather more of them not
so good. Gris was certainly among the best of them and was, for the next 10
years or so, as true a cubist as any. His active participation at such a
level allows him some real significance in the history of modern art, even a
moment or two of actual influence. Yet the evidence of the work itself is
that, good as he was, Gris remained as he began, an artist essentially of
the second rank, never a leader but always a follower.
The temptation with such a figure, given the circumstances of a manifest
talent, famous friends, early success and a premature death, is to search
too assiduously for significance and originality, to fall for the myth. To
do so here, however, is to be as unfair to Gris. For to be a follower at
such a level is no mean thing and, for this work to be remembered, a real
achievement.
This fine exhibition, beautifully chosen and arranged, gives us the perfect
opportunity for just such a fair reappraisal. What it shows us of Gris, in
its gentle way, is that his qualities were a function of his limitations.
Decorative has become the most delicate of perjoratives, loaded with
condescension and damnable faint praise, yet it need not be so. If Gris was
indeed a decorative artist, he was so in the most positive way. The thought
occurs that at that early moment when he saw cubism in terms of style, and
exploited so energetically the opportunity it presented, he may even have
been a little ahead of the game. Did he offer a lead to Braque and Picasso
in modifying the rigours of analytical cubism into the more open, playful
disciplines of synthetic cubism, from which all the devices of collage,
dada, constructivism and surrealism were so soon to follow?
The strong, monumental composition; the clearly stated image; the flat
surface and the flattened picture-plane; the clean colour  - all are virtues
of the essentially decorative and graphic artist, by which is meant no
slight but only a necessary distinction. What we do not get is the
hesitation and rethinking on the canvas itself, the active engagement in the
handling of the paint and its resolution into image that is the mark of the
artist absorbed and unself-conscious. Gris, the stylist, looks ever about
him, and in his work throughout. In Gris the eclectic, we pick up hints of
his more public preoccupations. Now it is Picasso, most obviously, and
Braque; now Chagall and Metzinger; and yet we look on the surface to find
his paint always less particular than theirs, the effect brighter, simpler,
the apparent complexity of the image often flattering to deceive. The image,
the appearance, is everything, though to say as much seems too harsh.
The 1920s, however, do indeed see a profound falling off, marked not so much
by a change in approach as by a clear loss of confidence. Where, at his best
in the mid 1910s, his reworkings of the cubist formulae of fruit and
bottles, cups and glasses, cigars, guitars and all the rest of it, were
reworked with a real confidence and panache, now it seems he had declined
into nothing more than pale imitation and pastiche  - at first of the clowns
and pierrots of Picasso, last of all of Braque's mid 1920s table-tops and
buffets. The last years are very sad.

<TEXT>
Wagnerians have been left parched and thirsty by our major opera companies
in the South-East, so it was no surprise that the Festival Hall was close to
full on Sunday night. Giuseppe Sinopoli was conducting the Philharmonia in
the first act of Die Walkure, with an excellent second-rank principal pair,
and the usual bleeding chunks from Gotterdammerung, with the 'Immolation' to
close.
Without penetrating insights, the performances were sound enough.
Neither the Siegmund nor his Sieglinde wielded a particularly beautiful
instrument  - Robert Schunk's well-schooled tenor is on the dry side
(unfettered rapture is not his line), and in low-lying recitative Sabine
Hass's pitch was rough and approximate; but both of them offered clear,
crunchy diction and an exact appreciation of their words, and both voices
found their best lusty focus in the upper register where it matters most.
The brute Hunding was the imposing, ever-reliable bass Kurt Rydl. At the
crucial moments, there were honest thrills. Sinopoli obviously knows the
score very well and did nothing eccentric  - though the Walkure act passed
rudely from some dubiously slow tempi in the first scenes, without
sufficiently heartfelt playing to justify them, to a manically up-tempo
Lenzlied and a coda like tearaway Rossini.
As usual with live, on-the-spot Sinopoli, when he doesn't have recording
engineers to sort things out (or a Bayreuth band who can do that unaided),
the orchestral tuttis were ill-balanced. In ff passages he again let
everybody play at an unmitigated ff, and vital thematic stuff was submerged.
Some eight years ago, I observed sourly that his left hand seems to enjoy no
functional independence from his right, which beats time assiduously while
his left merely mirrors it; that is still true. He owes it to himself, and
his repertoire, to acquire a better technique.
Programme books at the Festival Hall nowadays are never cheap. The
Philharmonia ones promised the complete Wagner texts but stopped short of
Brunnhilde's last thirty-odd lines, the climax of the 'Immolation' (which
Miss Hass delivered with full-voiced power and dignity), along with the
stage-directions which the late William Mann's recycled programme-notes
assured us 'describe with perfect accuracy what happens in the music, but is
almost never to be seen on the stage'. Nobody apologised or explained, nor
offered refunds. The concert was sponsored by the Automotive &amp; Financial
Group
                           *       *      *
The bulk of Roger Norrington's programme with his orchestra on Sunday was
Brahms  - the Tragic Overture and the Second Symphony, played on instruments
of the late 19th century. But there was also Beethoven's Second Symphony,
performed on the same Brahmsian scale, filtering one composer through the
sound world of one of his heirs.
It is difficult to distinguish genuine music exploration from expediency in
such a venture. Presenting a Beethoven symphony as Brahms would have heard
it might be just a handy novelty that enables the London Classical Players
to mix their programmes and still retain their period credibility, but it
could be a valid attempt to widen the horizons of period performance, to
demonstrate how orchestral textures are just as important a component of
music history as harmony or form.
The reality is probably a mixture of practicality and curiousity, for
Beethoven played by Brahms's orchestra sounds distinctly odd now  - neither
lean, early 19th-century fish, nor sleek, overweight 20th-century fowl  -
muscular in its figuration, yet a shade bombastic in its wind. Norrington's
performance was certainly couched in his Beethovenian terms, propelled by
snapping rhythms, sharp sforzandi and hard-edged wind solos. Yet it led on
naturally from the Tragic Overture, which became a much punchier and more
angry piece than modern instruments construe it, so that one started to
believe in Norrington's declared intention to make Brahms 'sparkle'.
The sound was based on modest string forces with the double basses arrayed
along the back of the wind, and double woodwind. It managed to combine
sinewy clarity with enough expressive weight and flexibility to make the
great paragraphs of the slow movement tell. It was all welded together by
Norrington with irrepressible vigour and panache, crowning the symphony with
exuberance and affirmation; the corporate sense of discovery that he
generates in his players gave every section of the orchestra a sense of
separate identity and purpose.

Kent Nagano, chief conductor-designate of the Halle Orchestra, has been
touring the country with his new orchestra. On Sunday they arrived home at
the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, for a concert (broadcast on Radio 3) which
was terrifically exhilarating not just in itself but for what it portends.
It was an ambitious programme  - works by Messiaen and John Adams (composers
with whose music the young American conductor has become closely associated)
which had been given their British premieres earlier on the tour, plus a
lightly glittering account of the complete Stravinsky Firebird score. All
the pieces were executed with exactly the cool confidence and flair that
have been missing in the portfolio of Halle attributes recently. Nagano, as
he told radio listeners in an interval talk, has discerned a pressing need
to re-create the quality of imagination in this orchestra's programming; it
is to this end that his opening series, under the sub-title 'New
Beginnings', has been directed.
The first half, its two offerings, each an attractive contrast with the
other, certainly proved the point. Un Sourire (1989) is the penultimate
composition to have been completed before Messiaen's death earlier this
year. It is a tiny (5-minute) marvel of 'late-music' economy and radiance.
Two strands of Messiaenic thought, the hymnally lyrical and the
birdsong-percussive, are set in block alternation, then brought to repose.
Adams, composer of Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, approaches
his big projects with big confidence; the huge orchestra for Eldorado
(1991), including two synthesisers, wastes no colour-device. This
two-movement symphony  - self-proclaimed rather than immediately evident as
such  - treats with disquieted irony, as well as picturesqueness, two
aspects of West Coast existence.
The movements are two different sound-landscapes: the first, called 'The
Dream of Gold', builds up baleful neo-Shostakovich sonorities; the second,
'Soledades', gradually fills its empty space with tingling, desert-inspired
patterns. Adams, now firmly into his post-minimalist phase, layers his
much-repeated rhythmic and colouristic figures in the manner that appears to
draw on Baroque and various 20th-century (including rock) modes of
articulation equally: his musical language proceeds in cells of activity
forming foundation pillars to support spans of lyrical line.
The idiom is unfailingly appealing, easy to absorb. What troubles me  - here
as in the past  - is the arrival of climactic gestures produced less out of
the heat of argument than through mechanical assembly. Eldorado is a superb
concatenation of applique effects announcing itself up as something
altogether weightier.
Meanwhile, last Thursday and Friday in the Festival Hall there were also New
Beginnings  - of a rather less confidence-inducing kind. The London
Philharmonic Orchestra celebrated its newly achieved position as resident
orchestra of the London South Bank Centre with two concerts of triple-decker
form and three-hour length. If the aim of their programme was to suggest the
different kinds of promise for the future that the orchestra now holds under
its chief conductor, Franz Welser-Most, its damp-squib impact must already
be raising anxious eyebrows. To put it bluntly, the concert was either
absurdly ill-planned or all too deftly designed to demonstrate Welser-Most's
interpretative immaturity.
The centrepiece, the Schumann Second Symphony, received a glaring
performance, loveless, lumpy and driven. Unsparkling, bandmasterly accounts
of Prokofiev's Three Oranges Suite and (as encore) the Fledermaus Overture
sank spirits ever lower. The message, alas, seems to be that a highly
talented young conductor learning on the job is not well placed to lead an
orchestra many people still consider London's top-class ensemble into its
much-vaunted New Era.

AN Wilson's promotion campaign for his new book about the historical Jesus

FT  22 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Time to take an interest
in rates - Charles Batchelor says entrepreneurs should reassess the ways in
which they are funding their enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a trying week for Chris Tubbs, managing director of
Wiltshire-based Tubbs Elastics, a family-owned business with sales of nearly
Pounds 8m and 200 employees.
Last Thursday's threatened five point increase in interest rates had Tubbs
postponing several spending decisions.
He put on hold approval for the purchase of three new directors' cars,
delayed implementation of a programme to upgrade the company's computers and
cancelled a photocopier machine contract.
But within 24 hours, the chancellor had reversed the interest rate rises and
Tubbs had reinstated his spending plans. As the Forum of Private Business, a
small firms lobby group, reminded the government last week: 'Unstable
interest rates prevent businesses planning ahead with certainty.'
How are businesses to cope with gyrating interest rates? Smaller firms do
not have their own treasury departments and they lack ready access to
financial management expertise.
Nevertheless, even the smallest firms can carry out some fairly basic
financial planning while financial instruments such as 'caps', which set an
upper limit on interest charges but which were previously reserved for the
large corporation, are now available to the smaller business.
As a first step, management should check existing financing arrangements,
says Colin Moor of Taurus Banking Consultants. Moor says one client who
thought he was paying 3 per cent over base rate discovered he was paying his
bank's penalty interest charge of 33 per cent on his entire loan facility.
This error had cost him Pounds 15,000 in excess charges.
One detail of some loan arrangements which will become more important if
interest rates start to fall is the setting of a minimum base rate, says
Alastair Winter of the Bank Relationship Consultancy. 'Some agreements state
that you will never pay less than, for example, 8 per cent,' he notes.
Businesses must also check whether the overall structure of their banking
arrangement makes sense, advises Phil Doggett of Business Banking Review, a
consultancy.
One company was involved in engineering contracts with an average life of 12
months, yet it financed itself with an overdraft which was subject to
three-month reviews. This made a nonsense of its financial planning.
Once the business has established that its existing banking arrangements
make sense and are error-free, it should go on to plan its future
requirements. How do these match up with future expectations on interest
rates?
Many companies refuse to plan for interest rate movements, arguing that it
is too much effort, that the markets cannot be beaten or that uncovered
positions will average out over time anyway. This is fine provided that they
can pass on any increase in interest costs to customers without reducing
sales, their margins or their market share, says Eric Warner, a director at
National Westminster Capital Markets.
Some companies attempt to hedge their bets by dividing their borrowings
equally between fixed-rate and variable-rate loans. This implies that they
have no expectations at all of the direction of future interest rate
movements, says Warner in the Director's Guide to Getting the Best from your
Bank.* But while it may sometimes be the case that rates are as likely to
move up as down, it is more often likely that the economic cycle will be
tending to push rates in one or other direction.
In the six years up to early 1992, sterling interest rates  - based on the
six months' London inter-bank offered rate (Libor)  - averaged just under 12
per cent but fluctuated between 8.4 and 15.25 per cent. Past performance is
no reliable guarantee of future trends but a check against the longer-term
trend will show whether present interest rates are below the average, and
therefore likely to rise, or above average and therefore likely to fall.
In principle, therefore, managers can decide whether they need to increase
the proportion of fixed-interest debt in the expectation of higher interest
rates in future or increase variable borrowings because they expect a fall.
Many commentators are now expecting interest rates to fall since Britain no
longer needs to defend a fixed parity for sterling within the ERM. This may
encourage the already strong tendency of British small firms to rely on
short-term, fixed-rate borrowings, mainly in the form of overdrafts, though
fixed-rate borrowings need to be considered for some purposes.
'We recommend fixed-rate loans if a business is particularly susceptible to
interest rate movements because the business operates with large borrowings
and narrow margins,' says Richard Parkinson of the Bank Relationship
Consultancy.
Despite the banks' urgings to their small business customers to take up
fixed-rate term loans instead of relying on overdrafts  - only about
one-third of small firms have term loans  - there are a number of
disincentives.
Fixed-rate loans are not offered on the sharpest terms, notes Parkinson,
while the penalties for prepayment can be high. In addition, front-end fees
of 1 1/2 to 2 per cent for term loans are not uncommon and act as a
disincentive, says David Burton of the Centre for Consultancy (Surrey).
Another disadvantage of switching from an overdraft to a term loan is that
the business may lose the benefit of current account balances. If the
company runs an overdraft, payments received reduce the size of that
overdraft. If it has a term loan but no overdraft, payments go into the
current account, which normally does not earn interest, and make no
contribution to reducing financing charges.
Term loans make strong sense when long-term assets are being bought. Buying
land over a 20-year period using finance subject to three-monthly review or
recallable 'on demand' exposes the business to changes in bank lending
policies or to a change in bank manager.
The popularity of the overdraft means that many small businesses do not look
beyond that for their finance. However, the banks have begun to tailor some
of their financial services to their smaller customers.
Caps  - which set a ceiling on the rate of interest which can be charged  -
are commonly used by larger companies to limit their interest rate exposure.
If interest rates exceed the ceiling, then the bank pays the company the
difference. Until a few years ago, caps were only available in amounts of
Pounds 5m or more but they have recently become available in smaller
amounts. National Westminster Bank now offers a Pounds 100,000 cap tailored
to 'mid-corporate' customers.
Caps may be less popular if interest rates do fall  - though they still
represent an insurance policy against the unexpected  - but companies which
have taken out caps may now need to check the terms.
Companies which buy caps frequently reduce their premiums by, at the same
time, agreeing a floor. If interest rates fall below the floor level, then
the company pays the bank. The prospect of lower interest rates means cap
and floor agreements, known as 'collars' may start to become a charge on
companies.
Lower interest rates are a temptation to businesses to pay less thought to
their financial arrangements but careful planning is still needed.
Doggett says: 'At the moment, the businessman asks 'How can I reduce my
overdraft?' What he should be saying is 'How can I fix my interest charges?
How can I get to medium-term borrowings? What about caps and other
products?' He should get his bank manager to be more pro-active.'

The approach of 1993 and the formal creation of the single European market
has prompted the organisers of this year's National Small Firms Policy and
Research Conference to hold part of the event in France.
The conference, the largest annual get-together of academics specialising in
small firms research, will start in Southampton on November 25 and 26 and,
after an evening cruise to Cherbourg, continue for its final day in France.
Topics which are expected to be included among the papers to be presented
are small firms policies in the recession; the preparedness among small
firms for the single market; business ethics; and tensions between local and
national policy following the creation of Training and Enterprise Councils.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to survive the
recovery - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the economy starts to recover from the recession, businesses may find
themselves overtaken by decisions which appeared to make sense at the bottom
of the downturn but which may lead to difficulties in the longer term.
Marketing budgets may have been cut or investments neglected because of
pressure on finance.
Recession and Recovery: How Businesses Can Prosper provides an overview of
six key areas which businesses need to consider if they are to survive in
the longer term.
The booklet, produced by Alex Lawrie, a factoring company, and the Henley
Centre, a forecasting consultancy, covers sales and marketing, cash
controls, raising finance, distribution, time management and planning. It is
aimed at companies with turnover of Pounds 100,000 or more.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Speaking the language of
Europe - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Machinery which crosses European Community borders will have to be
accompanied from January 1, 1993 by instructions drawn up in the language of
the country where it is to be used. Exporters have apparently been confused
by the relevant EC Directive (89/392/CEE) but the European Commission has
confirmed that instructions will have to be in the customer's language,
according to Transtelex*, a translating company.
Even if the contract between an English exporter and, say, a German exporter
stipulated that the language of the contract was English, this does not
absolve the exporter from having the manuals translated into German, it
said.
Customers could, in theory, refuse to accept delivery while customs
officials could use the absence of a manual to block entry. British
companies do not have a good record for providing foreign language manuals
and last-minute orders to produce manuals inevitably lead to delays and to
higher costs, says Peter Green, Transtelex's marketing manager.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Technology: PC discs sent down the phone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sending printed documents has become effortless, thanks to the widespread
availability of facsimile machines. But when it comes to sending material
from one personal computer to another, even seasoned PC users often find the
task daunting.
At the moment, information is transmitted between PCs - either from a remote
PC to the office, or across different networks - down an ordinary telephone
line using a modem.
The problem is that the telephone line, which was designed to transfer voice
rather than data, can be an unreliable and slow conduit for sending
information from a PC.
Now comes the floppy disc transfer machine which will send the entire
contents of a 3.5-inch or five-inch floppy disc down the phone line to
another disc.
In order to transfer the information it is first read by a floppy disc
drive. The signals are then compressed so they can be sent down the digital
network and decompressed, or expanded, at the other end. Then they are
copied on to a disc stored on a receiving machine.
Because they involve the transfer of digital signals, floppy disc transfers
can only be used where an integrated services digital network (ISDN) is
available.
In Japan, where 94 per cent of those who use telephones have access to ISDN
services, NTT, the former public telecommunications operator, started
selling floppy disc transfer machines two years ago.
The NTT machines are manufactured by Yamaha. The NTT machines can also be
used to copy the contents of discs of different sizes on to each other. NEC,
the electronics group, has a similar model.
Europe has still some way to go in building up its ISDN infrastructure but
in the UK, BT, the telecommunications group, has been making an effort to
expand its ISDN network. BT said that it is currently looking at the floppy
disc transfer machine on a trial basis.
NTT believes that when ISDN is more widely available in Europe, the floppy
disc transfer machine will find strong demand.
In the US, however, the adoption of different ISDN standards by the Baby
Bells makes the system it impossible to use.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Technology: Molecules muscle in / A look at a faster method
of getting drugs to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A visit to a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company these days may yield
some surprises to the casual observer.
The labs, complete with test tubes and scientists in goggles and white
coats, are still there. Increasingly prominent, though, are computer rooms,
where researchers sit in the dark looking at coloured pictures on the
screen, and designing the drugs of the future.
'These new molecular design methods will become increasingly significant for
the industry, and in 10 to 30 years will account for many of the new drugs
on the market,' said Jaqueline Siegel, an industry analyst at Hambrecht &amp;
Quist in New York.
The new method, sometimes referred to as 'second generation biotech', is
really a convergence of biotechnology with more conventional molecular
design.
The biotech industry's traditional products are proteins for which a useful
application has been discovered. But the problem with using proteins as
drugs is that they are too big to get through biological barriers in the
body. 'They are simply too large,' explains Joshua Boger, chief executive
officer of Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals.
Their size means they must be injected straight into the blood. If taken by
mouth, they are broken down in the digestive system. Insulin, considered the
first biotech product and one of the smallest proteins in existence, has a
molecular weight of 7,000, compared with aspirin, which has a weight of 150.
This is a particular problem because the greatest medical challenge to
scientists is fighting diseases like cancer and Aids. 'Biotech products are
too big to be taken orally, and if you want to treat chronic diseases, which
require continuous administration, you really need an oral product,' Boger
said.
Scientists agree that the industry's familiarity with protein structure is
invaluable in the search for useful drugs. But the new second-generation
techniques require a change in philosophy in the industry. Under the new
methodology, the protein is no longer thought of as a possible product;
rather it is considered a target.
'What we realised is that many chronic diseases are caused by reactions of a
single protein within the body,' said John Maraganore, head of biological
research at Boston-based Biogen. 'So if we can design molecules that bind to
the protein to somehow affect the reaction, we may have a useful drug.'
Vertex is using the new method to work out a cure for the Aids-causing HIV
virus. The company has discovered an empty space in the protein where a
chemical process causes the virus to become active. The hope is that by
plugging up that space, the molecule would simply lay dormant in the body.
The product which will probably come on market first is one developed by a
traditional pharmaceutical group, Merck, to prevent glaucoma. In late
clinical trials, the product may be on pharmacy shelves as early as 1994.
Squibb and Hoffmann-La Roche are also using second-generation molecular
design techniques to come up with new drugs. '(Second-generation) is a
powerful approach which is being heavily utilised in the industry,' said
Peter Lomedico, senior director of molecular biology at Hoffmann-La Roche.
Traditional pharmaceutical companies are approaching the new technique from
a different direction than biotechnology firms. Unlike biotechnology
companies, pharmaceutical groups were always in the business of looking for
small molecules. The problem was that there was little method to the
madness.
'Old-fashioned research methods call for years of random testing,' said
Boger, who worked for many years in the pharmaceutical industry. 'What the
scientists do is experiment with substances to see what works. They often
use soil samples because they contain so many different compounds. If
something accidentally works, they turn it into a drug.'
The problem is that this method is costly and lengthy. Traditional drug
discovery takes an average of seven years. And the average cost of
traditional drug development is a hefty Dollars 220m (Pounds 124m) per
product. 'It's trial and error with too much error,' said Boger.
The aim of second-generation biotech is to get drugs on to the market
faster. 'The new techniques are a lot better than the traditional grind and
find approach,' said Siegel.
Another problem with traditional drug development is that it creates a
product which often has side-effects. 'The compound may cleave to the
protein you want, but it may bind to other proteins as well,' said Boger.
'That's what causes side-effects. With new molecular design methods, we try
to get as specific as possible, trying to come up with a molecule that binds
to just one specific protein.'
Whatever direction they are coming from, both biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies are now using similar methods in the new molecular
design approach. The latest techniques take advantage of a process called
X-ray crystallography, which enables researchers to take a three-dimensional
picture of a protein. The protein is then entered on to a computer screen,
where scientists design drugs they believe will react with the target
molecule. This method is sometimes referred to as 'structured rational drug
design'.
'It's becoming increasingly like a recipe,' explained Maraganore. 'If you
want to make the compound longer to fit on to the protein better, you add on
some amino acids - shorter, and you take a few beads off. What you come up
with is not something found in nature, which would be a traditional biotech
product, but a unique, designed drug which binds to a specific protein.'
Structured rational drug design uses both the protein expertise of the
biotechnology firms and the molecular design methods of the pharmaceutical
groups. For that reason, many companies find that joint projects are the
best road to take.
'It's the development of this new technique, which uses the expertise of
both industries, which is inspiring a lot of the partnerships now forming
between biotechnology and pharmaceutical groups,' said Siegel.
The latest method of drug research is just beginning to take hold in the
industry, and no products developed through the technique are yet available
on the market. But few doubt that it is the wave of the future. 'This is the
permanent trend of the industry,' said Lomedico of Hoffmann-La Roche.
'There's no turning back now.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Technology: Computers on the home front - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW MANY times have we heard that millions of living rooms are about to
accommodate a home computer? It seems that every couple of years one or
other of the leading personal computer manufacturers takes a new stab at
creating consumer interest in computers.
To date, the results of their efforts have been less than spectacular. Now
here we go again. Apple Computer and International Business Machines are
mounting renewed efforts to address the nascent home computer market.
Apple, with a new range of 'Performa' Macintosh models, and IBM, with
additions to its PS/1 range, aim to open the floodgates of incipient demand
which they are convinced is still lurking behind the front doors of suburban
households.
Some 7m American families, according to Apple's reckoning, can afford to
purchase a personal computer but have not, so far, got around to it. The
targeted group is parents of school-age children. These families will have
'multiple motivations' to purchase a home computer, Apple predicts.
Dad and Mum may use the computer for work they bring home from the office.
It will also, Apple suggests, become a tool to work out household finances.
Children will use it for their homework. Parents may also use it as an
education tool to learn new skills. And everyone will enjoy computer games.
None of this is new. A decade ago, PC industry executives were expounding
the joys of home computing in similar terms. For all of these years, PC
makers have been searching for a 'compelling application' for the home
computer. They have never found it.
So what is going to persuade people to dig into their pockets to buy a home
computer now? Apple's US marketing experts suggest that changing patterns of
consumer spending, driven by recessionary pressures, should make this latest
generation of 'home computers' more successful.
Consumers are now looking for products with 'real value', as opposed to
products with status or design appeal, according to Apple's research.
Parental concerns about the so-called 'education crisis' in schools,
spurring greater efforts to help children learn at home, will prompt home
computer sales, the company predicts.
Home office activity is also on the rise as a result of the economic
recession, leading to increased demand for home computers. Working parents
also want the flexibility to be able to bring work home when they need to.
IBM, similarly, believes the time is right to reach consumers who have sat
on the sidelines for the past decade wondering why and whether they really
need a computer in the home.
A blunter assessment might be that the 30-40 per cent slide in PC prices
over the past year has done what millions of dollars of advertising failed
to do: encourage consumers to look again at products that they previously
regarded as expensive toys.
At today's prices, perhaps a PC is worth considering. Whether this will
translate into strong sales is less certain, with consumer spending in a
slump and consumer electronics markets particularly soft.
But price-war-weary PC makers are desperate to find new customers, so it is
time to give the consumer market another shot. The products that Apple and
IBM are offering to consumers are little more than renamed, rebundled office
computers.
Apple has added an easier-to-use graphics interface to its new Performa
line, but otherwise its 'new' products differ little from existing models.
Much is also made of the fact that these consumer-oriented computers will be
available in department stores.
That too, has been tried before. One day there will be real 'home
computers', but they probably will not look like today's offerings. In the
meantime, the 'commodity PC', whether it comes with Mickey Mouse software or
the same program you use at work, will appeal only to bargain hunters who
already know what a PC can and cannot do for them.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Opt-out schools given cash pledge by Patten
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, has promised that opt-out schools will
continue to get more cash than ordinary state schools.
The move followed fears of a slowing down in the pace of schools' becoming
grant-maintained under the government's flagship education policy because of
concerns about funding.
The 278 schools that have already opted out receive a significant budget
advantage once outside town hall control.
But this summer's white paper  - which provided a blueprint for all schools
to opt out into a new system without local education authorities  - was
unclear whether new grant-maintained schools would get the same preferential
treatment.
Critics say the clampdown on public spending made it unlikely, leaving heads
and governors wondering whether opting out was worth the risk.
Mr Patten has sought to maintain the momentum for opting out gained by the
Conservative election victory.
He told a party meeting in Aldershot on Friday: 'I intend to ensure that
schools which are accepted for grant-maintained status continue to receive
funding that recognises their extra responsibilities compared with LEA
schools.'
All opt-out schools would get a built-in advantage as part of the new common
funding formula proposed in the white paper, he said in the
little-publicised speech, which was not released until yesterday.
'It is important that parents and schools that are contemplating
grant-maintained status are aware of all these factors when coming to new
decisions,' he said.
Mr Patten said although the future of opt-out schools was 'totally secured',
there were question marks hanging over town halls as an independent
commission led by Sir John Banham, former director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, investigated their future role, if any.
The government must start valuing teachers if its reforms are to improve
education, the Rev Dominic Milroy, chairman of the Headmasters' Conference
 -which represents 233 private schools  - said yesterday.
He said at the opening of the organisation's annual conference in Bruges:
'There appears to be a tendency in the public mind, and even for the
government, to lump teachers together as a profession which doesn't deserve
the same respect as the medical, legal or financial professions.'
Mr Milroy warned against the dangers of the 'exam league table mentality'
and performance pay for teachers.

THE CUTS in RTZ Corporation's UK workforce are to continue with 540 job
losses at its MK Electric subsidiary, which makes plugs, sockets and circuit
protection equipment, Kenneth Gooding writes. That represents more than 20
per cent of the workforce of 2,600.
Two factories in Edmonton, north London, bear the brunt of the cuts, as 330
jobs will go this year and one plant will close. The rest of the 410 job
losses this year are at factories in Essex  - at Southend and Basildon  -
and MK's head office, which will cut its workforce by 130 in the next two
years.
This is the second substantial cut in jobs at MK.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Keen bidding for rare Meissen: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COLLECTION of early and mid-18th-century Meissen porcelain found
exceptional prices at Christie's in London yesterday. The collection, by Dr
and Mrs Korthaus between the late 1940s and 1968, was of consistently high
quality and contained several rarities.
Keen bidding forced a top price of Pounds 77,000 (estimate Pounds
40,000-Pounds 50,000) for a chinoiserie table-bell and stand decorated with
harbour scenes, set in elaborate purl and gilt cartouches, and one of very
few examples to have survived intact. Other pieces from this apparently
unique tea and coffee service doubled their estimates.
A white ware beaker vase dating to the last days of the great Johann Bottger
also soared way over estimate, fetching Pounds 49,000. An oval armorial
sugar box and cover from the famous Swan Service, made by JJ Kandler and
Eberlein for the factory's director Count Bruhl, found a new owner at Pounds
48,400 (estimate Pounds 25,000-Pounds 35,000). The Korthaus collection
realised Pounds 613,910, with 19 of 68 lots unsold. A further 70 pieces will
be offered in the spring.
Outstanding istoriato or 'story-telling' majolica earthenware from the
collection of the late Sir Thomas Barlow fared less well. A dish of 1523-25
decorated by the Raphael of majolica painting, Nicola da Urbino, and a great
market rarity, was bought in at Pounds 60,000 (estimate Pounds 80,000-Pounds
120,000).
Another Urbino istoriato dish, by Francesco Xanto Avelli  - perhaps the most
extraordinary personality in the history of majolica  - was unsold at Pounds
26,000. Italian dealers and collectors, the prime supporters of the majolica
market, seemed to have stayed at home.
The sale of Continental ceramics totalled Pounds 775,148, with 70 per cent
sold by value.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Shorts' share in jet plan will secure jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTICIPATION in the development of a new business jet is expected to secure
between 700 and 800 jobs at Short Brothers, the Belfast aerospace company
now part of the Canadian Bombardier engineering group.
Learjet, the sister company of Shorts within Bombardier, yesterday announced
plans for the new medium-sized business aircraft, the Learjet 45, just
before the opening of the Dallas business aircraft show.
The Canadian company confirmed that the Belfast-based manufacturer will
design and build a significant proportion of the airframe.
Three Bombardier aerospace companies are participating in the project. Apart
from Learjet, de Havilland in Toronto will be responsible for the wings and
Shorts will design and manufacture the fuselage and build the tailplane in
Belfast.
Speaking from Dallas, Mr Roy McNulty, Shorts president, said he was
'delighted at this vote of confidence in Shorts' ability to play a major
part in the new Bombardier project'.
Preliminary design work has already started. Certification is scheduled for
1996.
The new aircraft will be able to carry eight to 10 passengers over a range
of 2,200 nautical miles at a cruise speed of Mach 0.81. Its 61-in cabin
width will be designed to provide greater comfort with more head and
shoulder room.
Shorts already employs more than 8,000 people in Northern Ireland and is the
province's largest private employer.
There was further good news on the economic front in Ulster yesterday with
an announcement by the Sandown group of private nursing homes that it is
creating 250 jobs through the provision of four new homes across the
province.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Ulster talks deadline extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEADLINE for completing the talks on the political future of Northern
Ireland was yesterday extended in apparent recognition that a conclusion to
the complex negotiating process is still some way off.
Yesterday's session of strand two of the talks  - which are taking place in
three strands, or sections  - set no new deadline. But it was decided that
after three days of talks in Dublin this week, the next round will return to
Belfast next week.
When the talks began last April, the intention was that they would be
concluded by the end of July. That deadline was later extended until the end
of this month.
Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, said the presence in Dublin of
leaders of the Ulster Unionist party from Northern Ireland was a 'historic'
event, but added that he did not wish to over-emphasise this 'out of
sensitivity for the other participants'.
Yesterday's session at Dublin Castle was the first time since the partition
of Ireland in 1922 that unionist leaders had visited Dublin for political
discussions.
The Democratic Unionist party (DUP), led by the Rev Ian Paisley, stayed away
from the talks for part of last week and is boycotting this week's Dublin
phase, arguing that the Irish government has not demonstrated any
flexibility over the territorial claim to Northern Ireland enshrined in its
constitution. Articles Two and Three of the 1937 Irish constitution lay
claim to the six counties of Northern Ireland.
Mr Paisley attacked the Ulster unionists yesterday for meeting the Irish
ministers, saying: 'Some of the unionist negotiators drink at the bar with
these men . . . my party is not in that business. The only time we address
them is across the table when we are standing up for what Ulster stands for
and will stand for.'
Terrorism and security matters, the issues of identity and allegiance, as
well as what is considered the central issue of the constitutional status of
Northern Ireland were touched on yesterday.
Mr Andrews said afterwards: 'The discussions were very positive. Every day
there are new ideas. Certain progress was enhanced by today's business.'
A bilateral meeting between the British and Irish governments is due to be
held this evening and is expected to set a date for the next meeting of the
Anglo-Irish conference.
This will also be a bilateral meeting of the two governments and will take
place in the context of the 1985 Hillsborough Agreement  - to which the
unionists are opposed, as it gave Dublin a say, albeit minimal, in Northern
Ireland's affairs.
It was at the insistence of the DUP that the Anglo-Irish conferences were
suspended last April to allow the talks process to proceed. The talks are
designed to find a replacement to the agreement.
Last month it was agreed that the next bilateral conference would not be
held 'before September 28'.
Both the British and Irish governments are concerned that any further
postponement of the conference would undermine the 1985 agreement, but there
is also concern that the convening of a new conference might prompt the DUP
to withdraw from the round-table talks altogether.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Tube train drivers reject work plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASLEF, the train drivers' union, yesterday rejected London Underground's
plan to overhaul working practices, saying that it failed to compensate
drivers fully for the changes.
Aslef said it would ballot members on industrial action should London
Underground try to impose the plan, seen as the most radical for 40 years,
without union agreement.
The two other rail unions, the RMT and the TSSA white-collar workers union,
have told London Underground they need more time to study the plan and
consult their members.
London Underground had set September 30 as the deadline for responses after
a week of intensive negotiations intended to kick-start the stalled talks.
London Underground has offered staff a total of 5.8 per cent in compensation
but the plan means that 29 per cent of the 21,000 staff will suffer a
reduction in wages after two years.
Aslef is asking for pay rises of up to 19 per cent to ensure that the 2,341
train staff affected receive half the amount of money, between Pounds 12.75m
and Pounds 13.56m, that it calculates London Underground will save by
shedding 5,000 staff over five years.
Previous attempts to shake up working practices have failed partly because
of the highly unionised workforce and partly because of the importance of
the network for the London economy.
The three rail unions are meeting in London today to discuss the
negotiations.
Mr Gwynn Evans, London Underground's head of employee relations, said: 'Any
union which leads its members into a dispute over a package as good as ours
and in the current economic climate where many people are just happy to have
any job would be less than wise.'

FT  22 SEP 92 / Investment declines in W Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL investment by quoted companies in the west Midlands has fallen 8 per
cent on average over the past year, or 18 per cent if the spending plans of
utility groups are not taken into account.
The decline was measured by the Birmingham branch of KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy firm, by collating the most recent published results of 131
companies active in the region. The results of the survey raise serious
doubts about the competitiveness in the medium and long term of companies in
one of the UK's main industrial regions.
Although KPMG Peat Marwick found many companies that are 'fit, profitable
and cash-generating', it suggests that 'lack of investment coupled with high
labour rates can only undermine competitiveness for the long term'.
The collective bill for employees in the west Midlands companies  - wages
and salaries, social security and pension costs  - was Pounds 6.32bn in
1991-92, compared with Pounds 6.06bn in 1990-91. The survey notes that
average wages and salaries rose 6.5 per cent to Pounds 13,100 a year, as the
total number on the payroll declined to 418,000 from 430,000 in 1990-91.
It found, however, that companies were maintaining dividend payments to
shareholders. Payments rose overall by 3.5 per cent while total pre-tax
profits earned by the 131 companies declined 24 per cent.
Only the utilities  - Midlands Electricity, Severn Trent Water and South
Staffordshire Water  - and companies in the retailing and food and drink
sectors recorded an increase in capital investment.
'Given the significant increase by the utilities, reflecting the investment
programme of Severn Trent to improve the standard of water supply', the
average fall in capital spending 'disguises much larger reductions by both
large and small companies', the survey says.
Expenditure by small companies, defined as those with a market value of less
than Pounds 50m, fell 46 per cent during 1991-92. Spending by large
companies  - those with a market value of more than Pounds 100m - declined
12 per cent from 1990-91.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Warning over stress-related illness at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 750,000 people took time off work in 1989-90 because of
work-related illness, a conference was told yesterday.
Dr Paul Oldershaw, head of technology and health sciences at the Health and
Safety Executive, told the three-day conference in Sheffield on occupational
health that work-related illness would be a big concern in the future.
Stress at work was also recognised as an important cause of sickness
absence, Dr Oldershaw said. Research had shown that occupational stress
could have an impact on physical health. 'We need to gain a better
understanding of the causes of psychological stress and how these impact on
the health and performance of the worker.'
Some 8,000 lives and 27m working days in Europe are lost each year due to
work-related accidents and ill health.
Dr Oldershaw called for more debate in the European Community to identify
areas that could be treated and where further research was necessary.
He said the largest single area of work-related health disorders was
musculo-skeletal injury: 'It affects workers in heavy manual activities,
such as lifting, as well as less strenuous but more repetitive tasks such as
keyboard operators and supermarket check-out staff.' Almost 30 per cent of
women workers do not know if their employer has an equal-opportunities
policy, a survey of 20 organisations suggests.
The survey, conducted by Riley Advertising, which specialises in recruitment
advertising, found that all but one employer had such a policy. Researchers
questioned both employers and 437 of their women workers.
More than half of those women who are aware of their employers'
equal-opportunities policies said they were only partly successful. More
than 60 per cent said their employers were not committed to their policies.
However, more than 80 per cent thought the policies were useful.
The survey also found that fewer than 8 per cent of women workers said their
employers had consulted them when drawing up equal-opportunities policies.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Yard denies 'dirty tricks' reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND YARD last night denied reports that it believed MI5, the security
service, was behind a 'dirty tricks' campaign over the leak at the weekend
of the appointment of Commander David Tucker as the new head of Scotland
Yard's anti-terrorist branch.
The appointment was planned months ago as part of a reorganisation of the
security operations against IRA units active on the mainland, spearheaded by
Ms Stella Rimington, the MI5 chief, according to police sources.
It was not, Scotland Yard said, a way of hastening the retirement of
Commander George Churchill-Coleman. 'There is no MI5 dirty tricks behind
this,' it said.
The move came amid fears that any public escalation of a row between
Scotland Yard and MI5 might be exploited by the IRA.
However, anger within Scotland Yard continued to be widespread yesterday at
the way the leaking had in effect forestalled any chance of an
uncontroversial succession, due to take place in November, to one of the
most sensitive public posts in the country.
According to one Scotland Yard official, the Home Office was under pressure
to identify those responsible for the leak, while Mr Churchill-Coleman was
said to be 'furious' at the way the announcement of his departure has been
pre-empted by the media.
In spite of official denials, Mr Brian Hilliard, editor of the usually
well-informed magazine Police Review, said that the 'grassroots' feeling
within the force was that Mr Churchill-Coleman had been moved 'at the
request of MI5'.
Mr Tucker was avoiding the public eye yesterday, hoping that the controversy
would eventually subside and allow him to get on with the job he has
apparently been groomed for behind the scenes.
Officially, Scotland Yard's SO11, the unit he has headed for the past two
years, has focused on non-terrorist criminal activity. But it emerged
yesterday that the unit has also been closely involved in covert anti-IRA
operations. It is that activity which has reportedly earned Commander Tucker
a good reputation among senior officials of MI5.
It also became clear yesterday that Commander Tucker had accepted the post
as head of the anti-terrorist branch in preference to an appointment linked
to Europol, the planned European intelligence agency which is due to become
operative in January. He has experience of liasing with other European
police agencies as a former head of Scotland Yard's Interpol unit.
The very nature of SO11 has meant that Commander Tucker has been one of the
least well-known senior officers in the Metropolitan Police.
Close colleagues of Commander Tucker say that he owes his relatively rapid
promotion to a proven track record as a skilled operator in surveillance
work and as a conciliator between the various agencies involved in
anti-terrorist work.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard both yesterday launched

However, reflecting the cut-throat competition in the PC market, AST
Research, a leading clone maker, matched and in some cases undercut IBM and
HP prices with new models of its own.
IBM launched 12 new models in its PS/2 Premium line and announced a new
warranty service.
H-P claimed its new PCs were cheaper than comparable products from Compaq
Computer and provide more features than similarly-priced PCs from Dell
Computer and AST.
IBM has called for redemption on November 21 of all Dollars 1.2bn
outstanding of its 7 7/8 per cent convertible subordinated debentures due
November 2004. It also called for redemption on November 14 of all Dollars

TOYOTA MOTOR of Japan has denied agreeing to buy into Astra International,
Indonesia's main vehicle manufacturer.
The denial followed an statement by Astra on Friday  - restated yesterday  -
that Toyota was to acquire about 4 per cent of the company in a deal worth
about USDollars 46m.
Toyota said yesterday: 'It is not a fact that we have agreed to the
investment as cited by Astra'  - although approaches made by Astra were
under consideration. It added: 'We will do what is necessary to ensure that
our relationship (with Astra) will be successful.'
Astra intends to bring in foreign shareholders following a decision by the
Soeryadjaya family, which owns 76 per cent of Astra, to sell down its
holding to raise about Dollars 350m in finance for its troubled Summa Group.
Astra, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 1.2bn, is reported also to
have held talks with General Electric of the US and Temasek of Singapore.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Mixed feelings in Bonn
on result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ON Maastricht, the German body politic seems to want to eat its cake and
have it.
One side  - Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his government and the main parties  -
says full steam ahead: lingering doubts about the meaning of Maastricht, and
the implications for the D-Mark, must be subsumed in a rapid ratification
process.
'Maastricht is not going to fail because of Germany,' says Mrs Heidemarie
Wieczorek-Zeul, EC spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats (SPD),
normally die-hard opponents of the chancellor.
The other side  - many of the same people, plus business and industry, the
financial establishment, and politicians outside the Bonn hot-house  -
simultaneously wants a breathing space, time for some fine-tuning, even for
a little reconsideration about the revolution implied by economic and
monetary union (Emu).
'The direction of Maastricht is the right one, but the speed will depend on
how quickly we can solve the problems,' Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister and
close associate of Mr Kohl, said yesterday. One cannot create a European
currency 'artificially', he said.
Outside the establishment there are those who want nothing to do with
Maastricht at all. In spite of growing public sympathy, they have made no
impact on Bonn. Their campaign for a referendum does not look likely to
succeed  - because of the shambles of the French referendum and, more
important, because of memories of the misuse of referendums in the Weimar
republic, when they undermined the elected parties and contributed to the
rise of Hitler.
Even those fighting for ratification admit that the process  - due to begin
with a first reading in the Bundestag on October 7  - is no longer the end
of the issue. For the demand by both houses of parliament to have another
debate before moving to the final stage of Emu, in 1997 or 1999, is now
recognised as a chance to halt any automatic move to a single currency.
'No German government will go ahead (to Emu) if the Bundestag refuses to
accept that the economic convergence criteria have been fulfilled,' a senior
government official said yesterday. 'And Emu without Germany would not
happen.'
The view that is gathering momentum, however, is that the EC is condemned to
become a multiple-speed community.
As a result of the divided establishment view, there is something of a
love-hate relationship towards those seen as complicating the process: first
Denmark, then France, and now Britain.
The Danish No vote was welcomed by many pro-Europeans for forcing the German
public to focus on the Maastricht Treaty for the first time. It was welcomed
by opponents for liberating the debate and allowing Germans to dare to say
No in the opinion polls.
The French referendum was watched in trepidation throughout the political
establishment for fear it would undermine Germany's most important partner
in all Community affairs. With the result out, no one is quite sure the tiny
majority for the Yes vote will not have the same effect.
Attention is turning to the British reservations, just as the British are
indulging in a dose of Germany-bashing. One voice of the establishment says:
'Press on regardless. They will never be true Europeans.' Another voice
says: 'How can we help them stay on board? For we sink or swim together.'
'Great Britain must decide,' says Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman
of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats. 'There is a growing temptation for people
to pull back into their national snails' shells. It is an illusion. It is an
expression of fears, a flight from reality. The reality is called Europe.'
What Germany can do for British Prime Minister John Major is return to the
issue on which the two stand relatively united: the need to reinforce
so-called subsidiarity  - maximum devolution of decision-making  - and the
protection of national identities in the Maastricht Treaty.
That was the key new element in Mr Kohl's statements on Sunday night and
yesterday, in the wake of the referendum result. Otherwise he was merely
insisting that Maastricht must be ratified by all member states, and that
political union must move hand-in-hand with economic union.
However, the simultaneous German concern is that UK fury at the fall of the
pound, and its accusations of German complicity, may fatally undermine
British willingness to find ways of pushing the Maastricht process forward.
That would be serious if Britain were just one of 12 members round the
table. It could be disastrous with Britain currently occupying the
presidential chair and so responsible for promoting compromise.
In particular, Mr Major's suggestion that the emergency summit in October
might consider ways of reforming the European Monetary System and its
exchange rate mechanism is regarded as wild and dangerous in Bonn.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Ministers disagree over
timetable for ratification - Britain succeeds in avoiding deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday warmly welcomed 'the positive
result' of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, but disagreed
about both the timing of the ratification process and the strength of their
commitment to various aspects of proposed European union.
A joint declaration issued after an extraordinary meeting of the EC Council
in the margin of the United Nations General Assembly in New York made clear
there was general agreement that the treaty should not be renegotiated.
Britain succeeded in keeping out of the text any commitment to a precise
deadline for ratification.
The text was adopted after an earlier draft submitted by Mr Douglas Hurd, UK
foreign secretary, acting in his capacity as EC president, had been
rejected. According to a Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman the draft was
rejected as being too weak on both ratification and renegotiation.
The spokesman pointed out it did not even go as far as the Oslo declaration
by the Twelve  - adopted last June after the negative referendum vote by
Danes  - which specified the Maastricht treaty should be ratified by the end
of this year.
The final version adopted by ministers still leaned more towards the British
position than towards those who  - like the Dutch, Belgians and French  -
wanted firm language on both ratification and renegotiation. It said the
Council noted with satisfaction that certain member states had already
ratified the draft treaty and that such procedures were well advanced in
most other member states.
'They attached high priority to the speedy and successful conclusion of the
process, without reopening the present text, on the timing foreseen in
article 'R' of the treaty.' This states that the treaty shall enter into
force on January 1 1993, provided all instruments of ratification have been
deposited or, failing that, on the first day of the month following deposit
of the ratification instrument of the last state to take that step.
Mr Hurd said after the meeting that Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, had made clear the British government's position on ratification.
The UK needed to be clear about Denmark's intentions and wanted to await the
outcome of the EC summit which Mr Major had called for next month before
tabling the ratification bill in parliament. The Danish government is due to
publish a white paper on its position on Maastricht within the next two
weeks.
Britain's and other members' concern that ordinary citizens' reservations
about certain aspects of the Community's development, voiced over the past
few months, should be taken into account by governments was reflected in the
communique.
'They (the ministers) pledged their determination to ensure that
preoccupations which had been brought to the forefront in the public
discussion will find specific responses in the future development of Europe
internally and externally,' it said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE judge presiding over the US court case involving Dollars 5bn (Pounds
2.8bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) turned down last night a request from defence
lawyers to order a fresh trial.
Lawyers for Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta branch manager,
filed a motion last week requesting that Mr Drogoul be allowed to withdraw
his previous guilty plea and stand trial. At present Mr Drogoul is facing an
unusual sentencing hearing that has been effectively transformed into a
mini-trial.
Judge Marvin Shoob said, however, he wished to hear a series of government
and defence witnesses instead. Mr Drogoul's lawyers have cited declassified
US documents and witnesses they say will be produced in court to argue that
US intelligence agencies and BNL's Rome headquarters knew of the Iraqi
loans, which Baghdad used to fund nuclear, chemical and missile projects.
The US government's case is based on the premise that Mr Drogoul was the
sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans, without any knowledge on the part of
the bank in Rome.
Mr Jake Arbes, one of Mr Drogoul's lawyers, said last night he appreciated
the judge's desire to hear evidence. He hinted, however, that a second
motion for the guilty plea to be withdrawn could be filed when the
sentencing hearing is concluded in a few days.
Last weekend the Bush administration released a CIA letter that argued it
only learned from press reports of the BNL Rome office's possible
involvement with the Iraqi loans. The letter did not, however, address
disclosures made in Congress last week that the CIA had subsequently
confirmed the press reports of Rome's knowledge.
Yesterday, other declassified documents were released in Congress by Mr
Henry Gonzalez, House banking committee chairman, who has accused the Bush
administration of covering up its own knowledge of the BNL affair. Mr
Gonzalez disclosed a March 23, 1989 State Department memo to then Secretary
of State James Baker which, Mr Gonzalez claimed, showed a rapid rise in US
imports of Iraqi oil as a quid pro quo for the administration's approval of
export licences for technology that helped Iraq's military projects.
Although the memo stated that Iraq had asked Washington 'to push Congress'
to delete sanctions legislation, it also told Mr Baker that Baghdad was
'working hard at chemical and biological weapons and new missiles'. The memo
also said that Iraq had given 'favourable deals to US oil companies' and
noted oil exports to the US had soared to about 500,000 b/d.
Mr Gonzalez released documents showing that by the time Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990 US purchases of Iraqi oil had jumped to more than 1.1m b/d. He said
the US Department of Energy had purchased more than 3.4m barrels of Iraqi
oil only months before the Gulf war started.
The congressman also said that US intelligence reports dating back to the
summer of 1989 showed the Bush administration knew that technology for
Baghdad's nuclear and missile programmes was being procured by
Matrix-Churchill, the Iraqi-owned and UK-based machine tools company
financed by BNL Atlanta.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Teachers 'undervalued'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government must start valuing teachers if its reforms are to improve
education, the Rev Dominic Milroy, chairman of the Headmasters' Conference -
which represents 233 private schools - said yesterday.
'There has been an unfortunate tendency down the years for teachers to get a
lot of stick,' he said at the opening of the organisation's annual
conference in Bruges.
'There appears to be a tendency in the public mind, and even for the
government, to lump teachers together as a profession which doesn't deserve
the same respect as the medical, legal or financial professions.'
Mr Milroy attacked the view of Mr John Patten, education secretary, that
parents always knew better than teachers and educationalists.
He also warned against the dangers of the 'exam league table mentality' and
pressing ahead with performance-related pay for teachers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Trudeau, the former Canadian prime minister, has indicated he will
campaign for a No vote in next month's referendum on the country's new
constitution, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
In a strongly worded essay published in a Canadian magazine yesterday, Mr
Trudeau urges Canadian political leaders to have 'a bit of courage' in
resisting 'master blackmailers' in Quebec who are demanding more powers for
the francophone province.
The No forces have seized the early initiative in the campaign leading up to
the October 26 referendum.
Criticism of the deal in Quebec has so far centred on the failure of Mr
Robert Bourassa, the province's prime minister, to extract more powers from
the federal government. In western Canada opposition is centred on the
provision which guarantees Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of
Commons in perpetuity.
Westerners also oppose proposals for a revamped Senate which would have
equal provincial representation but only limited powers of veto.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Solicitors reject latest plan for legal aid fees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICITORS' leaders yester-day rejected the government's latest proposals for
fixed legal aid fees and pledged to fight their planned introduction.
They said the plan merely repeated earlier unsatisfactory proposals.
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, announced levels of standard or fixed fees
for legally aided magistrates' court work, based on recommendations by Price
Waterhouse, the management consultancy.
Basic standard fees, payable under a two-tier structure, would range from
Pounds 127 per case (Pounds 143 in London) to Pounds 497 (Pounds 631 in
London) depending on the type and complexity of hearing, plus payments for
travelling and waiting time.
Some cases, however, judged the most complex or time-consuming, would be
assessed for payment by the Legal Aid Board outside the standard fee system.
Lord Mackay intends to introduce standard fees by the end of the year.
The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said the
Price Waterhouse recommendations simply repeated earlier 'flawed and
discredited' proposals.
'The consultants' report has much to say about cost control, but virtually
nothing about the risk that these proposals will make it more difficult for
solicitors to provide a good service to their clients,' it said.
'The society will oppose the proposals with the utmost vigour.'

THE LEADER of the Institute of Directors, yesterday called on the government
to cut interest rates to 8 per cent in the aftermath of the French
referendum.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director general, also called on the prime minister not
to ratify the Maastricht treaty. He said implementation in the present form
would be 'the height of folly' because of dissatisfaction in France and
elsewhere. The treaty was designed by 'other people' with other interests
and there was never anything in it for Britain.
The European exchange rate mechanism had been exposed as a 'multilateral
shambles' which had destroyed many businesses, added Mr Morgan.

FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pacific Dunlop maintains payout
on steady earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Dunlop, the diversified Australian industrial company, has struggled
through the recession almost unscathed, reporting operating profits little
changed for the year to June.
The company's profit before abnormals fell by just under 1 per cent to
ADollars 217.7m (USDollars 160m) from ADollars 219.8m, on an 18 per cent
rise in sales to ADollars 5.91bn from ADollars 5.02bn.
The directors recommended a maintained annual dividend of 21 cents a share,
but it will be paid on capital increased by a ADollars 663m rights issue
during the year, lifting payout by 23 per cent to ADollars 189m.
Mr John Gough, chairman, said the company had come through the worst
recession in 60 years with increased competitiveness and a 'creditable
result'.
'Until the last quarter, the recession continued to affect performance in
most markets,' he said. 'Australia, New Zealand, the US and Europe all had
depressed economies, with weak consumer and industrial demand.
'As the 1992 financial year ended, signs began appearing that the current
year may be a little brighter. Each of the business groups is predicting no
further deterioration in its markets, but realises that emerging from the
recession is likely to be a long and uneven experience,' he added.
Pacific Dunlop earned a net ADollars 22.2m from the Petersville food group,
which it acquired from Adsteam in August last year. This contributed to
ADollars 48m profits from the newly-formed Pacific Brands Food group.
The company's biggest earning division, however, remained building and
construction, with profits easing to ADollars 135m from ADollars 158m. The
biggest improvement in earnings came from South Pacific tyres division, up
to ADollars 30m from ADollars 24m.
Pacific Dunlop also confirmed yesterday it would apply for regulatory
approval to bid for New Zealand-based Wattie Foods. But it stressed it had
not decided to proceed with a bid which would rival an offer from the
US-based Heinz.
The rights issue during the year allowed Pacific Dunlop to reduce net
interest marginally to ADollars 66.9m from ADollars 67.3m. But depreciation
rose to ADollars 187.9m from ADollars 141.8m, and tax took ADollars 91.9m
compared with ADollars 75.1m.

46m stake in Indonesia's Astra

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA MOTOR of Japan has denied agreeing to buy into Astra International,
Indonesia's main vehicle manufacturer.
The denial followed an announcement by Astra on Friday - restated yesterday
 -that Toyota is to acquire about 4 per cent of the company in a deal worth
about USDollars 46m.
Toyota said yesterday: 'It is not a fact that we have agreed to the
investment as cited by Astra' - although approaches made by Astra were under
consideration. It added: 'We will do what is necessary to ensure that our
relationship (with Astra) will be successful.'
Last year, Astra, which has a 54 per cent market share of vehicle sales in
Indonesia, sold 142,824 units, with Toyota models accounting for 53 per cent
of the company's sales.
Astra intends to bring in a consortium of foreign shareholders following a
decision by the Soeryadjaya family, which owns 76 per cent of Astra, to sell
down its holding to raise finance for its troubled Summa Group. Brokers
estimate the family must raise over Dollars 350m. Astra, with a market
capitalisation of Dollars 1.2bn, is reported also to have held talks with
General Electric of the US and Temasek of Singapore.
Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusomo, chairman of Astra, said Toyota would acquire 16
per cent of the shares to be sold by the Soeryadjayas - a 4 per cent stake.
Astra said yesterday it would name other international shareholders this
month and details of the deals by December. Last week, Astra announced a 67
per cent fall in net profits for the first half.

FT  22 SEP 92 / People: Taunt rejoins Smiths Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No amiable bon mots for some weeks from Robin Taunt, newly appointed
business development director at Smiths Industries. He is already hard at
work in the US learning his new employer's business. Or rather, learning how
it has changed since the late 1970s, when he last worked for the
fast-growing, acquisitive high technology company.
Then he spent seven years with Smiths in various senior appointments before
leaving to become group planning and development manager and eventually
security division chief for MK Electric.
His principal role is to look after Smiths' ambitious acquisition programme
(and, to a lesser extent, disposals). The group has Pounds 95m in cash to
snap up bargains in the company's core areas of aerospace electronics,
medical systems and specialised industrial products. Taking on debt will
prove no barrier if Taunt comes up with a suitably enticing prospect.
Now 43, he is a metallurgist by training and came to grips with acquisitions
and divestments through a spell as head of corporate finance for British
Telecom.
His appointment will give economic adviser Gerry Mortimer new freedom to
concentrate on strategic planning and investor relations.
*****
Following the departure of Martin Saunders to sort out the Tory party's
finances at central office, David Morris, a senior partner of KPMG Peat
Marwick is joining P&amp;O as its new group finance director.
Bruce MacPhail, who has a double first in maths and is a chartered
accountant, is a highly financially literate managing director, so the City
saw much less of Saunders, a quiet man who busied himself with the nuts and
bolts of the figures.
Saunders' predecessor as finance director, Andrew Robb, who moved across to
Pilkington in 1989, had been more active as far as the City was concerned.
Morris, too, may wish to adopt a higher profile. With Peat Marwick since
1959, he has spent most of his time on the accountancy side, but worked in
the management consultancy arm between 1980 and 1989. In 1989 he was
president of the Management Consultancy Association.
While KPMG are P&amp;O's auditors, Morris was not responsible for that area. He
does, however, know chairman Lord Sterling and Bruce MacPhail well.
P&amp;O is wrestling with a mountain of debt - gearing standing at around 70 per
cent - acquired partly as the result of its involvement with Laing
Properties since early 1990; one analyst characterises Morris' new
assignment as 'no soft option'.

<TEXT>
CHRISTIAN SALVESEN, the distribution, manufacturing and specialist hire
group, has sold its oilfield technology subsidiary for Pounds 28.5m to BJ
Services Company, of Houston, Texas.
The Aberdeen-based Salvesen (Oilfield Technology) had a net book value of
Pounds 15.8m and made operating profits of Pounds 3.3m in the year to March
31, which the group described as a difficult period in the North Sea oil
business.
Mr Chris Masters, Christian Salvesen's chief executive, said: 'The sale is
in line with our strategy of focusing on a limited number of activities
where we have a demonstrable and maintainable competitive edge.'
The proceeds will be used to reduce gearing, which stood at 35 per cent in
March. The consideration is being satisfied by a Pounds 15m 90-day loan note
and the balance in cash.
The disposal comes at a time when companies in the offshore supply business
face increasing competition for work as oil companies cut costs.

UNEMPLOYMENT in Australia and the Home Counties made itself felt in
Newcastle yesterday when the Youth Hostels Association announced the closure
of its northern England office.
The association expects numbers of overnight visitors at its 230 hostels in
England and Wales to fall to 1.9m this year, against a 1989 peak of 2.15m.
The fall in Australian visitors was partly offset by an increase in the
number of Americans who have traded down from hotels to youth hostels in an
attempt to make their dollars go further.
The number of UK hostellers has fallen sharply as youth and student
unemployment has reduced the association's traditional market. Mr Colin
Logan, the association's chief executive, said the business lacked
recession-resistant qualities.
Apart from the closure of the Newcastle office, the association is reducing
the marketing department at its St Albans headquarters and cutting the
number of field managers. The total number of jobs lost will be 11 out of a
management and administrative staff of 120, although Mr Logan said five new
jobs should also be created.
The association is retaining regional offices in Wiltshire, Derbyshire and
Cardiff.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Pension fund theft insurance launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROVISION of unusual business at Lloyd's of London took a new turn
yesterday with an underwriter launching the first known insurance against
pension fund theft.
Syndicate 1007, managed by Spreckley Villers Hunt &amp; Co, is the lead
underwriter for insurance cover that will protect pension fund assets for up
to Pounds 50m.
The policy will provide 'first party' cover, which should permit prompt
reimbursement once theft has been established without the need for civil or
criminal action.
It defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of pension fund property
with the intention permanently to deprive the assured of that property.
It will apply to any theft by people or organisations that have control over
or access to pension fund assets. They include trustees and their employees,
administrators, investment managers, actuaries and directors.
Applicants will have to complete an eight-page form asking for details of
those involved in handling pension fund assets, how the fund manages and
handles investments and whether it takes part in stock lending.
Existing insurance cover has been available only for negligent errors or
omissions by pension fund trustees and not for deliberate fraud.
Mr Simon Haggas, an assistant underwriter, said the new idea was prompted by
the plight of the Maxwell pensioners. 'We were kicking ourselves about why
we had not done it before,' he said. 'It takes something like the Maxwell
affair to make it happen.'
Asked whether the introduction of the cover was a publicity stunt, he said:
'Oh, absolutely not. We are in it for the financial gain. We want to make
money out of the product.'
Losses caused by Hurricane Andrew in the Bahamas, Florida and Louisiana will
top Dollars 10bn, the Thomas Howell Group, loss adjusters, warned yesterday.
Estimates have been raised in Florida and delayed by slowness in claims
while residents concern themselves with food and shelter.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STATUTORY audit of all limited-liability companies should remain
compulsory, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said
yesterday in a submission to the Department of Trade and Industry.
It says that although reform may be required, abolition of the statutory
audit is not the solution and the audit is important for the Inland Revenue,
creditors and bankers.
The document follows growing pressure from other bodies for abolition of
audits for small companies.
The DTI said earlier this year that it might consider abolishing the
requirement for companies with turnovers below the VAT threshold of Pounds
36,600.
Industry and a number of professional bodies have argued that the audit is
costly and inefficient.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: Calls for plebiscite led by SNP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish National party yesterday stepped up demands for a referendum in
the UK on Britain's future relations with Europe - which would include a
question for Scottish voters on the home rule issue.
Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said the narrowness of the French vote made
Mr John Major's position in refusing to hold a referendum untenable - and it
was equally untenable for him to deny the Scots a ballot on their country's
future.
'Why should the Scots be denied a vote on Europe's future and Scotland's
place in Europe when the Danes, the Irish and the French have all had their
say?' said Mr Salmond, MP for Banff and Buchan.
He told a Glasgow news conference: 'Scotland needs a vote on Europe and a
voice in Europe. If closer co-operation is to proceed - and the SNP, despite
Maastricht's flaws, hopes that it will - Europe must be brought closer to
the people.
'That means a small nation like Scotland, just like Denmark and Ireland,
must have an independent voice at the heart of the new Europe.'
The SNP meets in Perth for its annual conference tomorrow. On Saturday,
there will be a debate on the Maastricht agreement - an amendment calls for
a referendum.
Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, yesterday renewed his
call for a referendum, saying the French result had knocked progress to
monetary union 'completely off the rails'.
'Perhaps it is time for the people of Britain to have a say,' he said. 'A
referendum on the issue would clear the air and make it much easier for John
Major to speak for the country in the certainty that he was speaking for all
the people.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOVIS has been appointed development manager for a Pounds 15m regional
shopping centre, to be built on the outskirts of Brno in Czechoslovkia.
The client, Vrabel Brothers SRO, is a leading Czech property development
company with particularly good knowledge of the Moravia area.
Occupying a seven hectare side adjoining the Prague-Brno motorway, and close
to a proposed major north/south interchange, the centre will provide 30,000
sq metres of retail space. The development will include a 0.5 hectare
motorway service area to be built for the petrol company AGIP.
Planning consent has already been granted for the retail centre and service
area. Construction work is due to begin in April next year with completion
in spring 1995.
Bovis, which is owned by P&amp;O, is already engaged in another project in the
area, as joint venture partners with the City of Brno in the development of
a Pounds 130m technology park on the university campus.

<TEXT>
SUZUKI Motor, the Japanese minicar and motorcycle producer, has taken
control of Pak Suzuki Motor, its nine-year-old joint venture in Pakistan
which runs the country's only car plant, by increasing its equity to 40 per
cent from 25 per cent, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
Mr Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki Motor, told a news conference his
company had taken control of the venture with the aim of improving
efficiency and exporting cars to the newly independent central Asian
republics.
Under an agreement signed on Saturday, Suzuki bought an additional 15 per
cent of Pak Suzuki shares worth Y861m (Dollars 7m) from the state-run
Pakistan Automobile Corp as part of the privatisation programme of Mr Nawaz
Sharif, prime minister.
The new management has agreed to increase production to 50,000 cars a year
within two years, and to 100,000 in five years, from 25,000 now, said Mr
Saeed Qadir, head of Pakistan's privatisation commission.
Pak Suzuki will be Pakistan's first privatised company to have a foreign
management. More than 50 state enterprises have already been privatised.
Mr Suzuki said the company was now losing Rp600m (Dollars 24m) a year, which
had eaten up earlier profits. He said he intended to 'improve everything' in
Pak Suzuki to make it financially sound.
Pak Suzuki was also interested in marketing its cars in the former Soviet
republics of central Asia, Mr Suzuki said.
'If we achieve good results in Pakistan, we will export from Pakistan rather
than open another plant in central Asia.'
Toyota and Honda also plan to make cars in Pakistan.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (3): A riverside renaissance -
Laganside Corporation is transforming a run-down piece of land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Laganside Corporation is charged with regenerating 120 acres of inner
city property and land along 1.5 miles of the River Lagan which has fallen
into dereliction and disuse as a result of industrial decline.
In this, the corporation is similar to development corporations in
Merseyside, Newcastle, Manchester and even London docklands. The idea is
that by using a modicum of government money to improve access to rundown
dock, riverside or canalside areas, private sector investment will be
levered into housing, offices, shops, concert halls and exhibition centres.
The difference is that the River Lagan is in Belfast. Not only is the city a
place apart in that - unlike the other industrial cities in decline on the
mainland - it does not lock into a highly populated business hinterland, it
also has a security problem.
The chances of a visiting businessman meeting a violent death are no doubt
greater in Chicago or New York. But the troubles in Northern Ireland have
for a long time been a disincentive to investment in property.
This began to change in the second half of the 1980s. Mr Michael Roberts,
director of marketing at the Laganside Corporation says: ' Everything in
Belfast in the property sector is grace of the IRA. But you can see for
yourself the changes that have been made in recent years.'
Compared with the early 1980s, Belfast is much changed. Then, the city was a
web of security barriers and barbed wire. Few new property developments in
the city centre were embarked upon. But since 1985, buildings of all kinds,
offices, shops, houses, wine bars and cinemas have sprung up in the centre.
The renaissance started with retailing. Belfast, which was dominated by
local stores, such as Robinson and Cleaver, began to see the arrival of the
big chains. By 1990 - with the Castlecourt Centre, the York Centre and the
Kennedy Centre - 700,000 sq ft of retailing space had been added to the
centre.
Office space was also built, as government departments were moved out of
cramped and inadequate space at Stormont, the old parliament outside the
city. Mr Kevin Milhench of the leading local estate agents Lambert, Smith,
Hampton estimates that the take-up of office space in the past two years has
been more than 650,000 sq ft. The clients have been predominantly government
departments. 'Traditionally, the take-up of office space in Belfast would be
no more than 150,00 sq ft a year', Mr Milhench says.
It would be difficult to describe Belfast as normal. The heavily fortified
law courts, which stand between the city centre and Laganside, are reminders
of the abnormality. 'When you talk about developing Laganside, it is like
having Fort Knox between the city and the River,' Mr Milhench says. However,
in spite of these reminders of the troubles, the terrorists have been either
unwilling or unable to destroy the city centre. This has allowed further
property development.
The question is now arising as to whether the spurt of building in recent
years has created an oversupply of property in Belfast and whether
development of Laganside would lead to a flood in the market.
Using the grandiose original plans, this would have almost certainly been
the case. In 1989, when Laganside Corporation was formed, an investment of
Pounds 750m was talked of in the seven main sites - the Abercorn Centre, the
Abercorn Basin, Clarendon Dock, Laganbank, Ravenhill Reach, Bridge End and
the Gasworks.
Developments would have included more than 1m sq ft of office space as well
as facilities such as a concert hall, shopping centre, cinema complexes,
houses, parks and museums.
With a changed economic climate - Northern Ireland has not been immune to
recession - ambitions have been scaled down. By 1996 it is hoped that Pounds
200m will have been invested, with Pounds 150m coming from the private
sector.
Improvements to the infrastructure have already taken place. The weir across
the Lagan, at a cost of Pounds 14m, will will trap water and cover up the
unsightly mudflats. The weir was financed directly by government with help
from the European Regional Development Fund.
Spending by the Laganside Corporation - funded by the Department of the
Environment of Northern Ireland - has been running at between Pounds 8m and
Pounds 10m a year. Much of this has been spent on developing walkways along
the river banks. In the private sector, the main development has been an
office block of 70,000 sq ft on the Abercorn Centre site.
If development continues at its present pace, by the mid-1990s, the derelict
area of Belfast's docklands should well the way to being transformed into a
lively attractive precinct.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLERICAL Medical and National Provident Institution, both mutually owned
life insurers, are shortly expected to announce a merger creating a new
company with Pounds 11bn in assets under management.
The merger would be part of a growing trend among mutually owned life
insurers, who need either to merge or demutualise in the quest for capital.
Mutually owned life companies need to expand distribution channels and meet
reserve requirements to write new business.
Earlier this year, National Provident said it would limit sales of its
single-premium with-profits bonds - the life industry's most successful
product in the past year - due to concern about the strain the sales were
placing on reserves.
Sir Douglas Morpath, chairman of Clerical Medical, would only say there had
been widespread speculation about the deal.
However, he said Clerical Medical 'has been discussing business combinations
with various parties for some time.'
Last January, Clerical Medical said it would provide life office
administration and investment management for a new joint venture life
insurance company 92 per cent owned by National Westminster Bank.
Sir Douglas said Clerical Medical, like other mutually owned life insurers,
would have to consider its future in the face of growing competition from
Europe and the need to raise capital for expansion.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Arts: Mercy for Holmwood - Architecture / Colin Amery pleads
the cause to save Alexander Thomson's greatest domestic building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817-75) was a leading architect in Glasgow in
the middle years of the 19th century. He worked mainly in his own version of
the neo-classical style which time has shown to be, not only extremely
original, but also of considerable European significance.
Although he is a very remarkable product of Scotland, in many ways Alexander
Thomson is a forgotten architect. He never travelled outside the British
Isles and remained very insular as a character. Yet his architectural
achievements, which are confined to Glasgow and its immediate surroundings,
are of the highest imaginative quality.
Thomson, in his original interpretations and developments of classicism,
reminds me of Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736), another insular non-traveller.
What Hawksmoor and Thomson have in common is their own imaginative
interpretation of the Ancient Classical world.
So Thomson is an architect who should not be forgotten. I have written
before about the important work of The Alexander Thomson Society, which was
recently founded by Dr Gavin Stamp and others in Glasgow. This Society now
has an urgent case on its hands. It has already done sterling work in its
campaign to make the work of Thomson at least as familiar as that of Charles
Rennie Mackintosh - Glasgow's other much praised native architectural son.
The urgent case they are now quite rightly promoting is that of Holmwood,
the finest house designed by Thomson.
Holmwood is a villa set in a Loudonesque sylvan setting. It stands on the
southern edge of the city of Glasgow, next to a scenic bend on the river
Cart. It is a Grade 'A' listed building and is, to my eye, one of the most
original neo-classical villas in the world.
It is almost in the same league as the Court Gardener's House in Potsdam by
Karl Friedrich von Schinkel - but possibly even more original and daring. We
know that Thomson was much influenced by Schinkel and that he possessed the
engravings of much of Schinkel's work. Thomson built Holmwood in 1857-58,
after his famous Double Villa and none of his subsequent domestic work is of
such interest.
In 1958 Holmwood was purchased by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions,
who erected school buildings on land behind the house. The convent school
closed last year and the Alexander Thomson Society started to campaign for
the house to be acquired for the public realm and restored and opened.
The National Trust for Scotland immediately saw the point of the house, both
as an important aesthetic monument and as a very positive addition to its
architectural portfolio.
There are still some handicaps to be overcome. In 1990 a property developer,
the Carvill Group (UK), acquired an option to purchase the whole Holmwood
site, subject to securing planning permission to build in the grounds. This
unwise and unfortunate situation has led to elaborate negotiations between
the developer, The National Trust for Scotland, Historic Scotland, and the
Planners of Glasgow District Council to find a compromise solution that will
allow the house to be preserved with as little intrusive development as
possible.
The debate about planning consent naturally affects the value of the house
to the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions and the need to debate the
planning consents adds the risk of lengthy delays. So the situation is
urgent. Vandalism has already begun - the empty school buildings have been
set on fire and the Sisters are having to employ security guards at
considerable expense.
The National Trust for Scotland is hoping to make a decision about acquiring
and restoring Holmwood early in October. The National Heritage Memorial
Fund, under its energetic new chairman, Lord Rothschild, has already visited
Holmwood and shown considerable interest and willingness to help.
There is an urgent need for a final push by all the parties concerned to
reach a sensible deal that is not based only on commercial considerations.
There is enormous goodwill in the air - perhaps greater public awareness at
this stage will help to force some conclusive action.
What is so special about Holmwood? It represents the peak of Thomson's
domestic invention. It is a pioneering and creative piece of architecture
that is moving and beautiful to see. In its strange abstraction it points
towards much modern architecture and to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright.
All this ingenuity comes from an architect who was a practising Grecian at
the same time as Scott, Pugin and Ruskin were preaching their Gothic
triumphs.
His churches in Glasgow - the Caledonian Road Church and the Vincent Street
Churches - are even more remarkable, bringing Egyptian and Indian elements
into their designs. One is a burnt ruin and the other is worryingly insecure
 -both belong to the City council.
Holmwood should be the turning point for the public appreciation of 'Greek'
Thomson, a European creative genius yet to be fully recognised.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Islamic venture fund plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO raise a Dollars 400m (Pounds 224.5m) venture capital fund to make
investments according to Islamic doctrine have been launched.
The First Islamic Venture Capital Company is offering up to 40m shares at
Dollars 10 each. The company intends to invest in established, profitable
enterprises in Europe and the Islamic world, although some of its
investments in Islamic countries will be in infrastructure projects such as
roads and bridges, which will make a lower return.
This is believed to be the first time that a specifically Islamic or ethical
fund has been launched. The fund will not make investments that produce
interest or rents, nor will it back banks, finance houses, breweries,
casinos or tobacco companies. It is designed to appeal to Moslem investors
and others seeking an ethical investment.
Up to 40 per cent of the fund's assets will be invested in Islamic
countries, and at least 30 per cent in Europe. The remaining 30 per cent
will be invested in international equities to provide liquidity and income.
Within the ethical code, investments will be made on a commercial basis. The
fund expects to make between 10 and 30 investments, according to Mr Derek
Bartlett of City Financial Asset Management, which will manage the fund's
liquid assets.
First Islamic takes the form of a close-ended investment company - it will
stop issuing shares once its agreed capital is reached - incorporated in the
Isle of Man. It will have an expected life of about 18 years, after which
time it plans to go into voluntary liquidation.
Piper Investment Management, which has a venture capital fund specialising
in the retail sector, will manage the European portfolio, while the Mohammed
Group, with interests in housing, industrial, agricultural and media
projects, will advise on marketing in Islamic countries.
The offer period for the shares closes on October 9.

FT  21 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's news that Midland Bank plans to offer customers venture capital
through its UK branches may have sent shivers of apprehension through the
shareholders of HSBC. Have not most of the UK clearers in some form tried -
and failed - over the last 15 years to supply equity to smaller businesses?
And even if it could hardly happen on a Latin American scale, could this
latest initiative not be another recipe for losing heroic sums of investors'
money?
It is right to be sceptical, but it is worth bearing in mind that there is
an urgent demand for this form of finance. The venture capital industry -
much of it imported from the US - took the UK by storm in the last recession
and raised huge sums of money from institutions eager to invest in smaller
companies.
The fact remains, however, that owing to the high fixed costs of each
transaction and the prospect of juicier returns most UK funds are only
interested in sizeable management buy-outs or development capital deals in
the Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 1m range. Unfashionable as it may be to say so,
the equity gap for businesses seeking Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 250,000 is
alive and well.
In theory, the banks should be ideally placed to help given their nationwide
networks and large balance sheets. But in practice - best illustrated by the
rise and fall of National Westminster's Growth Options initiative - bankers
themselves have not made good venture capitalists. On top of this, it has
proved difficult in practice to identify the good propositions, without
damaging traditional banking relationships and alienating managers in the
field. Midland's centrally-based team of professional venture capitalists -
working through the corporate banking centres which in common with its peers
it has established over the last decade - is another attempt to find the
solution. The risks remain, but in theory the service should be more cost
effective than say 3i. Midland is at least addressing the problem that many
small business loans at this stage in the cycle are de facto equity without
the upside. The prize for any bank getting it right will be a lucrative one.

FT  21 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK oil shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's fall against the dollar has brought some relief to oil shares.
While few expected the pound to stay at Dollars 2, the fact that oil
companies' revenues are mostly priced in dollars has caused discomfort. But
for the largest UK oil firms, BP and Shell, the effect is muted. These oil
majors are largely dollar-based stocks with dollar assets and borrowings;
which leaves the translation of profits into sterling as the real problem.
The geographical spread of the large companies also helps insulate them from
dollar movements, with refining and chemicals operations often priced in
local currencies. Since early September when the pound was at Dollars 2,
Shell's shares have risen by 14 per cent and BP is up only 10 per cent.
The currency effect is much more marked in the exploration and production
stocks, especially those operating in the North Sea. These have dollar
revenues and sterling costs. Their margins were being badly squeezed as the
dollar fell during the summer. The 29 per cent rise in Enterprise Oil's
shares to 401p in the past two weeks is some measure of the relief.
But the oil market remains difficult. With western economies still in
recession, demand for oil is unlikely to rise, while extra supply will come
on stream over the next year. Doubts about the level of Opec's production
targets and its ability to stick to them may prevent the oil price rising
much above Dollars 20 a barrel. With refining and petrochemical profit
margins still poor, it will take more than a stronger dollar to push oil
shares much higher.

FT  21 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: The system under strain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before French voters went to the polls yesterday, it was clear that the
ERM as we have come to know it was blown. From the moment of Italy's
devaluation a week ago, faith in the system's ability to deliver quasi-fixed
exchange rates was shattered. What was perhaps unexpected was the tidal wave
of speculation that swamped even well-armed central banks. The Bundesbank's
admission that it has spent DM60bn in intervention during the recent turmoil
is a rude reminder of the scale of short-term capital flows in a world
largely free of exchange controls. It is sheer fantasy to assume those
controls can be resurrected. The markets have proved they can win, and win
quite easily. No referendum result could have changed that.
Had France voted No, the franc would almost certainly have come under
excruciating pressure. As it is the Yes vote may buy some calm, but it is
disturbingly slim and there is other unfinished business: Italy's attempt to
re-enter the system, pressure on the peseta, Danish krone, and Irish punt.
Maybe the answer will yet be for Europe to split in two with the Benelux
countries and, now, France as well as Denmark congregating round Germany.
Countries in the slow lane would offer higher growth and higher inflation,
but at a price of heightened currency risk. Investors would have to be more
nimble than before.
The question is whether Europe's leaders would be prepared to ignore the
political consequences of such a split. There must be some relief that
France looks set to stay in the fast lane, but a two-speed Europe still
represents a serious setback. Besides, the scale of international capital
flows makes it hard for small countries to go it alone, even when like
Denmark and Ireland they could point to economic fundamentals better than
those of Germany. The chances are the politicians will want to preserve the
system as best they can. One more reshuffle of the lesser currencies might
bring stability for a while, but the markets would judge its credibility on
the degree of genuine policy cooperation that followed. That would mean the
Bundesbank cutting interest rates, even if this still goes against the
monetarist grain.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Serb fighting undermines aid effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S Serb forces yesterday stepped up their attempts to gain control of
the main routes into Sarajevo, the capital, in an offensive aimed at
consolidating their positions before winter.
The international aid operation could be undermined, if Serb forces, led by
Mr Radovan Karadzic, gain the suburb of Stup, western diplomats said
yesterday. This would allow Serb forces to control a strategic route linking
the airport to the city, and one of the main western road routes used by the
aid convoys.
'This means that no matter what agreements are signed in Geneva, the Serbs,
who are working hand-in-glove with Croatian forces in Bosnia, will be able
to intimidate the aid convoys at any time, and will be able to maintain the
pressure on forces loyal to the Bosnian government,' a western diplomat in
Belgrade said yesterday.
The Serb offensive coincided with new efforts by the United Nations High
Commission on Refugees to resume humanitarian aid operations to the city.
All flights were suspended after an Italian aid aeroplane was shot down over
Croatian-held territory on September 3.
In Sarajevo, the presidency building in the centre was alight with flames
after heavy mortar attacks aimed from Serb-held areas on the hills around
the city.
Despite the heavy fighting an aeroplane carrying General Philippe Morillon
and other senior UN officers, landed safely in the capital to start
preparations for expanding the UN humanitarian relief operation in the
republic.
The current UN forces of 1,500, based in Sarajevo, will be increased by
6,000. They will then be deployed in four other cities in Bosnia to protect
UNHCR aid convoys. But the success of the relief operation will depend on
gaining secure access to the airport and its routes into Sarajevo.
The Serb offensive, launched against Stup last week, confirmed that Mr
Karadzic had not placed all his artillery under UN monitoring, despite his
promises. The bombardment of Stup, and the continuous shelling of Sarajevo
indicated that Serb forces retained large quantities of heavy ammunition.
A statement issued by the Bosnian government said 53 people were killed and
285 wounded in fighting throughout the republic during the weekend.
More than 10,000 people have died over the past nine months in fighting in
the republic which broke out before the European Community recognised

FT  21 SEP 92 / Sweden unveils rescue package: All parties back plans to
save Skr28bn through benefit cuts and tax rises

SWEDEN'S minority coalition government last night agreed an emergency
economic package with the Social Democratic opposition to try to convince
international financial markets that its currency will not be devalued.
The wide-ranging package involves sweeping cuts in state benefits and tax
increases. The measures will lead to a total reduction in the budget deficit
of SKr28bn (Pounds 2.9bn) next year - around 2 per cent of the country's
gross national product.
The all-party agreement involves further budget cuts and tax increases over
the next five years to 1997 when government savings are expected to total
Skr40.6bn.
The party leaders hope this will be enough to calm the markets and enable
Sweden's central bank to cut the current overnight 500 per cent interest
rate on lending to the banks.
There is no question of the Social Democrats joining the centre-right
government in any grand coalition, but the party will use its votes in
parliament to back the details of the agreement as they come into force.
In a joint statement the two sides said they supported fully Sweden's fixed
exchange rate policy and the tough financial measures needed to maintain it.
Under the benefit cuts, old age pensions will be reduced, child benefit
increases will be postponed and the introduction of family allowance will be
abandoned. Sickness benefits and foreign aid will also be cut.
Many of the government's cherished economic plans are to be dropped or
postponed. The privatisation of state industries will be delayed and the
promised abolition of the wealth tax has been deferred by a year. The
scrapping of the tax on capital, previously planned for this autumn, will be
postponed for two years. Taxes will rise on petrol and tobacco.
Both government and opposition have accepted unpopular measures in an effort
to keep unemployment down.
In the longer term the two sides have agreed on a radical transformation of
the way the Swedish welfare state is financed. The biggest change will
involve shifting the funding of the health insurance system by the middle of
the 1990s from the state to both sides of industry.
Last night Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, and the other party leaders in
the coalition, as well as Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democrat leader,
held a joint press conference to present the unprecedented peacetime
agreement. All party leaders stressed the extraordinary circumstances that
had forced them to bury their differences in the wider national interest.
They hoped the agreement would the markets after three weeks of
unprecedented turbulence and bring stability back to the economy.
Politically the agreement has enormous significance. It is precisely one
year ago that the Social Democrats lost the general election. Now the party
can claim to have played a vital part in saving the economy from collapse
although at the price of sacrificing many of its welfare spending plans.
For Mr Bildt's four-party coalition the events of recent days have shaken
its confidence. There appears to be no question of its resignation but the
abandonment or delay of large parts of its free market programme is bound to
arouse discontent among its supporters.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (10): Hackles rise over sell-offs
 -Unions say privatisations will hit the consumer in the pocket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM FLANAGAN

<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION reached Northern Ireland later than it did the rest of
Britain. The process of transferring government-owned companies and public
utilities to the private sector only got going just over three years ago.
The management-employee buy-out of Harland and Wolff, the Belfast
shipbuilder and the sale of aircraft and missiles manufacturer Short
Brothers to Bombardier, Canadian transportation giant, signalled the start
of privatisation in earnest. In spite of fierce trade union opposition, the
sales were completed and saved the UK government from paying substantial
annual subsidies to keep the businesses afloat.
While privatised companies have not had it easy since then, Harland has a
reasonably healthy order book and Shorts, the region's largest private
company, was profitable enough two years ago to enable a dividend to be paid
on shares for the first time in years.
Successful transfers to the private sector encouraged the government to
press on with its timetable.
The first part of the privatisation of the electricity industry was
completed with the sale of the province's four power stations to British
Gas, NIGEN (an American/Belgian consortium) and a management-employee
buy-out team.
However, completing the flotation will not be so easy. Last week Mr Robert
Atkins, the province's economy minister, unexpectedly announced that the
flotation of the transmission, distribution and supply business of Northern
Ireland Electricity (NIE) - planned for November - would be postponed. Mr
Atkins said a number of outstanding matters needed to be resolved, the most
important of which related to the funding of a proposed interconnector to
Scotland. NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m
interconnector project earlier this year, and the government is believed to
be seeking about Pounds 70m from the European Commission towards the cost of
construction.
Unions argue that, as well as leading to large scale redundancies, the sale
will hit consumers in the pocket. The Federation of Unions Supplying
Electricity believes the provision of an efficient service will be secondary
to the requirement to keep shareholders happy by making profits.
The government dismisses such fears and says legisation will be introduced
to protect consumers.
While the power industry sell-off is almost complete, another project in its
early stages is already causing concern. The privatisation of water and
sewerage services in Northern Ireland has set alarm bells ringing, although
it is not taking place for another three years. Opponents point to
experience elsewhere in the UK where bills have been rising.
Two months ago, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, revealed
that the government was dispensing with a plan to transfer the Department of
the Environment's water and sewerage functions to a government-owned company
before privatisation. The new proposal will take the services directly into
the private sector in 1995/96, earlier than would otherwise have been the
case.
A customer billing system for water and sewerage will have to be introduced.
Since domestic water charges are currently included in rates charges in
Northern Ireland, the changes mean the calculation of the regional rate will
have to be adjusted.
The Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) which represents 1,200
employees in the water industry, is angry at the sell-off proposals.
Mr Sid McDowell, NIPSA deputy general secretary, said: 'Experience in
England clearly shows that farming, industry and other commercial interests
will face substantial increases in water charges. Northern Ireland will
suffer those charges over a much shorter timescale than in England.'
One of the big concerns is just who will pay the Pounds 500m being spent in
the province over the next eight years to bring Ulster's water and sewerage
facilities up to EC standards. Mr McDowell has no doubts about where the
money will come from: 'Years of failing to invest in the water industry
means that the vast amounts of money needed to make good that negligence
will now be found by privatising and shifting the burden from the taxpayer
to the consumer.'
The General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland has called for a system of
strict, independent regulation.
Several other privatisations are in the pipeline. Northern Ireland Airports,
which runs Belfast International Airport, is to be transferred to the
private sector and a study has been commissioned on introducing a private
element into the management and operation of Northern Ireland Railways -
either in its entirety or on certain routes.
Legislation on compulsory competition tendering is also to be introduced
affecting all 26 of Northern Ireland local authorities. Councils will have
to put out to tender their main services, such as refuse collecting and
street cleaning. Again the unions say the cost will be a poorer service and
job losses as companies vie for the work by under-cutting each other.
In spite of the oppositon, however, there seems little chance of turning
back the tide of privatisation. As one senior civil servant put it: 'The
philosophy is enshrined in government policy. The sales will continue and
the question is no longer whether to move to the private sector but how.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (8): Breaking out of isolation -
Transport and Telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM FLANAGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland has moved transport and telecommunications rapidly up its
economic agenda. There are pressing reasons for it to do so.
As well as its peripheral position within Europe, the EC's commitment to
creating new transport links between Europe and the Republic of Ireland -
the only country not joined to the EC by road or rail - after the opening of
the Channel Tunnel will have important effects on the province's ports,
particularly Larne, Ireland's main roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) harbour.
About a quarter of Larne's freight traffic either comes from or is going to
the Republic of Ireland.
The short crossing to Scotland - from Larne and Cairnryan - is the favoured
route of road hauliers heading for the rest of Britain and on to Europe.
A General Consumer Council report, written last year by transport studies
professor Austin Smyth from the University of Ulster, suggested that
improvements to the region's transport system should be viewed in a Irish
single market context.
'Pursuit of the local interest in either Northern Ireland or Eire will only
reinforce our problems of relative accessibility,' Professor Smyth says.
The report made a number of recommendations aimed at countering
perpherality. Professor Smyth's suggestions include more direct air services
from the province to continental destinations, the upgrading of the A75 from
Stranraer to the M6 to improve travelling times to England and continued
improvements to Ulster's ports allowing them to maintain their competitive
edge.
Another recommendation - the use of high-speed catamarans - has become a
reality with the introduction of the 90-minute SeaCat Belfast to Stranraer
service in June.
Hoverspeed, the Seacat operator, says passenger numbers are ahead of
schedule and claims Belfast traders have benefitted from an increase in
Scottish visitors.
Increased trade is one of the most important factors behind the drive to
improve cross-border transport.
In 1991, Belfast Port had a record trading year with a 6 per cent increase,
bringing the total number of goods handled to 9.4m tonnes.
About 50 per cent of the port's total throughput is now accounted for by
ro-ro and lift-on, lift-off container traffic.
The increase came as a result of the addition of a third ship on the Belfast
to Heysham service, the decision by Railfreight Distribution to channel all
its Irish container traffic through Belfast and the introduction of a new
Belfast to Liverpool ro-ro service.
European links have also been strengthened by the introduction of a new
container service to Le Havre and the provision of large ships on the
Rotterdam and Oslo routes.
More than 55 per cent of Ulster's seaborne trade is now shipped through
Belfast Port, which is undergoing a 10-year capital expenditure programme of
over Pounds 100m, aided by EC grants.
Measures, it would seem, are having some success. Last year, the Department
of the Environment's digest of statistics summarising transport trends in
the province found domestic freight on Ulster roads  - regarded as one of
the least congested systems in the UK - had increased by 77 per cent between
1987 and 1990.
The report also said transport at Northern Ireland Airports, which runs
Belfast International Airport and which has invested heavily in the airport,
had increased by 20 per cent - scheduled and chartered movements growing by
19 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.
Between 1985 and 1990, Belfast City Airport had the highest growth rate in
Britain in terms of terminal passengers.
The Northern Ireland Centre in Europe - the province's gateway to the
European Commission - has been lobbying hard for a Brussels-Belfast air
link.
Work in progress includes the building of Belfast's new cross-harbour road
and rail bridges which will significantly reduce travelling times between
the north and south of Ireland.
The Commission has also been involved in a study into the costs of upgrading
the main Belfast to Dublin rail line.
The modernisation of the line, which should lead to faster journeys between
the capital cities, will cost over Pounds 65m.
Although Northern Ireland had one of its worst ever years for inward
investment last year, the province received 130 first-time visits by
companies interested in investing in Europe.
One of the main attractions for such potential investors in Northern Ireland
is the province's telecommunications network - one of the EC's most
advanced.
Over the past five years British Telecom has invested around Pounds 200m in
the local telecommunications infrastructure.
In addition to the computerisation of the province's telephone exchanges,
the European Commission has invested Pounds 7.25m under its Special Telecoms
Action for Regional Development (Star) programme, designed to help Objective
One regions - those most in need - to improve communications links.
The result has been the completion of a world-leading fibre-optic
telecommunications infrastructure linking even the more remote areas of the
province.
The existence of such an advanced network has had an important effect on the
local economy. With distance eliminated, work can be carried out far from
its original source. This has led, for instance, to London directory inquiry
calls being answered in Northern Ireland and Ulster civil servants working
on social services claims from the Home Counties.
This has meant the creation of jobs. Of the 430 jobs lobbied for by the
Industrial Development Board last year, 350 were such 'back office' posts
which did not require public financial assistance. Figures for 1990/91 are
even more striking, with over 1,000 jobs created involving investment of
Pounds 25m in buildings and equipment and Pounds 10m in wages.
In July, Mercury Communications landed its telecommunications cable in
Northern Ireland. Mercury has spent the past five months installing
underground cables to make the final link-up from Northern Ireland to the
rest of Britain. The cable has been laid via the Isle of Man where there is
a repeater unit boosting the telecommunications' signals to or from the
province.
In spite of recent transport and telecommunications advances, local business
people are aware of the difficulties posed by geographic isolation - they
have had to live with the additional costs for years.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (9): Sleeping with strangers -
Co-operation North aims to bridge the social and cultural gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROBABLE reaction of a Catholic teenager from Dublin being asked if he or
she would like to spend a fun weekend in a Loyalist area of Belfast would
be: 'Thanks. I'd rather a have week in Sarajevo.' A similar reaction might
come from a Protestant youth being encouraged to spend a weekend on the
Falls Road.
Nonetheless, increasing numbers of teenagers, in Northern Ireland and in the
Republic, are being asked to surrender the security of their own communities
for a few days and live with a family in the 'enemy' camp, in a programme of
school and youth exchanges promoted by an organisation known as Co-operation
North.
Established in 1979, by a group of leaders in business, trade unions and
academic life on both sides of the border, the non-denominational body
defines its mission as: 'To change attitudes by promoting practical
co-operation between the people of Ireland, North and South, so that people
respect each others' traditions and achieve greater levels of economic,
social and cultural co-operation.'
In 1986, the schools and youth exchange programmes were initiated, and
10,000 teenagers each year are now involved in sporting, school and cultural
projects in which Catholics and Protestants mix and learn to overcome some
of the prejudices they have grown up with.
Such a programme would not seem extraordinary, or even necessary on the
British mainland. But in Ulster - where Catholic neighbourhoods are often
separated from Protestant neighbourhoods by high fences or corrugated iron
walls and where most children go to a school of their own faith - there is
an all-too-clear need for such an initiative.
Co-operation North sees its role as falling into the category of 'Track-two
diplomacy', a term coined by two US academics in the early 1980s in a study
on diplomacy and conflict resolution.
The theory is to encourage informal, unofficial contact between members of
adversarial groups in a structured and systematic way. By targeting sports
clubs, youth groups, schools and workplaces, a wide range of people in both
communities are brought together, the ultimate aim of which is gradually to
shift public opinion from being bigoted and prejudiced, to one of tolerance.
This facilitates the official 'Track-one' diplomacy, carried out by the
political leaders, who can be encouraged to take bolder initiatives at the
negotiating table if they are aware that their constituents are more likely
to be receptive to them.
In Northern Ireland's case, there is still clearly a long way to go, but
measurable progress has been achieved and efforts are being made to expand
the scope of Co-operation North's work.
An independent study commissioned recently by Co-operation North, found
that, as a result of the exchanges, attitudes did change in a positive
direction, but also noted that most of the teenagers participating in the
school exchange schemes were primarily Catholic and from middle and upper
class backgrounds.
A spokeswoman for the organisation in Dublin said: 'The study has helped us
to focus more clearly the groups we need to reach and we are now in the
process of broadening and extending our work to the more disadvantaged
communities of both denominations'.
The EC, and the British and Irish governments have strongly endorsed the
work of Co-operation North, and between them provide around 25 per cent of
the organisation's annual Pounds 1.5m budget.
In its last annual report, Co-operation North noted that 'to attain the
critical mass estimated as necessary to achieve a large-scale impact on the
situation, Co-operation North believes that its required annual budget would
need to be Pounds 2.5m. It is quite clear that the organisation will have to
move from an annual fund-raising strategy to the establishment of an
endowment fund and more permanent funding arrangements with its
institutional and corporate donors'.
The balance of the organisation's funds presently come from donations,
fund-raising activities and contributions from the International Fund for
Ireland. Most of the major corporations north and south of the border are
already supporting the organisation with regular donations.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (7): 'Brain drain' worries region
 -Britain's brightest students are using their skills on the mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM FLANAGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland produces some of the brightest academics in Britain.
However, few of them stay on to play a part in revitalising the country's
most economically depressed region.
While pupils in Northern Ireland achieve higher marks than pupils elsewhere
at A-level, one third of those who go on to higher education each year do
so, not in local universities, but in the rest of Britain.
'Many of them are our science and technology 'high fliers' and many do not
come home to pursue their careers and play their part in economic
regeneration and social progress,' Lord Grey of Naunton, Chancellor of the
University of Ulster, said at a summer graduation ceremony this year.
'This is our own 'brain drain' and is not something which Northern Ireland -
which relies so much on its indigenous human resources as opposed to mineral
wealth - can afford,' he said.
A recently qualified first class honours graduate at the ceremony summed up
his feelings: 'There is limited scope for me in Ulster. I don't particularly
want to leave the province but from a career point of view I've got little
alternative. Obtaining a degree does not guarantee me anything.'
Education standards compare favourably with those of England and Wales -
26.3 per cent of Ulster pupils achieved two or more A-levels in 1989/90
compared with 20.1 per cent in England and 17.4 per cent in Wales.
Just over 27 per cent of 18-year-olds in Northern Ireland enter higher
education compared to just over 19 per cent in the rest of Britain,
according to figures for 1990/91.
At the other end of the attainment spectrum, however, the position is
disturbing. More pupils leave school without a qualification of any kind in
Northern Ireland than in any other region of Britain.
Roman Catholic teenagers are more likely to be in such a position. A report
commissioned by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights identified
a 'significant minority' of Catholic schools where a high proportion of male
school leavers are unqualified.
The latest statistics show that almost 16 per cent of Catholics leaving have
no qualifications. Social and economic disadvantage allied to low
self-esteem have been cited as possible factors in the poor performance.
Two new Catholic schools are to be built in Belfast and Londonderry at a
cost of Pounds 8m. The schools will provide 15,000 places and will address
the shortage of places for Catholic pupils.
Education in Northern Ireland is undergoing radical change with the reforms
reflecting the particular needs of the province. The government encourages
educating Protestant and Roman Catholic children together, although it is
not policy to impose integrated schools on parents.
Several integrated schools at primary and secondary level have been set up
and more are in the pipeline but, while an important area, it remains small
in terms of total pupil enrollment.
The aim of the reform programme in Northern Ireland is to provide a system
which can raise standards and give parents a wider choice.
Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland maintains the 11-Plus tests
whereby a place in grammar or secondary school depends largely on a pupil's
performance in two of mental agility tests.
The new examination structure marks a shift towards continual assessment and
will test children at the ages of eight, 11 and 14. It means that next year
thousands of Ulster children will face a three day examination on top of the
controversial 11-Plus tests.
Primary seven pupils will be sitting new exams in English, maths and science
in February, just three months after the 11-Plus tests.
While the 1993 tests are a dummy run before they become official in the
1993/94 school year and replace the 11-Plus, educationalists have voiced
fears that, if the results of the new tests differ substantially from the
11-Plus exams, public confidence in the new system will be undermined.
While anything which does away with the pass-or-fail syndrome system of the
11-Plus will be generally welcomed, teachers unions argue that, if the
assessment is to be completed within working hours, it will be at the
expense of teaching pupils. Teachers, they say, are already overstretched,
under-valued and leaving the profession in large numbers.
But the government says the changes will help maintain Northern Ireland's
reputation for good quality education. Current education spending, at just
over Pounds 1bn a year, represents a rise of 21 per cent in real terms over
the past 10 years.
However, the IRA's campaign has thrown up added problems for many schools.
Last year the cost of criminal damage and injury claims arising from
concerted bombing attacks on commercial targets led to a moratorium on
public spending.
Although the temporary spending freeze was lifted in April, a number of
important school projects were delayed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 12m contract to design and build a main building for Nepean
Hospital, 50 kilometres west of Sydney, Australia, has been awarded to
BARCLAY MOWLEM, the Australian division of John Mowlem Construction.
The project is part of a major programme of extensions and improvements
being undertaken at Nepean Hospital, Penrith, near Sydney, which is designed
to upgrade its status to a tertiary referral and teaching hospital.
The building is in three segments, varying from two to five storeys.
Facilities will include general medical and surgical in-patient units, a
coronary care and cardiology inpatient unit, emergency and outpatients'
departments, medical imaging, endoscopy, clinical physiology and therapy
units together with social work and medical records departments. The number
of beds will rise from 300 to 400.
Construction is expected to begin in late November with the completion of
the project sheduled for June 1994. New South Wales public works department
has undertaken the conceptual design.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Water reclamation works in Leicester
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn Trent Water has awarded BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL ENGINEERING the Pounds
9.4m Abbey Sewer contract in Leicester.
The work involves driving a 6km tunnel from the water reclamation works near
the village of Wanlip on the northern outskirts of Leicester, into the heart
of the city.
Approximately half the tunnel length follows the Melton Road, which is a
busy residential and shopping street leading into the city. The other half
is through a very rural area where the tunnel passes under a canal, the
River Soar and a lake with only shallow ground cover.
The tunnel will be lined with 2.44 metre internal diameter precast concrete
bolted smoothbore segmental linings, erected within a full face tunnel
boring machine which will be used to excavate through the Mercia Mudstone
beds about 10-15 metres below the surface. The contract includes the
construction of 17 precast concrete segmental manhole shafts between 6.75
metre and 3.05 metre diameter at depths of up to 16 metres.
There is also a 370 metre length of 1.52 metre diameter tunnel and 300
metres of sewer in headings and trenches, required to connect up to existing
sewers.
Work on the 100-week project will commence by the end of October.

FT  21 SEP 92 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace on Wednesday is the big results event of the week. It is
the one chance for Mr John Cahill, the distressed group's new chairman, to
clear the decks and produce - as he has promised - a solution to the
company's regional aircraft problem.
At interim stage a year ago it unveiled a sharp plunge to pre-tax profits of
Pounds 86m (Pounds 146m) and a Pounds 432m rights issue. Whatever profits it
eked out in the first half of this year will be swamped by restructuring
costs which, on the most pessimistic forecasts, could approach Pounds 750m.
The week will bring more results from the battered construction sector. The
reported profit or loss at Tarmac tomorrow and Costain on Wednesday will be
less interesting than the news the companies might deliver on restructuring
efforts essential to their recovery.
Tarmac is likely to report an interim loss of about Pounds 14m (pre-tax
profit of Pounds 18.2m, itself a sharp decline from the previous year) and a
dividend of 2p (3p). Provisions are likely on the value of its landbank and
for restructuring costs.
Costain might make a minimal profit of around Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 5.7m) but
it too needs to take hefty provisions. Partial flotation of its Australian
coal business has yet to be finalised but should generate a much-needed
Pounds 45m or so. But it needs more help than that and the markets will want
to hear of further restructuring plans.
Barratt Developments, the volume house builder, took its pain in 1991, with
a loss of Pounds 106m. For the year ended this past June it should report a
small profit of up to Pounds 7m and perhaps a modest dividend. It is back
under the management of Sir Lawrie Barratt, its founder, but is suffering
from the sharp margin and volume cuts of the housing market.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Economics: Good news remains elusive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STATISTICS due this week will give delegates at meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank a further reminder of
problems facing the world economy.
German money supply figures are likely to dampen any hopes of further cuts
in German interest rates. Broad money in the year to August is expected to
have grown at an annualised rate of 8.5 per cent, well outside the
Bundesbank's target range of 3 1/2 -5 1/2 per cent.
A raft of statistics on Firday are expected to confirm that the US recovery
is, at best, sluggish. And the gloomy mood in Japan will not be helped by
news of the second quarter figures for gross national product. The markets
expect GNP to have grown by a mere 0.5 per cent, compared to 4.3 per cent
previously.
UK trade figures will be watched over the next year to see whether last
week's sterling devaluation gives a boost to exports. The August visible
trade balance is expected to be Pounds 1bn, down slightly from the previous
month.
Today: Belgium, EC deputy finance ministers meet to discuss internal market;
France, Matif to open at 05.00 GMT; Australia, July housing finance (up 0.5
per cent); Canada, July retail sales.
Tomorrow: France, official referendum result announced; US, annual IMF/World
Bank meetings continue, August housing starts (1.16m), August building
permits, August Treasury budget; Japan, July personal income, July personal
consumptions expenditure, September wholesale price index, first ten days;
Canada, July wholesale trade (up 0.5 per cent), July department store sales
(up 0.5 per cent); UK, August current account (Pounds 0.8bn deficit), August
visible trade (Pounds 1bn deficit).
Wednesday: US, Federal Reserve release Tan Book for October 6 FOMC meeting,
auto sales September 11-20 (6m units); France, August trade balance
(FFr1.6bn surplus); UK, August building societies net new commitments
(Pounds 3.1bn), second quarter GDP (down 0.1 per cent on quarter, down 0.5
per cent on year); New Zealand, August trade balance.
Thursday: US, second quarter GDP (up 1.4 per cent), second quarter after tax
profits (up 1.7 per cent), initial claims for week ended September 12
(410,000), August export price index, August import price index, money
supply data for the week ended September 14.
Friday: Germany, first Bundesbank meeting after summer break; Japan, August
consumer prices index - Tokyo (up 2.1 per cent on year), excluding
perishables (up 2.2 per cent on year), nation (up 1.7 per cent on year)
excluding perishables (up 2.3 per cent on year); Australia, August motor
vehicle registrations (up 5 per cent); US, August durable goods orders (up
1.2 per cent), August existing home sales, August personal income (up 0.4
per cent), August personal consumer expenditure (up 0.2 per cent), August
bank credit; Canada, industrial production price index (up 0.1 per cent),
raw materials price index (down 0.2 per cent).
During the week: Japan, second quarter GNP (up 0.5 per cent); Germany,
August M3 (up 8.5 per cent); Netherlands, trade balance; Denmark, August
CPI; Belgium, August CPI; Italy, September CPI (up 5.4 per cent), PSBR
(L87trillion).

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Lamont launches charm
offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the bad blood of the past week it was all sweetness and light between
Britain and Germany in Washington this weekend. At Saturday's meeting of
Group of Seven finance ministers, Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the
exchequer, went out of his way to mend fences with Mr Theo Waigel, his
German counterpart.
An indication of the looming charm offensive came early in the meeting when
a UK Treasury spokesman briefed journalists, with a completely straight
face, to the effect that Mr Lamont 'was not in the business of telling
Germany to cut its interest rates'.
Later, in a post-G7 briefing, the chancellor said several times that his
observations about the economic effects of German unification or the need
for the UK and German economies to be better synchronised were not meant as
a criticism of Germany.
For their part, Mr Waigel and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
president, took the more conciliatory line with good grace. Mr Waigel
disclosed that he and Mr Lamont had talked on several occasions over the day
and agreed that their 'good personal and political contacts' would be
continued.
Before the meeting began Mr Waigel had commented on Britain's complaints of
the past week. One-sided blame for what had happened did not help matters,
Mr Waigel observed. He maintained that Germany had always taken a
constructive approach to the problems of exchange markets and stuck to the
rules of the European Monetary System.
Mr Schlesinger let slip the background to his recent fraught relations with
the chancellor. He recalled that at the informal meeting of EC finance
ministers in Bath earlier this month, Mr Lamont had pressed him four times
to say he would cut rates. He had been obliged to answer four times that he
could make no such commitment, when only once should have done.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Bonn throws full weight
behind EMS - Group of seven and IMF meetings in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY said at the weekend it would do everything to maintain the European
Monetary System in spite of last week's monetary chaos which left sterling
and the lira suspended from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, told a press conference after
Saturday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington that the EMS was a 'central
component' for achieving price stability in Europe and moving towards
economic and monetary union.
However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said it was open to
question whether the rules of the ERM had been properly observed in the
light of last week's massive intervention.
Mr Schlesinger disclosed that Germany bought DM60bn (Pounds 22.7bn) worth of
foreign currencies during the crisis in the EMS, with intervention during
one day amounting to DM35bn - mainly in support of the lira.
He was critical of the way in which ERM parities had been realigned and the
way participation of the pound and lira had been suspended. Realignments
were supposed to be carried out early and without a great public debate, he
said. This was clearly not the case with last week's events.
Tensions in the system had been allowed to build up since the last
significant realignment in 1987. For many of the other EMS countries
realignment seemed to be a 'dirty word', Mr Schlesinger added.
It remained to be seen what the effects of intervention would be on
Germany's money supply. Some funds could flow back across the foreign
exchanges, easing pressure.
While he said the Bundesbank's goal of maintaining price stability would be
easier to achieve after the EMS changes, Mr Schlesinger - and Mr Waigel -
made clear there would be no early cuts in German interest rates.
He said the discussion on German rates had one-sidedly focused on money
market rates. Germany's long-term rates, which were crucial for investment
decisions, were, at about 7.5 per cent, lower than elsewhere in Europe.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Yes for Delors from Merthyr
mayor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAYOR of Merthyr Tydfil was up early yesterday morning to throw his
weight behind Mr Jacques Delors and the Yes campaign.
Councillor David Jarrett did not necessarily expect to find himself a
central figure in the 11th-hour campaigning.
He and a delegation from the Welsh borough's Labour-run council were in
Clichy, Merthyr's twin-town, to celebrate the Paris suburb's 70th
anniversary.
But at about 9.30am they were wheeled out to greet the Commission president
 -a former mayor of Clichy - as he arrived in the municipality in order to
cast his vote.
A somewhat bemused Mr Jarrett, sporting a Oui lapel-badge, admitted that he
had never met Mr Delors but added: 'He's a socialist, so I suppose we have
that in common.'
All in all, it turned out to be a good morning for socialist mayors.
Mr Gilles Catoire, the current incumbent in Clichy, could hardly contain his
excitement. Such was Mr Catoire's eagerness to please that he spoilt the
picture every television crew wanted - a stoical Commission president
emerging from the polling booth - by jumping in front of Mr Delors as he
swept back the green curtain.
Mr Delors himself appeared in buoyant mood, despite the delicate state of
Community politics.
Voter number 269 joked with cameramen, gave two relaxed interviews in
English to British television crews and dutifully posed in front of Oui
posters outside the mairie, or town hall.
But behind the bravado and bonhomie, there was no mistaking Mr Delors'
distress at the apparent collapse of monetary and political consensus in the
Community.
'It will be very difficult after the events of this week to find a quick
solution so that we can continue the construction of Europe,' the Commission
president said.
Irrespective of the French vote, the Maastricht Treaty would probably have
to be renegotiated to accommodate the Danes, he added. It was a flexible
document, not a rigid text - the real difficulty would be guessing which
parts of the treaty opponents had rejected.
As for Mr Delors' personal stake in the outcome of the referendum, the
Commission president confirmed again that a No would prompt his resignation.
If necessary, he would 'continue the struggle' from outside the Brussels
bureaucracy, he said, through trade unions and professional organisations.
If he remained, then one of the Commission's first jobs would be to
'reconcile the Germans and British', whose increasingly angry exchanges over
last week's currency crisis risk tainting future Community co-operation.
Meanwhile, in the Bar de la Mairie, across the square from Clichy's town
hall, the personal fate of the Commission president seemed of little import
to locals taking a break from the Sunday market. 'Yes or No, whether they
devalue the franc or not, nothing much will change,' muttered one
broken-nosed businessman.
As the presidential entourage departed - taking Mr Delors to his Paris
pied-a-terre for a nervous few hours awaiting the results - the bar's
customers scarcely looked up from their breakfast glasses of kir and muscat:
just another ex-mayor en route to his destiny.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Mitterrand risks the path of
direct democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE referendum has been an ambiguous and sometimes dangerous weapon for
French presidents throughout the 34 years of the fifth republic.
Few of them have been able to resist the temptation to appeal directly to
the people, for a mixture of reasons: to enforce their own legitimacy,
confound their political enemies or simply to get a firm decision on an
important national issue.
Yesterday's poll was the seventh referendum during the current French
constitution and the second called by Mr Franc'ois Mitterrand. Technically,
it was the least necessary of all of them.
Mr Mitterrand would have been constitutionally entitled to leave it to
parliament to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. Indeed, parliament did ratify
the treaty last June.
Several of the president's government ministers were horrified when he said
he would seek a popular vote. They knew it could backfire and turn into a
vote against the declining popularity of Mr Mitterrand and his party, rather
than a rational decision on Europe. Mr Mitterrand's argument was that French
ratification would be worthless without a public debate.
Previous referendums have made the risks of direct democracy in France only
too clear. Low turnouts have produced distorted results and it has sometimes
proved difficult for the electorate to separate the question from the
questioner.
General de Gaulle is the classic example. He was master of the art, calling
no fewer than five referendums. Most were on issues which already commanded
public support and so appeared a safe way of bolstering his personal
legitimacy. On each occasion, Gen de Gaulle warned the electorate that he
would resign if there was a No vote, in contrast to Mr Mitterrand, who has
kept his options open and begged voters not to use the referendum as a
presidential plebiscite.
In the end, Gen de Gaulle fell into his own trap and resigned after a 1969
vote on decentralisation and reform of the senate, the upper house of
parliament.
Mr Mitterrand has tried to avoid the same fate by asking the electorate to
wait until elections next March to vote on the Socialists' record.
Gen de Gaulle claimed that the referendum was the cleanest and most honest
democratic practice possible, pointing to the 1789 declaration on the rights
of man, which speaks of citizens' rights to take a personal part in the
formation of laws. His critics argued that he used referendums partly to go
over the head of parliament, an institution he never really respected.
Since 1969, French presidents have been more or less keen to use
referendums. Mr Georges Pompidou called a referendum only once, in 1972, to
ratify the entry into the European Community of Britain, Ireland, Denmark
and Norway. (Oslo later withdrew its application, as the result of another
referendum which backfired famously.)
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing steered clear of referendums altogether during
his presidency from 1974 to 1981. It was Mr Mitterrand who reintroduced the
practice, with a poll in 1988 on a new statute for New Caledonia, a French
overseas territory. Not surprisingly, this obscure question produced a bored
response, with a turnout of barely 37 per cent.
Perhaps it was a sign that the French electorate had started to lose the old
feeling that every referendum was a vote for or against the president.
Even so, polls taken during the Maastricht campaign indicate that last
night's result will have been the outcome of a complex mixture of French
feeling about Maastricht, about Europe generally and about Mr Mitterrand
personally.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Turmoil alters Japan's view
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE turmoil in Europe's foreign exchange markets last week, combined with
uncertainty about European political union, could have a lasting impact on
Japanese perceptions of the EC.
Japanese financiers, industrialists and policymakers have two main concerns.
The first is that the US dollar will soon be sucked into the turmoil. That
would drag in the yen.
A depreciation of the dollar could put Japan on the spot. The Bank of Japan
has set itself against further interest rate cuts unless they are needed to
stimulate the domestic economy.
However, with the dollar falling, Japan could come under pressure to cut
interest rates to help stabilise the US currency, according to Mr Yukio
Yanbe, the DKB Research Institute's chief economist.
He said: 'If the dollar weakens a wider adjustment will be necessary to
prevent the dollar falling too far. Some Japanese monetary easing probably
will be necessary if the French vote against Maastricht.'
The second concern is about the shadow cast over prospects for European
integration. The last week could have marked a big shift in Japan's
uncertain attitude towards the EC.
The Japanese are torn about European integration. They are impressed by the
ambition of the project and attracted by the commercial opportunities.
Yet they also regard it with suspicion, as an economic fortress in the
making. They distrust the grander political ambitions for a unified Europe
which could foster protectionism and bureaucracy.
The last week is likely to have made the Japanese both more cautious and yet
more confident in their approach to the EC.
The Japanese would be most alarmed by any signs of fragmentation within the
EC as this could undermine the rationale for much of the costly
manufacturing investment Japanese manufacturers have made in Europe to take
advantage of the single market.
A two speed Europe, still committed to a form of integration, would be less
worrying.
In the long run Japanese policymakers would probably welcome a slowing of
the pace towards political and social integration in Europe.
Indeed in some quarters there is a thinly disguised air of satisfaction over
the troubles besetting the treaty.
As the Asahi Shimbun put it in an editorial last week: 'The treaty was a
product of convoluted compromises for patching things up, hastily cobbled
together by leaders of the EC. The concern at the grass roots is the price
to be paid for such a jerry-built treaty.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: A right to hunt ring doves -
William Dawkins dreams up an offbeat European treaty designed to suit all
tastes and circumstances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S hyper-efficient public administration has a plan for every
contingency.
The boffins from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration have devised a secret
counter-treaty. Its sole purpose is to satisfy every possible objection
floated by all sides of the French public and as such is only a basis for
negotiation. An executive summary has mysteriously come into our hands.
Article 1:
Subsidiarity. As stated in the original treaty, the European Community shall
cease to have any powers in matters where national decision-making is most
appropriate. But it shall mind its own business with especial care in the
following specific areas. This list can be unilaterally expanded - but not
shortened - by any member state: Foods. Cheap lamb, beef and pate de foie
from eastern Europe can be kept out according to individual governments'
wills. Free pan-Community market access guaranteed for all EC-made
unpasteurised cheeses known to the Prince of Wales, wines and perfumes.
Sports. The right to hunt ring doves and other small birds across internal
frontiers is guaranteed.
Article 2.
Monetary Union.
Single currency programme to take place as envisaged, but the new currency
will be called the Francfort and will circulate in parallel with all
existing EC currencies.
Central European Bank. It will be fully independent from market forces. This
is to be a largely ceremonial institution, based in Lyons, at the heart of
Europe. The bank's duty will be to promulgate monetary and economic policies
decided by European Community finance ministers, on a unanimous vote only.
Article 3:
Security co-operation.
Member states shall make their own arrangements over immigration. Visas will
be issued by individual member states and apply to the country of issue
only. Customs posts will be strengthened. Article 4:
The treaty shall be expanded to include these trade matters.
The Common Agriculture Policy and EC steel quota regime are to be
reinstated.
All Japanese car imports to be cleared through Peugeot headquarters in
Paris. Vehicles applying for entry to be left in convenient little
underground car park at the back, quite near the metro station. Parking fees
from FFr500 (Pounds 56) per vehicle per day. Import licences granted by
unanimous vote in the EC council of ministers.
Article 5:
Ratification.
This treaty can only come into effect on achieving a simple majority by
simultaneous referendum in all 12 member states. After ratification, any
member state can opt out of all or part of the treaty for a temporary period
or for ever if its parliament wishes.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Voters left in no doubt about
'historic choice' - One member of the French electorate explains her
referendum dilemma to Alice Rawsthorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN when Ms Marie Bertrand arrived yesterday at the entrance of her local
mairie, or town hall, in the fourth arrondissement of Paris to cast her vote
in the Maastricht referendum, she had still not decided whether it would be
Oui or Non.
'I just can't make up my mind,' she said. 'For years I've been pro-European
unity, but the Germans make me really nervous. They're too powerful. I'm
going to wait until the very last moment to decide. It's between me and the
polling booth.'
A brief glance at the weekend press on the corner news stand would have left
Ms Bertrand with no doubts about the importance of her decision. The French
newspapers, which have for weeks been swamped by articles on the merits and
demerits of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty, all emphasised the drama of the
knife-edge end to the referendum campaign.
Un choix historique - a vous de dire ('An historic choice - it's up to you')
was splashed across the front page of Le Journal de Dimanche. The weekend
edition of Le Monde was more restrained, but no less resonant, with the
headline Trente-huit millions d'electeurs francais decident de l'avenir de
l'union europeenne' ('Thirty-eight million French voters decide the future
of European union').
Voters, like Ms Bertrand, filed in and out of the fourth arrondissement town
hall throughout the day. Its facade, like that of every other mairie in
France, was covered with huge screens bearing posters from the various
political parties.
The Greens restricted themselves to a stark blue and white Oui a l'Europe.
The extreme right National Front opted for a soft focus shot of its leader,
Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, trying his hardest to look avuncular, with the slogan
Non a l'Europe. Non a Mitterrand.
The surrounding streets were littered with the pale grey vans of the CRS
riot police. Ordinary police, clad in their pale blue summer shirts, stood
around the town hall entrance. 'It's not that we're expecting trouble,' said
one. 'But we're here just in case.'
Police were stationed around all the other polling stations and political
buildings in Paris.
The National Assembly on the Quai d'Orsay was shrouded by riot barriers, as
was the Socialist party headquarters a few streets away on rue Solferino,
where Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the party, gathered in the
evening with other pro-Maastricht Socialists to hear the referendum results.
On the other side of the Seine the 20 volunteers who had turned a small
suite of offices on rue Francois Premier into the headquarters of the No
camp, spent the day preparing for an evening reception for Mr Philippe
Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, the RPR politicians who have spearheaded the
No campaign.
The volunteers will today leave rue Francois Premier and the suite will
revert to its usual role of Mr Seguin and Mr Pasqua's private offices.
The centre of Paris, usually peaceful on sunny Sundays, was packed with cars
as Parisians drove back early from their weekends on the coast or in the
country to cast their votes.
They returned to find the Oui and Non posters plastered along the main roads
freshly defaced by graffiti and bright blue European community flags
fluttering from the flagpoles of the grand hotels.
Back at the mairie of the fourth arrondissement, Ms Bertrand may have
procrastinated all the way to the ballot box but her fellow voters seemed
more decisive.
'I voted No,' said Mr Didier Proffit, a 22-year-old advertising executive.
'The French people haven't been given enough information about the
Maastricht Treaty and we haven't had long enough to consider it. In any case
it's a question of history. There are certain things the French should
treasure, like our currency. Who could treasure the Ecu?'
Mr Guy Darouste, a 59-year-old engineer, disagreed. 'The French should say
Yes to Maastricht,' he said. 'Europe is the future and we have to secure
that future for our young people. I voted Yes for my children and
grandchildren.'
'I voted Yes too,' said his wife, Christiane.
'We've been married for nearly 40 years and the Maastricht Treaty is about
the only political issue we've ever agreed on.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government has indicated it will support a referendum to amend its
territorial claim over Northern Ireland, if 'a fair and honourable
accommodation' can be reached between unionist and nationalists in the talks
on the province's future.
This could mean rewriting articles two and three of the 1937 Irish
constitution which lay claim to the 6 counties of Northern Ireland.
The round-table talks, which move to Dublin today, will be attended by the
British and Irish governments, and three of the four main constitutional
parties in Northern Ireland.
The hard-line Democratic Unionist Party said on Friday it would not send a
delegation to Dublin, arguing that the Irish government had not shown any
flexibility on its territorial claim.
However a statement to unionist leaders in Stormont last Friday by Mr David
Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, - leaked to Sunday newspapers in Dublin
and Belfast - indicates the Irish government said it was prepared to go
ahead with a referendum in the context of an overall settlement.
The statement said: 'If  .. our negotiations achieved the basis of a 'new
beginning' in the relationship between the two (nationalist and unionist)
traditions in Ireland, and if agreement on a fair and honourable
accommodation between them were to entail any constitutional consequence in
our jurisdiction, the government could approach the electorate with the hope
and prospect of a positive response'.
Mr Ken McGinnis, the deputy leader of the Official Unionist Party said: 'The
tone has modified noticeably from what we previously understood to be the
Irish government's position.'
However, Mr Sammy Wilson, a spokesman for the DUP, said the Irish
government's position was 'totally unattractive'.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Result boosts Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was last night facing growing domestic opposition to European
economic and political union as leading Conservative Euro-sceptics warned
that an attempt to push through ratification of the Maastricht accord in
Britain would prompt fierce opposition from inside the Tory party.
In spite of the welcome given by Mr Major, the prime minister, to the result
of the French referendum, the narrowness of the vote in favour of the treaty
will serve only to stoke up problems among Conservative backbenchers now
convinced that they have it in their power to ditch the accord.
The weekend also saw new tensions within the government on the timing of
re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. Some pro-European
ministers warned that Mr Major could not risk consigning Britain to the
'slow lane' of Europe by remaining outside indefinitely.
Tory Euro-sceptics are determined to fill the vacuum left by last week's
retreat from the ERM. Lady Thatcher's sharp criticism of Mr Major in a
weekend speech in Washington was echoed by several acolytes in London
yesterday, who demanded that Britain quit the ERM completely.
Mr Major, speaking last night outside Admiralty House in London, where he
has a temporary office, said there was no prospect that Britain would ratify
the Treaty until Denmark, which rejected it in a June referendum, had
clarified its position.
In a reference to sterling's ignominious departure last week from the ERM,
the prime minister said the EC leaders would have to consider the
'shortcomings' in the system.
Mr Major then added to suspicion that he remains unconvinced that Maastricht
is now back on course by warning that the special summit of European leaders
called for early next month would have to respond to the concerns of
European electorates about the pace of integrations.
'I think we do have to take account in public debate of the many concerns
that have been raised throughout the Community over recent weeks,' he said.
Responding to questions, Mr Major reaffirmed his support for the treaty but
in terms which acknowledged the growing confidence of the Euro-sceptics in
the Conservative party by saying that there was 'much' of value.
One backbencher, Mr John Townend MP, chairman of the party's finance
committee, was one among many said British voters should be allowed to
express their views.
Mr John Smith, leader of the Labour party, welcomed the outcome, saying: 'It
is positive for the future of Europe.' However the result will also fuel
difficulties for the Labour leadership which is beset with mounting
resistance to the pro-Maastricht position adopted by the former leader, Mr
Neil Kinnock, and taken up by Mr Smith.

<TEXT>
ESTONIA'S first post-Soviet presidential elections appeared headed for an
inconclusive result early today as former communist leader Arnold Ruutel
failed to win an outright majority in most areas, Reuter reports from
Tallinn.
Mr Ruutel, chairman of parliament since 1983, had captured 43.1 per cent of
the total vote based on results from 17 out of 21 cities and counties,
including the capital Tallinn, election officials said.
His nearest rival, Mr Lennart Meri, a former foreign minister and leader of
the conservative Fatherland alliance, took 29.55 per cent.
The early results suggested Mr Ruutel would fall short of the 50 per cent
plus one vote needed to become the Baltic state's first freely elected
president since emerging from half a century of Soviet rule.
This means that the new president is likely to be chosen by parliament, also
elected yesterday.
Mr Meri's Fatherland alliance was widely expected to form the biggest party
in parliament, but results of that vote will not be known until today.
Russians, who make up about a third of the country's 1.6m population, were
barred from voting because under Estonian law they have no automatic right
to citizenship.
In the presidential vote, Mr Rein Taagepera, a Californian university
professor of Estonian birth, was close behind Mr Meri with 23.52 per cent,
while National Independence Party candidate Lagle Parek took 3.83 per cent.

THE ministers and governors reaffirm the commitment made by their heads of
state and government at the Munich summit to strengthen world growth without
rekindling inflation. Since then, measures to reinforce economic recovery
have been taken, including interest rate reductions in a number of
countries, as well as the recent announcement of the Japanese stimulus
package. These measures will strengthen the global economic recovery and
foster greater stability of exchange markets.
Ministers and governors expressed concern about the recent volatility in
world financial markets. They agreed on the importance of restoring stable
and long-lasting exchange rate relationships. The ministers and governors
will continue to co-operate and to monitor closely economic and financial
conditions in their countries and will take appropriate additional actions
as needed to achieve sustained growth and greater currency stability.
The ministers and governors also met with representatives of the Russian
federation and discussed Russia's reform programme. They urged Russia to
intensify its efforts to implement comprehensive economic reform. They also
urged the World Bank to form a technical assistance support group for Russia
to discuss bilateral and multilateral technical assistance.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Stability of currencies a

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE MINISTERS from the world's leading industrial nations were last
night preparing to restore calm in case of financial market turbulence
following the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
A weekend meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers agreed to take
'appropriate additional actions as needed' to achieve currency stability.
European Community finance ministers said yesterday they were ready to bring
Japan, the US and Canada (which together with Germany, France, the UK and
Italy make up the G7) into their discussions if necessary, but said
responsibility for reacting to the French vote lay primarily with the
Europeans.
Their remarks came after a meeting of finance ministers yesterday called by
Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, in his capacity
as president of the EC finance ministers' council.
It remained unclear what additional moves had been agreed. The G7 communique
said the ministers and central bank governors expressed concern about the
recent volatility in world markets and agreed on the importance of restoring
stable relationships. They said they would 'continue to co-operate and to
monitor closely economic and financial conditions in their countries' and
act as needed 'to achieve sustained growth and greater currency stability'.
The ministers' promise of additional action provoked scepticism among some
bankers in Washington. Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank,
said it was difficult to imagine anything that could be effective, given the
size of foreign exchange markets.
With ministers aware that a public display of disagreement could further
upset financial markets, the G7 meeting was unusually harmonious. 'No one
was put in the dock,' said Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister. Mr
Lamont went out of his way afterwards to say that he was not criticising
Germany.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said he did not come under
pressure to cut interest rates.
Some of the tensions underlying economic relations among the countries
surfaced away from the G7 meeting. It is understood that in bilateral talks
with Mr Waigel, Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, repeated the
US belief that Germany should cut its interest rates to promote growth in
Europe.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Bush proposes commodity
link for currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday floated the idea of using a basket of major
commodities as an indicator of currency values and an aid to restoring
stability in the foreign exchange markets.
'We believe it can be useful in strengthening the co-ordination process to
more intensely utilise an economic indicator that compares the relationship
among our currencies and a basket of commodities including gold,' Mr Bush
said.
The idea was aired at a reception held yesterday evening at the White House
for ministers attending the annual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund.
Mr Bush emphasised that the commodity basket was just a suggestion for
improving international economic co-ordination, and could serve as 'an
independent reference point for our multilateral surveillance process'. But
the idea - especially with the inclusion of gold among the commodities -
carries an echo of the old gold standard, which pegged exchange rates up
until the 1930s.
Economists at the Federal Reserve Board, the US central bank, have pointed
out some of the difficulties involved in using commodity prices as a
reference for economic policy.
'While commodity prices contain valuable information for the policy-maker,
whether they belong at the centre of policy implementation remains to be
proven,' commented Mr Donald Kohn, director of the Fed's monetary affairs
division, at a conference three years ago.
Mr Kohn pointed out that one has to establish a target level for commodity
prices and this can be a tricky exercise; for rising or falling commodity
prices can indicate different policy responses depending on the level of
those prices.
'Ultimately, one suspects, commodity prices will take their place in that
eclectic mix of indicators that have keyed policy recently,' Mr Kohn said.
President Bush's proposal bears all the hand prints of Mr James Baker, his
chief of staff. Indeed, Mr Bush's speech was written by Mr Robert Zoellick,
one of Mr Baker's closest aides.
When Mr Baker was treasury secretary in the late 1980s, he put forward an
identical proposal to link currencies to a commodity basket, including gold.
At that time the proposal came to nothing. However, any move to link
currencies, albeit indirectly, with gold is likely to prove popular with the
right wing of the Republican party, many of whom hanker after the stability
of the gold standard of pre-first world war years. Such ideas also have a
following in the US Federal Reserve, where Mr Wayne Angell, one of the
governors, has long been an advocate of a commodity link for currencies.
It is unlikely that the idea will gain support with the main trading
partners of the US. A senior official of the Bundesbank, the German central
bank, said last night that he was sceptical about such a suggestion. One
European monetary official dismissed the notion as an election ploy.

A Somali child watches the first food aid to reach the village of

Catherine Bertini flew in yesterday to meet relief agencies that will
distribute a promised 100,000 tonnes of extra WFP food before the end of the

The start of a US airlift of 440 armed United Nations guards to the Somali

diplomat in Mogadishu said reasons for the delay were not clear but
preparations for the elaborate operation might not have been completed.
US air force aircraft are to make 21 flights into Mogadishu over the next
week to bring in the Pakistani 'blue helmets'. A vanguard of 60 troops
arrived last week and have set up camp on the edge of the derelict airport
as part of an operation to stop bandits plundering relief supplies.

FT  21 SEP 92 / US probes Jordan embargo claims
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration is investigating reports that Jordanian trading
companies are continuing to violate the United Nations embargo on Iraq by
shipping militarily useful goods across the Jordan-Iraq border to Baghdad.
Investigators in Washington say the Jordanian companies - including two
previously identified as part of Iraq's military procurement network - are
believed to be sending stocks of small arms ammunition, artillery rounds and
spare parts for the Iraqi military.
The goods are being bought in eastern Europe, shipped to Jordan and
transferred overland from Amman, according to one US official.
Included in the shipments are artillery rounds for a wide-range of mostly
Soviet-made howitzers, long-range guns, mortars and heavy anti-air guns.
Also being shipped, according to US intelligence reports, are small arms
ammunition in various calibres that can be used for machine guns,
anti-aircraft guns, sub-machine guns, side arms and rifles.
At least two US government agencies are also examining allegations that some
of the Jordanian trading companies may be financing the shipments with loans
from the Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank (GIB).
GIB, in which Iraq formerly held a 10 per cent equity stake, was a prime
commercial lender to Iraq before the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Mr
Saddam Hussein.
Since 1990 the bank, which is owned by the governments of Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has restructured its
capital and and distanced itself from Iraq.
The US investigators say they have no reason to suspect that GIB is aware
that its loans to Jordanian trading companies may be being used to violate
UN sanctions.
On Friday a GIB official said: 'To the best of GIB's knowledge it has had no
dealings with Jordanian-based companies with regard to any goods of military
value to Iraq.'
The US Department of Justice has taken the unusual step of making public a
letter from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that denies any
involvement by the CIA in the making of more than Dollars 5bn of illegal
Iraqi loans by the Atlanta, Georgia branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro (BNL).
The release of the letter, a copy of which was sent to BNL prosecutors in
Atlanta last week, appears to be an attempt by the Bush administration to
deflect allegations that it hid information about the BNL case.
The CIA letter also seeks to counter a disclosure last week in Congress that
senior officials of BNL in Rome were aware of and approved the BNL
operations.
Lawyers for Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta branch manager,
last week asked a US court to allow them to withdraw Mr Drogoul's earlier
guilty plea and approve a full-scale trial, partly on the grounds that Mr
Drogoul was in contact with US intelligence officials and had in any case
been given approval for the Iraqi loans by BNL's head office in Rome.
BNL's Rome office has denied it was involved in the Atlanta scheme.

FT  21 SEP 92 / East's pollution 'threat to Germany's targets'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent

<TEXT>
THE former East German states are a huge obstacle to German environmental
plans, according to Mr Klaus Topfer, environmental minister.
He told the Financial Times Germany had 'a hell of a job' to meet
environmental targets on reducing the emission of carbon gases announced by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the Earth Summit in Rio in June.
He said a carbon tax to help cut those emissions 'is absolutely necessary -
and very soon. Germany cannot meet the targets without it.' Germany has said
that it plans to cut emission of carbon dioxide by 25-30 per cent by 2005
compared to 1987 levels.
However, he admitted that 'the German government's position is in favour of
a tax, but parts of German business are against it'.
East Germany was emitting roughly twice as much carbon dioxide per head of
population as the west, because of its use of lignite fuel. He also expected
the number of cars in the former east Germany to double to the west's level
of one car for every two people.
Mr Topfer added that he supported the plans of the UK environment minister,
Mr Michael Howard, for more vigorous enforcement of EC environmental policy
but that the methods chosen could still pose problems for German federal
structure.
'We would have a problem with a central green police,' he said. However he
added that enforcement 'is vital for the credibility of the community and
for environmental department'.

<TEXT>
Churchill once said 'one vote is enough'. The same applies to the narrow Yes
win in the French referendum. It does not clear up all the doubts about the
ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The Danes have to be squared. And
British MPs - now in one of their least attractive xenophobic moods - need
to be calmed; or some alternative way found of carrying on without the UK.
At an immediate financial level, a powerful effort will obviously be made to
shore up the exchange rate mechanism. One lesson, which should have been
reinforced by recent events, is that half-way houses between fixed and
floating rates - like the original ERM or Bretton Woods - are only
transitional. They either harden into rigidly fixed exchange rates - a
common currency in all but the convenience - or they break down into some
kind of 'dirty' floating.
ERM members would be well advised to press ahead with maximum speed to
monetary union. Many of the moves, such as locking the French and German
parities together, can be taken at central bank and finance ministry level.
Also, the Bundesbank will have to recognise that it can no longer behave
like a purely provincial organisation, but is now the central bank for at
least the inner core of the European Community.
We are likely to see not a two-speed but a three-speed Europe. There will be
the inner core of Germany, plus its smaller neighbours, reinforced by
France. Second, there will be an outer core of Mediterranean countries
committed to staying in or rejoining the ERM as soon as possible. Third,
there will be the UK, back on the sidelines, having zero influence on the
reform of what John Major calls the faultlines of the ERM.
Or if I can put into plain English recent statements about rejoining the ERM
from Norman Lamont, they mean: 'Never, if I can help it, and in any case not
for a very long time.' His conditions, perhaps intentionally, remind one of
those laid down by Lady Thatcher.
What I have missed most from the statements of the prime minister and
chancellor is the 'D' words. I do not mean devaluation but admission of
defeat. Time and again they said that the ERM was at the heart of British
economic policy. Most human endeavours end in defeat. But it is gracious and
decent to recognise the defeat, instead of beating the patriotic drum and
pretending that all is well.
The defeat is not only for the government, but for the vision of an economy
based not on the literally zero inflation, but on reasonably stable prices.
The first signs were beginning to appear - businesses were revolting against
upward-only rent reviews, people were starting to view houses as places to
live in rather than as investments, renting was coming back in fashion and
even expense account restaurants were offering relatively cheap fixed-priced
menus.
These gains will not disappear overnight. It is a characteristic of currency
depreciation, like all other drugs, that the early effects are stimulating.
A tabloid headline saying 'Joy in a sinking pound' had it all. Interest
rates can now be a little lower. Exporters will find the going a little less
difficult but - and the full process can take years - the internal value of
the currency catches up with the external. The 1972 departure from the
monetary 'snake' was hailed as an act of liberation. But it led in a
straight line to Denis Healey turning back on his way to the IMF in 1976.
The long decline of sterling after 1981 paved the way for the inflationary
credit boom in the last years of that decade.
Until well after the forced devaluation of sterling, I wanted Norman Lamont
to stay. Otherwise we would be playing the old game of making a scapegoat of
successive politicians, while leaving those who really made the mistakes to
advise their successors undisturbed. The Bank of England cannot be a
candidate for independence until its role in last week's debacle has been
scrutinised. But after pretending that a defeat was a matter of adopting the
British policy, as distinct from the presumably non-British policy which he
himself had earlier been following, I no longer care whether the chancellor
goes or stays. Some 90 per cent of what politicians say is disbelieved. The
discount factor should now rise to 99.9 per cent. This is the sense in which
what should have been a technical issue has become a moral one as well.
But let us not dwell further on this, after all very ordinary government.
The faux pas of the Bundesbank could not have led to devaluation unless the
Bundesbank's views had struck a parallel chord in the financial talking
classes - from learned professors to the famous dealers in white socks. The
code was to say that the sterling parity was fixed at too high a level. What
they all really meant was that the effort to dump the inflationary habit was
too great - which is why the recession has been so much more severe in
Britain than in France, a country which has had appreciably higher real
interest rates.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Indian reform can go on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Manmohan Singh should be the toast of his peers at the International
Monetary Fund/World Bank annual meetings this week. In only 14 months, the
Indian finance minister has achieved what many would struggle to do in
years. With the strong backing of his prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao,
he has overseen a change of direction in economic policy, and has persisted
with it.
The government took office when the country was in the depths of a payments
crisis and appeared in danger of being torn apart by internal dissent. That
dark time already seems long distant. Mr Rao and Mr Singh have put an
economy which had been isolated and strangled for decades by socialist
bureaucracy on course to openness and the free market, while remaining alert
to the needs of India's poor. Much more must be done. But if they manage to
maintain the momentum, they will create the base for a dynamic, open, and
huge economy in the second half of the 1990s.
This is all the more remarkable given that they are operating in one of the
world's most feverish democracies. China's reformers do not have to account
for themselves to voters, have so far taken 13 years to reform the economy,
and still have a long way to go.
Doubters, even within the government, have felt in recent months that the
early pace was slackening. Some have questioned the government's will,
others the pace at which it is feasible to push reform in India. The Bombay
stock market scandal forced the resignation of one of the leading reformers,
commerce minister Mr P Chidambaram, and occupied much of Mr Singh's time as
the scam became the subject of intense parliamentary argument. However, by
recent reductions in fertiliser and petroleum subsidies, Mr Singh has
demonstrated that he remains determined.
Though not by nature a politician, Mr Singh is commendably frank in
admitting the political difficulties he faces in taking the next steps of
reform. But visible progress must continue to be made if growth in
international confidence is to continue. Foreign companies, other than those
who had been working for years to get investments through and suddenly found
the dam broken, have so far not backed their support with very much hard
cash. Without substantial private inflows, the reform programme will falter.
Potential investors want to see progress on several fronts. Employers need
to know on what basis they can hire and fire. A clear 'exit policy' has yet
to be enunciated. Mr Singh has, perhaps sensibly, tackled one industry first
and won agreement with labour unions on reorganising textile factories. This
alone will involve the loss of 70,000 jobs. He has to tread carefully when
new job opportunities are scarce and the safety net precarious or
non-existent.
On reducing the size of the public sector, Mr Singh feels that he does not
have a popular mandate for full-scale privatisation. Measures taken so far
have been tentative and insufficient. Big state-owned industries and banks
mostly need new management and new capital. New ownership is the best way to
achieve this given the bureaucracy with which they mostly remain encumbered.
Agriculture urgently needs new investment to restore its growth to
respectable levels. The tax structure must be reformed to broaden the tax
net, reduce reliance on customs duties and therefore allow further
reductions in import tariffs which will help to force Indian industry to
become more competitive.
Mr Singh will be heartened by recent signs that the economy is responding to
fiscal and monetary tightness. This will help him win support for continued
reform. Exports to convertible currency areas are showing faster though not
spectacular growth. A convincing upturn in industrial production is still
awaited. But year-on-year inflation is running just below the 8 per cent
target for the financial year, and the fiscal deficit has been sharply
reduced. The stability of the rupee since it was made partially convertible
this year may well encourage Mr Singh to go for full convertibility within a
few months.
His approach in all these areas must be steadfast, though not so bold that
the whole game is lost. The international community is aware of the
political battles he faces. But he has already shown just how much can be
achieved, against the political odds, by determined good government. He must
press on, and he must be allowed to do so.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Russia before the winter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW SESSION of Russia's parliament opens tomorrow with every sign pointing
to the most bruising clash yet between the legislative and executive powers.
Russia's government has still little to offer the people but more sweat and
tears: and its legion of enemies in the parliament and in the country will
be anxious to see some of its blood.
Vast dangers threaten the country. Inflation is now said by leading
government figures to be rising sharply towards hyper inflationary levels -
while the government bemoans its lack of control over or agreement with a
big-spending central bank. The budget deficit, on the most recent figures,
stands at close to Rbs1,000bn from a total income of Rbs3.300bn. Production
continues to fall - and though some of that is accounted for by goods no one
wants (guns), an important part consists of goods people do want (butter),
or the country desperately needs to trade (oil).
Although the grain harvest is likely to be better this year (the potato
harvest will be worse), the central and local authorities are already
raising the spectre of winter hunger in the cities before western aid
donors. There has been growth in the number of private farmers in Russia,
but state and collective farms still predominate and distribution and
storage continue to worsen.
Add to this the following: taxes which are widely evaded; hard currency
which is poured out of the country into secret bank accounts; corruption at
every administrative level; a rouble zone covering nearly all the former
Soviet republics without the former Soviet monetary discipline; a state
managerial class hostile to foreign investment, to its own government and
perfectly prepared to enter into league with the unions to hold the state to
ransom; and a clutch of opportunist politicians each with a sure way of
getting out of the crisis. In logic, this constitutes not a crisis in the
making, but a crisis made.
There is another reality, however, which is to be found as much outside of
Moscow as within its rutted beltway. It lies in the steadily increasing
privatisations of small shops; the ever present activity of foreign
companies, even individuals; the growth of market activity on every roadside
with kiosks, stalls or just a few commodities displayed on a piece of cloth;
the growing self confidence (and conspicuous consumption) of the
entrepreneurial class; the multiplication of cultural, commercial, social,
academic and political links with foreign states; the hollowing out of the
often-stagnant institutes and academies as their people leave to make money;
and the plurality of views still vehemently expressed and able to be
expressed in print, on the air or in the street.
Even with all that weighs them down, the government is still maintaining a
momentum on its programme for the privatisation of large companies. Every
kind of lobby is against this, and the population appears sceptical. But the
government is so far holding firm, and next month should see the first
privatisation plans being approved. As ministers will gloomily admit - even
insist, this being a government in part composed of painfully honest Moscow
intellectuals - radical reform is gone. But reform is not dead, nor its
cause lost, as the virulence of their critics confirms.
Foreign assistance to this process has always been much less important than
domestic effort - but it remains crucially important, even though the lamp
of attention has been greatly and damagingly dimmed and is likely to remain
so. Those who still pay attention, in western cabinets and boardrooms, need
to counsel patience, flexibility - but continued and close engagement in and
argument for the process of change, for change is indeed taking hold.
This will be very hard: none of the Group of Seven governments which have
put themselves in charge of aiding Russia now have much taste for
generosity. Besides, the Russian ministers (and their counterparts in the
other former Soviet states) will give them an excuse to be stingy, since
they are no position easily to repay debts.
The hopes that a dose of 'shock therapy' could electrify the system and jolt
it out of its seven-decades long Soviet groove have proved groundless: this
will be a long haul. But the government of Russia can still be assisted and
the task should not be impossible.

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH FRANC moved higher against the D-Mark last night but the apparent
narrowness of the Yes vote in the referendum cast further doubt over the
prospects for some of the weaker currencies in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
As currency trading rooms across Europe opened for business last night,
investors switched funds into the French franc and the D-Mark while sterling
dropped to a new low against the German currency.
Mr Hermann Remsberger, chief economist at BHF-Bank, the German bank said any
sense of relief on the Yes vote would evaporate given the big political
difficulties about moving to economic and monetary union according to the
current time table.
Weaker currencies still within the ERM, such as the Spanish peseta and the
Portuguese escudo, could prove vulnerable to selling pressure as doubts grow
about whether individual European economies will converge.
Attention is also likely to focus on the government's economic policy after
the pound's withdrawal from the ERM last week.
In early far eastern trading the franc jumped to about FFr3.4060 per D-Mark.
This compared with Friday's close of FFr3.4200 and was roughly three
centimes above its FFr3.43 floor in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Pressure remained on sterling in early Tokyo trading where it dropped to
DM2.5616, down more than five pfennigs on Friday night's close, giving the
UK government less room for an early cut in interest rates. Against the
dollar, the pound was quoted at Dollars 1.7355, little changed from Friday's
New York close.
The dollar weakened against the D-Mark and was quoted at DM1.4760 in Tokyo,
more than two and a half pfennigs down on Friday's New York close. Traders
reported Bank of Japan intervention in the currency markets.
Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
Swiss bank, said: 'There is some relief about a Yes vote, but the margins
are too narrow to give any clear direction to trading.'
Mr Mark Austin, an economist at Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank said: 'The
outcome of the referendum looks like a nightmare. It leaves everything up
the air.'
Among the few beneficiaries of the vote, apart from the French franc, were
Ecu bonds which rose by 1 point on muted relief by investors in these
securities about a positive vote.
French government bonds also rose in price slightly on prospects that France
would remain a part of the low inflation core of the ERM, linked to the
D-Mark.
The lira, due to return to the ERM tomorrow after suspension last week,
fluctuated in initial trading but recovered to about L835 against the
D-Mark, up slightly on Friday's close in London of L836.1, but still beneath
its ERM floor of L820.
Mr Axel Siedenberg, an economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said he
foresaw 'a lot of movement and uncertainty' in currency trading when markets
in Europe open today.

FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: Italcementi chief warns of lower
profits and dividends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ITALCEMENTI, Italy's biggest cement group, which this year became one of the
world's largest producers after buying Ciments Francais in France, has
warned of lower profits and dividends for 1992.
Mr Giampiero Pesenti, chairman, said sales for the first half of this year
rose by 4.7 per cent to L768bn (Dollars 612m). However, the group was being
held back in the home market, in which it has a share of over 30 per cent,
by slow sales and continuing price controls, which prevented it from passing
on higher costs.
Speaking at the annual meeting of Italmobiliare, his holding company, Mr
Pesenti said Italcementi's cement deliveries had grown by 4.4 per cent in
the first half, against a 6.1 per cent national average. Production, up by 4
per cent, had also lagged the national average.
Speaking of a 'static period' in the home market, Mr Pesenti forecast this
year's earnings and dividends would be overshadowed by rising costs and
lower turnover owning to falling prices. 'The dividend is bound to feel the
block on prices and the rise in costs,' he told shareholders.
First half sales also slipped at Ciments Francais, acquired for L1,700bn,
with a 5 per cent decrease to FFr7.5bn (Dollars 1.45bn). Adjusted for
disposals, the fall was 1.6 per cent, and reflected the downturn in the
French economy.
Europa Metalli, the industrial arm of the Italian SMI non-ferrous metals
group, reported a fall in first half consolidated turnover to L1,567bn from
L1,610bn a year earlier, owing to the continuing drop in metals prices.
The group, which now controls Kabelmetal in Germany, gave no forecasts about
the effect of exchange rate movements on sales and earnings this year after
the devaluation of the lira.
The bulk of turnover is generated abroad, with Kabelmetal alone accounting
for around half group sales.
Europa Metalli reported net losses of L3.9bn in the first half, compared
with profits of L22.4bn. The plunge in earnings was caused largely by the
problems in Europa Metalli's defence business, which has suffered from a
lack of orders for ammunition by the Italian government.
Failing orders from the government by the end of this year, the group warned
it would put its defence operation up for sale. The unit has around 200
employees, and lost around L8bn in the first half - more than its sales.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (5): New links forged -
North/South Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUNBATHERS on Howth Strand in Dublin can look north on a sunny day and
clearly see the mountains of South Down 50 miles away. There begins Northern
Ireland.
If traffic conditions are favourable, it is a mere one-hour drive to the
border. If they are not, which is more likely, it can take over three hours
to cover the 100 miles to Belfast - the same as the ferry trip to Holyhead
across the Irish Sea, and the British market lying beyond. The train journey
takes two-and-a-half hours, while an airline service simply does not exist.
The underdeveloped transport links between Northern Ireland and the Republic
are always a surprise to the newcomer arriving from another European city.
No two cities of comparable size and separation elsewhere in northern Europe
now lack the high speed road, rail and air links that are vital to
successful trade and commerce in the competitive environment of the 1990s.
It should be of no surprise therefore, as the EC moves towards the
completion of the Single Market, that this geographic anachronism - a result
of the 70 years of political distrust and antagonism between the two parts
of the island - is finally coming under scrutiny, as is the entire subject
of north-south trade.
The Confederation of Irish Industry (CII) calculates that manufacturers in
the south sell only one-third as much per capita in Northern Ireland as they
do in their home territory in spite of the proximity of the market.
Manufacturers in the north, meanwhile, sell only one-sixth as much per
capita in the south as they do in Northern Ireland. Only 5 per cent of the
south's total exports go to the north, while the north supplies only 4 per
cent of the south's imports.
The possibilities for enhanced trade would seem to be considerable.
According to the CII, a total of 75,000 additional jobs on both sides of the
border could be achieved by exploiting more fully the market potential
within the island of Ireland.
It is a theme to which politicians north and south are increasingly warming.
In May, amid much fanfare, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
launched a 200-page government study on cross-border economic co-operation.
The central message of the study is this: 'In an increasingly integrated
Europe, the costs of the current one-island/two-economy basis of operation
will have an inhibiting effect on economic progress.'
In a keynote speech in July, Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland's minister
for the economy and environment, echoed Mr Reynolds' views. He pointed to
growing links between business federations on both sides of the border and
the challenge of the European Single Market. Such developments, he said,
'add up to a fundamental change in circumstances and open up the real
prospect of a quantum change in the economic relationships between Northern
Ireland and the Republic'.
Both governments have made commitments to upgrade the road and rail links
between Belfast and Dublin.
Infrastructure will not be sufficient in itself, however. The fact that
around 20 per cent of the Republic's foreign trade is already transported
across the border for onward consignment by road to Britain and Europe,
suggests that infrastructure is not necessarily a limiting factor to
improved north-south trade.
Some are also highly sceptical of the CII's estimate of 75,000 additional
jobs coming from improved trade. Dr Graham Gudgin, the director of the
Northern Ireland Economic and Social Research Centre (NIESRC), says that a
recent survey based on 870 Northern Ireland manufacturing companies,
accounting for 80 per cent of manufacturing employment in Northern Ireland,
found that two-thirds of these firms are already involved in some trade with
the Republic, and that Northern Ireland firms already export three times
more on a per capita basis to the Republic than they do to mainland UK.
'I am sceptical of large short-term gains but I support the efforts to
improve trade,' said Dr Gudgin. 'We certainly should increase trade to
increase long-term competitiveness but we should not create over-optimistic
expectations. Greater trade and access to each other's market means job
losses as well as gains.'
Of immediate benefit, however, will be the plan by the two governments to
establish a joint tender information system, whereby firms on either side of
the border will be invited to tender for contracts of both governments.
The creation of a new database detailing all the manufacturing firms in the
island of Ireland, their products and capabilities, will be made available
to the public, possibly next year. Joint trade fairs and roadshows are also
planned.
Such initiatives will never, independently of the EC process of integration,
result in Northern Ireland's economy becoming as integrated with the
Republic as it is with the rest of the UK. Wage bargaining systems are
different, and the fiscal structures and public expenditure programmes
remain independent of each other. But that is not the primary goal.
In the words of Mr Atkins, 'the benefits of increased cross-border trade
will go beyond the purely economic. The more contact people in both parts of
Ireland have with each other, and the more they see their interests bound up
together, the more likely it is that understanding and tolerance will grow'.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (6): Ex-soldier uses political
instinct - Profile of Michael Mates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Michael Mates was appointed to hold the security portfolio at the
Northern Ireland Office in April, hopes and apprehensions were stirred in
equal measure on the two sides of the religious divide in Ulster.
A former lieutenant-colonel in the Queen's Dragoon Guards, Mr Mates is no
newcomer to the province, having served there with his battalion in the
early 1970s when the 'troubles' were at their peak. His 20-year military
career saw him serve in Germany and Cyprus as well as Ulster and finally
brought him on to the team of the Vice-Chief of Defence Staff at the
Ministry of Defence, before he entered politics as a Conservative MP in
1974.
For the Ulster Unionists, Mr Mates' appointment to oversee security in the
province was a signal that their appeals for a tougher stand against the IRA
had been heard. An ex-soldier/politician would be more amenable, so they
thought, to their insistence that selective internment and covert operations
must become the new weapons with which to break the back of the IRA.
The SDLP and the nationalist community were meanwhile apprehensive that such
a 'get-tough' policy would sweep away much of what had been achieved in
recent years through painstaking work in trying to reduce tensions in the
Catholic community and simply fuel a new recruitment drive for the IRA.
On appearances alone, Mr Mates' burly frame and defiant paratrooper's jaw
would suggest that the Unionists might have cause to celebrate. His
political instinct, however, has been honed by almost two decades in
parliament. Since winning Petersfield for the Tories in 1974, Mr Mates has
become a familiar sight in Westminster corridors and committee rooms.
He has been secretary of the Conservative parliamentary Northern Ireland
Committee from 1974-79, its vice-chairman from 1979-81 and is currently the
chairman of the all-party Anglo-Irish parliamentary group. He has also been
secretary of the influential 1922 backbench committee in the Conservative
party, and chairman of the Conservative Home Affairs Committee.
He has sat on the Commons Select Committee on Defence since its formation in
1979 and been its chairman since 1987. In the latter role, he has been
critical of the government's plans to cut the British Army strength from
156,000 to 116,000 by the mid-1990s and from his new vantage point in
Ulster, he can be expected to argue even more forcibly against the cuts.
An ally of Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Mates was passed over numerous times for
ministerial appointment during the Thatcher years. So after nearly two
decades on the backbenches, he now has the first opportunity to prove his
ministerial mettle.
'This is the biggest challenge of my career,' he said. 'I am here to do
things and I feel I can get on and do them. There is an urgency and vibrancy
here where events often require immediate action and decisions.'
There will be no headlong rush for a military solution to the province's
problems, however. 'There is no question of a military victory against the
IRA. The only way to defeat them is by a combination of economic, social and
political development and in the meantime we have to redouble our efforts to
contain the violence,' he said.
Significantly, Mr Mates also holds the finance portfolio at the Northern
Ireland Office, making him responsible for the allocation of its entire
Pounds 7bn budget. Does not that put him in the role of both gamekeeper and
poacher? 'We have to ensure that health, education and housing and the like
have their share but we can't compromise on security.'
Some business leaders and politicians believe the government is indeed
compromising on security - a view reinforced in some minds by Mr Mates'
recent statement that it is 'impossible' to stop the bomb attacks in Belfast
city centre. He is unrepentant. 'The IRA wants to make life intolerable. I
want to make it tolerable. We could easily put a cordon around Belfast, but
in doing that the IRA would have achieved its objective.'
Mr Mates thus sees his job as one of ensuring the security forces are
adequately resourced to contain and weaken the paramilitaries while the
province's politicians thrash out a solution. As chairman of the Commons
Select Committee on Defence, he is acutely aware of the budget restraints
facing the armed forces and the restraints that this places upon Northern
Ireland's security policy.
'I do not want to see British soldiers in the streets and countryside of
Northern Ireland any longer than they need to be. The day I can send a
battalion home I shall be very happy, and when I can send two battalions
home I shall be even happier.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (4): The cost of containing
terror - With cash scarce, efforts are focused on improving intelligence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAVOURITE game among journalists in Northern Ireland is to try to trap a
minister into defining what is an 'acceptable level of violence', the point
being that if the IRA cannot be defeated by military means as the security
forces experts say, then at what level can the violence be contained until
such time as the paramilitaries can be defeated by economic, social and
political means?
The ministers have their standard reply prepared. 'There is no acceptable
level of violence,' they say.
Government statistics hint in numbers at what ministers are unable to define
in words. Last year there were 499 shooting incidents, 367 bomb incidents
and 237 incendiary devices which exploded or were defused, all relating to
paramilitary activity. Over the past four years shootings have oscillated
between 500 and 600 - the bombings between 300 and 450.
In 1991, 94 people died as a result of the violence, 75 of them civilians -
many of those sectarian murders. Murders by Loyalist paramilitaries are now
running almost as high as those by the IRA, and last month's banning of the
Ulster Defence Association (UDA) is a recognition of the growing threat they
also pose to political stability in the province.
Criminal injuries and damage expenditure, paid by the government as
compensation to the victims of the violence, is running at over Pounds 40m
per year. This caused the government to temporarily suspend its capital
investment programme in Northern Ireland earlier this year.
So what more can be done to contain the violence?
When paramilitary activity showed an upturn at the end of last year, two
more army battalions were flown into the province. In addition, 400 more
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers have been recruited bringing RUC
strength up to 8,500. Total army strength is now around 18,500 including
6,000 from the Royal Irish Regiment (formed by merging the Ulster Defence
Regiment and the Royal Irish Rangers). Troop levels are now the highest
since 1979.
On the streets of Belfast and the country lanes of Armagh, there is a now a
highly visible army presence. Random checkpoints are set up to make more
difficult the movement of weapons and explosives. The incessant judder and
whine of the round-the-clock helicopter patrol over Belfast, adds an
Orwellian flavour to the city's already militarised atmosphere. Locals say
they no longer notice it.
Mr Michael Mates, the new minister responsible for security in Northern
Ireland, while fighting for more resources, is concerned that any higher
level of troop presence could prove counter-productive. He says turning
Belfast into a 'fortress' would be to hand the IRA a propaganda victory.
Other considerations are cost and manpower limitations. The planned defence
cuts in the armed forces will sharply deplete the number of regular army
troops available for Northern Ireland. Already several battalions there are
understrength and additional companies are having to be seconded in from the
mainland.
Expenditure cuts are also being felt at the RUC. In his annual strategy
statement made at the beginning of the year the RUC chief constable Sir Hugh
Annesley said 'the uncertainty of future major capital expenditure and
insufficient technical staff continue to be major problems'.
With no blank cheque available to help bring down the level of violence, the
security forces are therefore focusing their resources on improving their
intelligence activities and in targeting the finance and munitions flows to
the paramilitary organisations.
The RUC's new anti-racketeering squad claims to have had considerable
success in drying up numerous sources of finance of both IRA and Loyalist
paramilitaries in the past year, and new legislation is in the pipeline to
make it easier for the police to investigate and prosecute businesses and
organisations suspected of channelling funds.
The Libyans are under pressure from the United Nations to give hard
intelligence to the UK government which might lead to a breakthrough in
locating the remaining 100 tons or so of weapons supplied in the mid-1980s
to the IRA, most of which is thought to be still hidden in the Irish
Republic.
However, cross-border co-operation is improving and, significantly, Mr Mates
and Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish justice minister, met privately in Belfast
recently, the first such meeting outside the formal structure of the
Anglo-Irish talks.
A new area of concern is the sourcing of weapons from the former eastern
European states which are undergoing fragmentation and civil war. 'We are
very much alive to the danger, but there is no evidence yet of any new arms
supplies,' a senior RUC source said.
The RUC views its intelligence-gathering operations through penetration of
the paramilitary organisations as a priority area of its work. Sir Hugh said
pointedly, in his strategy document: 'Public co-operation and understanding
in this difficult task is crucial if we are to succeed.'
Equally as crucial are moves to improve liaison between the Army and the
RUC. A new body called the Province Executive Committee (PEC) was
established during the summer, which will co-ordinate intelligence gathering
and sharing at the top level.
The PEC is chaired by Mr Blair Wallace, the deputy chief constable of the
RUC. In principle the RUC is in charge of all security operations in
Northern Ireland, including intelligence gathering. MI5, however, has run
its own operations independently in the province for two decades, some of
which have come under intense criticism for alleged involvement in Loyalist
paramilitary activities.
Earlier this year MI5 was given overall responsibility for intelligence
operations against the IRA on the mainland, replacing the Metropolitian
Police Special Branch. This in effect confers and confirms a similar role
for MI5 in Northern Ireland.

FT  21 SEP 92 / France votes Yes, but only just: Decision a relief to EC
partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday approved the Maastricht treaty on European union by a
wafer-thin margin - to the universal relief of its European Community
partners.
Britain, the current EC president, immediately responded by calling a
special summit meeting of heads of government early next month to consider
how to proceed with ratification of the treaty.
In Washington, Community finance ministers expressed the hope that the vote
would ease tensions within the European Monetary System, while on the
foreign exchanges, the French franc strengthened against the D-Mark.
Early today with all votes counted in metropolitan France and in some
overseas territories 50.95 per cent had said Yes and 49.05 per cent No to
the controversial treaty on an unusually high turn-out of 70.5 per cent. Not
included were votes in overseas possessions west of France where voting
began and ended several hours later.
'We have just lived through one of the most important days for the history
of our country,' said President Francois Mitterrand, in an attempt to soothe
the intense divisions opened by the campaign. The result was a 'yes for
France, a yes for Europe' but there would be neither 'victors nor
vanquished' from the poll, he said.
The vote was the climax of a campaign which exposed deep divisions over
Europe in France, hitherto one of the main driving forces of European
integration, and which at times appeared likely to deal a severe setback to
the European Community. Uncertainty over the outcome also helped fuel the
turbulence on the currency markets in recent weeks, which forced the pound
and the lira to be suspended from the EMS.
The result does not, however, mean that ratification of the Maastricht
treaty - which provides for political, economic and monetary union between
the 12 EC member states, and the establishment of a common currency by 1999
at the latest - is yet assured by the Community's self-imposed deadline of
January 1 1993.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany last night led a chorus of relief among
European Community leaders over the referendum result. He vowed to press
ahead rapidly with efforts to secure ratification of the treaty in his
country and elsewhere, and to work for enlargement of the Community. 'The
positive result of the French referendum, even if it was narrow, will give
the European integration process a new boost in the other member states,' he
said in a statement.
However, approval of the French referendum result among EC governments was
tinged with concern at the narrowness of the outcome and apprehension about
the prospects for ratification of the treaty elsewhere in the Community,
notably in Britain.
Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, congratulated Mr Mitterrand on his
narrow victory. But he said European leaders now had to consider how to
proceed with ratification of the treaty. The summit he had called for early
October would need to consider the recent turmoil in the exchange rate
mechanism of the EMS. Referring to the narrowness of the French vote he
added: 'I think we do have to take into account in public debate the many
concerns that have been raised throughout the Community over recent weeks.'
EC foreign ministers are to meet today in New York, where they are attending
the UN General Assembly, to take stock of the French referendum result.
Their task in seeking to regain the political initiative after the currency
crisis of the last few weeks will inevitably be complicated by the
narrowness of the French verdict, which will do nothing to extinguish the
opposition to Maastricht in Germany, Britain and some other EC member
states.
Mr Kohl still has to secure ratification from both chambers of the German
parliament, while Mr Major is delaying putting the treaty to the Commons
until the problems stemming from Denmark's rejection of the treaty in a
referendum in June are resolved.
It remains unclear how the EC will deal with this difficulty - though Mr
Poul Schluter, Denmark's prime minister, said last night that Danish voters
would be asked to vote on the treaty for a second time next year, with the
addition of special reservations to meet objections to some parts. He said
the narrow vote in France should make it easier for Denmark to negotiate a
special deal with the other member states.
Yesterday's result marks a reprieve for President Mitterrand, who has spent
much of his 12-year presidency working for European integration and who had
staked almost his entire political prestige on securing a Yes vote.
In Paris, the vote was immediately hailed by Mr Laurent Fabius, first
secretary of the ruling Socialist party, as 'a victory for democracy and for
the president who, in calling the referendum, had taken the initiative for
it'.
Mr Paul Quiles, the French interior minister, argued that Mr Mitterrand's
decision to call a referendum had been vindicated. It showed that the French
had 'rejected the demagogy of extremes in refusing to follow those who
worked on their fears and fantasies'.
However, others in both Yes and No camps cautioned that the narrowness of
the majority meant there was no reason to celebrate. It 'gives us a measure
of the work which will be needed, from tomorrow morning, to relieve the
difficulties of the French who have said No,' said Mr Michel Rocard, former
prime minister and a leading supporter of the treaty.
Sensitive to the warning implicit in the closeness of last night's result,
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said: 'Our duty is
to take account of it as much at the national as at the European level. We
will do so by deepening our democratic practices.'
Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the leading anti-Maastricht standard-bearer in
the Socialist party, said the result was 'an amber light, not a green one'
for the treaty to go ahead. A re-negotiation was inevitable because 'one
cannot go on as if nothing had happened', he said.
European leaders would now have to take account of the sizeable French No
vote as well as the majority Danish rejection of Maastricht in June.
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the opposition RPR who had campaigned for
Maastricht against much rank-and-file opposition in his party, welcomed the
result, but called on his party members to 'find their place again' within
his neo-Gaullist grouping. He urged them to relaunch the offensive against
the government and prepare for a Socialist election defeat.
According to one exit poll, more than 60 per cent of RPR supporters voted
against Maastricht, while more than 60 per cent of the centre-right UDF
voted in favour. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, UDF president, claimed that
his party had 'accounted for a large part of the narrow margin (of
victory)'.
But Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right National Front, said
that taking account of abstentions, 'only one French citizen in three has
actually voted for Maastricht'.
The poll indicated deep splits along class and regional lines, underlining
the domestic challenges now facing the government. A 60 per cent majority of
farmers and industrial workers voted against the treaty, while the
Maastricht plan received 68 per cent support from executives and
professionals, according to exit surveys. Of those who voted against the
treaty, 58 per cent cited fear of loss of national sovereignty and 41 per
cent fear of Germany, said exit surveys.
Any reprieve for Mr Mitterrand from his political problems is likely to
prove temporary. He admitted before the result yesterday that he knew he had
taken a 'considerable' risk in putting Maastricht to a popular referendum.
'But,' he added 'there are times when it is necessary to consult the
people.'
The president took his gamble in putting the treaty to a referendum after it
failed the Danish plebiscite.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Lamont to take tough line on public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government will take an even tougher line on public spending since
suspending the pound's participation in the European exchange rate
mechanism, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, said
yesterday.
Speaking in Washington, Mr Lamont said that monetary policy, which now will
be based on a range of financial indicators, would be supported by a tight
fiscal stance: 'With sterling now floating outside the ERM, a rigorous
approach to public spending will be even more important.'
His comments came as ministers in London suggested that sterling's
withdrawal opened up the prospect of a small cut in interest rates as long
as the pound stabilised on currency markets. Senior Whitehall officials
pointed out that both inflation and output had 'undershot' the Treasury's
predictions in the March Budget allowing some scope for an easing of policy.
Mr Lamont refused to be drawn on when rates might fall. Instead he stressed
that the government would not take any risks with inflation. It would ensure
that monetary conditions are sufficiently tight to ensure the government's
objective of bearing down on inflation.
He said UK monetary policy before the floating of the pound last Wednesday
had been tighter than required to deliver the UK's inflation objectives. On
the other hand, the subsequent fall of sterling had produced some loosening
of monetary policy.
As currency trading rooms across Europe opened for business last night,
investors switched funds into the French franc and the D-Mark while sterling
dropped to a new low against the German currency.
The pound dropped to DM2.5616, over 5 pfennigs down on Friday night's close,
cutting UK government room to reduce interest rates.
Mr Lamont, who was addressing the International Monetary Fund's
policy-making interim committee said he would be making an assessment of the
UK's present monetary stance soon.
The assessment, which could determine interest rate changes, would be based
on a number of financial indicators, including narrow money, broad money,
assets prices including houses and the sterling exchange rate.
He acknowledged that operating monetary policy without a clear rule such as
ERM membership was not easy. 'Judgment has to be applied,' he said.
'Operating a floating regime is not easy and not a soft option.'
This was also true of fiscal policy. 'It has been suggested that while
monetary policy was constrained by the ERM, we should have been prepared to
follow a more expansionary fiscal policy,' he told the IMF. 'Whatever the
merits of that argument, and I, myself, was far from convinced, they clearly
do not apply now.'
British business leaders were dismayed by the narrow French vote and
forecast more uncertainty. Companies battered by the recession had hoped for
a decisive Yes, and the tiny majority was not widely welcomed.
Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said anything
less than a two-thirds Yes majority should rule out ratification of the
treaty by Britain. 'In the light of events last week and the level of clear
popular dissent expressed in France, Denmark and elsewhere, we believe it
would be folly for the government to commit the European economies to
economic and monetary union and political union as envisaged in the treaty.'
Mr Richard Brown, director of policy for the British Chambers of Commerce,
said: 'A narrow result is probably the worst result, because it means more
uncertainty. At least a Yes vote is better than a No vote, because it means
that Maastricht will continue. But it could also mean more instability, and
that is what business does not want.'

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE MINISTERS from the world's leading industrial nations were last
night preparing to restore calm in case of financial market turbulence
following the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
A weekend meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers agreed to take
'appropriate additional actions as needed' to achieve currency stability.
European Community finance ministers said yesterday they were ready to bring
Japan, the US and Canada (which together with Germany, France, the UK and
Italy make up the G7) into their discussions if necessary, but said
responsibility for reacting to the French vote lay primarily with the
Europeans.
Their remarks came after a meeting of finance ministers yesterday called by
Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, in his capacity
as president of the EC finance ministers' council.
It remained unclear what additional moves had been agreed. The G7 communique
said the ministers and central bank governors expressed concern about the
recent volatility in world markets and agreed on the importance of restoring
stable relationships. They said they would 'continue to co-operate and to
monitor closely economic and financial conditions in their countries' and
act as needed 'to achieve sustained growth and greater currency stability'.
The ministers' promise of additional action provoked scepticism among some
bankers in Washington. Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank,
said it was difficult to imagine anything that could be effective, given the
size of foreign exchange markets.
With ministers aware that a public display of disagreement could further
upset financial markets, the G7 meeting was unusually harmonious. 'No one
was put in the dock,' said Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister. Mr
Lamont went out of his way afterwards to say that he was not criticising
Germany's monetary policy.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said he did not come under
pressure to cut interest rates.
But there was no sign of any early changes in economic policies. As
expected, Germany refused to promise any further interest rate cuts, and the
US made no precise commitment to new efforts to curb its budget deficit.
Mr Lamont said that Mr Waigel on Saturday had said he hoped conditions would
be established, 'though not necessarily immediately' for interest rates in
Germany to come down. 'I think everybody is of the view, including the
Germans, that we would like in time to see lower interest rates.'
Germany had not been criticised, he said, for its high interest rates 'but
obviously there was a lot of discussion of the consequences of reunification
for the world economy and for interest rates.' He said Germany had a
'uniquely difficult task to deal with'.
Some of the tensions underlying economic relations among the industrialised
countries surfaced away from the G7 meeting. It is understood that in
bilateral talks with Mr Waigel, Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury
secretary, repeated the US belief that Germany should cut its interest rates
to promote growth in Europe.
President George Bush was expected to take up this theme last night at a
reception for ministers attending the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund.
Mr Sapin said yesterday before the referendum result that he had given
considerable thought to what needed to be done in the event of a Yes vote -
including the provision of celebratory champagne; he had never considered
the possibility of a No vote. 'I know all the ills it would bring, but I
have never taken it into account,' he said.
But Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, said he was not sure the
lira could return to the exchange rate mechanism tomorrow as he had said
earlier.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Monday Interview: Ruffling diplomatic feathers - Boutros
Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine months after his controversial appointment as United Nations
secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali could be forgiven for
occasionally feeling self-satisfied at the way he has confounded those who
questioned his suitability for the job.
The conventional wisdom in many western government circles was that,
notwithstanding his long diplomatic experience and his distinguished career
as an academic lawyer, this archetypal Egyptian civil servant lacked the
dynamism and imagination to lead the UN in the post-Cold War era.
Yet it is because he has proved to be independent and outspoken that some
national noses have been put out of joint. He has already ruffled many
feathers - mainly those of diplomats - and achieved much more than was
generally expected.
Quite apart from the international problems he has had to deal with, Mr
Boutros Ghali has made a good start on restructuring the UN's overblown
bureaucracy. He has also proposed an imaginative 'agenda for peace' calling
for the creation of permanent standby peace-keeping forces on which the UN
could call at 24 hours' notice, and a system of 'preventive diplomacy'
designed to nip potential conflicts in the bud.
During an interview in his oak-panelled suite on the 38th floor of the UN
headquarters in New York, the secretary-general made no attempt to deny
diplomats' complaints that he sometimes goes over their heads and deals
directly with their governments.
'Mea culpa, maxima culpa. Yes it is true. But if I have to wait a week to
have an answer and the foreign minister or prime minister is an old friend,
it would be counter-productive not to talk directly to them. I am doing this
every day, otherwise I would not be able to finish all my work.'
Mr Boutros Ghali certainly has a lot on his plate. Yet he speaks about his
job with passion and without trepidation. Though he is the first to concede
that the end of the Cold War and the subsequent spirit of co-operation
between the US and Russia has given the UN a new lease of life, he is
convinced that the secretary-general's job has become infinitely more
demanding.
'My role is becoming more difficult, not because of the absence of
co-operation between the five permanent members of the Security Council, or
because of the absence of political will on their part, but because of the
multiplication of problems: Yugoslavia, Salvador, Cambodia, Somalia, Angola,
South Africa and, soon, Mozambique. The UN never had to deal with six or
seven big problems at the same time.'
The UN is currently running 12 peace-keeping operations in various parts of
the world. This involves some 40,000 military personnel under UN command at
an estimated cost of nearly Dollars 3bn over the present 12-month period -
more than four times the previous highest annual figure.
Yet there is not nearly enough money in the UN kitty to pay for all these
activities. 'The member states owe the UN Dollars 1.8bn and only 52 out of a
total of 179 have paid their contributions,' he complained. Both US
President George Bush, whose country is the worst offender with an
outstanding debt to the UN of Dollars 733m, and President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia, the next biggest debtor, have promised to pay up in instalments.
'But I am still waiting.'
Several proposals have been put before the General Assembly, currently
meeting in New York, to deal with this cash-flow problem. These include
charging interest on contributions not paid in time, the establishment of a
temporary Dollars 50m reserve fund to meet the initial cost of peace-keeping
operations and authorisation for the secretary-general to borrow on the
money markets.
The failure of member states to recognise the UN's cash problems was at
least partially behind the widely-publicised row last July between Mr
Boutros Ghali and Lord Carrington, the European Community's former chief
peace negotiator on Yugoslavia. The very undiplomatic tiff erupted over the
secretary-general's criticism of the Security Council for endorsing the EC's
proposal that the UN should supervise all heavy weapons in Bosnia.
Though pique at being presented with a fait accompli by the Security Council
and at being ordered around by a 'regional' organisation like the EC
certainly contributed to the ill-feeling, Mr Boutros Ghali now has a much
more rational explanation for his sharp reactions at the time.
'It is useless to take decisions or adopt resolutions in the Security
Council when you know that you do not have the capacity to implement them.
My advisers had told me that it would take two to three months to find the
additional forces, money and equipment to carry out such a monitoring
operation (in Bosnia). But the Europeans could have done it in something
like three days. What was the interest, therefore, in asking the UN to
undertake the operation instead of the EC member states? That was the reason
for my confrontation.'
The secretary-general believes the compromise reached at the subsequent
London conference on Yugoslavia in August was acceptable. 'What I obtained
at that conference is the agreement of the Europeans to contribute to
additional peace-keeping forces (for Bosnia) and that the cost of this
operation would be paid directly by EC members. They wanted these forces to
operate under the UN flag, and I accepted this.' Though acknowledging that
this agreement raises the issue of UN control over future peace-keeping
missions, Mr Boutros Ghali emphasises that it is a sui generis arrangement
which will not be repeated elsewhere.
The secretary-general remains unperturbed when reminded of his description
last summer of the Yugoslav conflict as 'the rich man's war'. He did not
repeat the phrase in the interview, but he stressed that he sees his task as
secretary-general as maintaining some kind of equilibrium between the richer
and poorer nations. 'The rapprochement between east and west must not be at
the expense of the relations between north and south.'
Similarly, he does not agree with the widespread impression that the UN is
dominated by the US. 'I say no, honestly. After nine months in this house, I
can assure you that it is a very democratic system. The members spend weeks
trying to obtain a consensus. This I would call democracy.'
Because of the UN's increasingly heavy workload, Mr Boutros Ghali is anxious
that specialised international agencies and regional organisations should
play their full part in ensuring international peace and security, in
co-operation with the UN.
'We are no longer asked only to undertake peace-keeping operations. We are
asked to present a comprehensive approach, which embraces the return of
millions of refugees to their former homes, rehabilitation, the reform of
national administrations, the integration of armies of former enemies and
much more besides. We are not able to cope with this comprehensive approach
by ourselves and we need the assistance of different international
specialised agencies.' These increasing demands on the UN have prompted Mr
Boutros Ghali to order a thorough study of how the work of the organisation
and the autonomously functioning agencies can be better co-ordinated.
At 69, which some considered too old for the job only nine months ago, Mr
Boutros Ghali appears to be in excellent health and full of life. Though he
makes deprecating noises when asked whether he is enjoying his job - 'I was
an elder statesman in Egypt who could have his Turkish coffee twice a day
and choose whatever trips abroad he wanted to go on' - there can be no doubt
of his enthusiasm for the UN, a subject with which he has long been familiar
as a professor of international law.
For all his enthusiasm, Mr Boutros Ghali has no intention of seeking a
second mandate. 'I am protected by my age (he will be 74 when his term
expires). At a certain age you have to write your memoirs or go to the Cote
d'Azur to admire the girls.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / The fiscal roots of market turmoil: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The communique released by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries
over the weekend was singularly unimpressive even by this august body's own
undemanding standards. The three paragraphs offered neither an analysis of
why markets are in disarray nor an outline of possible cures. The
statement's vacuity reflects the inability of US and European policymakers
even to agree on the character of current problems.
From a US perspective the turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is a
sideshow. Because foreign trade has always been a relatively minor component
of the US economy, Americans have never taken exchange rate systems that
seriously. They believe sacrifices may be worth making to achieve ultimate
ends, such as economic growth, but not in defence of particular currency
arrangements. When former President Richard Nixon broke the dollar's link
with gold and summarily wound up the Bretton Woods exchange rate system in
the early 1970s, he incurred the wrath of neither the American public nor US
academics - who happily embraced the floating dollar.
Given this history, most US analysts privately welcome the de facto
realignment of the ERM that is now under way. They never understood why
Britain was so determined to impose Germany's abnormally high interest rates
on an economy saddled with US levels of personal and corporate debt. And
most believe the UK economy will do better with a domestically-oriented
monetary policy.
Americans are preoccupied principally by lack of growth and jobs rather than
by currency gyrations. The US Treasury's repeated warnings about growth are
not just a reflection of the imminent presidential election. They reflect a
different history - the US economic psyche was scarred by the Great
Depression rather than by hyper-inflation. The fact that all three economic
blocks - the US, Japan and Europe - are simultaneously facing hard times
greatly worries Washington. While a global slump is not expected, it is not
seen as impossible.
Perversely, the monetary restraints imposed by German unification may have
encouraged complacency in Europe. Policymakers appear convinced that growth
will revive if only they can find a way to reduce interest rates. In the US
scepticism runs deeper because the Federal Reserve has already cut rates
aggressively. The US went into recession with short-term interest rates of
about 8 per cent - a level about which Britain can still only dream - and
has since slashed them to 3 per cent. Yet the results have been profoundly
disappointing. The economy has still not recovered decisively from
recession: indeed, uniformly poor figures indicate that the very sluggish
growth of recent quarters may again be tailing off.
It was thus not surprising to hear Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury
Secretary, declare over the weekend that the cure for the currency
instability worrying Europeans was nothing less than action to meet the US's
number one worry: lacklustre growth. History, however, reveals no clear link
between growth and exchange rate stability: when the dollar plunged in the
mid- to late-1980s, the world economy was enjoying a brisk recovery. Mr
Brady's call for policies to restore global growth was just a coded demand
for further German interest rate cuts. The US demands are logical: an easing
of German monetary policy would soothe currency strains, prompt somewhat
faster European growth and improve US export prospects.
But US analysis skirts the core of current problems. The lack of balance
between monetary and fiscal policy is the underlying cause of both slow
growth and currency instability. If Germany had financed the costs of
unification mainly through tax increases rather than borrowing, German
inflation and interest rates would be much lower and the ERM would not have
blown apart. Germany's fiscal error was as serious in its way as the US's
refusal in the late-1960s to raise taxes to finance the Vietnam war. The
American mistake led to a decade of high inflation; Germany's has
contributed mightily to what may prove a decade of stagnation.
The US, meanwhile, should have ended the boom of the 1980s with a sizeable
budget surplus. It could then have used fiscal policy to counter the 1990-91
recession. Had it done so the Fed would not have had to cut interest rates
so sharply, the dollar would have been stronger, and the strains on the EMS
would have been greatly reduced.
The link between structural fiscal deficits and slow growth is even clearer.
In the US, labour force growth has dwindled. The rate at which the economy
can expand is thus determined mainly by productivity improvements which in
turn reflect levels of savings and investment. The US is unable to grow
faster than a meagre 1-2 per cent largely because huge deficits are draining
already inadequate levels of domestic savings. Chronic US (and now German)
deficits have greatly exacerbated a worldwide shortage of savings, pushed up
long-term interest rates, and undermined global growth prospects.
You will read nothing of this in the pusillanimous G7 communique. The only
mention of fiscal policy is an approving reference to higher public spending
in Japan. Given such leadership, the world perhaps deserves its problems.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Usual rules do not apply: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In their attempts to develop a policy towards the civil war in Yugoslavia,
western governments are operating under three severe handicaps. The first is
that they bear a serious responsibility for having accelerated the war by
their serial recognition of would-be independent states. Second, they cannot
make good this responsibility because they have no operational leverage for
bringing the conflict to a halt, at least none that they can exercise
without mobilising hundreds of thousands of men, with any chance of success.
But the third and most serious handicap is that they dare not admit the
gruesome truth that the situation probably has to get worse before it can
get durably better, and that the 'ethnic cleansing' which all condemn may in
fact be a necessary precondition for any lasting settlement.
Perhaps the earlier errors were unavoidable in the circumstances in which
they were committed; perhaps the Germans could not escape a national
obligation to press for early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia; but even
if that is now water under the bridge, it still leaves the Germans, and thus
also their partners in the European Community, with responsibilities for
trying to cure the damage which they cannot possibly fulfil.
After such an unpromising starting point, the twin-track approach which has
been evolving in the European Community and the United Nations is probably
about as constructive as one might reasonably expect. On the one hand, there
is the diplomatic strategy fronted by Cyrus Vance for the UN and David Owen
for the EC, which aims to persuade the warring factions to give up the
bloody conflict and come instead to the conference table. On the other hand,
the United Nations is now making a seriously determined effort to push
through the programme of humanitarian aid with some small backing of
military force.
The tender-hearted may feel that this twin-track programme is far too little
compared with the need. Moral revulsion at the barbaric tribalism of this
multi-sided conflict, plus the urge to protect the innocent or at least
alleviate their sufferings, together seem to call for much deeper engagement
to put an end to an unacceptable situation.
The tough-minded, by contrast, would argue that the outside world is already
trying to do far too much, in a situation where it can have no effective
leverage on the conflict, and that any further involvement carries a
manifest danger of getting sucked into a politico-military quagmire, with
potentially disastrous consequences.
Such realists have the deepest misgivings over the latest UN plan to send
troops to back up the provision of humanitarian aid; for they fear that this
could lead uncontrollably to military involvement in the fighting, but
without any framework of a realistic political strategy.
Between the competing claims of morality and realism, the present twin-track
programme is in fact about the best that can be offered in extremely
unpromising circumstances. The outside world cannot bring peace; but it can
lay down some principles of international law, and hold out a useful
procedural framework ready for the day when most of the combatants decide
they would prefer peace to war.
In the absence of peace, the outside world cannot prevent the death and
deprivation of many innocent civilians on all sides; but it must do what it
can to alleviate these sufferings, and it should do a lot more than it is
now doing, because it could save many hundreds of lives.
But this twin-track policy only makes political sense on two conditions. The
first is that the UN humanitarian aid programme is kept rigidly and
manifestly distinct from any monitoring or peacekeeping operations, because
it is essential that the combatants should have no reason to believe that
the aid escorts are really a peacemaking force in disguise. This means
accepting that the aid escorts cannot fire back, even at the cost of taking
casualties.
The second condition is that we must recognise that the conference
arrangements being offered are unlikely to serve any useful function until
the fighting in some sense comes to rest. It is right for the outside world
to insist on high-minded principles such as self-determination and the
protection of minority rights.
But the bottom line is that peace negotiations will probably not start in
any serious way, until the combatants see the prospect of stable political
and territorial arrangements. Since the root cause of the fighting is the
secular mutual hatreds of the warring communities, one of the prime
preconditions of stable political and territorial arrangements will be a
high degree of ethnic homogeneity.
The outside world is never likely to admit that ethnic cleansing, which
means large movements of peoples, and non-respect of minority rights, could
be a necessary part of any peace settlement, because it is morally repulsive
and contrary to principles to which most civilised governments formally
subscribe.
But if the choice is between ethnic cleansing and a negotiated peace on the
one hand, and continued slaughter and suffering of the innocent, in the name
of the protection of minority rights, on the other, it seems clear where
one's choice should lie. This is a serial civil war, and in civil wars, the
usual rules do not apply.
