FT  21 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Wall Street swamped by orders
deluge - Rush of new corporate offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rush of offerings spurred by the latest US interest rate cut has left the
US corporate bond market suffering from a bout of indigestion.
After the Labor Day holiday on September 7, Wall Street's investment bankers
returned to find a deluge of orders on their desks from companies keen to
take advantage of the lowest interest rates in three decades.
But the heavy supply of paper has overwhelmed demand, leaving many banks
with unsold stock on their books.
The turmoil in European markets last week further slowed buying, as
investors pondered the implications for US interest rates.
In the last two weeks, the volume of new issues has totalled more than
Dollars 16bn. Some of the biggest names of corporate America led the way,
including General Motors Acceptance Corporation, BankAmerica, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, Wal-Mart Stores and Pacific Bell.
This latest stampede - there have been several similar rushes this year -
followed the cut in the Federal funds rate (the interest rate banks charge
on overnight loans to each other) two weeks ago from 3.25 per cent to 3 per
cent.
The extremely low cost of funds in the capital markets has delighted
corporate finance officers at leading companies, which have been able to
refinance debt issued in the 1980s at much higher rates.
So far 1992 has been a banner year for the corporate bond market, with more
than Dollars 220bn of new issues.
After the previous Fed cut, in early July, the market enjoyed its second
busiest month ever with Dollars 28.4bn of debt issued. The previous rate
cut, last December, led to January's record total of Dollars 34.8bn.
Issuers are now in a hurry, fearful that if they do not move fast a
prolonged backlog of orders will widen the interest rate spreads over
Treasuries on new issues and push up their funding costs.
As Mr Richard Dubusc, a managing director with First Boston in New York,
puts it: 'There's a sense that the early bird will get the worm in terms of
spread execution.'
It could even get busier if the Fed cuts the discount rate or continued
economic weakness brings market rates down further.
Some issuers appear to be holding out for such an eventuality. Mr Joe
MacHale, managing director at JP Morgan in New York, says: 'There's a
significant number of corporations who think that rates will go still lower,
and I'm not so sure they're wrong.'
The longer term outlook is cloudier. There is little chance that interest
rates will rise significantly over the rest of the year - the economy is in
too weak a state to envisage it - but market yields could steadily inch
higher if political shock waves from the presidential election rattle
financial markets.
Treasury investors are concerned that if the Democratic nominee, Governor
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, wins the election, his fiscal plans for next year
could lead to an increase in the budget deficit.
Much of the impact of a Clinton victory has already been factored into
Treasury prices, however. As one Wall Street banker put it: 'Increasingly
the view here is that it's Clinton's election to lose.'
That said, if Mr Clinton looks a sure bet nearer election day on November 3,
the market could react by pushing rates higher.
Given the uncertain outlook, many companies may decide to bring any plans
for debt issues forward.
Mr Dubusc says: 'The dollar's a concern to people, the election's a concern,
so there's a lot of reasons to move now.'
But investors, faced with the deluge of new issues, are becoming
increasingly choosy. The low level of rates has increased their appetite for
deals which offer sizeable margins over US Treasury yields.
'Investors face an invidious choice,' observed one investment banker.
'Mortgage products offer higher yields, but with the latest drop in interest
rates, there is likely to be a wave of refinancing (which triggers the early
prepayment of mortgage deals).'
With spreads on corporate bonds trading at relatively tight levels, some
investors have voted with their feet.
'There have been some aggressively priced deals which have not been placed,
which has put spreads under pressure (to widen),' said one syndicate
official at a US bank.
For example, a Dollars 400m seven-year offering for Ford Motor Credit priced
at 68 basis points over the comparable Treasury yield has widened to 78
basis points.

FT  21 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: A message of hope from Dr
Doom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE old days when Salomon Brothers was the most stuffily respectable
institution in New York, its senior credit analyst was Dr Henry Kaufman. He
used to dominate bond market sentiment, just as his British admirer, Mr (now
Professor) Gordon Pepper, did in London.
Those were financially disorderly and increasingly inflationary times, and
Kaufman's frequent storm warnings got him the name Dr Doom. Unfortunately,
he was right (and so, of course, was Pepper, with his dire forecast of the
result of joining the ERM). Doom is now in over-supply, so you may not wish
to read about Kaufman's latest thoughts; but read on. You may be surprised.
He was speaking only yesterday at the World Economic Development Congress in
Washington, a kind of IMF fringe meeting; and since commonsense will no
doubt be in shorter supply than ever at the main event, I wish I had space
for his whole address; but as it is, his account of how we got into this
mess, through ignorant though well-intentioned tax-cutting and financial
deregulation, most be taken as read. It is aimed at the US, but applies with
equal force to the UK, after adjusting for privatisation instead of
borrowing. It is pithy, but basically familiar.
His current comments are not so conventional, especially from a man with
such a name for austerity; but even here, some quotations will have to do.
First, monetary policy. (Quotes are Kaufman on the US, brackets a UK gloss
on them.) 'During the crucial months of 1990, 1991 and even part of this
year, the Federal Reserve failed to come to grips with the financial
impediments to a normal rebound. The very notion of a credit crunch was
ridiculed in some quarters . . . mainly because there was no direct
historical counterpart on which to base a conventional analysis.' (But while
the Fed did brood about the problem, the UK authorities simply shut their
eyes.)
'A startling number of speeches was given predicting a healthy recovery just
ahead. Such cheerleading was an obstacle to realism.' (Comment redundant.)
'The Fed continued to maintain its customary vigilance against inflation.
Central bankers must be forgiven this bias. Nevertheless, in the context of
a dispirited economy . . . this took on some of the aspects of fighting the
last war.' (The Fed may have seen itself as resisting Reaganomics, but in
the UK the elected government is more Catholic than the Pope.)
On deflation: 'In the current situation . . . the only way many businesses
can try to increase earnings is through cost reduction. That cannot work for
the economy at large . . . (it) reduces employment, lowers income, and sours
sentiment. It feeds on itself, resulting in bigger negative consequences
than expected . . . Draconian measures to reduce the budget deficit in the
short term would be dangerous.' (Wholly applicable to the UK.)
On recovery: 'Economic revival requires financial rehabilitation, and
rehabilitation requires still lower interest rates' (even in the US]). It
also requires 'modest and explicitly temporary fiscal measures'; but
monetary policy must carry the main burden because 'it has the advantage of
flexibility - the capacity for reversing course quickly.'
On Europe: 'I have long felt that an all-out defence of the ERM would be a
mistake, and that the US should urge (its) members to consider suspending
the mechanism until current divergences are able to be narrowed. That is
what has happened under pressure of an old-fashioned market crisis.
'The events of the past few weeks must seem like a bizarre replay of
something out of the 1960s. Even the role of the Bundesbank has been
reminiscent . . . German rates will have to be reduced considerably further
before there is much chance of re-establishing credible parities within the
ERM.'
On devaluation: 'Devaluations would probably be inflationary if European
economies were pushing against capacity constraints. However, the reality is
the opposite.'
And remember that Dr Kaufman's record as an anti-inflationist is impeccable.
Kaufman for Governor? Our battered national pride would hardly take that; so
what about Prof Pepper?

FT  21 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexican and Hungarian issues
break new ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO and Hungary broke new ground in the US bond market last week,
launching the first Yankee bond issues by sub-investment grade sovereign
borrowers.
Mexico brought a Dollars 250m offering of 10-year bonds priced to yield 215
basis points above the 10-year treasury yield. Goldman Sachs, which arranged
the transaction, said the deal was being placed with mainstream Yankee bond
investors.
Meanwhile, Hungary became the first eastern European country to raise funds
in the US bond market, with a Dollars 200m 10-year deal via Salomon Brothers
priced to yield 275 basis points over the 10-year treasury yield - wider
than the original indication of 250 basis points.
Hungary has now completed around Dollars 900m of its Dollars 1bn funding
programme for this year, and expects to raise the same amount in the capital
markets next year.
Mexico is rated BB-plus by S&amp;P and Ba2 by Moody's while Hungary has BB-plus
from S&amp;P and Ba1 from Moody's.

FT  21 SEP 92 / European Bonds: French voters do little to close divisions
in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lukewarm support delivered by French voters yesterday for the EC's
proposed economic and monetary union is likely to do little to reverse the
forces that had already opened up sharp divisions within the European
exchange rate mechanism.
The foreign exchange market decided last week to exercise its own vote
before the French got round to theirs, and its verdict seems unlikely to be
reversed now.
'An event that doesn't have broad European significance,' was the view of Mr
Richard Grey, a bond market analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, ahead of the
vote.
However, the result is still likely to have some important ramifications:
for instance, in deciding the fate of the French franc, and the future
direction of the French bond market.
If the franc survives the current ERM crisis without a forced devaluation -
an outcome that appeared more likely as the currency strengthened last night
 -then 'it will virtually have become a Deutsche mark,' said Ms Alison
Cottrell, an economist at Midland Montagu.
The foreign exchange markets, which were developing a taste for bashing the
franc at the end of last week, are likely to back off somewhat after the
referendum result - though the narrowness of the victory means the currency
is not out of the woods yet.
The second result of a Yes vote could be an attempt by European politicians
to patch up at least some of their differences of the last few days, and
perhaps even to try to keep the Maastricht timetable for Emu on the road.
That could merely serve to delay the inevitable. Ratification of the
Maastricht Treaty in other member states will not be easy, given the
narrowness of the French support, the messages from the currency markets in
recent days and the ill-will generated between some European leaders during
the course of last week.
As a result, Europe's bond markets at the end of last week were already
reflecting a lack of belief in the future of EMU, preferring instead to take
a fresh look at the economic fundamentals of individual member states.
A clear indicator of this was the speed with which the gilt market's
inverted yield curve fell flat on its back.
The market's mood did a smart about-turn during the course of the week, at
least at the short end of the yield curve. As sterling slid, the market
began to look for a two point cut in base rates, from the current 10 per
cent.
Meanwhile, longer-dated gilt yields had begun to creep up, to around 200
basis points above German levels, as the spectre of renewed inflation
threatened to return. However, most analysts discounted the likelihood of a
renewed burst of inflation given the depth of the UK's current recession -
even allowing for the effects of the falling pound  - and the relative
firmness in the gilt market reflected this view.
The beliefs which have shaped both ends of the yield curve in recent days
could turn out to be over-optimistic. It seems unlikely, for instance, that
the UK government is about to abandon its anti-inflation strategy quite so
quickly.
With a general election won less than six months ago, Mr John Major's
government is under no immediate pressure to engineer an economic boom to
appease voters. Also, a sharp drop in rates could cause sterling to plunge,
further undermining attempts to restrain inflation.
Even if the UK does not opt to tie its currency into the ERM in the near
term, it can hardly ignore the power of German interest rates, which will
continue to dictate monetary conditions in Europe.
'If we are still in the same anti-inflationary world, you have to look at
Germany,' said Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg.
At the longer end of the market, meanwhile, yields could be set to rise
sharply from their current levels. Even leaving aside the danger of renewed
inflation, there remains the question of how the UK will finance its fiscal
deficit.
Analysts doubt that any economic upturn resulting from devaluation will show
through in an increased tax yield or lower social securities payments until
the second half of next year.
In the meantime, international investors will demand an extra risk premium
for holding sterling.
It will be difficult to persuade UK investors to take up the slack. The
renewed appetite among UK insurers and pension funds for gilts in recent
months was based on the assumption that the UK was facing a low-growth,
low-inflation decade, making fixed-income investments more attractive than
equities.
If those assumptions are reversed, gilt yields will have to rise to persuade
investors to keep funding the UK's deficit.
The precipitate decision to float sterling last week has made an immediate
impact on investors. 'I've got to say that it does look as though it has
shifted the pattern in favour of equities,' said Mr Mike Sandland, chief
investment manager of Norwich Union, the UK insurer. Norwich Union had done
more than any other investor over the previous months to lead the move away
from equities and into gilts.
The clear winner from the dislocation of the ERM so far has been the bund
market - with other 'core' government bonds markets, like that of the Dutch,
closely in tow. However, over time, the events of the last few days could
prove to have contradictory effects on the German market.
On the positive side, bunds will benefit from disarray in other currencies -
though to a large extent, investors from outside Europe had already looked
to the D-Mark block when investing in the EC.
The result will be to buoy the currency further, helping to slow its decline
against the US dollar. A high D-Mark will make German exports less
competitive, adding to the slowing in the German economy and so making bunds
more attractive.
On the negative side, any further slowdown in Germany could exacerbate the
fiscal deficit, adding to the weight of supply in the bond market (and with
much of this year's deficit still to be financed).
Also, the sharp spike in money supply from all the ill-starred intervention
on the foreign exchanges in recent days could hold back the speed of
interest rate reductions. If the politicians decide to call it a day on
Maastricht, the pressure on Germany to cut its interest rates will also
diminish.
Against this background, the French bond market could yet turn out to be one
of the major gainers from the events of last week and yesterday's narrow
vote.
The country's strong economic fundamentals have long been recognised by
international bond investors, though their appetite for OATs has been slight
during the uncertain summer months.
With uncertainty finally out of the way - at least for the French market -
the market's fundamental attractions could return to the fore.

FT  21 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Investors wait for the dust to settle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S grudging French vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty should
allow US credit markets to focus more fully on America's domestic economic
difficulties and the chances of a further interest rate cut.
The US bond market, along with the rest of the western financial world,
spent the weekend focused on the outcome of the French vote. A French No
would probably have reinforced last week's strengthening of both the dollar
and short-dated US Treasury issues as investors moved into these traditional
safe havens.
Trading was subdued on Thursday and Friday, ahead of the vote and following
the extraordinary gyrations in European currency markets on Wednesday. Many
investors want to sit on the sidelines until the European dust settles.
Throughout last week's European crisis, US credit markets remained a haven
of relative tranquillity. On Wednesday, when the crisis broke, the long end
of the US Treasury market was knocked lower, while the short end, including
three-year notes, moved higher, in a normal response to market uncertainty.
In both cases the movements were modest, but the result was to further widen
the huge yield gap between the short and long ends. By Friday night the
yield on the benchmark 30-year issue was 7.32 per cent, up 0.03 per cent on
a week ago, while three-month treasury bills stood at 2.93 per cent, down
0.05 per cent.
Even with yesterday's Yes vote, many analysts believe that continued
uncertainty over the future of the ERM is essentially bullish for the US
fixed income market. The dollar has been rallying amid expectations that
Germany interest rates are headed lower, which will narrow the huge yield
differential between the two markets.
This is turn, goes the Wall Street consensus, will give Mr Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve, further scope to cut US interest rates.
The Fed last eased on September 4, when it knocked 25 basis points off the
Fed Funds rate. Some believe it would have liked to move more aggressively,
but was deterred by fear of weakening the dollar.
Certainly, there are still precious few signs of robust US economic growth,
though last week's batch of bad news had little effect on the market amid
the European excitements.
Retail sales fell 0.5 per cent in August, much more than expected, although
the impact of this was blunted by an upward revision in the July figures, to
a 1 per cent increase. Poor consumer confidence means a continued reluctance
to buy durable goods. Industrial production also dipped in August, with
capacity utilisation down to 78.5 per cent, compared with 79 per cent the
month before.
All this is creating widespread expectations of a further easing move by the
Fed, with analysts circling the date of October 2 as the likeliest time for
action. This is when employment data for September will be released. The
Fed's last two rate cuts occured on days when the government reported
particularly dire employment statistics.
An easing would immediately benefit the short end of the market, but the
long end faces residual concerns about inflation which may intensify in the
final weeks of the presidential election campaign if Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic nominee, sustains his lead in the opinion polls. Strongly
Republican Wall Street tends to see the Democrats as the party of inflation.
What is unclear is the extent to which the US capital markets have already
factored in the possibility of a Clinton presidency and its implications. A
view seems to be growing that whoever is the next president, the US economy
will remain so sluggish, and the budget deficit so restrictive, that
inflation will remain subdued for a long time yet.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALCEMENTI, Italy's biggest cement group, which this year became one of the
world's largest producers after buying Ciments Francais in France, has
warned of lower profits and dividends for 1992.
Mr Giampiero Pesenti, chairman, said sales for the first half of this year
rose by 4.7 per cent to L768bn (Dollars 612m). However, the group was being
held back in the home market, in which it has a share of over 30 per cent,
by slow sales and continuing price controls, which prevented it from passing
on higher costs.
Speaking at the annual meeting of Italmobiliare, his holding company, Mr
Pesenti said Italcementi's cement deliveries had grown by 4.4 per cent in
the first half, against a 6.1 per cent national average. Production, up by 4
per cent, had also lagged the national average.
Speaking of a 'static period' in the home market, Mr Pesenti forecast this
year's earnings and dividends would be overshadowed by rising costs and
lower turnover owning to falling prices.
'The dividend is bound to feel the block on prices and the rise in costs,'
Mr Pesenti told shareholders.
First half sales also slipped at Ciments Francais, acquired for L1,700bn,
with a 5 per cent decrease to FFr7.5bn (Dollars 1.45bn). Adjusted for
disposals, the fall was 1.6 per cent, and reflected the downturn in the
French economy.
Europa Metalli, the industrial arm of the Italian SMI non-ferrous metals
group, reported a fall in first half consolidated turnover to L1,567bn from
L1,610bn a year earlier, owing to the continuing drop in metals prices.

FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: DAF confirms it is in talks with
Japanese truck maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAF, the loss-making Dutch commercial vehicle maker which is already holding
negotiations on a strategic alliance with Mercedes-Benz of Germany, said
last night it was also holding co-operation talks with a Japanese truck
producer.
It is believed to be discussing collaboration, most probably for the
development and supply of components, with Hino Motors, one of the leading
Japanese heavy truck makers and part of the Toyota group of companies.
DAF confirmed last night that Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the DAF management
board, had held talks recently in Tokyo with a Japanese truck producer, but
it refused to disclose the identity of its partner in the talks.
Toyota, the biggest Japanese car maker, holds a direct stake of 11 per cent
in Hino with which it has been linked since 1966.
DAF, in which British Aerospace holds a 16 per cent stake, said that it had
decided 'not to reveal how substantive these talks are' with the Japanese
producer.
Confirmation of the discussions in Japan follows the disclosure last month
that DAF had begun talks on forming a 'strategic alliance' with
Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading truck maker.
It is understood that the collaboration discussions now under way with Hino
are not as far-reaching in scope as the negotiations with Mercedes-Benz.
While DAF refused publicly to name Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary
of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, as its potential
partner, Dutch trade union officials confirmed the talks between the two
companies.
DAF, which is suffering its third year of heavy losses, said last month that
discussions were 'taking place on a strategic alliance', which could lead to
a 'structural strengthening' of the group.
An equity stake was under consideration and the negotiations included talks
on exchanging products, co-operation in product development and sharing of
production.
Mercedes-Benz admitted that discussions were under way, but it insisted that
the talks only concerned the creation of a 'customer/supplier relationship'
between the two.
Hino's presence in Europe has been limited to small-volume assembly of its
trucks in Ireland.

HONGKONG Land, one of the colony's leading property investment and
development companies, has reported a 3.7 per cent rise in net profits to
USDollars 152.8m for the first half to June, up from Dollars 147.3m a year
earlier, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Earnings per share for the half year
were 5.84 cents, up from 5.75 cents. The directors recommended a rise in the
interim dividend to 3 cents a share from 2.85 cents. Turnover slipped to
Dollars 194.3m from Dollars 195.1m.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said the company was likely to show similar
profits growth for the rest of the year.
'Although open market rentals in Hong Kong are again showing some increase,
the effect of the group's three-year rent review cycle means that the profit
growth in the full year is unlikely to be markedly different from that in
the first six months,' Mr Keswick said.
Occupancy in the group's office properties remained at 97 per cent, while
open market rents had shown a modest increase since the start of the year.
Hongkong Land is one third owned by Jardine Strategic, which in turn is 52
per cent owned by Jardine Matheson.

issue to repay debt

<TEXT>
SHANGHAI Vacuum Electron Device, the Chinese maker of television tubes and
domestic fluorescent lamps, will seek approval at a shareholders' meeting on
Wednesday to raise Yn600m (Dollars 107m) through a rights issue to repay
bank debt, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Quoting the official China Daily, the agency said Shanghai Vacuum would also
seek agreement for a share split and to revise the scope of its business.
The stock split would give each share a face value of Yn10 compared with the
present Yn100.
The company, which dominates the Shanghai stock market, expects to add Yn40m
to its annual profits by reducing bank interest charges, according to Mr Xue
Wenhai, chairman. He said the share split would reduce the company's
price/earnings ratio and make the stock more attractive to local investors.
Shanghai Vacuum was the first Chinese company to offer special B shares for
foreign investors.
However, the B shares have plunged in recent weeks along with other similar
issues because supply has swamped demand.
Mr Xue said the price of the rights issue would be decided by the People's
Bank of China, the market regulator. The China Daily made no mention of the
ratio of the proposed rights issue.
Mr Xue said profits in the first eight months of this year reached Yn45m and
the company would have no problem hitting its profit target of Yn72m for the
full year.
To expand the scope of its business, Mr Xue said Shanghai Vacuum was holding
talks with two Japanese companies about introducing technology and equipment
to produce picture tube screens. He did not name the companies.

MICROSOFT, the US personal computer software developer, is continuing to
co-operate with a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) probe into alleged
anti-competitive actions, the company has confirmed.
This follows a report that the FTC may soon file charges of 'exclusionary
behaviour' against the company.
'Microsoft is in frequent contact with the FTC on the investigation of
Microsoft. We continue to believe that the company has done nothing wrong,'
it said. Microsoft had previously acknowledged it was subject to an FTC
anti-trust probe.
Microsoft shares fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 79 7/8 on Friday, following
publication of the report in Business Week magazine.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has frequently expressed incredulity that
the FTC could find any wrongdoing by his company. However, executives at
several of Microsoft's competitors who say they have been interviewed by FTC
investigators, are convinced Microsoft has used its dominant role in the
personal computer software market unfairly to prevent competition.
As the supplier of Dos and Windows, the most widely used personal computer
operating systems programs, Microsoft has a dominant position in that
market. The Seattle-based company is also gaining market share in the
applications programs market.

HEWLETT-Packard (HP) is taking a Dollars 544m one-time charge before tax to
adopt a revised method of accounting for the cost of medical insurance for
retired employees.
The accounting change will result in a Dollars 332m after tax reduction in
fiscal 1992 earnings.
HP is one of several US corporations that have adopted the new rule, set
down by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which requires companies
to include in their accounts the long-term costs of medical benefits
obligations.
HP's first-quarter earnings, originally reported as Dollars 306m, or Dollars
1.21 per share, have been restated as losses of Dollars 30m to reflect the
charge.
Additional 1992 expenses, as a result of the accounting change, will be
approximately Dollars 23m pre-tax.

SIR ROBERT Jones, executive chairman of Robt. Jones Investments (RJI) of New
Zealand, announced his retirement at Friday's annual meeting.
Sir Robert founded the company 10 years ago, and built it into the biggest
listed property group in Australia and New Zealand, although he had it
delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1990 following a dispute.
Sir Robert, 53, said he was retiring to 'go fishing and write books'.
He said his departure would save the company money, a reference to his
substantial management contract.
After Sir Robert's resignation, the New Zealand Stock Exchange surveillance
panel censured him and Mr David Moriarty, RJI managing director, over their
handling of a number of property deals.

PROGRESSIVE Enterprises, the New Zealand supermarket chain, has reported net
profits before abnormal items of NZDollars 26.5m (USDollars 14.4m) for the
12 months to July 26, in spite of lower than expected retail sales.
This result was 8.3 per cent ahead of Progressive's flotation forecast in
May, when it was sold by Coles Myer, the Australian retailer.
Comparable trading figures are available, however, because Coles Myer
retained a number of the former Progressive group's assets, including the K
mart retail chain.
Mr David Sadler, chairman, said the better than forecast result reflected
the benefits of the company's cost reduction programme, and a lower tax
charge due to losses from previous years.
Total retail sales were 3.6 per cent lower than forecast at NZDollars
1.003bn, largely due to a slow recovery in the Auckland market. Mr Sadler
said growth would come from new stores throughout the North Island over the
coming months.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Dan-Air parent and Virgin in merger talks: Joint venture
could provide one solution to UK-based airline's financial problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVIES &amp; Newman Holdings, owner of Dan-Air, the UK-based airline, has begun
preliminary merger discussions with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic
airline. This follows the collapse of talks between Dan-Air's parent and
British Airways earlier this month.
Davies &amp; Newman is interested in finding a buyer or in forming a partnership
with another airline to stave off financial difficulties.
The UK recession has had a severe effect on the airline. Davies &amp; Newman is
expected to show a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 7m in 1992. At the time of
its refinancing a year ago it forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m.
British Airways is understood to have held 'very detailed discussions' with
Dan-Air over several months about either a merger or some form of
partnership, according to one City of London source. The talks were called
off about a week ago and no formal reason for ending discussions was given.
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, was unavailable for comment
yesterday.
A merger or partnership would provide one solution to Dan-Air's financial
problems. Although the group has very little borrowings at the end of the
peak travel season, its position deteriorates during winter. This raises
questions over whether its Pounds 35m borrowing facility will prove
sufficient and whether it will breach a banking covenant linked to 1992
profits.
A return to the market to raise funds looks unlikely because the share price
has fallen well below the 50p rescue issue price.
Davies &amp; Newman came close to collapse a year ago, but was refloated in
October 1991 with a Pounds 49.3m share issue. The group reported a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 35.4m in 1991.
Mr David James, the company doctor-chairman, warned in May that weak
economic growth would have an adverse effect on the airline. 'In our listing
particulars we drew attention to the fact that passenger traffic generally
grows at twice the rate of gross domestic product. Whereas we had adopted
the widely expected GDP growth of 2.6 per cent to give passenger growth of
5.2 per cent, the growth so far in 1992 has been negligible.'
Dan-Air's attractions to a would-be buyer include its strong position at
Gatwick airport and its range of European routes. It is Europe's 12th
largest airline.
Its share price has recovered in the past few weeks from a low of 11p. At
Friday's close of 19p, its market value was Pounds 21.8m.
A recent buyer of the shares said the gamble was more to do with a possible
deal with another airline than on recovery hopes behind the rescue share
issue.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: World Bank's spotlight on Russia's woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upheaval last week in the European currency markets was spectacular.
But on the Richter scale of economic convulsions, the forced realignments in
the European Monetary System and the unprecedented decisions to release
sterling and the Italian lira from their obligations in the European
exchange rate mechanism must still rank some way below the economic crisis
engulfing Russia.
The finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries
heard something of these problems when Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy
prime minister for foreign affairs, and other Russian officials joined their
meeting on Saturday.
But for a comprehensive and deeply disturbing account of the problems
confronting the former Soviet republic, western governments would be well
advised to read a new World Bank study on Russia due to be released later
this week.
The study, which runs to more than 300 pages with technical appendices and
statistics, is up to date. Russia only became a World Bank member in June.
The report takes into account developments since then and was discussed with
the Russian authorities in Moscow earlier this month.
It makes clear that the former Soviet republic is facing problems of almost
unfathomable proportions and the outlook is for conditions to worsen rather
than improve.
Inflation this year is expected to be around 1,500 per cent, far more than
in other reforming socialist countries. Poland, for example, experienced 250
per cent inflation in 1990.
Output in real terms has fallen between 30 per cent and 40 per cent since
1989, according to World Bank estimates. The output drop over the past 12
months alone has been about 15 per cent.
Import volumes have plummeted - by 50 per cent last year - and the bank
expects a further fall of about 20 per cent this year. Exports this year are
expected to be about half the levels of 1990. Oil exports, which fell by 50
per cent last year, are expected to decline further in 1992, by around 11
per cent in volume.
The warnings in the report are stark. 'Slippages and missteps can be
expected and have occurred' in Russia's economic reform programme.
Implementation of structural and institutional reforms, other than price
liberalisation, has lagged. There is a danger the managers of Russia's
fiscal and monetary policy 'will be unable to resist the pressures for a
major relaxation' of policy.
'The risks are immense,' including 'a slide into hyperinflation, a decline
in output to an unsustainable level, or both, along with the political
implications of the failure of the economic reform process'. Moreover, says
the bank, 'the government is now reaching a stage where its commitment to
the reform process will be severely tested' because the scope for relatively
painless adjustments has been exhausted.
Not all the administrative problems are on the Russian side, however. Tucked
away in its pages is recognition that the industrial countries'
co-ordination of support such as technical assistance has not been as good
as it might have been. The G7 on Saturday took steps to resolve this problem
by urging the World Bank to form a special support group for Russia to
discuss bilateral and multilateral technical assistance.
So far, as the World Bank noted, the Russian people have born their troubles
with remarkable patience. This is partly because real wages have held up
well in spite of the high inflation. Real wages are roughly at the level of
1987.
Another reason is that employment fell only about 1 per cent last year. But
the next phase of the reform process will have to address the problems of
the labour force and industrial restructuring which will mean inevitable
sharp increases in unemployment and idle plants. With perhaps 3m to 4m
people likely to lose their jobs within a year, the World Bank insists that
a social safety net should be a high priority.
The report cannot hide underlying scepticism about the central state's
ability to prevent plans slipping and unravelling. 'Russia is facing a
crisis of governance,' the bank says. 'A major effort is needed to develop a
capacity to govern and implement economic policy.'
In the meantime, Russia's industrialised creditor nations will have to
accept some messy compromises. For example, the report warns that achieving
policy goals such as lower inflation will take longer than anticipated.
Knowing where to compromise is a big problem facing the industrialised
world. At the weekend, Lady Thatcher appealed to the G7 and IMF not to be
too tough on Russia. The Russian people had a larger task on their hands
than any ever known in the West. If their efforts to create a free
enterprise society were to end in chaos 'they will turn away from democracy
to another strong man,' she said.
Another, opposite view came last week from Mr Horst Schulmann, managing
director of the Institute for International Finance, the Washington-based
organisation owned by commercial banks to monitor sovereign debtors. He
urged the Paris Club of creditor nations not to reschedule Russia's foreign
debts without securing improvements in its economic and financial policies.
The importance of settling Russia's foreign debt problems is considerable.
The World Bank report estimates the country will need to mobilise some
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.2bn) a year of external financial resources for the
next few years to support the reforms. Russia's external financial
requirement is put at about Dollars 23bn this year with a comparable amount
thought necessary in 1993.
About two thirds of this will come from export credit agencies, through
bilateral aid packages or from multilateral institutions such as the World
Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Deferral of
debt and rescheduling of Russia's debt service obligations are expected to
provide the rest.

FT  21 SEP 92 / City jitters sour Tesco's share price: The UK's second
biggest grocery chain is believed to have suffered more than its rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City of London is convinced something is awry at Tesco. The problem is
no-one is sure exactly what.
Over the past few months, the share price of the UK's second biggest grocery
chain has fallen more than 15 per cent relative to the market as a
succession of ugly rumours has swept through the City. Tesco's market value
is now more than Pounds 3bn, less than Sainsbury's Pounds 7.6bn.
All food retailers have had a difficult summer because of sticky sales
volumes, consumer uncertainty caused by the lingering recession and sharp
food price deflation. But it is widely believed Tesco has suffered more than
most.
'The industry numbers have been lousy. The Institute of Grocery Distribution
figures have been slightly negative with everybody else saying they are up.
There has to be a big loser for the sums to add up and the fear is that it
is Tesco,' says Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at stockbrokers Morgan Stanley.
Tesco's interim results presentation tomorrow will therefore be viewed as a
crunch moment for the company and - perhaps - for the industry as a whole.
Although Tesco's figures are likely to be perfectly respectable with margins
widening and pre-tax profits climbing from Pounds 229.6m to between Pounds
245m and Pounds 255m, the City's attention will focus rigorously on the
company's trading performance since the beginning of August.
Are there signs of the company's prodigious growth record - which has seen
profits grow over the past five years from Pounds 219m to Pounds 546m -
beginning to stall? Is the company's near-Pounds 1bn a year capital spending
programme - most of it on new stores - in danger of faltering?
'My feeling is that either Tesco will say something that will knock all the
rumours on the head and send the share price 10 per cent to 15 per cent
higher or their reputation will take a knock that will endure for some time
to come,' says Mr Paul Smiddy, food retailing analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
The jitteriness is understandable given the vast sums at stake. In February
1991 Tesco tapped the stock market for Pounds 572m to help fund its
development programme. Its move was followed by rights issues from J.
Sainsbury, Argyll Group (owners of Safeway), Wm Morrison and Asda. Between
them they took Pounds 1.8bn from their shareholders. What returns these
funds will generate is clearly a matter of great concern.
Analysts argue that Tesco's sales are under more pressure than those of its
rivals for a variety of reasons. Tesco, they say, is more exposed to sales
of low-margin petrol and non-food items, such as clothes. Its normally
aggressive marketing promotions have been suspiciously quiet. Its stores,
many far bigger than those of its rivals, are located in some of the
economically worst-hit areas of the country.
The shopping habits of some of its customers - dubbed Thatcher's Children -
who live in outer-metropolitan areas have proved more fickle than those of
Sainsbury's and Safeway's more steadfast shoppers.
However, analysts will be most interested in the performance of Tesco's
newly opened stores, which anecdotal evidence suggests have been trading
below expectations.
Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite,
says: 'In the long view Tesco is a superb company with superb prospects. But
if it really is the case that it has difficulties with sales progress at its
new stores then that is potentially a very serious problem.'
Over the past few years, the big supermarket groups have developed highly
sophisticated computer modelling techniques to predict a new store's sales
patterns. By using a mass of demographic information - such as the local
population's size, age, income and levels of car and home ownership - they
were able to forecast the likely turnover of any store.
Until recently it was Tesco's proud boast that its sales forecasts were
never wrong by more than 5 per cent. And with such a high degree of
accuracy, the company was happy to spend up to Pounds 35m on a new
superstore, confident it could rely on a predictable stream of cash to
generate its investment returns and provide funds for future expansion.
Tesco's plans envisaged the addition of 25 new superstores a year for the
next four years.
But the widespread suspicion in the City is that for some - as yet
unaccountable - reason Tesco's 'holy grail' has been poisoned. New store
sales are believed to have been disappointing and even a small reduction in
the expected volume can have a disproportionate effect on a store's
profitability because of its high and rigid fixed operating costs.
Tesco has been unable to dispel such fears because it has been bound by the
normal Stock Exchange conventions which prevent it from commenting ahead of
its results. But its reaction tomorrow will be keenly awaited.
The company may simply press ahead aggressively with its store opening
programme arguing that the sales hiccup is simply a temporary
recession-induced aberration - which may be eased anyway by sterling's
effective devaluation and a slowing of food price deflation.
Alternatively, Tesco may begin to scale back on its site development
programme and look for more attractive investment opportunities elsewhere
either by expanding its Metro chain of high street stores or moving into
another retailing sector altogether. It has also been intensively
investigating opportunities abroad.
'It will be fascinating to see how Tesco reacts to its recent problems. The
astonishing quietness on the marketing front implies that there has been a
pause for serious thought,' says Mr Bubb of Morgan Stanley.
No-one can yet be sure whether the recent sales malaise is merely a
temporary phenomenon caused by recession and the sharp price deflation for
food or a symptom of more ominous industry trends.
Tesco's combative chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin can certainly be relied upon to
come out tomorrow with all guns blazing. But it will be more than normally
interesting to see in which direction the barrels will be pointing.

<TEXT>
TECHNICALLY, THE French electorate has ratified the Maastricht treaty. In
reality, it has saved the European Community.
The treaty in the precise form that it was signed last February is almost
certainly already past saving. The task now facing European leaders is,
first, to decide how much they really want to save and, second, to devise a
way of doing it. Ironically enough, that is what many of those advocating
rejection of the treaty, in France and elsewhere, have said they want to
happen. But had the majority of French voters taken their advice the chances
of saving anything would have been much less. Not only would the treaty
itself have been junked wholesale: many of the EC's earlier achievements, if
not its very existence, might have been jeopardised, in an atmosphere of
which last week's recriminations gave an unpleasant foretaste.
The treaty as it stands is past saving for several reasons. First, the Danes
have already rejected it. They show no sign of changing their mind, and even
if they do so it may not be possible for them to vote again on an unaltered
text. Second, the forced departure of Britain and Italy from the exchange
rate mechanism has shown that the convergence criteria for economic and
monetary union are most unlikely to be met by more than at most an inner
core of north-central European countries. Third, in the course of the
referendum campaign France's leaders have said things, both about Germany
and about the purpose of Emu, which have strengthened the rapidly growing
misgivings in Germany about the whole project.
Public opinion
All year, but especially since the Danish vote on June 2, a revolt of public
opinion has been apparent throughout Europe. Not one of the 12 governments
in the EC could now claim to have gained popularity or authority since
signing the treaty; nearly all of them have lost both. Greatest of all,
perhaps, has been the loss for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government in
Germany, whose promises that no one would be worse off for reunification
have been revealed, at least in the short term, as cruelly false. The
authority that enabled Mr Kohl, a year ago, to impose a timetable for Emu on
a clearly reluctant Bundesbank is simply not there any more.
The Yes vote in France accords these 12 discredited leaders a breathing
space. But for one of them, Mr John Major, it makes a desperately difficult
domestic situation even more difficult. He cannot now put the whole
Maastricht episode behind him, as he must privately have hoped to do.
Instead he has to continue defending, before a deeply sceptical audience, a
platform from which the central plank - Britain's ERM membership - has
already been knocked out. And yet it is to him, as current president, that
falls the immediate task of convening his fellow heads of government to
search for a new way forward.
Common interests
Mr Major has done the right thing in calling a summit, but its agenda cannot
be simply the ratification or implementation of Maastricht. The heads of
government should agree to put that on one side for the moment, and proceed
as their predecessors did 42 years ago under the guidance of Jean Monnet.
Rather than seeking to score national points at each other's expense, they
must consider what they believe to be the interests that all of them have in
common.
It should not be too difficult for them to agree that all want to see the
single market become a reality. If that were achieved, many of the monetary
tensions felt so painfully this year could be reduced, since economic
conditions in one part of the market would work through into other parts
more swiftly, and so monetary policies required in one member would be less
inappropriate for the rest.
They might also agree that it is politically unhealthy for the monetary
policies of all member states to be dictated, in practice, by the national
authorities of one of them. At least the question could be put in that form
to the Germans and, if they did agree, they could be asked to help devise a
system which would avoid that, whether or not it was intended to bring about
a single currency at the end of the day.
And the 12 could surely agree that they all want to see a community or union
which interferes as little as possible in the internal affairs of its
members, but defends their common interests effectively vis-a-vis the
outside world, under democratic supervision. They would, perhaps, end up
producing a treaty not unlike Maastricht, but simpler, more coherent, and
above all easier for the peoples of Europe to understand and accept.
Meanwhile, there is plenty of work for them to get on with, notably in
completing the Uruguay round and in offering more effective support to
central and eastern Europe, before other countries of that region follow
Yugoslavia into the abyss.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The ERM's future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL margin in favour of the Maastricht treaty in the French referendum
should keep the ERM alive. This is not because ratification of the
Maastricht treaty itself, still less smooth progress towards economic and
monetary union, have become certain. It is because the French people have
demonstrated, however grudgingly, that there remains a majority in favour of
European co-operation. On that a two-tier ERM should be able to stand, but
it will do so only if the Bundesbank shows a greater commitment to the
system than it did last week.
Events have confirmed that a semi-fixed exchange rate system has evident
weaknesses. The nature of the frailty is also clear. The managers of a
currency under severe pressure can never save it on their own. After a
certain point, they will run out of reserves. Since operators in the markets
know that, they are bound to win any serious battle.
The durability of the hugely higher interest rates - 500 per cent overnight
in the case of Sweden - that are sometimes needed to defend a frail currency
lacks credibility. It is impossible to believe that the government of most
countries would be able to endure the ensuing slump. What is believed will
be difficult at some time in the future swiftly becomes impossible today.
The credibility of the parity depends partly, therefore, on the will of the
authorities responsible for the weaker currency to defend it and on the
credibility of their commitment to impose whatever interest rates may be
required for as long as proves necessary. But the parity depends rather more
on the perceived willingness of those responsible for the stronger currency
to defend the parity as well. The governments of Italy and the UK failed all
these tests. But France - in addition to the other core ERM countries, which
includes at least the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg - need not.
Nevertheless, the narrowness of the French vote, in addition to the
dwindling likelihood of Emu, is bound to shake the market's previous faith
in the determination of this and future French governments to defend the
parity. The economic conflicts within Europe consequent upon German
unification also continue. The ERM may now be more secure than feared last
week. But it is far from secure.
It now rests overwhelmingly on the Germans to remove these doubts. Should
the Bundesbank, fresh from its victories over the Italians and the British,
demonstrate that it is absolutely committed to maintaining the present
parity for the French franc, regardless of the short-term effect on the
German money supply, then that parity will stand. The Bundesbank can never
run out of D-Marks, since it is the ultimate producer of that particular
piece of paper. If it is not so committed, then no parity can be secure
under the pressure that currency markets are now able to exert.
This is not just an economic issue, however technocratically the Bundesbank
might like to address the matter. It is a political one. Emu or no Emu,
Maastricht or no Maastricht, Germany needs friends.
The Bundesbank should be more than content with the victories that its
determination and events have now delivered. It has obtained the D-Mark
appreciation it sought and from that will come some of the disinflation that
it has long desired. The principle that the ERM is a system of adjustable
exchange rates has been re-established. The Bundesbank is also in an
excellent position to resist the imposition of Emu by a German government
that has been seriously weakened by its past policy errors. In addition, the
EMS has been definitively established in two tiers, with little prospect
that the frailer brethren will be allowed to join Emu, should it occur.
Enough is enough. France has at least not rejected the alliance with
Germany. The Bundesbank would be well advised to rest on its laurels and
return the favour.

toll in human suffering and economic damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of the flooding which has struck Pakistan in the past week is most
easily visible from the air.
Where there was rich agricultural land in the central province of Punjab,
only trees can be seen, their trunks under water. On high ground are
remaining patches of crops. Peasants gathered on roof-tops appear to be
stranded on tiny islands in an ocean. It seems miraculous that weak
buildings made out of mud, straw and wood are holding up. River boats
carrying troops speed across the water in search of victims caught on high
ground or roof-tops, along with their meagre belongings and livestock.
The cost of the disaster, caused by torrential rain which swelled the Indus,
Chenab, Jehlum and Ravi rivers, is still being calculated, but
rehabilitation will be lengthy and expensive. Initial estimates of up to
2,000 deaths have been lowered to about 1,000. Hundreds of thousands have
been affected, and the damage is enormous.
An official in the central city of Multan said: 'This is the worst crisis
I've seen in years. Who knows how long and how much money it will take to
repair the damage?'
Across from the sher shah bund, a protective mud boundary created to protect
the historic Islamic city, the destruction is obvious as far as the eye can
see. Field after field of crop land is submerged under water which came
through a 20-metre wide breach in the boundary. Relief workers had to
dynamite that portion to let the water flood farmland rather than let the
pressure build up where it could break through the boundary and enter the
city.
Victims either lost their mud homes or ran out of food and tried to swim to
land. Some were forced to climb tree-tops out of fear of being drowned, and
had to stay there for a day before being rescued. A large crowd of people
has gathered to wait for friends and family members who may be stranded in
the flooded area.
Less than a mile away, relief workers are trying to strengthen the train
tracks by lining rocks and sand-bags alongside the rails.
The cost of the disaster will put pressure on Pakistan's economy. The
province of Punjab estimates its losses at Rs16bn (Dollars 640m), and the
other three provinces - North West Frontier, the territory of Azad Kashmir
and Sindh - are still calculating. Agriculture has taken the worst beating.
Pakistan had expected to produce up to 14m bales of cotton this year, up
from last year's 13m. But the latest estimates are that production will fall
to 11.5m.
Cotton is by far Pakistan's most important product, with exports of cotton
and its products accounting for 58 per cent of the country's Dollars 6.8bn
of exports last year.
A drop in exports could threaten Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's drive to
introduce free market reforms, replacing the former socialist bureaucracy.
The programme depends on boosting exports to maintain both foreign exchange
reserves and economic growth.
Severe damage to the cotton crop is expected in the southern province of
Sindh. Up to 60 per cent of the 1.5m acres of land sown to cotton in Sindh
is expected to be destroyed by a combination of torrential rains last month
and the present floods. In the province of Punjab, up to 1m acres out of 7m
sown to cotton are estimated to be destroyed.
Pakistan has not so far launched an international appeal for assistance
though it has accepted voluntary donations - Japan has offered Dollars
800,000, Britain Dollars 200,000 and the United Nations Dollars 100,000.
However, some officials believe that as the costs of rehabilitation mount,
the government will need to ask for outside help.
Mr Sharif, who has been touring affected areas by helicopter, has announced
Rs1bn of relief for Moslem victims and Rs250m for non-Moslems. Interest on
agricultural loans of up to 20,000 rupees (Dollars 800) from state-owned
banks has been written off, and borrowers have been given an additional year
to pay back their loans.
The government's handling of the crisis has been criticised by opposition
leader Benazir Bhutto. In Pakistan's volatile democracy, some politicians in
Mr Sharif's ruling coalition are worried that the disaster could provide
ammunition to the opposition. But there are few signs so far of public
unrest.
However, the government will be left with some difficult problems. In the
short term, there is not only rehabilitation and reconstruction, but also
the possibility of outbreaks of epidemics from stagnant water. In the longer
term it will come under pressure to improve flood management techniques.
Officials say deforestation has intensified environmental problems. The
official estimate is that just over 5 per cent of Pakistan is forested. But
officials concede that the figure is a legal description of areas set aside
for forests and does not reflect the destruction of trees to meet the needs
of a rapidly growing population.
Pakistan and India would benefit from joint efforts to increase forestation
in their northern areas, to combat environmental problems. But given the
tension in their relations, there are few signs that such an effort could be
launched.

FT  21 SEP 92 / An issue that won't go away: World capacity to reprocess
nuclear waste is expanding, but storage may now be a better alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the coming winter, workmen will be putting the finishing touches to a
cavernous new plant at Sellafield on the Cumbrian coast, the main facility
of the state-owned British Nuclear Fuels. When it begins operating next
spring, the Pounds 1.85bn project will have the capacity to take in 1,200
tonnes of spent nuclear fuel a year, separate out the uranium and plutonium,
and transform the remaining waste into a form of glass which can be poured
into steel containers, where it sets rock hard for long-term disposal.
Across the English Channel at La Hague, on a windy headland near Cherbourg,
the French are expanding a similar facility to handle 1,600 tonnes a year.
And on the other side of the world, the Japanese have broken ground for a
plant of their own near Aomori on the northern tip of Honshu. The
Rokkasho-mura facility will handle 800 tonnes a year when it comes on stream
early next century.
All this suggests that the nuclear industry is finally getting to grips with
the problem of dangerous waste created by burning nuclear fuel. In the
history of nuclear power since the second world war, only one-third of the
120,000 tonnes of fuel discharged by reactors has been reprocessed.
Two-thirds, or 80,000 tonnes of it, lies in deep ponds of water or other
temporary storage, awaiting decisions about its final resting place.
But the reality is somewhat different. Even as all these new plants near
completion, questions are increasingly being asked about the wisdom - and
the huge cost - of reprocessing.
Earlier this year, Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned operator of two nuclear
power stations in Scotland, confirmed plans to explore long-term storage of
spent fuel as an alternative to reprocessing. 'We could save Pounds 43m a
year,' says Mr James Hann, SN's chairman, who believes that nuclear power
must slash its costs if it is to have any future. A public inquiry begins
shortly into SN's application to build a dry store to hold spent fuel for
half a century.
Nuclear Electric, which runs the 12 nuclear power stations in England and
Wales, recently signed a Pounds 13bn contract with BNF to reprocess fuel
from its existing Magnox and advanced gas-cooled reactors over the next 15
years. But beyond that, NE remains non-committal. It has built enough
storage capacity at Sizewell B, the large pressurised water reactor nearing
completion on the Suffolk coast, to house spent fuel for half the plant's
planned 40-year life.
NE's position is that, while reprocessing is appropriate for older plants
such as Magnox, because the spent fuel is corrosive, it is an expensive
option for newer technologies which discharge more manageable waste.
Germany has abandoned plans to build a reprocessing plant for a variety of
economic and environmental reasons. The US is not even contemplating
reprocessing. Government policy is to develop a long-term fuel repository
under Yucca Mountain in Nevada. But the project has encountered such strong
environmental resistance that it may never come about. The US Department of
Energy says that exploration of the site will take at least seven more
years.
The case for reprocessing has traditionally rested on three points. One is
military - it produces the plutonium needed for nuclear weapons. The only
reprocessing that has taken place in the US and the former Soviet Union is
for military purposes. The bulk of these countries' spent nuclear fuel has
only a temporary store.
The second reason for reprocessing is as a means of recycling uranium, until
recently a commodity in short supply. The third is to facilitate long-term
disposal; reprocessing separates waste into three levels of radiation risk -
high, intermediate and low - and only the first needs the most secure
storage.
But with the changed economic and political climate, the first two reasons
have weakened considerably. The need for plutonium - at least for military
purposes - has declined, and uranium has become plentiful, mainly because of
large exports from Russia, and is likely to remain so as nuclear weapons are
dismantled.
Meanwhile, the environmental lobby has mounted a campaign claiming that
reprocessing is an uneconomic way of dealing with spent fuel, because it
actually creates more waste through contamination of the equipment needed to
carry out the work, and it still leaves the world with the problem of
dealing with the end products.
A report by Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, earlier this year
concluded that reprocessing 'offers no benefits over alternative management
strategies for spent nuclear fuel, and produces significantly higher
economic and environmental costs'.
Added to this is the suspicion that the UK and France have upgraded their
reprocessing industries only because they existed already. They have also
found that reprocessing other people's waste can be made into a lucrative
business. The Sellafield plant, known as Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant
(Thorp), is fully booked for the next 10 years, and 40 per cent booked for
the 10 years after that. More than two-thirds of this business comes from
abroad. Cogema, the French state company which operates La Hague, is
similarly replete with orders, although in its case only half of the
business is foreign because of the heavy needs of France's own large nuclear
power industry.
Having made these huge investments, both these companies strongly resist
claims that storage provides a cheaper alternative. 'It's an unproven
route,' says Mr John Guinness, the newly appointed chairman of British
Nuclear Fuels, who observed the company closely in his previous job as
permanent secretary at the Department of Energy. He describes Scottish
Nuclear's preference for dry storage as no more than 'a sensible way of
keeping their options open'.
Mr Christian Gobert, the executive vice-president of Cogema, is more
forceful still about the storage option: 'You have done nothing. You have
taken a few measures which are not costly. You can forget it for a
generation. That's very comfortable but you have no final solution.'
The more technical argument for reprocessing is the extraction of plutonium.
Although the military requirement is declining, plutonium remains an
essential fuel for fast breeder reactors. But the fast breeder has an
uncertain future. The UK has just decided to cease funding its prototype at
Dounreay. In France, the nuclear installations inspectorate has blocked a
restart of the troubled Superphenix reactor which is spearheading the French
fast breeder programme.
At the moment, only Japan has a significant fast breeder programme, which
gives it a reason to proceed with the Rokkasho-mura plant. Mr Masato
Nakamura, of the nuclear fuel division of the Atomic Energy Bureau, says:
'We have never considered storage in place of reprocessing. Our view is that
Japan is a resource-poor nation, so we have to make use of a valuable
material.'
An alternative use for plutonium is in mixed oxide fuel (MOX), a cocktail of
fuels including plutonium which can be used in conventional nuclear power
stations. Up to 25 French stations could use it, according to Mr Gobert.
Even so, this potential source of demand for plutonium may not justify the
expense of reprocessing because of the large surplus of plutonium which is
building up. The Uranium Institute, a trade group, estimates that US and
Russian stockpiles of plutonium amount to more than 200 tonnes, and of
highly enriched uranium to about 1,000 tonnes.
Increasingly, though, the debate about reprocessing turns on environmental
considerations. The critics of reprocessing emphasise the dangers of
transporting nuclear waste sometimes half way round the world to the
reprocessing site, the radiation risks at the site itself, and the fact that
reprocessing still leaves an end product to be disposed.
Although both BNF and Cogema operate a policy of returning the processed
waste to their clients, they only ship back high-level waste because it is
easier and safer to transport. To compensate for the smaller volume, they
ship back slightly more high-level waste than they take in. But this still
leaves them with bulky low-level waste to dispose of. So even though neither
Sellafield nor La Hague is strictly a 'nuclear dustbin', where foreign
clients can dump their nuclear rubbish and forget about it, both sites have
to store considerable amounts of waste.
Mr Gobert rejects the accusation that the act of reprocessing actually adds
to the waste. He says that UP3, the newest facility at La Hague, produces
'no more waste than direct disposal, and we know we can do better than
that'. Mr Guinness says: 'What we are doing is socially desirable. We are
also making quite a lot of money. Taking the longer view, our children will
be mighty grateful that we have taken this course.'
However, both the UK and France do have to have final storage sites for the
end products of reprocessing. In the UK this is the responsibility of Nirex,
a company jointly owned by the government and the nuclear industry, which is
trying to obtain permission for a deep underground site next to Sellafield.
Despite the misgivings about reprocessing, it is unlikely that their state
owners will take a negative view of Sellafield and La Hague. Both plants
have been financed with money from their clients, so they place no burden on
state budgets. And their bulging order books promise healthy export earnings
for many years. Both companies make profits, although the adequacy of their
returns will not be fully tested until their new plants can show their
paces. If they are commercially successful, their owners could invite in
private investors.
In the long-term context in which the nuclear industry likes to see itself,
it may be misleading to see the debate in terms of storage representing an
alternative to reprocessing. At the moment, world reprocessing capacity
amounts to about 4,000 tonnes a year, according to the International Atomic
Energy Agency. However, the amount of spent fuel discharged each year is
about 9,000 tonnes. Although reprocessing capacity is expected to rise to
6,800 tonnes by the year 2000, spent fuel discharges will still exceed this.
Far from clearing up the backlog, the reprocessing industry will fall
steadily behind, even with its enlarged capacity. Long-term storage,
therefore, must play the leading role.

<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the UK aero-engine maker, is forming a company in Canada to
develop and manufacture an industrial version of its Trent 800 turbofan
aircraft engine in co-operation with Westinghouse Electric.
The total cost of the venture will be CDollars 140m (Pounds 66m) of which
CDollars 17m will be in the form of interest-free loans from the federal and
Quebec governments.
The net cost to Rolls-Royce will be reduced, however, by various investment
tax credits.
The company, to be called Rolls-Royce Gas Turbine Engines Canada, will be
located near Montreal and will initially employ 50 engineers.
Rolls-Royce already has a substantial presence in Canada, with subsidiaries
employing 3,250 people and annual revenues of more than CDollars 500m.
Rolls-Royce said the engine, with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts,
will be designed for industrial power generation and for utilities requiring
peak-hour generating capacity.

FT  21 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TVS founder attacks terms of US cable bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES Gatward, founder and former chief executive of TVS Entertainment,
yesterday criticised the terms of a proposed takeover by International
Family Entertainment, the US cable television company, saying it failed to
reflect the company's true value.
Mr Gatward, who was ousted from his position at TVS in February 1991, said
he had already been in contact with some of the company's private
shareholders and expected to talk to others this week about the terms of the
takeover.
International Family Entertainment last week offered Pounds 38.2m to acquire
TVS, the ITV company which lost its licence. The deal is worth 25p per
ordinary share and 45p per preference share, and has the support of 30 per
cent of shareholders.
Mr Gatward is one of the largest private shareholders in TVS with 350,000
ordinary shares (out of a total of about 60m shares). He said the US cable
television company's offer undervalued TVS, pointing out that at the end of
1991 TVS had net assets of Pounds 47.4m.
International Family Entertainment is buying TVS primarily for MTM, its US
production company which is responsible for programmes such as Hill Street
Blues.
MTM has been a thorn in TVS's side. Last year pre-tax losses jumped from
Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 26.7m in 1991. These included a further exceptional
provision of Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 25.1m) against the programme stock of MTM.

GT Venture Investment Company saw its basic net asset value increase from
144p to 146.2p over the 12 months to June 30. Diluted assets improved from
137.8p to 139.7p.
Net profits were Pounds 438,000 (Pounds 468,000) for earnings per share of

The trust has reached agreement with holders of its outstanding Pounds 18.4m
nominal of convertible unsecured loan stock 1999 to redeem the stock at a
significant discount to the nominal amount plus accrued premium totalling
Pounds 20.2m.
Holders have agreed to cancellation of conversion rights and interest will
become payable annually instead of being rolled up. As a consequence the
company warned that there would have to a substantial reduction in future
dividend payments.
The company is planning to change its name to Pantheon International
Participations.

FT  21 SEP 92 / UK Company News: The dilemma facing food's rag and bone men
 -Fresh doubts are emerging about prospects for Hillsdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR five years, Sir Harry Solomon, chairman of Hillsdown Holdings, has
repeated one central message to the City. It is that the company's days of
go-go diversification are over, and from now on it will focus squarely on
developing as a food manufacturer.
By stressing long-term commitment to a stable core business, Sir Harry has
hoped to rally investor confidence, which was badly jolted when the 1987
stock market crash abruptly ended Hillsdown's brief record of meteoric,
acquisition-led, growth.
But though Hillsdown's food business has grown to the fifth largest in
Europe and 80 per cent of group sales, the message has failed to get
through. The company's Pounds 281m rights issue last autumn flopped, and its
share price has tumbled by two thirds in the past year to close at 83 1/2 p
on Friday.
Now, as recession catches up with the food industry, fresh doubts are
emerging about prospects for Hillsdown, which last week reported slightly
higher pre-tax profits but lower operating results for the first half. The
doubts turn not just on current trading performance, but on the soundness of
the company's basic strategy and business mix.
Hillsdown has followed a simple formula to grow big in food. Unable to
afford to buy companies with top brands, which can command premium prices
for their products, it has relied on acquiring and rationalising run-down
producers of basic products. One City analyst calls the company 'the rag and
bone men of the food business.'
The company has sought scale economies and efficiencies - and the volumes
needed to stand up to powerful retailers - by establishing leadership in
sectors such as poultry and red meat and building a vertically-integrated
structure from farm gate to factory.
Its skilful cost-cutting, firm management controls and continuous high
levels of investment are widely praised. However, the question is whether
its single-minded emphasis on low-cost production is enough to guarantee
sustained high margins and competitive strength in the future.
As Mr David Lang of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite puts it: 'Hillsdown
bought terrible businesses and made them half-decent. But the trick of
turning them into really good businesses has eluded the company.'
Hillsdown's dilemma is that it seems unable to outgrow its past. Though
efficient, many of its businesses remain trapped in low value-added sectors
beset by chronic excess capacity, poor margins and fierce domestic and
foreign price competition.
The problems have been underlined in chickens. In the past 18 months
continental producers - aided by more favourable tax systems, cheaper feed
and less exacting health standards than in the UK - have flooded Britain
with birds at prices which Hillsdown has difficulty matching.
In red meat, Hillsdown's slaughterhouses are under pressure from marginal UK
operators which were recently given another three years to comply with
rigorous EC hygiene rules, while the company's canning business is embroiled
in a price war.
Hillsdown has responded by doing what it knows best - acquiring and
rationalising troubled large competitors, notably Associated British Foods'
Anglia canning operations and Unigate's JP Wood poultry business.
However, while these steps were widely considered essential to safeguard
Hillsdown's business, the economics are increasingly questioned. 'Money from
last year's rights issue is going into factory closures and redundancy
payments just to protect the existing base,' says one analyst.
Furthermore, far from increasing Hillsdown's bargaining power with
supermarkets, some acquisitions have cost the company business. The Anglia
deal prompted several retailers to transfer contracts to smaller suppliers.
Hillsdown recognises that it needs to create a stronger market franchise by
putting more emphasis on product strategy. It is withdrawing from commodity
businesses such as frozen chicken and has moved into higher-value lines such
as prepared meals, sandwiches and salads.
However, it faces several challenges. Having long relied on manufacturing
efficiency as its prime competitive weapon, Hillsdown lacks a marketing
culture. Its sales of branded groceries - chiefly by the Premier and
Canadian Maple Leaf subsidiaries - are relatively small, and spending on
advertising and product support is modest.
As a consequence, its quest for higher margins will hinge on private-label
products, which retailers sell under their own name. Hillsdown is already
Britain's leading supplier of private-label goods, which provide most of its
UK food-processing revenues.
However, profits in private-label products depend less on scale than on
dedicated specialisation, agility and close co-operation with retailers.
Hillsdown has yet to match Northern Foods' - admittedly exceptional -
success in building a lucrative private-label business on long experience in
the dairy industry and a close relationship with Marks and Spencer.
Hillsdown's structure may also be becoming a handicap. Growing price
competition from abroad and the trend among UK supermarkets to shop around
Europe for commodity items such as fresh chicken make the advantages of
vertical integration increasingly questionable.
Though Hillsdown is streamlining poultry production, Mr David Newton, chief
operating officer, concedes volumes will still exceed demand for
higher-value processed items such as breaded and stuffed chicken which, in
any case, are subject to increasing competition.
Some of these weaknesses may be dealt with by further restructuring. But
others will require deeper, longer-term changes in corporate culture and
skills. Unless that challenge is met, Hillsdown's fortunes seem likely to
remain closely tied to the ups and downs of consumer spending and the
commodity cycle long after the current recession has ended.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Letter: Old CFCs present a dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From KATHERINE ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re Peter Knight's article on CFCs (Business and the Environment,
September 2), there seems to me to be absolutely no point in developing new,
greener refrigeration technology alone. How can I, as a conscientious
consumer, dispose of my old refrigerator and buy a new one knowing that it
is only when refrigerators are crushed or broken up that they become an
environmental hazard.
Without an old-for-new exchange scheme and extensive re-cycling programmes
the world is a safer place if I stick to my old refrigerator for as long as
possible.
I have the same problem with aerosols. I have 20 or so in a box in the
garage which I am unable to dispose of safely in Italy. They all contain
CFCs. What can a thoughtful consumer do; ring Friends of the Earth? I rang
London and Rome and they could give me no answer.
Why is there this huge oversight?

FT  21 SEP 92 / Where the front line meets the bottom line: South African
business is becoming directly involved in politics in a bid to restore
stability and growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When troops from the Ciskei black homeland opened fire two weeks ago on an
African National Congress (ANC) march, they risked claiming an unusual
victim - one of South Africa's leading businessmen, Mr John Hall, an
executive director of Barlow Rand, the country's largest industrial group.
Business leaders in the rest of the western world would scarcely consider it
a normal day's work to risk their lives in a political demonstration. But
for Mr Hall (who attended the march as a 'peace monitor') and for many other
South African businessmen, the notion of 'business as usual' has lost its
meaning after months of mass protest action, industrial unrest, township
violence and political deadlock.
Increasingly, business is becoming directly involved in politics, in
economic policy-making and in attempts to shape a new South Africa society.
Frustrated at the failure of politicians, white and black, to lead the way
to a post-apartheid future, businessmen are trying to fill this leadership
gap with initiatives of their own. They have decided that politics is too
important to be left to politicians, and are hoping that the institutions of
civil society - business organisations, unions and churches - can work
together to restore stability, without which economic growth is impossible.
With the economy in its worst recession since the turn of the century,
labour and business have discovered a remarkable community of interest. Both
want a rapid transition to democratic rule; both know that permanent
economic damage results from every delay in the transition.
Indeed, late in July, the two sides came within a hair's breadth of agreeing
a joint strategy to pressure the politicians to resume constitutional talks,
suspended since June. The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu),
the largest union federation, and an umbrella employers' body, the South
African Co-ordinating Committee on Labour Affairs (Saccola), drew up a draft
Charter for Peace, Democracy and Economic Reconstruction, which would have
committed labour and business to a joint programme of action to force the
pace of political transition. The charter called on both sides to 'suspend
normal economic activity' for one day, on August 3, to demonstrate for
democracy.
In the end, the fledgling coalition proved too weak to hold, and Cosatu went
ahead with a more traditional two-day national strike on its own. Those who
negotiated the charter say talks broke down over union demands that Saccola,
a private-sector body, guarantee public-sector participation. The
government, the main target of the strike, made clear the public sector
would not co-operate.
The private sector also appears to have baulked at the last moment at the
idea of business and labour 'ganging up' against the government, in favour
of the ANC, whose anti-capitalist bias worries most businessmen. And even if
the joint stoppage had gone ahead, it seems unlikely that more than a
quarter of the private sector would have participated.
Since then, relations between business and labour have deteriorated, with
several strikes dragging on and with the unions attacking business anew for
failing to pressure government for political change. Unions have long blamed
business for colluding with Pretoria in its apartheid policies, and the rank
and file remains sceptical of corporate South Africa's conversion to
non-racial democracy. And some businessmen are clearly using the recession
to reduce staff permanently.
But liberal businessmen argue that the basis has been laid for future
co-operation. They say that the charter called for far more than just one
day's strike action; it spelt out a joint commitment to curb violence,
combat poverty and seek consensus on economic restructuring.
Initiatives in these areas are already under way. At the national level,
senior businessmen are involved in the National Peace Committee, the
multi-party body which tries to mediate between political parties in
potentially violent disputes. Mr Hall, the Barlow Rand director, is chairman
of the National Peace Committee, and was heavily involved in negotiations
between the ANC, the Ciskei government and Pretoria to try to prevent the
Bisho massacre. He was in the front line of demonstrators when the firing
started.
Barlow Rand says half a dozen of the company's senior executives are
involved in regional dispute-resolution committees and other structures of
the National Peace Accord, signed a year ago by all South Africa's leading
parties in an attempt to halt violence which has left 7,000 people dead
since the ban on the ANC was lifted in 1990.
Barlows is not unusually virtuous in this regard; Companies from across the
spectrum have attempted to mediate in the violence, which disrupts
production and sometimes spills over into the workplace. Indeed, business is
often the closest thing to a neutral party in a situation where political
rivalries inspire everything from protest to murder.
Businessmen can succeed in separating warring black factions where the
police, with their suspect background of involvement in political violence,
cannot. Business has the resources to provide venues for local peace talks,
and such mundane support as fax machines and transport.
The Consultative Business Movement (CBM), a business grouping supported by
about 100 corporations, argues that business should be a bulwark in a
fractured society. 'During this crucial period of transition, business is
one of the few institutions whose national networks are intact. Violence has
destroyed many community organisation networks and government networks are
largely discredited,' it says.
But the CBM points out, in its document Surviving Change: Business' Role in
the Transition, that ad hoc dispute resolution is not enough. Business must
work at creating 'the socio-economic and developmental foundation without
which a negotiated solution will not be permanent'.
Indeed, the Saccola/Cosatu draft charter committed business to an ambitious
programme to combat poverty, including job creation programmes, schemes to
deliver food aid, provide electricity, and upgrade housing and education
facilities. No details were agreed, but it seems clear that business was
willing to go well beyond traditional social responsibility programmes which
have helped provide housing and education to employees and local communities
in the past.
Mr Ken Ironside, public affairs manager at Barlows, says: 'We realise we
have a role to play in shaping this society - reluctantly - but we won't be
offended when society settles down and we can get back to making money.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Observer: Birthday Party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather and kingmaker' of Japanese politics, has just
celebrated his 78th birthday quietly at home - in place of the annual party
whose guest list is generally a good guide to future prime ministers.
He shared the occasion with a few generals from his faction, the largest in
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, but had no guests from the Tokyo
Prosecutors' office, which is seeking an audience with him over a generous
and possibly illegal Y500m donation from a parcel delivery company, Tokyo
Sagawa Kyubin.
Each day for the past two weeks, the big question has been whether Kanemaru
will keep his appointment with the prosecutors or whether they will make a
house-call, since the godfather, who has a Brando-like mumble, has confined
himself to quarters.
This strange stand-off does not surprise ordinary Japanese, who appreciate
that the prosecutors want to question Kanemaru but not to humiliate him.
They have, however, rejected a suggestion from the great man that he write
them a note explaining his behaviour and that bygones then be bygones.
While old and privileged friends suggest that he has spent most of his time
playing mah-jong, the Chinese game of chance, Kanemaru's long stay at home
has already had international consequences. Ichiro Ozawa, generally
described in the Japanese press as Kanemaru's 'loyal deputy', last week
cancelled a get-to-know-you trip to the US and Europe. Ozawa, generally seen
as close to a turn at the prime ministership, said he couldn't leave until
Kanemaru and the prosecutors had settled their differences.

Last-ditch defender Midland Bank has been given the boot by Tottenham
Hotspur - a cynical reward, it might seem for seeing the north London
football club through the dark years of heavy debt and suspended shares.
Instead, back comes Barclays, the club stalwart banker until dropped in
favour of Midland by Spurs' old management team headed by Paul Bobroff and
Irving Scholar who floated the club a decade ago.
By 1990, it owed Midland more than Pounds 10m after a disastrous
diversification into clothing and a huge over-run of costs. But, though the
debt could have been recalled at any time, it wasn't.
Still, the defender departs to a grateful 'Well played' from Spurs' new
management, consumer electronics millionaire Alan Sugar and football guru
Terry Venables. Moreover, Midland did not fare too badly as a Spurs player.
After all, the club kept up the interest payments which amounted to about
Pounds 6.5m in the four years to last May. Sugar took over part of the loan
a year ago, charging base rate for the interest, whereas the bank added 2
percentage points. And there will have been other bank charges related to
some tense and prolonged negotiations.
Now, having eliminated the debt through the sale of Paul Gascoigne, which
netted Pounds 5.4m, Spurs is reputedly only 'dipping in and out of
overdraft'. So, in the end, it may be Barclays that has missed out on the
glory years.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Observer: Sterling work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the fate of Lord Beaverbrook, the former Conservative party
treasurer who is on the brink of personal bankruptcy, it is a brave soul who
gets involved in Tory finances. Enter Martin Saunders, chartered accountant
and finance director of P &amp; O.
No prizes for guessing who introduced Saunders to Tory chairman Sir Norman
Fowler as a suitable candidate for the new post of director of finance in a
supposedly leaner, fitter political machine.
P&amp;O boss and ardent Tory supporter Lord Sterling has, despite the recession,
kept up his Conservative party donations at Pounds 100,000 a year and
Saunders has worked for Lord Sterling since 1976, when he joined as deputy
chief accountant of Town &amp; City Properties.
With a deficit of an estimated Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m to worry about, the
politically ambitious Saunders will have plenty to keep him interested - but
the puzzle is why central office has made this appointment before filling
the other new slot, that of chief executive.

<TEXT>
As the Bundesbank digests the volley of criticism slung at it last week,
Observer's sympathies are partly with president Helmut Schlesinger's press
office. The governor of the Bank of England had to phone Schlesinger twice
last Tuesday seeking clarification of press interviews (in which the
Bundesbank chief had suggested a more comprehensive EMS realignment might
calm markets), to be told the reports were 'not authorised'. It is not the
first time the professor has been misunderstood.
In a notable instance when still Bundesbank deputy, Schlesinger appeared to
suggest to Reuters that the bank was not in favour of intervening to support
the dollar - a remark that had to be amplified next day.
Again, last summer when he took over from Karl Otto Pohl Schlesinger was
unusually forthright, in the weeks before he chaired his first council
meeting, about the need to raise interest rates. While some central banks
find this a good way to test the water, it was unusual enough in Germany to
mean that, by the time the council met, its options were distinctly
circumscribed.
In contrast to the wily Pohl, an ex-journalist who was seldom tripped up by
his former colleagues, the dour Schlesinger is more loquacious than one
might expect. He also tries to impose a Beamte-like distinction between what
is 'authorised' and what is not. It can be confusing.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Letter: Record shows Treasury never forecast a recession in
UK at all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof WYNNE GODLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to the article, 'Treasury models in privatising move'
(September 15), by David Goodhart and Peter Marsh, the Treasury 'fail(ed) to
predict how protracted the recession would be'. The statement flatters the
Treasury's forecasting record because it never, at any stage, forecast a
recession at all. The chart shows each of the Treasury's last five forecasts
taken from successive issues of the Financial Statement and Budget Report
and the Autumn Statement set against the estimated out-turn derived from
Economic Trends, together with an estimate for the remainder of 1992 and the
first half of 1993 which will not, I believe, be thought controversial.
As the chart shows, it would be wrong to think of the Treasury's forecasts
as only having been wrong once. The forecasts have been persistently
dreadful, invariably in the direction of seeing substantial recovery 'just
around the corner' which, of course, never materialised. The scale of the
error, looking one year ahead, was generally rather over 4 per cent and it
is beginning to look as though the worst of the lot was the most recent
forecast made just before the election - this may be as large as 5 per cent.
It is very worrying that the government has been so persistently, and so
completely, misled by its official advisers. It is even more worrying if,
faced with a recession which is going to turn into a regular slump unless
present policies are further changed, the government is even now basing its
actions on an economic model and forecasting methodology which are utterly
discredited.
Is the article correct when it says that the Treasury employs 80 economists
to do this work?

Sir, ERM was an artificial barrier preventing the UK government from
reducing interest rates to a level which would stimulate economic recovery.
The markets are certain that the ERM is dead and any attempt at
resuscitation either in a political or technical sense will be rebuffed.
It would be ironic if the crisis of last week is now simply interpreted as
allowing John Major his best opportunity to take the kind of action which
otherwise would have been impossible without a humiliating political U-turn.
Although a little late in the day, the government's action in suspending
sterling's participation in the ERM deserves applause.
The return to a floating rate presented the chancellor with an opportunity
to reduce interest rates to below the 10 per cent which they started at last
Wednesday. The German finance minister is right in stating that we must put
our own house in order. Bundesbank monetary policy is focused on the German
domestic economy. If you cannot beat them, then join them.
Ever cloud has a silver lining. The question now is whether the government
has the courage to set rates to defend the economy or whether it will cling
to its now defunct policy of defending the currency.
Of course, these actions over-simplify the underlying issues and put us in
the realms of the short-term fix. It would be a mistake to allow political
expediency to be a cause for ignoring that we are inseparably part of a
European trading bloc.
Ultimately, Europe must continue to strive to find a way of co-ordinating
its responses to global economic imbalances. These are complex problems.
ERM has proved to be an ineffective tool in smoothing the superficial
manifestations of the underlying cause. If the ERM is to be completely
abandoned then it is clear that the UK and its European partners must
quickly put their heads together to deal forthrightly with the fundamentals
of the multi-layered inter-relationships of their economies.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Arts: Geraint Evans - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Welsh baritone Geraint Evans died in hospital at the weekend following a
heart attack. He was 70. A favourite of audiences at Covent Garden for more
than 35 years, he will be remembered primarily for the comic roles in which
he displayed such a strong and endearing personality. Yet his career
embraced a wide range of achievements that put him in the forefront of the
British singers who went out to win international reputations after the war.
Evans was born in Pontypridd on 16 February 1922. He began singing in
amateur events and after war service in the RAF was thought sufficiently
talented to pursue a singing career. In 1948 he made his debut with the
Covent Garden Company as the Nightwatchman in Die Meistersinger, the
beginning of a happy association that was to last until his retirement from
the stage in l984.
All his major roles were heard at the house. In the 1960s and 70s it was
difficult to imagine a Mozart opera there without him: Figaro and Leporello
both showed his natural ability for communicating with an audience, though
he preferred to avoid Papageno in Die Zauberflote, whom he described with
his typically down-to-earth Welsh sense of humour as a 'cheeky little
chappie'. Among other comic roles he was highly regarded as Don Pasquale and
Verdi's Falstaff.
Although by voice alone he might not have been thought suitable for many of
the leading tragic baritone roles, a strong sense of how to make a character
come alive resulted in some powerful portrayals: the title role in Berg's
Wozzeck, above all, though he also took part in the premieres of Britten's
Billy Budd and Gloriana and Walton's Troilus and Cressida. Only the vocal
demands of Rigoletto defeated him and he knew when to leave well alone.
At a time when British singers were just starting to make an impact
internationally, Evans led the way. From 1962 he sang regularly at the
Salzburg Festival, as Figaro, Leporello and Wozzeck. In the US there were
guest appearances at the Metropolitan Opera in New York from 1964 and at San
Francisco, where he also tried his hand as a producer in the mid-1970s. His
popularity extended beyond the usual operatic circles and he became a
familiar face on television. He was knighted in 1971.
Recordings exist of his major roles, including Beckmesser in Die
Meistersinger under Von Karajan and Falstaff under Solti; but few are able
to recapture the personality that made him so beloved of audiences when he
appeared on stage.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Arts: Elektra - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh National Opera last mounted Strauss's opera more than a decade ago.
The production, by Harry Kupfer, was set in a slaughterhouse, steeped in
blood, and resonant - hysterically shrill, some felt - with 'political'
overtones. It caused a stir. Now, the company have turned to David Alden
(of, inter alia, Scottish Opera Wozzeck and ENO Mazeppa, Boccanegra and
Masked Ball fame) for the new Elektra that launches their '92-93 season.
Will it do the same?
The approach is neo-expressionist. The opera is, according to an Alden
interview in the WNO programme, 'actually an expressionistic reduction of
realistic situations into a dreamscape of one person's psychology'. To
create that dreamscape he and his regular design-partner (formerly known as
David Fielding and now, mysteriously, as Paul Bond) have rushed to their
trunk of modern opera-production cliches and tipped its contents all over
the Cardiff New Theatre stage.
It's all there: the angled stage, the dangling light-bulb (growing bright at
significant moments) on a long cord, the shiny surfaces in black, gunmetal
and white, the hard planes of light (by Wolfgang Gobbel), the chairs, the
disconnected recourse to unusual props - at one point Electra hauls a
mattress on to the stage, at another a standard-lamp with a large lampshade
 -the writhing on the floor, the weirdo postures and face-pulling.
In addition, the team have shown no hesitation about drawing on the stock of
modern Elektra-production cliches of other provenance where they have felt
in danger of running out themselves. Poor old Chrysothemis is once again a
Marilyn Monroe-epigone in a slinky white petticoat, Clytemnestra a svelte
matron in a glam off-the-shoulder number, with a troupe of sadistic-chic
attendants who at one point bring on the syringe for her regulation
shoot-up.
What's wrong, it seems to me, can be briefly summed up: a terrible shortage
of fresh, stimulating, surprising dramatic imagination at work in the
production. The idea that the opera is a psychodrama in the head of its
titular character, or that the three types of feminine response to its
central crisis are part of a larger, psychologically-linked family pattern,
is itself not contemptible; one could have many a lively discussion about it
(possibly, indeed, with one's own psychiatrist).
But as evidenced here there is a depressing staleness about the execution.
This is in stark contrast to, say, the Alden-Fielding Masked Ball; and the
effect, far from bouncing illuminating new reflections off the score, is to
reduce its range of Affekt to a series of predictable bugaboo gestures. This
is Elektra presented as the opera's and the composer's most persistent
detractors might see and hear it.
On Saturday, though, the performance was saved from complete ignominy by the
tireless devotion, musical authority and sheer guts of its three leading
females (in comparison, the men are even more overshadowed than usual).
Janet Hardy, an American Electra already well-known across Europe, sings
with cleanly cutting strength and absolute confidence - there may not be
much beauty in her tone, much variety or depth in her musicianship, but she
delivers the goods with a refreshing avoidance of calculation or physical
cranking-up.
Eva Maria Bundschuh, a German soprano of old-fashioned (in the best sense)
vocal warmth and honesty, makes a far more robust case for the validity of
Chrysothemis's line of argument than Alden deserves. Best of all, there is a
simply tremendous Clytemnestra from Felicity Palmer, every note and word
socked into place with an attack that is fiercely dazzling - one looks
forward to encountering her in a production more fully worthy of her. Among
the maids the sweet, full soprano of Alwyn Mellor (the fifth) stands out.
Carlo Rizzi, new WNO chief conductor, undertakes his first Strauss opera.
There is much shapely playing, much concern for verbal clarity, much
tingling vitality in the orchestration. What is so far missing is any
directorial knack of joining musical sentences into dramatic paragraphs.
Rizzi's is a stop-start reading - and, in view of the staging deficiencies,
doubly unfortunate.
In WNO repertory until December 5

It was inevitable that when television finally produced
a series allowing humanists to question the role played by religion in human
affairs there would also be plenty of 'believers' drafted in to provide
'balance'.
Perhaps the regular hymn programmes will in future be obliged to feature a
rational thinker who will point out the absurdity of singing songs to an
imaginary superman in the sky.
That will be the day. No doubt it is also inevitable that Beyond Belief:
Religion On Trial should have to wait until after most people have gone to
bed before it is transmitted (11.00 C4).
BBC2's series about Africa today, Out Of Darkness (7.50), turns to Ghana
where the ruler, Flt. Lt. Jerry Rawlings, says he is introducing a
multi-party democracy to the country.
A new series of World In Action starts on ITV this
evening with a programme about David Sullivan who
not only has the audacity
to publish magazines and newspapers which many people want to buy, notably
'Sunday Sport', but, far more heinous, has grown rich as a result.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Management: Experience of a lifetime / A look at the value
of schemes that introduce young people to the world of work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work experience used to be a convenient way for schools to rid themselves of
troublesome pupils and place them in the care of an unsuspecting employer
for a fortnight. Developed from such inauspicious beginnings 20 years ago,
the provision of work experience for the employee of tomorrow is the best
established, the most popular and the clearest manifestation of the growing
partnership between the worlds of business and education.
Yet there is little agreement on the purpose. At government level, the
experience is deemed valuable as an introduction for the young to the world
of work, as a broadening of horizons; indeed, it is a recommended, although
not a compulsory, element of the national curriculum for 15-16 year olds.
At pupil level, motives are diverse. For some, it is less an educational
experience, more a useful way of obtaining an inside track to a limited
range of jobs. John Spires, Birmingham director of Project Trident, which
finds work experience places for 125,000 pupils a year, recalled that
earlier this year most of the 400 pupils in one group wanted to work in
shops and offices. 'Only 18 or 20 wanted to go to engineering companies.'
The most severe problem, suggested Robert Powell, communications manager of
School Curriculum Industry Partnership, is matching young people to
placements. 'Very often they choose according to what they know. Is it a
more valid learning experience to get them to do what they don't want to
do?'
Although it can be taken for granted that no employer wants to play host to
recalcitrant teenagers, employers themselves approach work experience from a
mixture of motives. According to John Berkeley, education and careers
manager at Rover Group, the car manufacturer: 'No apparent consensus exists
among employers as to why their organisations, particularly those operating
in a competitive, commercial environment, should devote time, effort and
resources to providing pupil placements.'
Spires, who spends much time talking to employers, listed a number of
possible motives, including the following:
To gain an extra pair of hands.
To enlarge the pool of future labour.
To influence what goes on back at school.
To provide staff with supervisory experience.
Such disparity of objectives inevitably means that the value of the work
experience for the pupil cannot be guaranteed. 'A lot of it should carry a
government health warning,' commented Berkeley. 'It is better to have none
than that which distorts the view of work.'
In this hit-and-miss world where work experience can mean shoving papers in
files for a fortnight, sitting for hours at a checkout till - being used, in
fact, as cheap labour - there tends to be a difference in approach between
large and small companies. 'If I place somebody in the branch of a multiple
shop or Land Rover, I would expect them to have a structured programme,'
said Spires. 'If I place somebody in a small solicitor's office, what they
get to do depends on workload and what time the partners have to spend with
the kids.'
Rover, itself, delivers the kind of structured programme that is being
copied by other groups. Ideally, the company hopes that pupils coming
forward for work experience will come from schools with which it already has
a contractual partnership, so that the work experience is an integral part
of a broader collaboration between school and industry.
Although Berkeley noted that work experience should not be career-oriented -
'I would place equal value on work experience when the young person
concerned realises that this industry is not for them'  - Rover consciously
adopts a business approach to each individual placement. There is a learning
agreement with each pupil, an extension of the contractual relationship it
has with schools. This is the concept, Berkeley observed, 'of the employer
as sub-contractor to the school'.
The learning agreement seeks to enshrine the answers to three questions.
What is to be learned? How is to be learned? What evidence of that learning
will there be and how is that learning to be assessed? Last year 1,000
school pupils went through the process, not on the assembly line, but in the
workshops, laboratories, test areas and offices of the group's plants.
Elsewhere in industry, Spires said employers were more frequently asking the
question: 'How can we take kids on to our premises when we are laying people
off?'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Management: Nuts and bolts of giving power to the people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few modern management concepts have generated as much noise and confusion as
the overworked term 'empowerment'.
Some executives fear it will undermine their authority and even remove their
jobs, while others see it as the only way their business will prosper, even
survive, in the 1990s.
One reason for the confusion is the word itself. In the US, it has been used
for more than a century in political circles to describe the gaining of
power, especially by minority groups. Over the past few years business has
caught the habit, but has employed - and parroted - it far too loosely.
Like much American business hyperbole, there is often less to empowerment in
US companies than meets the eye or ear. Sometimes the word is used merely to
dress up consultation - what David Bowen and Edward Lawler, two academics in
the field, call 'suggestion involvement'. McDonald's, the fast food chain,
uses this form of very limited 'empowerment'.
A second, more real, type is what Bowen and Lawler call 'job involvement'.
This entails extensive job redesign, so that employees use a variety of
skills, often in teams. They have considerable freedom in deciding how to do
the necessary work.
Despite the increased empowerment that it brings, the job involvement
approach does not change higher-level strategic decisions about organisation
structure, power and the allocation of rewards. These remain senior
management's responsibility.
A third level is what the two academics call 'high involvement' - a form
practised by Federal Express, the Herman Miller furniture company, and the
redoubtable Johnsonville Sausage of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. A much-admired
enterprise, its founder and chief executive, Ralph Stayer, has become one of
the best-known evangelists of the US empowerment movement. (Sadly for fans
of evocative company names, his was recently changed to Johnsonville Foods).
With 'high involvement', under Bowen and Lawler's definition, employees
become involved not just in how to do their jobs, or how effectively their
team performs, but also in the whole organisation's performance.
Virtually every aspect of the organisation is different from that of a
control-orientated one. Information on all aspects of business performance
is shared horizontally across the organisation, as well as up and down the
(delayered) structure.
Employees develop extensive skills in teamwork, problem solving and business
operations. They participate in work-unit management decisions. There is
profit sharing and employee ownership.
Whether one agrees that all three levels warrant the term 'empowerment', it
is vital to distinguish between them to understand what the term can mean.
It is equally important to know which form suits different situations. A
widely-quoted academic article by Bowen and Lawler earlier this year is
helpful here.* It makes the vital point that there is no single approach
which is ideal in every industry, company, function or situation. Like so
many other things in management, the ideal degree and form of empowerment is
contingent upon circumstances.
The second reason for confusion over the concept is that the word is too
often used without its mirror image: responsibility. This is not the fault
of two of the people most responsible for the popularity of the concept, Tom
Peters and Robert Waterman, who were co-authors a decade ago of the
best-selling business book ever, In Search of Excellence.
In subsequent, separate volumes in 1987, called respectively Thriving on
Chaos and The Renewal Factor, they each rammed home that empowerment carries
with it much greater responsibility, as well as the need for higher
performance. Indeed, some American pundits and companies now prefer the term
'high performance' to those of either 'high involvement' or 'empowerment'.
In France, the latter word is hardly ever used. 'The French call it
'responsibilisation'', says Paul Evans, professor of organisational
behaviour at Insead, the European business school based south of Paris.
Yet in German-speaking Switzerland and parts of Germany, 'empowerment' is
gaining a foothold, as being preferable to the German equivalent
'Ermaechtigung'.
A third problem is confusion between empowerment and delegation.
'Empowerment is not just a matter of pushing more responsibility down an
organisation,' says Evans. 'It's stupid and crazy to do so to people who
don't have the skills and competences to take control over their work.'
Evans is echoed by Jack Furrer, director of management education at
Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals multinational. 'All too
often, delegation equals dumping,' he says. 'Sometimes it's more positive
and consists of a balance between direction and autonomy. But it still
usually lacks the element of support which empowerment involves.'
A fourth problem is the obvious one, that power-conscious managers are put
off by empowerment war stories such as the one at Johnsonville Sausage,
where Stayer admits happily that he gave away much of his authority for the
benefit of the company's motivation and performance. At Ciba-Geigy, however,
reluctant managers have been told as part of the company's 'leadership and
teamwork' programme that in new-style organisations, one does have to share
power, although this does not mean surrendering it.
'People still need direction', says Furrer. 'Managers need to create an
environment which suits both themselves and their employees.'
Furrer, who subscribes to the theory of what is known as 'situational
leadership', says that the relative balance required between direction,
support and autonomy varies according to each person and circumstance.
Another way of putting this is to say that, except in a few very democratic
organisations, the empowerment of middle managers and other employees always
needs to have boundaries.
'High performance groups are focused on relatively tight objectives and are
measured accordingly,' says one top American human resources executive.
'They have fences around them and people know where they are.'
That said, there is no getting away from the fact that the fundamental
principle of empowerment is radically different from the traditional western
one of 'command and control', in which bosses transfer their ideas into the
hands of the workers. Instead, it rests on Konosuke Matsushita's much-quoted
dictum** that the survival of companies today 'depends on the day-to-day
mobilisation of every ounce of intelligence' within them. That implies a
very different relationship than in the past between leaders and followers,
managers and managed.
But it also explains why full-steam empowerment programmes have developed a
nasty habit in the US of hitting the organisational buffers after several
years. That, in turn, is partly why it is far more effective for most
companies to introduce empowerment as part and parcel of an 'organisational
re-engineering' programme than for them to give it the limelight on its own.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Moscow faces bitter fight over economic legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is to present a series of economic and constitutional
acts to the next session of the Russian parliament, opening tomorrow.
The radical legislation, coupled with the worsening economic situation, is
likely to provoke an open and bitter struggle between the different levels
of state power, jeopardising the survival of economic reforms and fledgling
democratic institutions.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, is expected to defend the
government's record and demand that parliament support a return to fiscal
and monetary discipline after a relaxation of controls. Mr Gaidar told the
Interfax news agency at the end of last week that it was essential to
'consolidate a proper financial and credit policy since further attempts to
retreat (from it) would lead not to a revival of industrial production but
to the destruction of the finance and credit system and of the national
currency'.
All key indicators have deteriorated sharply. The latest official figures
show a budget deficit of Rbs950bn on a total budget of Rbs3,300bn; inflation
is said by the government to be running at 20-25 per cent a month, and
accelerating; and production is falling at an average of 20 per cent a year.
The state of the finances will make further credits from the International
Monetary Fund - through a standby agreement on which negotiations restart
shortly - difficult to achieve. However, few government officials now seem
to believe in the possibility of substantial foreign aid.
However, President Boris Yeltsin is in an uncompromising mood, and will
attempt to push a series of measures through a hostile parliament.
These include:
A draft constitution, giving substantial powers to the president and
enshrining his right to rule by decree. It is scheduled for introduction to
parliament in about a month. The issue is likely to be the most contentious
among parliamentarians anxious to preserve their powers, and may lead Mr
Yeltsin to take it over their heads in a referendum.
A law on the government, which is expected to give the president the right
to appoint ministers, subject only to consultation with parliamentary
committees. Parliament has insisted on retaining the right, which it
voluntarily and temporarily suspended nearly a year ago, to veto ministerial
appointments.
A law on bankruptcy, which has so far been refused by parliament. Mr Yeltsin
has issued a decree allowing companies to be declared bankrupt, but it has
not been ratified and experts doubt it would survive legal challenge.
Mr Yeltsin, whose popularity has been slipping, has sought in recent weeks
to build bridges with his opponents in parliament, chief among them Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. However, Mr Khasbulatov
continues to claim that parliament is on an equal footing with the
presidency and government.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Taipei tightens China links

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN has approved a series of measures to increase ties with mainland
China, but these are likely to be criticised by the island's business
leaders as too cautious.
Following a two-day government conference organised by Taiwan's Mainland
Affairs Council, which oversees relations with China, the measures will now
go to Taiwan's cabinet and are expected to be quickly approved.
Under the proposals, Taiwanese banks will be allowed for the first time to
deal with Chinese banks, but only through overseas offices. Taiwanese
financial institutions will also be allowed to conduct certain transactions
with the branches of foreign banks in China. Taiwanese businessmen will be
allowed to remit money from China to Taiwan, and Taiwan has further relaxed
its rules on imports from the mainland.
The moves are the latest step in Taiwan's gradual programme to increase ties
with China. But Taiwan again refused demands from business that direct
shipping and air links be established. Taiwan's bans on direct trade,
transport and postal links, known as the 'three tongs', are seen as
important negotiating tools to try to force China to renounce its threat to
use force against Taiwan.
Taiwanese companies have invested about Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2bn) in China
since they were first allowed to set up operations, via third countries, in
1987. Processing and labour-intensive industries have moved to China to
avoid high wage and land costs on the island. So far few big companies have
invested in the mainland, but most analysts agree investment would increase
sharply if direct ties were established. Taiwan's government fears this
could undermine the island's economy.
Mr Lin Yu-siang, a legislator opposed to closer Chinese ties at this stage,
said direct links could lead 'most Taiwanese factories' to move to China.
'This is a security issue and would lead to serious unemployment,' he said.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Sarajevo flights set to resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees will ask international aid
agencies and governments to resume the humanitarian relief effort to
Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina later this week.
All flights to the Bosnian capital, which Serb forces have besieged since
early April, were suspended after Croat forces shot down an Italian relief
aircraft on September 3.
The plans to resume flights follows agreement at the weekend in Geneva by
the Serbs, Croats and forces loyal to the Bosnian government.
They agreed to make the airport secure for the airlift operations, to grant
safe road passage for the delivery of humanitarian aid, to desist from
disrupting electricity and water supplies to the civil population in all
areas, and to ensure safe passage for convoys carrying released detainees.
But Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UNHCR's high commissioner, said: 'The guarantees
are not wholly satisfactory, and all the security risks for the airlift
operation have not been eliminated.'
Since the downing of the Italian aircraft, road convoys have also been
attacked by Serb forces near Stup, a key strategic route which links the
road from the airport to Sarajevo.
Despite the continuing fighting and the risks facing the convoys, Mrs Ogata
said it was crucial that aid reached Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities
before winter.
Even if Sarajevo airport is re-opened, it will not be able to receive
flights every day throughout the winter because of heavy snow and the thick
fog which regularly settles over the city after October.
Because of this prospect, the UNHCR convoys, backed by UN armoured patrols,
will have the task of negotiating the opening of four road routes out of
Croatia and Serbia into Bosnia.
Many of the main routes are controlled by gangs of Serb and Croat forces.
Many are also impassable because they have been mined, or else bridges have
been blown up.
It is the task of the UN to help repair these routes. But European Community
diplomats in Belgrade yesterday conceded that 6,000 additional troops
committed by Britain, France and other countries to assist the UNHCR's
operations, would take several weeks to arrive.
Mourners burying 12 war victims in Sarajevo scattered in terror yesterday
when two mortar shells exploded 100 metres from graves dug in one of the
city's main cemeteries, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
Witnesses said scores of screaming people ran for cover and some jumped into
open graves as shrapnel ricocheted round their heads.
The mortars hit a road between the Lion cemetery and the Kosevo hospital.
The cemetery is always busy with the funerals of those killed in the daily
shelling and sniper attacks.

elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Estonia, the smallest of the former Soviet republics,
yesterday voted for a parliament and president in the first free elections
in the country since before the second world war.
The 1.6m population had a choice among four candidates for the presidency,
which will be a directly elective one only this time, and which is envisaged
as having limited powers.
Two of the candidates - Mr Arnold Ruutel, the current and long-serving
chairman of the Supreme Council, and Mr Rein Taagepera, a university
professor who has spent much of his life in the US - are moderate
nationalists. Both Mr Lennart Meri, the former foreign minister, and Mrs
Lagle Parek, a former political prisoner, take a radical nationalist stance.
Mr Ruutel commanded a consistent lead in pre-election polls, in spite of his
past as a senior communist.
However, the election has been made controversial by the exclusion of voting
under the new citizenship rules of over a third of the electorate. The
660,000 eligible to vote all had to show that they were directly descended
from pre-war Estonian citizens, a measure which excludes nearly all the
Russians and other former Soviet nationalities who emigrated there after
1945.
Mr Nicolai Medvedev, head of the commission on Russian-Estonian relations,
said in Moscow at the weekend that Russia was now concerned about a
nationalist government trying to create a 'mono-ethnic state' in Estonia.

week of shuttle diplomacy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CEASEFIRE in Sudan's civil war will be negotiated 'very soon', Mr Tiny
Rowland, chief executive of the international conglomerate Lonrho, said
yesterday.
Mr Rowland, in an interview, described a hectic week of shuttle diplomacy,
which has taken him from a further round of Mozambique peace talks in
Botswana to southern Sudan for lunch with rebel leader John Garang.
Mr Rowland, whose company's African interests include investments in Sudan
and Mozambique, was speaking in Nairobi before flying to Khartoum for a
private meeting with President Omar Hassan Ahmed el Bashir, the country's
military leader.
Mr Rowland disclosed that he and Mr Mark Too, deputy chairman of Lonrho East
Africa, flew into southern Sudan last Thursday for talks with Mr Garang,
leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). He had left with
a message from Mr Garang to President Bashir, and expected his efforts to
result in the first face to face meeting between the two sides.
This would 'very soon' lead to a ceasefire in the conflict which has cost
hundreds of thousands of lives: 'I have been at this for eight years and
this one is going to be settled soon,' said Mr Rowland.
He and Mr Too plan to return from Khartoum to Nairobi today and fly back
into southern Sudan for further talks with Mr Garang and Mr Lam Akol, the
leader of a second rebel faction.
Mr Rowland, who has assumed the mantle of broker in two of Africa's most
devastating civil wars, was also optimistic about last month's peace
agreement between the Mozambique government and Renamo rebel movement. It
was 'absolutely solid', he said.
The first stage of the peace accord was signed at a ceremony in Rome last
month, attended by Mr Rowland. He has continued to act behind the scenes,
and his arrival in Nairobi on Saturday night followed his participation at a
meeting between Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano and Renamo leader
Alfonso Dhlakama in Gaborone, capital of Botswana.
The meeting has resolved the last remaining obstacles to a ceasefire - the
formation of a national army composed of both Renamo and government troops,
and the role of the intelligence service during the transition to
multi-party elections next year.
Mr Vincent Zacarias Uluzu, general secretary of Renamo, said the two sides
agreed to restructure the intelligence service and police force.
Mr Rowland said a formal ceasefire agreement would be signed on October 1 in
either Gaborone or Harare.

New Zealanders have voted overwhelmingly to reject the first-past-the-post
election system which the country inherited from Britain, Terry Hall writes
from Wellington.
In a national referendum at the weekend, only 15 per cent voted to keep the
system, where the winning party usually gains a bigger share of
parliementary seats than of votes. Seventy per cent voted for mixed member
proportional (MMP), as in Germany.

ALGERIA'S new government promised austerity and more taxes but offered
incentives to foreign investors in an ambitious plan to achieve a market
economy and end violence, Reuter reports from Algiers. It warned 'rigorous
austerity, drastically reducing the need to import' was coming.
The rich will be taxed more on income, with a separate tax on assets; tax
breaks will go to innovative companies replacing imported goods, and
competing imports will be banned.
A 'vast field of activities' will open for local and foreign investors with
incentives, including favourable exchange rates for investment.

<TEXT>
THAI politicians at the weekend forged a five-party coalition that is
preparing to form a government and name Mr Chuan Leekpai, leader of the
Democrat party, prime minister after the king opens parliament today.
The coalition includes the four 'angel' parties opposed to military
involvement in politics and business - the Democrats, Palang Dharma (Moral
Force), the New Aspiration party, and Solidarity - and the Social Action
party (SAP).
The SAP was part of a short-lived coalition favouring the armed forces
during the political crisis in May when troops killed at least 50
pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of Bangkok. But its leaders
dithered during the conflict and it is regarded as an acceptable coalition
partner by the other four.
The five parties have 207 seats in the 360-seat House of Representatives,
but the coalition is still likely to be fragile.
Democrat MPs are concerned that the NAP will be wooed away by the
pro-military parties, and at what they see as the unpredictable ambitions of
Mr Chamlong, the devout Buddhist Palang Dharma leader who led the street
protests.
Mr Chuan's Democrat party won the most seats in the general election a week
ago, and Democrat members of parliament said yesterday they would choose the
ministers of finance, agriculture and industry and the prime minister.
The Palang Dharma party is expected to name the new ministers of foreign
affairs and transport and communications.
Mr Chamlong's party was given the transport and communications portfolio - a
source of corrupt earnings from commission payments in previous
administrations - because of his reputation as an anti-corruption
campaigner.
On the foreign policy side, Palang Dharma is expected to reduce Thailand's
support for the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and Burma's military junta.

<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, said at the
weekend that there was no question of the UN intervening unasked in
conflicts, unless they were the result of an aggression by one country
against another.
He told the Financial Times he rejected the growing view that the UN should
be allowed to intervene in some internal conflicts without the consent of
all the participants, if the threat to peace and security was particularly
serious.
'Like it or not, that is the reality,' he said. 'Unless all the protagonists
in an internal dispute ask for our intervention, we will not intervene,
except in the case of an aggression.'
He particularly lamented the fact that the UN could do nothing to help the
Middle East peace process because Israel was opposed to such a step. He said
he had offered his services to Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin, and his
predecessor Yitzhak Shamir. 'They said okay, we'll think about it, but they
have not given their agreement. I'm doing my best to persuade them that it's
in their own interests, but I cannot impose myself or the UN if they don't
want to have us. That is one of the basic rules of our organisation.'
Referring to the recent decision to send more UN peace-keeping troops to
Yugoslavia to ensure the delivery of international humanitarian aid, Mr
Boutros Ghali said reports that the rules of engagement had been modified to
enable the UN troops to use their arms if they were impeded from carrying
out their task, were incorrect.
'The rules of engagement remain the same as for previous peace-keeping
operations. They already have the right to fire back in self-defence. But a
new Security Council resolution would be needed to allow them to use their
arms in any other circumstances.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / UN vote paves way for Serbia's expulsion

<TEXT>
THE Security Council has rejected the claim of the Federation of Serbia and
Montenegro to have succeeded to the seat of Yugoslavia in the United Nations
 -paving the way for the expulsion of its delegates.
If, as appears certain, the General Assembly endorses the recommendation,
Belgrade would have to apply for admission to the UN as a new member.
Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, the other principal states of
former Yugoslavia, have already obtained independent membership.
The council resolution was approved on Saturday by 12 votes to none with
China, India and Zimbabwe abstaining after it was revised to take account of
Russian reservations.
Britain, France and Belgium were the prime movers, following an EC foreign
ministers' decision a week earlier. The US enthusiastically backed the
proposal and yesterday Germany said it would ask the UN to take a hard line
against rump Yugoslavia if it was forced to reapply for UN membership. Mr
Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said Serbia and Montenegro should be
required to halt aggression against breakaway republics like
Bosnia-Hercegovina before being admitted as new members.
However, senior UN officials believe the decision is ill advised since
international efforts to end the Balkans civil war now under way in Geneva
rely on Belgrade's co-operation. Officials fear that humiliating Serbia can
only increase peace-making difficulties.
Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of Yugoslavia, is scheduled to address the
General Assembly this Thursday. But that plan appears likely to be aborted
by an assembly vote rejecting his delegation, perhaps as early as tomorrow.
If the Belgrade authorities decided to apply for separate membership, the
US, Britain and France could be expected to exercise their veto powers at
least until substantial progress was recorded in the Geneva talks.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Back on your screen, Perot II: Now showing on Jurek Martin's
TV, The Return of the Non-Candidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS as if he had never gone away. Last Friday Ross Perot was on breakfast
television, public television and late-night television and, for good
measure, he threw in an interview with the Washington Post.
But at the end of the day, as in the springtime of his non-candidacy for the
presidency, it was not easy to work out what the little billionaire from
Texas was actually threatening to do.
On Friday, he was registered as a presidential candidate in Arizona, which
means his name will appear on the ballot in all 50 states on November 3.
Even though he announced in July that he would not run, some public opinion
polls continue to track his popularity and demonstrate that he could still
be a factor, though never a winner, 45 days from now.
The latest Washington Post poll, for example, gave him 15 per cent (against
45 per cent for Mr Bill Clinton and 31 per cent for President George Bush)
in a hypothetical three-way race. Most pundits think that unless he formally
declares he will get much less than that, but could still swing the outcome
in such states as his native Texas.
The bottom line of his Friday round appeared to be his continued concern
that neither Mr Clinton nor Mr Bush was yet seriously addressing the problem
of reducing the budget deficit and the national debt. His solution, he
repeatedly said, had been outlined in his recent paperback book, which is
indeed a best-seller now though his inability to provide such a blueprint
while still thinking of running was widely criticised.
The only way, he said, to get his views across was to buy television
advertising time. But the big networks told him this would only be possible
if he became a presidential candidate. 'I may be the only guy in history,'
he said with typical hyperbole, 'that had to declare he was a candidate so
he could buy TV time.'
Pressed by interviewers to say if this meant he was getting back into the
race, Mr Perot fell back on a familiar line: this was up to his
'volunteers'. His movement, he kept saying, was 'bottoms up' not 'top down',
as in the two main parties, and he poured scorn on questioners who failed to
understand his mystical rapport with ordinary citizens.
His movement is indeed showing signs of life, though many volunteers felt
left in the lurch when he abruptly pulled out in the middle of the
Democratic convention in July. He claimed then that his presence on the
ballot would only ensure a deadlocked election and that the Democratic party
seemed 'revitalised'. These reasons he now glosses over, though more than a
suspicion persists that he retains contempt for Mr Bush.
Whatever his ultimate plans, if he even knows them, there is little doubt
that Mr Perot has felt liberated by no longer being subject to conventional
political advice and scrutiny. His formidable ego and yearning for the
limelight have been restored by the uncritical and unfiltered flattery of
'the volunteers', who really do seem to believe that he alone is able to
save the nation from perdition.
But published post mortems of his abortive earlier effort have revealed
potentially damaging information should he re-engage. A devastating article
in Vanity Fair magazine paints a generally scary picture of a wilfully
ignorant autocrat consumed by conspiracy theories and almost paranoid about
security.
It also contains two specific allegations: that Mr Perot ordered a private
investigation of his daughter's relationship with a university professor who
happened to be Jewish, and that he had sanctioned the immediate firing of an
employee with the HIV virus. Mr Perot dismissed both charges as the worst
examples of tabloid journalism.

NEW Zealanders have voted overwhelmingly to reject the first-past-the-post
election system which the country inherited from Britain.
In a national referendum at the weekend, only 15 per cent voted to keep the
system, where the winning party usually gains a larger number of seats in
parliament than its share of the vote. The majority, 70 per cent, voted in
favour of mixed member proportional (MMP), a system used in Germany. The
remaining 15 per cent of voters favoured the other options put forward:
supplementary member, single transferable vote, and preferential vote.
Most politicians from the two main parties, led by prime minister Jim
Bolger, warned that any system apart from first-past-the-post would lead to
unstable government. However, it is widely believed that the strong vote for
change is a public condemnation of both parties for not honouring election
promises.
A second referendum will be held at next year's general election, giving
voters two options: first - past - the - post or MMP. The prime minister has
also hinted that the referendum will ask people to vote on the
re-establishment of an upper house of parliament.
Any change in the electoral system will not occur till the following general
elections, probably in 1996. The government will now decide the precise
structure of the MMP system to be put to the vote next year. However critics
say this task should be left to the Royal Commission which recommended the
MMP system in 1986.
Leaders of minor parties, who have been lobbying in favour of MMP, contend
that the government and the opposition will use the coming months to come up
with an unattractive form of MMP.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Bonn pledges full support
for EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY said at the weekend it would do everything to maintain the European
Monetary System in spite of last week's monetary chaos, which left sterling
and the lira suspended from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, told a press conference after
Saturday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington that the EMS was a 'central
component' for achieving price stability in Europe and moving towards
economic and monetary union.
However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said it was open to
question whether the rules of the ERM had been properly observed in the
light of last week's massive intervention. Mr Schlesinger disclosed that
Germany bought DM60bn (Pounds 22.7bn) worth of foreign currencies during the
crisis in the EMS, with intervention during one day amounting to DM35bn -
mainly in support of the lira.
He was critical of the way in which ERM parities had been realigned and the
way participation of the pound and lira had been suspended. Realignments
were supposed to be carried out early and without a great public debate, he
said. This was clearly not the case with last week's events.
Tensions in the system had been allowed to build up since the last
significant realignment in 1987. For many of the other EMS countries
realignment seemed to be a 'dirty word', Mr Schlesinger added.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Indicators to guide UK
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, British chancellor of the exchequer, said the UK
government intended to base its monetary policy on a range of financial
indicators, following last week's suspension of British membership of the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
He also made clear that among the conditions for Britain's return to the ERM
was greater synchronisation of economic conditions between the UK and
Germany.
In his speech to the International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim
committee at the weekend, the chancellor said it was the goal of government
policy to continue bearing down on inflation. 'People must understand that
low inflation is a pre-condition of sustained growth,' he said.
Earlier Mr Lamont told journalists that British interest rates would in
future be set in the light of a number of financial indicators. The UK's
narrow money target of 0 to 4 per cent annual growth in M0 would remain.
The government would also monitor broad money, asset prices and, in
particular, house prices and exchange rates. 'No government can be
indifferent to the level of the exchange rate,' he added.
The chancellor declined to be drawn on whether an opportunity now existed to
cut interest rates substantially, underlining instead the government's
determination to reduce inflation. He said the government would 'in due
time' make clear the criteria for the different monetary aggregates. It was
not considering giving independence to the Bank of England.
Mr Lamont laid down three conditions for sterling's return to the ERM.
The turmoil in the exchange markets should be over. The UK and German
economies 'should be more at the same stage of the cycle and have more
convergent conditions and interest rates'. The situation in Germany would
also be taken into account when determining British policy.
He also said the government would 'want to look at the co-operation and
working of the Exchange Rate Mechanism'. Although he refused to go into
details, he said the UK wanted to examine some technical aspects of how the
mechanism operated and of how co-operation and intervention worked.
In spite of a very public reconciliation between the chancellor and his
German opposite number, Mr Theo Waigel, it is understood the chancellor
continues to believe that sterling was undermined by unhelpful comments from
Germany in recent weeks.
He said all participants at Saturday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington
agreed the UK had done everything it could over the past week.
But circumstances were almost unique. 'There was a fixed date when people
thought there would be a realignment and gave them the opportunity to
speculate against that date, creating intolerable pressure and huge currency
flows.'
When asked whether it would be days or months before Britain re-entered the
ERM, Mr Lamont said it was 'not a question of time. It's the conditions'.
Earlier Mr Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch central bank governor, predicted that
the UK would not return to the ERM for several weeks.

display their relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN finance ministers and monetary officials meeting at the
International Monetary Fund in Washington yesterday put the best face on
things as they reacted to the first news of France's vote on the Maastricht
treaty, write George Graham and Peter Norman.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, acknowledged that the Yes vote
had only narrowly prevailed but said, as he disappeared into a meeting with
his fellow EC finance ministers, that the result would still be enough to
calm the markets.
'A small majority is better than a minority. It is a good result. It is a
positive signal for the integration of Europe. It is a positive for the
markets.'
His optimism was endorsed by some European central bankers.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, said the result 'will
certainly calm down the markets' while Mr Lamberto Dini, director general of
the Italian central bank, agreed it was positive.
French officials cheerfully maintained that even a narrow Yes would restore
calm to the markets.
One suggested the EC ministers' most important business in their meeting
would be the ceremonial opening of champagne bottles.
Some officials privately acknowledged, however, that the mood in private
meetings was far less cheerful. 'Any closer and we would all have been
diving for cover,' said one European diplomat.
'We're not out of the woods yet,' a senior EC official added.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Pros and cons of a free-floating exchange rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Leave the ERM, cut interest rates and let the pound find its own level. . .
it's the cut-and-run option. The credibility of our anti-inflationary
strategy would be in tatters. And quite soon interest rates would have to go
back up again - to much higher levels than they are today.'
So argued Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, in a speech to
the European Policy Forum in July. 'The ERM is not an optional extra, an
add-on to be jettisoned at the first hint of trouble,' he said. 'It is and
will remain at the very centre of our macroeconomic strategy.'
The chancellor has already been proved half right. Last week's hasty
departure from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism has certainly undermined
the government's inflation-fighting credibility.
But was Mr Lamont also correct to argue that departure from the ERM would
soon mean higher, not lower, interest rates to prevent a collapse in the
pound and a surge of inflation? This was certainly the view of his Treasury
speech-writers. 'As inflation has come down, we have been able to cut
interest rates nine times from 15 per cent to 10 per cent,' he said. 'I
cannot believe we could have achieved all this outside the ERM.'
It is easy to find evidence which contradicts the chancellor's assertions.
All the Anglo-Saxon countries - Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the US and
the UK - have faced similar problems of debilitating high levels of consumer
and corporate debt and lingering recessions. But only the UK has been forced
to keep its short-term interest rates above those in Germany. The others
have cut their interest rates well below German rates over the past two
years, as the upper charts show.
The difference is that these four non-European countries have all maintained
floating exchange rates which enabled them to ease monetary policy
aggressively as their economies slipped into recession. US short-term
interest rates are now 6 percentage points below those in Germany. Rates in
the other three countries are all at least 3 percentage points lower.
Yet these interest rate cuts have not resulted in a build-up of inflationary
pressure, as the chancellor's argument implies. True, lower interest rates
than those in Germany has led to a fall in each country's exchange rate
relative to the D-Mark. The US dollar has depreciated by 20 per cent since
the beginning of 1989, the smallest fall of the four. The Australian dollar
has fallen by 35 per cent since then. But the inflation rate gap between all
of the Anglo-Saxon countries and Germany has also fallen over the past two
years.
Of course, inflation rates only chart the past. Long-term interest rates are
a better measure of expected inflation. But the long-term interest rate
differential of all four countries relative to Germany has also narrowed
considerably since 1990, as the lower charts shows. Even Australia, a
relatively small and open economy, has been able to sustain lower interest
rates and a large depreciation without a surge in inflation, in part because
of the depressed state of its domestic economy.
The Anglo-Saxon countries should beware of moving too far, too fast.
Movements in long-term bond interest rates provide one warning signal of
inflationary risks ahead. The sharp fall in the value of the US dollar
against the D-Mark over the past month has been accompanied by a rise in US
long rates relative to Germany. The same has occurred in all the Anglo-Saxon
countries.
But there is no need for panic. Both US and Canadian long interest rates are
still lower than those in Germany. All had a lower long interest rate
differential than the UK at the beginning of last week, when sterling was
still in the ERM.
Last week's decision to float sterling gives the UK government the
opportunity to follow the Anglo-Saxon example and cut interest rates below
those in Germany. Will the chancellor be willing to follow their lead? The
consequences of doing so, he argued in July, 'would be either higher
interest rates, higher inflation, or most likely both'. But the evidence
suggests that he may be wrong on both counts.

FT  21 SEP 92 / People: Midland's Goldthorpe retires
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank executives hoping that the integration of their bank with its
new parent will proceed painlessly must be dismayed to learn of the sudden
resignation of Brian Goldthorpe, 59, deputy chief executive and a director
of both Midland Bank and Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation.
Goldthorpe's retirement after 43 years with Midland (he started at the
bank's Barnsley branch when he left school at 16) was made solely on health
grounds after advice from his doctors.
His abrupt departure robs the group of the most senior survivor from the old
days in Midland who has also worked closely with HSBC since the two banks
struck up their alliance in 1986 and who was expected to play a key part in
their integration. Goldthorpe joined the HSBC board last May when Sir Kit
McMahon resigned.
His departure also creates gaps in other parts of the Midland Group; he was
chairman of Forward Trust Group, the group finance house, and the Midland
Bank Pension Trust.

FT  21 SEP 92 / People: Ellis takes on Wang UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rick Ellis, a New Zealander in his early 40s, takes over as head of Wang UK
this week. He follows in the footsteps of such illustrious predecessors as
Ian Diery, now in charge of of Apple Computer's global marketing, and Alan
Davis, whose move to Ascom Timeplex created the vacancy Ellis is filling.
Ellis has been with Wang for nine years and has held a number of senior
management positions, ending up as general manager of the troubled
minicomputer manufacturer's New Zealand subsidiary.
Wang UK is a frustrated company these days. Wholly owned by its US parent
which is now languishing in Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code after years
of losses, it has managed its own business rather well and has proved to be
Wang's most successful overseas operation. Last year it was profitable on a
turnover of Pounds 96m - in the worst recession the UK computer industry has
experienced.
It will be a big change for Ellis but he says he is looking forward to it.
Last year, the New Zealand company turned over only Dollars 45m and he will
find himself dealing with some of Europe's largest companies. Ford, for
example, has shrugged off worries about Wang's future to place a Dollars 1m
order for mid-range computers - IBM machines, that is, with a Wang badge on
the front.

The Lancaster University Management School is fast becoming a forum for the
leading lights of London's advertising and design worlds.
The vociferous design consultant Wally Olins - currently at work on a book
which explains why companies don't understand design - took up a visiting
professorship there in June.
Joining him now as another visiting professor is Winston Fletcher (left),
chairman and eponymous co-founder of Delaney Fletcher Slaymaker Delaney and
Bozell.
(One of the lingering curiosities of the advertising world is why the agency
has not yet shortened itself to an acronym as have many others. . .)
Like a number of advertising colleagues, Fletcher is clearly a man of great
energy. He adds his new academic life to his agency work, his role as
director of the Central London Tec, his trusteeship of the Open College of
Arts, his weekly column for The Times, and his fellowship of the Royal
Society of Arts.
Fletcher says 'teaching at a first-class management school is often as
beneficial for the teacher as it is for the taught.' His first management
lecture could understandably be on the theme: 'The prioritising of working
time.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Crisis in the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange trading this week is certain to focus on whether the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism has a future, writes James Blitz.
By the end of last week, the chaos in the EMS left dealers believing that
little may now depend on the result of the French referendum vote on
Maastricht. The foreign exchanges have seen that the European Monetary
System is weak after the departure of both sterling and the Italian lira,
and the massive run on both currencies.
Although the UK government has said that sterling will return to the system
when the time is right, the UK Chancellor appeared to imply in an interview
last Friday that an early return to the EMS is not envisaged. There have
been subtle indications, too, that the Bank of Italy is having second
thoughts about its commitment to return to the system tomorrow.
The D-Mark's strength has even started to create strains at the very core of
the system, among the Benelux countries which closely track the D-Mark's
moves. On Friday, Belgium's central bank governor said the Belgian franc
would be allowed to diverge more widely from its central ERM rate against
the D-Mark than it had in the past.
The dollar could continue to profit from the turbulence in the EMS. In
recent weeks. it has regained some of its old status as a safe haven
currency and peaked at DM1.5020 in US trading on Friday night. Some analysts
believe that the dollar needs to break through DM1.55 if its upward path is
to be ensured. But with the US presidential election nearing, a sustained
dollar rally may be difficult to achieve. The August figures for durable
goods orders and home sales due out on Friday will confirm how weak the US
economy is.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (17): A tough negotiator -
Profile of Hans Tietmeyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANS TIETMEYER, vice-president of the German Bundesbank, is the most
forceful exponent of the stern monetary lore which now, for better or for
worse, guides the European economy. The burly 61-year-old - who between 1982
and end-1989 was the principal state secretary in the Bonn finance ministry
 -has been for years a familiar sight on the international economic circuit.
He gained a formidable reputation as a tough-minded negotiator and a
hard-working proponent of Germany's 'stability first' financial policies.
In terms of time spent on the job, Mr Tietmeyer was able to slip into
slightly lower gear when he took up a seat on the Bundesbank's directorate
at the beginning of 1990. But his international and domestic policy-making
role has become more important - for three reasons.
First, as the result of the resignation of Mr Karl Otto Pohl the then
president, Mr Tietmeyer moved up abruptly in August 1991 to the post of
vice-president. He has maintained his responsibilities for the Bundesbank's
international monetary business. Mr Tietmeyer is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
choice to take over as president next summer when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank chief, retires.
Barring accidents, Mr Tietmeyer thus looks likely to become the third
Bundesbank president (the other two were Mr Pohl and his predecessor, Mr
Otmar Emminger) to take over the top job after a thorough grooming in
international monetary affairs.
Second, the Bundesbank's direct responsibilities now extend across a larger
Germany. As a confidant of Mr Kohl, Mr Tietmeyer played a powerful part in
spring 1990 in deciding the monetary aspects of the German unification
process.
Third, Mr Tietmeyer has been given additional prominence by the long-running
debate over European economic and monetary union (Emu). He drafted the
Bundesbank's policy statements on the issue - notably its declarations in
September 1990 and in February 1992.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (16): Human face of world
finance - Profile of Michel Camdessus, chief of the International Monetary
Fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICHEL CAMDESSUS, the managing director of the IMF, is rapidly establishing
himself as the 'human face' of global finance. In recent speeches he has
called on all international agencies (including the IMF) to place a greater
emphasis on the social components of adjustment policies.
He believes 'social policy' is an essential 'fourth pillar' of a system of
international co-operation. The reforms he advocates include a big increase
in aid for developing countries and more generous social safety nets to ease
the human suffering involved in the transition to market capitalism.
Mr Camdessus has long argued that the IMF must adapt its traditional
approach. He favours less emphasis on short-term 'stabilisation' policies
and more emphasis on policies likely to promote long-run growth. At the Rio
Earth Summit in June, he refined his thinking further. The IMF's ultimate
goal was no longer growth but 'high quality' growth, he said.
In an interview just before the IMF/World Bank meeting, he set out the
requirements for high quality growth. It meant an expansion that was
sustainable (for example not based on excessive borrowing), that raised the
living standards of the poorest groups, and that met high environmental
standards.
Sceptics will note that the actual programmes negotiated by the fund's staff
rarely seem to embody Mr Camdessus's higher aspirations. However, the fact
that the IMF managing director makes radical speeches is significant in
itself. Policies will change only if attitudes change, and Mr Camdessus is
at least pushing in the right direction.
The supervision of the transition to capitalism in Russia and other formerly
centrally planned economies will doubtless occupy much of Mr Camdessus's
time in coming years. Indeed, in all probability Mr Camdessus's record will
be judged mainly by his success or failure in this historic task.
However, in the interview, Mr Camdessus stressed that he was also seeking to
place greater emphasis on the co-ordination of policies among industrial
countries. He regards this as a precondition for a robust world economic
recovery. If consumer and business confidence are to revive, he said, the
leading countries 'have to be seen to be acting together effectively'.
His remarks were prompted in part by the recent turmoil in foreign exchange
markets. In the mid-1980s the strains caused by the dollar's severe
overvaluation spurred a short-lived revival of interest in global
co-operation. This led to formal currency pacts - such as the Plaza and
Louvre accords of 1985 and 1987 - and to new mechanisms for monitoring
macroeconomic policies. But the commitment to co-operation proved
half-hearted.
Mr Camdessus's task is to try to build a more durable foundation for the
global co-ordination of policies. As a former governor of the French central
bank and director of the French treasury, he at least has the right
background: the French have always been among the most enthusiastic
supporters of government interventions to harmonise policies and stabilise
currencies.
If he succeeds, he will be fulfilling one of the IMF's historic tasks. As Mr
Camdessus has often stressed, the IMF was founded precisely on the
assumption that co-operative solutions to economic problems are preferable
to confrontational 'go-it-alone' approaches.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Insolvency Service fees and funding under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is undertaking a detailed review of the way in which the
official Insolvency Service is funded after strong criticism of the existing
system.
Among the issues under discussion is the reform of the insolvency services
account, which funds the service from the proceeds of assets realised from
insolvent companies and individuals.
The Insolvency Service deals with corporate and individual financial failure
and tackles wrongdoing within insolvencies. It is an executive agency of the
Department of Trade and Industry under the government's Next Steps
initiative.
Whitehall officials have confirmed that a review is under way. It will cover
some of the most important aspects of how the service is funded and the
structure of its fees.
Under the present timetable, ministers will have a report by early December.
Private insolvency practitioners have long complained that the insolvency
services account - which is administered by officials - is inefficient and
penalises creditors.
The existing system of finance means that the creditors of insolvent
companies and individuals are the ones who are paying for the service.
The proceeds of any asset sales from compulsory liquidations and
bankruptcies must be placed in the account, as well as those from other
liquidation procedures under certain conditions.
The account offers a low, fixed rate of interest which is taxed before any
proceeds can be removed. Some portion of the money can be placed into the
insolvency service investment account, which allows proceeds to be invested
in gilts and Treasury bills.
The Insolvency Service is at present running at a substantial surplus,
generating income from fees and the insolvency services account of Pounds
62m in the last financial year, against costs of Pounds 57m. The extra was
paid to the DTI.
The review is unlikely to propose any options that reduce the chance of the
service to be self-funding. But it will consider whether it is possible to
retain income generated rather than remitting it to the Treasury each year.
Among alternative proposals for raising money being considered is an
additional charge that would be paid by all limited liability companies as
part of their annual registration fee, or a fixed-rate fee levied on the
proceeds of asset realisations.
Historically, one of the reasons for the insolvency services account was to
prevent unscrupulous practitioners misappropriating funds left in their own
hands.
The 1986 insolvency act introduced a licensing system in which practitioners
are also required to put up a bond that could be cashed if there was any
suspicion of creditors' money being used improperly.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Auditors report price pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY SMALL firms of chartered accountants are experiencing severe price
competition for audit work, according to the findings of a new survey.
'Lowballing' or predatory pricing by rival firms for audit bids has caused
concern for nearly two thirds of a sample of 46 members of the CharterGroup
partnership, an association of accountancy firms.
Many firms have reported over the past few months that they have been coming
under pressure to reduce audit fees.
The ethics committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales was sufficiently concerned about lowballing to circulate a
discussion paper on the subject.
Sixty-three per cent of the CharterGroup survey said the present extent of
lowballing was sufficient to warrant concern, and 76 per cent believed it
would lead to a lowering of audit standards.

RECORD NUMBERS of homeowners are turning to the housing charity Shelter
because of mortgage debt.
The number of homeowners threatened with repossession seeking the charity's
advice increased by half last year.
Homeowners now accounted for one in seven of those wanting its help, Shelter
said in its annual report.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, a Shelter director, said: 'The changing face of our
caseload reflects the continuing debt crisis that is still swamping new
victims every day.
'Shelter has directly helped thousands of people stay in their homes in the
short term . . . but there has never been more urgency in our national
campaign for more affordable housing for rent.'
The charity reported an increase of 24 per cent in income to more than
Pounds 7m.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Rejection of Pounds 500m plan to be fought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT decision to reject a Pounds 500m package of commercial and
residential developments in an unemployment blackspot is to be challenged in
the high court by the receiver of a failed property company.
Citibank, the large US bank, and Touche Ross, the accountancy firm - the
promoters of the development - had estimated that the scheme would have
generated about 9,000 jobs on and around the Isle of Sheppey in north-east
Kent.
Mr Tony Houghton, a partner of Touche Ross and joint administrative receiver
of Lionhope (Kent), says decisions to reject the plans by Mr Michael Howard,
the environment secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary,
were 'fundamentally flawed in law'.
Mr Howard and Mr MacGregor said the proposals would have harmed nature
conservation interests and would have increased traffic congestion.
The plan included provision for a privately financed road tunnel linking
Sheppey to the mainland, the expansion of Sheerness Dock and the
construction of 3,300 homes and more than 1m sq metres of industrial and
business space.
Plans for the tunnel were welcomed in 1989 by the Department of Transport,
which said it would be bringing forward road improvements in anticipation of
the tunnel's development.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maps show sites of sea dumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN, the Irish Republic and Norway were the only countries among 12
bordering the north-east Atlantic to dump chemical waste off their shores in
1990, according to maps due to be circulated today to ministers from the 12
countries.
The maps, produced by the Oslo Commission, which regulates dumping in the
Atlantic, also show that potentially harmful waste has been dumped along
much of the European and Nordic coastlines.
Ministers from the 12 countries bordering the north-east Atlantic - the UK,
France, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, the Irish Republic, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden - are meeting in Paris in an
attempt to sign a new treaty to combat pollution in the Atlantic. But the UK
is threatening to scupper the treaty unless it retains the right to dump
some low-level radioactive waste at sea.
The Oslo commission's annual report for 1992, due to be published later this
week, shows that in 1990 the UK dumped chemical waste off the coasts of East
Anglia, Hartlepool, Blyth and Newcastle. The report also shows that the
Irish Republic dumped chemical waste near Cork, and Norway dumped in its
'internal' waters, which are outside the scope of the Oslo treaty. All but
two of the 12 countries - Spain and the Irish Republic - submitted figures
showing that they had dumped waste dredged from river beds and estuaries
near their coasts in 1990.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, said this weekend: 'We
will do our best in Paris to convince people not to use the sea as a dumping
place.' He added that Germany was prepared to discuss the compromise of a
moratorium rather than a ban.
Environmental groups have warned that the dispute over radioactive dumping
should not distract attention from the dangers of chemical waste and the
waste from dredged rivers and estuaries.
According to Mr Tim Birch, marine pollution officer at Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure group, dredged waste 'is often more highly
contaminated than industrial discharges as it is made up of sediments from
years back which contain a lot of heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium.'

need to be made if the process is to survive

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUBLIN CASTLE, the former seat of British colonial rule in Ireland, is the
venue this week of the round-table talks on Northern Ireland's political
future.
Not since the Irish Republic won independence in 1921 and Northern Ireland
split away, giving the Protestant Unionists of Ulster a secure political
majority there, have Unionists met Irish ministers on Irish ground.
The symbolism was not lost on the Rev Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist
party (DUP) leader, who last Friday announced that his delegation would not
be attending the Dublin phase of the talks. He has told the British and
Irish governments and the other three constitutional parties in the province
that are participating that his party would return to the table once the
Irish government agrees to drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland.
Mr Paisley said: 'We urge other delegations when returned from their Dublin
distraction to cease their play-acting and get down to the real work of
negotiating a way to the territorial claim that our people expect.'
That territorial claim will probably top the agenda this week in Dublin. The
DUP has thus absented itself from the discussions that are of most concern
to it.
The DUP intransigence has exposed a breach in the Unionist flank. The
Official Unionist party (OUP) is sending a 10-strong team to Dublin, and was
sharply critical of the DUP at the weekend.
Mr Ken McGinnis, the principal OUP negotiator, said: 'There were certain
undertakings made by all parties in this process. The OUP is not going to
run away, nor will it be pushed or pulled away from those obligations.'
The situation is such that signs of Unionist unity over the negotiating
process are becoming more difficult to detect as clear differences emerge
over tactics. Mr James Molyneaux, the OUP leader, and Mr Paisley have
carefully avoided direct criticism of each other's position. Both have
sought to underline the importance they attach to the amendment of Articles
2 and 3 of the Irish constitution, which deals with the territorial claim.
The leaders have chosen separate paths towards their goal.
Mr Paisley's party, the traditional voice of hardline unionism, is growing
more impatient with the lack of progress and its future participation in the
talks process is now in serious doubt. The Ulster Unionists remain committed
to the dialogue for the time being but are equally emphatic that the
constitution must be amended.
Mr Molyneaux told the Ulster Young Unionists' annual conference in Fermanagh
at the weekend: 'We are not reluctant British citizens nor coerced British
citizens but citizens by birth, history, tradition and our freely expressed
will in every election held since 1918.'
A statement made by Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, at the
talks last Friday, and leaked in Belfast and Dublin at the weekend, has
indicated signs of flexibility in Dublin.
Mr Andrews said: 'We do not rule out constitutional change, including change
in jurisdiction, ensuing from the present negotiations . . . if agreement on
a fair and honourable accommodation (between the nationalists and unionists)
were to entail any constitutional consequence in our jurisdiction, the
government could approach the electorate with the hope and prospect of a
positive response.'
A referendum would be needed to alter the Irish constitution.
Mr McGinnis said yesterday: 'The tone has modified noticeably from what we
previously understood to be the Irish government's position.'
That was perhaps helped by a statement last week from Mr John Bruton, the
opposition Fine Gael leader in Dublin, who said the government should be
prepared to yield more readily on the constitutional issue. 'An opportunity,
once lost, will not be retrieved by any amount of historical
hair-splitting,' he said.
The DUP yesterday rejected the Irish statement, however. Mr Sammy Wilson,
for the DUP, called it 'a pig in a poke'.
The talks have thus arrived at what is probably their most critical phase.
The first indications of compromises from all parties will have to be laid
on the table this week in Dublin. If none is forthcoming, it is unlikely
that this particular talks process will survive.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Trawlers get protection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FISHERIES protection vessel was standing off the Scilly Isles yesterday
after reports of more clashes between British and French trawlers in
disputed fishing grounds.
The Ministry of Defence said the fisheries protection vessel HMS Shetland
sailed to the area after the reports, but found no sign of French trawlers.
Falmouth Coastguards and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
both confirmed that Cornish trawlers reported yesterday that French trawlers
were sailing close to the nets of British boats off the Scilly Isles.
They could not confirm reports that one British trawler's nets were
destroyed by the French trawler L'Arche, the same vessel involved in clashes
in June.
In those incidents, involving several trawlers from Newlyn and the Brittany
port of Concarneau, the Cornish fishermen's nets suffered Pounds 15,000 of
damage.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Shelter sees rise in debt victims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD NUMBERS of homeowners are turning to the housing charity Shelter
because of mortgage debt.
The number of homeowners threatened with repossession seeking the charity's
advice increased by half last year.
Homeowners now accounted for one in seven of those wanting its help, Shelter
said in its annual report.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, a Shelter director, said: 'The changing face of our
caseload reflects the continuing debt crisis that is still swamping new
victims every day.
'Shelter has directly helped thousands of people stay in their homes in the
short term . . . but there has never been more urgency in our national
campaign for more affordable housing for rent.'
The charity reported an increase of 24 per cent in income to more than
Pounds 7m.
The report said: 'In spite of the growth we were still hit by the recession,
which required us to revise our target during the year. However, the
fund-raising division did remarkably well in making up a decline in income
in some areas by increases in others.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Auditors report fierce competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY SMALL firms of chartered accountants are experiencing severe price
competition for audit work, according to the findings of a new survey.
'Lowballing' or predatory pricing by rival firms for audit bids has caused
concern for nearly two thirds of a sample of 46 members of the CharterGroup
partnership, an association of accountancy firms.
Many firms have reported anecdotally over the past few months that they have
been coming under pressure to reduce audit fees. That has been driven by
many companies putting audits out to tender while accountancy firms have
been eager to gain business because of the effects of the recession.
The ethics committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales was sufficiently concerned about lowballing to circulate a
discussion paper on the subject.
Sixty-three per cent of the CharterGroup survey said the present extent of
lowballing was sufficient to warrant concern, and 76 per cent believed it
would lead to a lowering of audit standards.
Four fifths believe there should be extended ethical guidance on the subject
from the institute.
Eighty-eight per cent of firms believe that accountants would recover low
income from audits by providing other services to their clients.
Sixty-one per cent were concerned that aggressive price competition was
affecting research and technical development within firms as a way to cut
costs.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Suspected faction leader held
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the men alleged to be at the centre of rivalry between republican
gangs in Belfast has been arrested by police, it was reported yesterday.
He is among five men being questioned about attacks linked to a feud in the
Irish People's Liberation Organisation over drugs and money which has left
three men dead.
One of the factions bombed the Waterfront Bar at Dunbar Link on Saturday
night, but it is not known if the attack was connected with the dispute.
About 150 customers, many of them attending a wedding party, managed to
escape and nobody was hurt.
Three of those in custody were detained in the lower Falls area soon after
the pub went up in flames.
The other two were held some days ago after a car was stopped and a gun
found. According to security sources, one is suspected to be a leading
figure in one of the gangs.
The power struggle is between the organisation's so-called Belfast brigade
and a group led by a man now living in Dublin and on the run from the RUC.
Mr Jimmy Brown, an IPLO leader before the split, was one of the three men
shot dead when the in-fighting erupted in bloodshed last month. The sides
have vowed to wipe each other out.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Rejection of Pounds 500m plan to be fought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT decision to reject a Pounds 500m package of commercial and
residential developments in an unemployment blackspot is to be challenged in
the high court by the receiver of a failed property company.
Citibank, the large US bank, and Touche Ross, the accountancy firm - the
promoters of the development - had estimated that the scheme would have
generated about 9,000 jobs on and around the Isle of Sheppey in north-east
Kent.
Mr Tony Houghton, a partner of Touche Ross and joint administrative receiver
of Lionhope (Kent), says decisions to reject the plans by Mr Michael Howard,
the environment secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary,
were 'fundamentally flawed in law'.
Mr Howard and Mr MacGregor said the proposals would have harmed nature
conservation interests and would have increased traffic congestion.
The plan included provision for a privately financed road tunnel linking
Sheppey to the mainland, the expansion of Sheerness Dock and the
construction of 3,300 homes and more than 1m sq metres of industrial and
business space.
Plans for the tunnel were welcomed in 1989 by the Department of Transport,
which said it would be bringing forward road improvements in anticipation of
the tunnel's development.
Citibank, which previously had provided finance to Lionhope, is estimated to
have spent more than Pounds 1m financing the planning applications after the
developer, part of the Tudor Grange group of companies, went into
administrative receivership in 1989.
The region, for which Swale Borough Council is seeking assisted-area status,
has an unemployment rate of more than 12 per cent. That compares with a
national average of 9.9 per cent.
Mr Houghton said: 'The decisions of the secretaries of state can only be
seen as highly regrettable and potentially damaging.'
The four sites where developments were proposed were:
Ridham on the south bank of the Swale, where the existing port was to be
expanded and 220 hectares of industrial, business and warehouse space added.
Lappel Bank, where 100 hectares of land was to be reclaimed for the
expansion of Sheerness Dock.
Queenborough, where 300 homes were to be built alongside a marina.
Minster, where 3,000 homes were planned along with schools, medical
facilities, a golf course and some parkland.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Time's up for long office breaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE British office worker now spends just 21 minutes a day having
lunch, 11 minutes drinking tea or coffee, and six minutes going to the
toilet, according to a survey by Interlink Express Parcels.
The survey attributes such indices of pressure to the recession. A total of
74 per cent of those interviewed in the sample say that greater demands are
being made on their time than two years ago.
The survey also finds that office workers spend 42 minutes a day on the
telephone, 38 minutes chatting face-to-face, 21 minutes reading or writing
letters, 15 minutes attending meetings, and 50 minutes commuting to work.
Nearly 90 per cent complain of their time regularly being wasted - 53 per
cent blame interruptions from unscheduled telephone calls or visits and 15
per cent blame the waste of time on reading junk mail. Workers based in
London complain most about unscheduled interruptions and those based in
Manchester complain least.
The survey is based on a small sample of only 100 workers but Interlink says
the sample included secretaries, clerical workers, consultants and senior
executives from London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Bristol.
More than 64 per cent report being equally busy throughout the day, with a
third saying there are peaks and troughs. London-based workers are most
likely to be busy through the day while those in Edinburgh are most likely
to have peaks and troughs.
Workers report that Tuesday is the quietest day of the week and Monday and
Friday are the most frantic.
A third of office workers say time pressures have 'greatly increased' in the
past two years and nearly half (49 per cent) blame the pressures on
increased business without any increase in staff. An almost equal proportion
attribute their troubles to greater competition caused by the recession.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Carbon tax raises power sales hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK electricity industry would suffer less than other sectors of the
energy industry from the European Community's proposed carbon tax, according
to a confidential report prepared for the Electricity Association, the
industry's trade group.
The tax might even result in electricity increasing its market share.
The report, by Cambridge Econometrics, the research group, suggests that the
tax would reduce total energy demand in the UK by 7 per cent between 1990
and 2000. Even so, electricity demand would fall only 5 per cent because
large segments of industry would switch to electricity from other power
sources.
The big loser would be coal, where consumption is forecast to fall 19 per
cent by 2000 and 42 per cent by 2005.
Gas consumption would also decline because cuts by domestic and industrial
users would more than offset increased use of gas by power generators.
The EC is proposing a tax equivalent to Dollars 3 a barrel of oil, rising by
Dollars 1 annual stages to Dollars 10. The tax would be based partly on the
carbon content of fuel and partly on the energy content. The Cambridge
report was commissioned by the Electricity Association to help it to prepare
a submission to the government. Comments were due by the end of last week.
On the sensitive question of how the tax would affect profits, the report
says that about Pounds 400m is in the balance. If the electricity industry
absorbed all the increased cost of the tax, total profits would be reduced
by that amount. It was therefore a question of how much of the cost the
industry would be able to pass on to the consumer. Last year the electricity
companies as a whole made pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2bn.
The tax would reduce UK carbon emissions by about 9 per cent by 2000, the
report says, helped by an easing of demand and a switch to cleaner fuels.
Most of the reduction would come from the power generation industry.
Transport, the other principal source of pollution, would barely reduce
emissions at all because of the lack of alternatives to petrol.
The report says that the measure would yield enough revenue to allow the
government to cut value added tax from 17.5 per cent to 16 per cent. It
concludes that the macroeconomic effect of the tax would be small provided
that the revenues are fully recycled.
Although the Cambridge report provides some encouragement to the electricity
industry, it is unlikely to sway its general opposition to the tax. National
Power, the largest power generator, has told the government that the tax
might be damaging to economic growth.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Managers' salaries outstrip inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASIC PAY for managers continues to outstrip inflation comfortably and has
risen by 5.6 per cent over the past 12 months, compared with 8.9 per cent a
year ago, according to the latest survey by the Reward Group, the employment
consultancy.
In the three months to August, the average settlement for managers fell to
4.2 per cent, but the survey participants do not predict a further fall, and
the annual settlement level for this time next year is expected to be 4.8
per cent.
The latest report from Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, predicts
that next year: 'Low inflation plus stagnation will produce low pay
settlements, roughly in the 3 to 5 per cent range.'
The report notes: 'It is true that pay settlement levels have more than
halved since the beginning of 1991, but this has been the consequence of
recessionary forces and the decline in the inflation rate, rather than a
fundamental change in bargaining behaviour.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Way is cleared for Gold TV channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOLD, the planned Pounds 30m television entertainment channel, now seems
certain to go ahead.
The new channel, which will be financed entirely by advertising, at least in
the first year, will be broadcast by the Astra satellite system.
A US television company has agreed in principle to underwrite the 65 per
cent of the equity not held by the channel's founders, Thames Television and
BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC.
A deal being finalised with the unnamed company clears the way for a launch
of UK Gold in mid November. Thames, which will cease to be an ITV company at
the end of this year, will take a 15 per cent stake in the company, with an
option for a further 5 per cent, and the BBC will have 20 per cent.
The aim is for the rest of the equity to be held by four or five
shareholders, but the underwriting deal means that the launch of the channel
can now go ahead before all the shareholders are formally in place.
The channel, drawing on the programme libraries of Thames, the BBC and other
broadcasters, will be entirely devoted to entertainment. There will be no
news, current affairs, sport or religious programmes. The programme
schedules will include popular drama series, such as The Bill, and
Eastenders, and comedies such as Porridge.
A long-term programme deal has already been signed by BBC Enterprises and
another with Thames will be complete within a few days. The programmes will
be made available under existing agreements with Equity, the actors' union.
The Independent Television Commission has indicated that UK Gold's structure
is likely to be acceptable under the terms of the Broadcasting Act, which
prevents the BBC being part of an ITC-licensed satellite channel. The BBC
would be part of the UK Gold holding company but would not be part of a
separate company that would hold the licence.
ITV is still considering the possibility of launching a similar channel,
ITV2, using its programme library. It is not clear whether ITV2 is anything
more than an attempted spoiler.
UK Gold's business plan suggests that it will initially get a 3 per cent
share of viewing in homes that can receive satellite and cable television,
rising to 5 per cent in six or seven years. Executives privately suggest
that it may get 7 per cent or 8 per cent.
Although UK Gold is seen as primarily an advertising channel, it may join
one subscription packages of programmes now being planned for satellite
television. Although UK Gold will be on a Europe-wide satellite, it will be
available only in the UK because of restrictions in programme rights.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Service costs for offices increased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERVICE charges for office buildings increased faster than inflation last
year, according to a report by Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyor
and international property consultant.
Service charges now represent a larger share of tenants' gross costs as
rental levels continue to fall.
The report, which covers buildings ranging from 3,000 sq ft to 400,000 sq
ft, says the level of service charges last year reflected contract prices
agreed in 1990 that had not been influenced by the recession.
Jones Lang Wootton estimates that service charges this year will be at or
below the average level of inflation as contractors submit increasingly
competitive tenders.
Insurance costs rose an average of 10 per cent last year and are expected to
rise by a further 10 per cent this year in the face of 'uncertainty in the
insurance market for commercial property'.
The report says service charges accounted for 9.1 per cent of tenants' gross
costs last year for air-conditioned buildings in the West End of London
compared with 7.8 per cent in 1990, and 7.9 per cent in 1989. In the City,
the share of gross costs represented by service charges jumped to 12.5 per
cent in 1991 from 8.9 per cent in 1990 and 7 per cent in 1989.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Low wages 'paid by third of employers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY one in three employers are illegally underpaying their staff,
according to a report from the Low Pay Unit based on the 1991 figures from
the government's Wages Inspectorate.
The Low Pay Unit, an independent research group, found that of about 18,000
employers visited by government inspectors last year, nearly 6,000 were
underpaying staff. Only 15 employers were prosecuted.
Mr Chris Pond, director of the Low Pay Unit, said: 'The Wages Inspectorate,
which has responsibility for enforcing minimum wage legislation, is being
whittled away. There are now only 64 inspectors to check the wages of nearly
2.5m employees, compared with 177 in 1979.'
He said proposals to abolish the Wages Councils, which set wages in some
low-paid industries, would legitimise 'criminally low wages' and leave the
UK alone in Europe with no minimum wage protection.
The latest underpayment figures represent a 15 per cent increase on 1990.
The Low Pay Unit says the worst offenders are employers in the retail food
sector. Cafe and snack bars also had a poor record, followed by restaurants,
hotels, pubs, clothing factories and shoe repairers.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Property advisers' skills criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY advisers lack proper management skills and financial expertise,
according to a report by the College of Estate Management, an independent
training and research establishment.
The report, based on 23 interviews with representatives from all sides of
the property industry, identifies weaknesses among property advisers,
including poor analytical skills; a reluctance to be innovative and
independent; and a tendency to be superficial. Advisers' strengths are
centred on contacts, local knowledge and depth of resources.
The report says that the failure of chartered surveyors to understand their
clients' overall business needs has led to the entry of other professions
such as accountants and management consultants into the marketplace.
Quantity surveyors, architects and building surveyors are declining in
importance because of changing practices in the building industry, the
report says. For instance, the growing importance of comprehensive 'design
and build' contracts has weakened demand for architects' traditional
management and co-ordination roles, although their design skills continue to
be in demand.
Demand for investment surveyors is also likely to fall, as their skills do
not meet the demands of increasingly complex financial markets.
In general, the professionals who will be at a disadvantage are those who
have 'a narrow, myopic outlook and training and an inability to bridge
across disciplines and understand both the complexity of, and synergy
within, the entire property and construction industry'.
The report concludes: 'Individuals need to be complete business men or
women, rather than narrow technicians.'

COMMANDER George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist
branch for seven years, is to be replaced by Commander David Tucker, the
Metropolitan Police commissioner said yesterday.
Sir Peter Imbert said the move was one of a number involving senior officers
in the Metropolitan Police. Mr Tucker, at present head of the force's
criminal intelligence branch, takes over from Mr Churchill-Coleman against a
background of reports of the government's impatience with the anti-terrorist
squad's failure to prevent IRA attacks on the mainland.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, recently said MI5 was to take over the
primary responsibility for gathering intelligence about IRA terrorism on
mainland Britain. Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, which deals with
the investigation of IRA incidents and the subsequent preparation of
evidence, was unaffected operationally by the move.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (2): Outward signs of activity
mask the real story - Statistics paint a gloomy picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE wanting to place a finger on the economic pulse of Northern Ireland
these days, need do no more than stand on the Queen Elizabeth Bridge over
the Lagan river in Belfast.
From there an outward appearance of feverish activity meets the eye. The
unmistakable heavy-lift cranes of the Harland and Wolf shipyard manoeuvre
structures on to the hull of a bulk carrier - one of six orders the company
won last year; the flash of welding arcs identifies the Lagan weir - the
centrepiece of the Laganside development scheme; the ramps for the
cross-harbour road and rail link are taking shape; and in the harbour
itself, the sleek lines of the SeaCat ferry from Stranraer can be spotted
bringing in carloads of tourists that are feeding a renaissance in the
province's tourism industry.
According to a regional trends survey published in July by the Confederation
of British Industry, the economic outlook in the province is better than
anywhere else in the UK, with order books growing and businessmen showing
confidence by planning new investment. The recession, it would seem, has
only been happening over the water.
But a different picture emerges from the statistics. The Northern Ireland
Economic Council (NIEC), a governmental research and advisory body
representing business and trade union interests, notes in a report made in
April of this year that 'almost all the indicators . . . show that the
Northern Ireland economy has been in recession over the past year. Given
that recovery in Northern Ireland has usually lagged behind recovery in the
rest of the UK, where GDP and other indicators are still falling, any
respite from these problems may be some way off'.
'These indicators add up to what is probably the most gloomy assessment of
the Northern Ireland economy that the Council has produced since the last
recession in the early 1980s,' it says.
Unemployment rose in July to 107,100, up 6,700 on the same month last year,
and is now at 14.7 per cent of the workforce. Dr Graham Gudgin, the head of
the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre (NIERC) says his group's
econometric model predicts unemployment rising to 16.4 per cent by 1994, to
fall later but to remain at 15 per cent until the end of the decade.
According to the NIEC, over half the unemployed have been out of work over
one year and are classified as long-term unemployed - almost double the UK
average of 27 per cent.
The recession held off until last year in Northern Ireland, largely because
of high public sector employment level and lower house prices resulting in
higher disposable incomes than the rest of the UK. But those watching the
longer term trends are concerned that when there is an upturn, the province
will continue to lag behind the rest of the UK.
The announcement earlier this month from Mr Michael Mates, minister of state
for finance and security in the province, that Northern Ireland will have to
face public spending cuts this year with the rest of the UK, has added
further gloom to the picture.
more radical approaches are needed. 'Until we get off the current growth
path, there is no prospect of any convergence with the mainland economy or
our Community partners,' he said. Northern Ireland's GNP per capita is
calculated to be around 75 per cent of the rest of the UK, but at the upper
end of the poorer regions in the community.
The NIEC calculates that if the EC were to continue its average annual
growth rate of 3 per cent of the past five years, Northern Ireland would
have to grow at an annual 5.4 per cent to achieve convergence over the next
15 years. But figures produced by Dr Gudgin's group show Northern Ireland's
economy has rarely outstripped growth in the overall UK economy, and then
only during recessions.
Inside and outside government, it is acknowledged that the province's high
birth rate - one of the highest in western Europe - is a big problem.
Job creation programmes, industrial promotion and vocational training are
all being actively pursued through various governmental agencies, some of
them using EC funding, but Dr Gudgin believes this is not enough.
'If we had the same birth rate as the rest of the UK we would have the same
unemployment rate. We have to create a highly skilled mobile workforce and
increase the quality of labour, to give people the skills to find jobs.'
He said a vocational training programme 'to bring everybody up to A-level
standard at vocational level' would create a different outlook for the
province. Although A-level results in Northern Ireland are consistently
higher than on the mainland, he says 'only a third of students go on to
A-levels. It is no good educating just half of the people'.
There is little hope of funds being made available for such an ambitious
programme though. Public expenditure is targeted at Pounds 7bn for 1992/93
and will rise by an average 2.4 per cent annually in real terms until 94/95.
As a proportion of total UK public spending, however, it is declining,
according to the NIEC.
A growing body of opinion believes that by giving the province autonomous
powers and allowing it to work with the Irish Republic to negotiate the
allocation of EC structural funds, a higher rate of growth could be
achieved. Both parts of the island suffer similar structural problems but
for 1989-93 structural funds allocated to Ireland were almost three times on
a per capita basis those which were allocated to Northern Ireland.
Such an approach would clearly have to clear the hurdle of a political
solution. But even those trying to sell Northern Ireland to the outside
world, are frank in their assessment of the future if unemployment is not
adequately tackled. Mr Billy Pinkerton, a DoE official administering the
government's 'Positively Belfast' campaign, said: 'If we don't give the
people of Belfast the dignity of employment or further education, someone is
going to stick guns in their hands.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): Waving the olive branch -
Present talks represent the first real hope of peace in years. But deepening
recession and threat of spending cuts add to the sense of urgency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

POLITICAL initiatives lie like burnt-out wrecks along the trail that has
marked Northern Ireland's recent history.
Twenty-three years of intractable sectarian conflict has left behind such a
backlog of mistrust and fear that new ideas for bridging the gulf between
the nationalist and unionist traditions in Northern Ireland have often been
rejected out of hand before they have even had a hearing.
But in April, for the first time since the 'troubles' began, the province's
four main constitutional parties started facing each other at the
negotiating table, with representatives from the British and Irish
governments, to discuss substantive proposals for the future administrative
structure for Northern Ireland. The complex three-strand negotiating process
initiated then has created the first real hope in years that the elusive
political settlement may finally be in the offing.
The walk-out by the Democratic Unionist leaders at Stormont two weeks ago,
however, has put a question mark over their likely presence in Dublin this
week, where the talks are scheduled to resume today. The Rev Ian Paisley,
the DUP leader, insists that the Irish government must first commit itself
to reforming the Republic's constitution, dropping its legal territorial
claim to Northern Ireland, before any progress can be made in other aspects
of the negotiations.
The Irish government, for its part, is proffering the carrot of
constitutional reform to the Unionists, which would dilute the Republic's
territorial claim to one of a mere 'aspiration' for Irish unity, but in
return also wants guarantees that will protect the interests of the minority
community in Northern Ireland.
The nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) led by Mr John Hume,
will be particularly anxious that any compromise on the Irish constitution
must be compensated by a radical new government structure for the province,
which will give Dublin some monitoring role in order to guard against any
irredentism on the part of the Unionist majority.
To date, the unionists have given few clues as to how they see the concerns
of the nationalist community and the Irish government being addressed, or
indeed that they are prepared to surrender any of their bargaining counters.
That presumably will be tested soon.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary of state, said that he
has no wish to endanger the talks by putting undue pressure on the
participants. 'I expect it to be a longer rather than a shorter process. It
would be better to see a result rather than an abrupt halt. It will have a
better chance of success if we allow people to sound off,' he said.
However, there is concern in Dublin that the talks should not drag on
indefinitely. Four cabinet ministers are in the Irish delegation, and are
devoting most of their time to the talks - an indication of the importance
Dublin attaches to the process.
If no progress is made in the coming weeks, however, there could be a change
of attitude, especially if simmering domestic crises should come to the
boil.
For its part, the UK government is showing signs of financial, if not
political, fatigue with the Ulster question. In a speech earlier this month
Mr Michael Mates, minister of state for finance and security in the
province, said Northern Ireland would no longer be cushioned from the impact
of spending cuts elsewhere in the country. 'There are firm constraints on
public expenditure nationally and these are likely to be reflected in
difficult decisions for all parts of the public sector. . . we in Northern
Ireland cannot be excused our share of this misery'.
It is an ominous warning. Some 40 per cent of employment in Northern Ireland
comes from the public sector. It has been an important factor in Northern
Ireland weathering the recession better than other parts of the country.
Unemployment, already the highest regional rate in the UK, is rising,
however, and independently forecast to exceed 16 per cent by 1994, even
before any cuts. Economic experts are calling for radical new approaches to
the economy. The government, however, appears to be going in the opposite
direction.
It is also going against the political grain in the province by pressing
ahead with its plans for privatisation of public utilities against both
nationalist and unionist opposition.
The determination of the government to reduce Northern Ireland's strain on
the Exchequer will undoubtedly encourage a growing number of politicians
from both political persuasions to seek economic comfort in Brussels.
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, in its last Congress also noted
that an EC dimension might form the basis of a political solution. Its
leaders have also been making increasingly conciliatory statements towards
the unionists in recent months. The defeat of Mr Gerry Adams in the West
Belfast constituency at the last general elections is indicative that Sinn
Fein's star is on the wane, and is pushing the organisation towards a more
moderate and conciliatory stance.
From the other end of the spectrum, Sir Patrick Mayhew is emphatic when he
says: 'The British government does not have a selfish motive for staying
here. It does not have a special interest of its own to serve . . . The more
people understand that is the way we look at it, the harder it will be for
the IRA to win support.'
He still rules out talks with Sinn Fein, however. 'When there is palpable
evidence on the ground that they have renounced and denounced violence for
political purposes, then we will have a new situation,' he said.
The fact that the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the cover organisation
for the Loyalist paramilitaries of the UFF, was proscribed last month, and
Sinn Fein was not, is nonetheless being interpreted as a signal to Sinn Fein
that the door has not been closed to their eventual inclusion in the talks.
The substantive concessions from all sides which will be necessary for
progress have thus still to be made, but the fact that negotiations have
begun at all suggests that a rethink of old dogmas may be under way.
According to Mr Robin Wilson, the editor of Fortnight magazine in Belfast,
who through his publication has done much to draw attention to the merits of
an EC dimension in any settlement, 'it will be a question of redefining
nationalism and unionism in a European context'.
Whether that imaginative road will be chosen, remains to be seen. It will be
a difficult and politically risky process for all involved, but the price of
past failure by Northern Ireland's politicians is already there to be seen -
the bomb-damaged buildings of Belfast and a grisly death toll of 3,000 since
1969.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Mandarins turn their attention to a question of cash:
Economists are divided over ways of monitoring money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Britain likely to be in no hurry to rejoin the European exchange rate
mechanism, Treasury mandarins will be working overtime this week answering
an important question: what is the best way of monitoring the money supply?
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, gave a clear hint yesterday that the
supply of money - an important indicator of demand and inflationary
pressures - would have a bigger role in determining the direction of base
rates, which many politicians and industrialists would like to see brought
down quickly from 10 per cent.
The chancellor's comments will be both a relief and a challenge to
monetarist economists. While many have been angered by the progressively
smaller importance accorded to monetary targeting during the late 1980s,
they also find it difficult to agree on precisely which measure of the money
supply provides the best method of monitoring demand.
Professor Patrick Minford, a monetarist economist at Liverpool University
and long-time opponent of the ERM, said Britain should make M0 - a narrow
measure of money, which mainly comprises notes and coins in circulation, the
best known form of 'ready money' - the centrepiece of its targeting policy.
Prof Minford believes demand is so weak that Britain could safely cut base
rates to as little as 4 per cent without causing the pound to drift too low
or triggering an unpalatable rise in inflation.
In the opposing camp are other monetarists, including Professor Tim Congdon,
economic adviser to discount house Gerrard &amp; National, who says greater
weight should be given to targeting broad measures of the money supply.
Such measures comprise not only cash in circulation but monetary deposits.
Those can be drawn on for purchasing goods and services, and so provide an
additional representation of demand. Of those measures, the best known is
M4, which is cash in circulation plus sterling deposits in banks and
building societies.
Somewhere between devotees of 'broad' and 'narrow' money are economists
including Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, the
investment house. Mr Spencer favours an eclectic measure of money which he
calls 'divisia money'. It accounts for cash together with monetary deposits
in banks and other institutions, with the amount of money in the deposits
given a 'weight', depending on the degree to which they represent ready
money as opposed to funds being kept to gain interest.
Under Mr Spencer's system, for example, current accounts in banks - which
many people draw on virtually all the time for purchases and so have a big
effect on the rest of the economy - would be given a weight of close to 100
per cent. Many kinds of savings deposits, on the other hand, would be given
a zero weighting because the owners of such money have little or no imminent
intention of releasing it into wider circulation.
In the early 1980s, Britain used a range of methods to target the money
supply. Sir Terry Burns, formerly the government's chief economic adviser,
who is now Treasury permanent secretary, was brought into Whitehall in 1980
primarily because he favoured monetary targeting.
But since the mid 1980s, monetary targeting has become a much less important
part of UK economic policymaking, with the Treasury switching instead after
ERM entry nearly two years ago to a full-blown method of targeting the
exchange rate.
The Treasury still formally targets M0, saying it should ideally be growing
at between zero and 4 per cent a year to keep the economy ticking over at
optimum level. In the year to the end of August, M0 grew 2.4 per cent,
indicating a continuation of a slack economy. However, the Bank of England
has always been sceptical about the value of M0 and has been more keen on
broad-money targeting. One UK official said recently that M0 targeting had
little practical relevance to steering the economy and had been kept mainly
'for presentational reasons'.
Assuming the Treasury can agree with the Bank precisely which monetary
measures to target, it will then probably try to decide on the target range,
a far from easy job.
It was the continual need to revise money targets - because of problems in
working out the link between specific measures of the money supply and
inflation - that led Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, in the mid
1980s to drop money targeting as a central plank of economic policy.
Mr Giles Keating, economics director at Credit Suisse First Boston, the
Swiss bank, said that, given the government's need to build up credibility
with financial markets after the debacle of the ERM suspension, the Treasury
should provide a 'clear statement' about the precise form its monetary
targeting should take. He said: 'The Treasury should publish some definite
rules about what it has in mind. It will not be enough to make some vague
promise about the government from now on taking into account monetary
aggregates.'
If the government follows Mr Keating's suggestion, the UK will follow many
other European governments in having explicit targets for the money supply.
The wheel would then have turned full circle for Sir Terry, who would find
official government thinking on the need to monitor this variable back to
what was the Treasury line 12 years ago.

FT  21 SEP 92 / New fear of travel collapses sparked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MASON International Travel, a Scottish holiday company, has ceased trading
amid fears that more travel operators are facing collapse in the wake of
sterling's devaluation.
The Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday that five international travel
operators had ceased trading in the last month.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, claimed that last
week's devaluation had 'plunged holiday companies into financial crisis'. He
said travel operators would find that the money they had taken from clients
would no longer cover their bills abroad, because devaluation had increased
costs by 10 per cent.
Mason International Travel, based in Glasgow, specialised in package
holidays to Canada and the US. All its holidays were covered by bonds with
the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) and the CAA.
The 300 customers estimated to be abroad will be able to continue their
holidays, while those with advance bookings will receive a full refund.
Mason International Travel traded under several names including Canada Air
Holidays, Canada By Design, America By Design, Florida By Design and Albany
Tours. It is believed that the company is seeking a buyer as a going
concern. A recorded message at its Glasgow offices yesterday reported that
it was temporarily closed but was 'hoping for good news by Tuesday'.
Mr Griffiths claimed that about 1m package holidays a year were taken with
non-Abta companies with none of the protection of Abta bonding.
EC law would require all travel companies to be bonded from January 1 next
year, Mr Griffiths said, but UK law offered no protection to holidaymakers
booking between now and December 31.
The government had already missed its deadline for issuing guidance on
implementation of the regulations, Mr Griffiths said. The Department of
Trade and Industry had previously told the travel trade that the bonding
regulations would be published on August 1.
Mr Griffiths accused the government of dithering and failing to take action.
'This gross negligence cost 40,000 holidaymakers their money and their
holidays when Land Travel collapsed without bonding in July,' he said.
He called on the government to publish the guidance regulations today and to
take action this week to enforce bonding on all travel companies to bridge
the gap between now and the end of the year.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Smith aims for party consensus on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, Labour leader, must this week steer a perilous policy course
aimed at reconciling the widely divergent views on Europe within his party
while maximising pressure on the government.
Even before the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty
was known last night, his officials were preparing the policy options to be
presented to the shadow cabinet and Labour's national executive committee on
Wednesday.
The conclusions that are drawn in the next 48 hours will have a crucial
bearing on Mr Smith's ability to keep the party united and to inflict the
maximum damage on the government in Thursday's Commons debate on the
economy.
If he succeeds, he will go to the party conference in Blackpool next week in
triumph. But if the wrong tone is set, there is a danger that Labour will
suffer the kind of public in-fighting over Europe that is dogging the
Conservative party.
In recent weeks, the new party leader has faced mounting criticism from some
colleagues for not keeping open the option of a sterling devaluation and a
British referendum on the future of the Maastricht treaty.
A growing lobby - including three leading shadow cabinet members - is now
privately claiming that it has been vindicated by the debacle in the foreign
exchange markets last week that saw the pound eventually suspended from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Yesterday, however, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow heritage secretary and the most
prominent dissident, was waiting for the verdict of the French vote.
Senior party officials were insisting, however, that Labour continued to
oppose a referendum on the ground that the issues were best dealt with by
parliament. In addition, it was too early to give a definitive view on how
the Opposition should respond to the highly volatile economic outlook,
including the future of the ERM, that would be strongly influenced by the
French poll.
One senior shadow cabinet minister predicted, however, that Labour's likely
posture would remain more European than that of the government. 'I don't
think we will be ready to make the same volte-face as them,' he said.
Mr Smith is aware that he must woo the Euro-sceptics. While out-and-out
opponents of the European Community are now a rump within the party,
Labour's so-called soft left, including the Tribune group, are growing more
vocal in their demands for wide-ranging changes to the Maastricht agreement.
In particular, they want to see more democratic accountability imposed on a
European central bank and other Community institutions. They are also
arguing that the criteria for economic convergence - required before
monetary union - should include social goals such as a Continent-wide effort
to cut unemployment.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Conservative MPs back tax incentives on equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST Conservative MPs and City professionals agree that the government
should provide further encouragement through the tax system for individuals
to invest in equities and unit trusts, according to a survey.
However, the study of politicians and senior City staff shows Labour MPs as
very negative about such encouragement - more than three quarters (76 per
cent) opposing it and only 14 per cent in favour.
The survey, conducted by Access Opinions, shows that while the views of
Labour MPs towards private pensions have softened, they retain suspicions of
the stock market, and by implication its involvement in the pensions
industry.
The survey aimed to test the change in attitudes on the left in favour of
private economic activity, and among Tories on whether Britain's marginal
propensity to save is too high to maintain healthy consumption levels.
The responses of Tory MPs on the panel of 100 politicians were almost the
same as those of a panel of stockbrokers, bankers and representatives from
insurance, accountancy and the law. Three quarters of the Tories favour more
tax encouragement for investors while 23 per cent oppose them. That
highlights the fact that most do not agree that the current marginal
propensity to save is too high.
Both Conservative and Labour MPs support the principle of pension
contributions being wholly excluded from taxable income, as does the City.
Nearly nine out of 10 Tories (89 per cent) support that proposition,
compared with 77 per cent of Labour MPs. No Labour MPs oppose it strongly.
Similarly, most MPs would support a proposal to tax different forms of
savings in the same way wherever possible, but there is significant
opposition in both parties.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Ministers offer hope of small cut in loan rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS last night held out the prospect of an early cut in interest rates
but sought to play down speculation that sterling's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism had set the stage for a rapid relaxation of
anti-inflation policy.
The forecast of a fall in borrowing costs before the Conservative party
conference - which starts early next month - did little to disguise growing
concern within the cabinet about the longer-term implications of the break
with the D-Mark.
The unease coincided with acknowledgement by Whitehall officials that it was
now 'impossible to predict' exactly when sterling would rejoin the ERM.
One of Mr John Major's senior colleagues said the uncertainty would
foreshadow intense debate within the cabinet over the pace of the pound's
re-entry.
It is understood that there is no pressure on the prime minister to rejoin
over the next few weeks. There is a broad consensus that the immediate
priority is to see the establishment of economic recovery in Britain and
evidence from Germany that its interest rates are on a downward path.
But Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and other senior
ministers are arguing that an indefinite suspension of ERM membership would
decisively undercut Britain's economic prospects.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary,
are among others said to believe that the government should be thinking in
terms of resuming membership later this year or early next year.
Pro-European ministers were emphasising yesterday that the increasing
confidence of the Euro-sceptics on the Conservative back benches disguised
the fact that the cabinet is stacked heavily against them. Their hope is
that Mr Major will reaffirm his commitment to keeping Britain at the 'heart
of Europe' during Thursday's emergency Commons debate on the economy.
The ministers acknowledged concern that the shock of last week's devaluation
may for a time tempt the prime minister to switch his attention from
rebuilding bridges with Europe to the need for economic recovery here.
The timing and scale of reductions in interest rates will depend on the
level at which sterling settles on foreign exchange markets after
yesterday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Treasury officials are warning ministers that the devaluation of the pound
since last Wednesday has already provided a loosening of monetary policy. If
the government moved too quickly to push up domestic demand through lower
borrowing costs, the competitive gain from the devaluation would quickly be
lost in high inflation.
But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to judge that even with a
lower pound there is scope for a cut of between  1/2 a percentage point and
1 percentage point in base rates over the next few weeks.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Arts: Medea - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What with Hecuba at the Gate, The Thebans at the Barbican and now Medea at
the Almeida, London has begun to sprout a Greek festival. Unless there is to
be a touch of Aristophanes to lighten it up, perhaps the time has come to
say that enough is enough. Medea, in particular, is heavy going. The Almeida
production repeatedly brings to mind the remark by the philosopher
Wittgenstein: 'Of one thing I am certain. We are not here in order to have a
good time.'
I should also admit to a growing prejudice. After exposure to The Thebans
last week (a production with many virtues) I find it increasingly difficult
to take seriously people who, however otherwise intelligent, persisted in
believing in the oracle at Delphi, the Furies and the inevitability of doom.
Medea is Euripides' first surviving tragedy. The story is gruesome
throughout. It was Medea who, with her magic arts, enabled Jason to pick up
the golden fleece from Colchis and returned with him to Greece. She married
him; they had children. The play begins when he is preparing to ditch her in
order to marry into the ruling family. Medea has the future wife murdered,
then kills her own children. That is about it.
The piece has some pathos. Medea is an immigrant in a foreign land who
perhaps does not fully appreciate the benefits that Greek civilisation is
supposed to bestow. She is a strong character and does not take kindly to
Jason's proposal to move up in the social hierarchy.
The underlying theme of the Almeida production, and presumably the reason
why it has been put on, is that there have always been Jasons: women should
stand up to them. As Medea puts is in a new translation by Alistair Elliot:
'It's natural for a woman to be angry with a husband embarking on a second
marriage.'
Medea is played by Diana Rigg, a fine actress, full of passion, intelligence
and looks that kill. But one wonders if she sat in the audience and watched
this production whether it would occur to her how relentlessly, hellenically
monotonous it is.
There are one or two redeeming features. The chorus, played by three women
in a mixture of speech and song, is much more effective than the far bigger
chorus in The Thebans. The music by Jonathan Dove is very good. There is an
excellent performance by Dan Mullane as the messenger who describes the
horrors of the murder perpetrated by Medea on her rival.
Tim Woodward has an embarrassing time as Jason, since the production is
rigged against him and - to be fair to the women's movement - he has no
plausible excuses for his action. Direction is by Jonathan Kent.
Almeida Theatre until October 24 (071) 359 4404

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (5): More emphasis on
market forces - A look at the results of economic reform in Latin American
countries / The March of Western values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE disintegration of the Soviet bloc has brought predictable claims of a
victory for the western style of democratic government and economic
management. But even before the discrediting of communism transformed the
map of the world, shifts towards more democratic systems of government and
more market-friendly economic systems were already under way in many
developing countries.
For pragmatic rather than ideological reasons, many governments had already
come to the conclusion that in a capital-scarce world, the market should
have a more important role in allocating resources than they had conceded
hitherto. There have been two main aspects to this change: the first has
involved attaining equilibrium in government finances; the second a series
of reforms to the structure of economies to make them more responsive to
market forces.
In Latin America, for example, the onset of the debt crisis 10 years ago
laid bare the economic mismanagement of military governments across the
region and paved the way for their replacement by elected successors. But,
also as a result of the crisis, governments found it impossible to raise
capital. Because their ability to sell debt was severely limited, any
attempt to stimulate the economy directly by increasing government spending
in excess of revenues has had one result: inflation. Thus reforms were
considered necessary to redirect the role of government, raising revenues by
restructuring tax systems and cutting expenditures by slimming down bloated
bureaucracies and privatising state industries.
Privatisation has had an important role in structural reform, too, as part
of a set of changes to allow for greater play of market forces. It has been
accompanied by a removal of quotas, tariffs and other obstacles to foreign
trade and reforms to improve the attraction of investment, domestic and
foreign.
Yet there is no doubt that governments have been reinforced in their
decision to throw out the state-dominated, inward-looking model of economic
development by the changes in eastern Europe. Graphic television pictures of
life in the former socialist countries have changed the point of view of
many voters. 'We used to think there were two ways we could develop our
economy. Now we realise that in the east, they live as badly as we do,' said
Mr Jaime Duran, a political analyst in Ecuador, where a government pledging
economic reforms has just assumed power.
This 'unipolar' world has exciting potential, particularly in the prospects
offered of a reduction in defence expenditures in developed and developing
countries. It has also meant in theory that governments in industrialised
countries can alter the basis of their relations with developing countries;
that aid can be used to bolster democracy and weaken tyranny, instead of
shoring up corrupt regimes whose only claim for support was opposition to
Moscow.
However, there is also disquiet in the developing world. Donor governments
have felt less reticent about imposing new, less ostensibly economic,
conditions on aid. The freedom of the US and its allies to intervene in
areas of the world in pursuit of domestic policy aims - such as combating
drug traffickers or securing oil supplies - is much enlarged.
Furthermore, without strong ideological competition, there is the danger of
drift in international policy-making, of purposelessness and petty squabbles
among the rich countries, epitomised by the inability to reach a conclusion
to the Uruguay round of free trade talks. Many policy-makers in developing
countries are thus worried that their unilateral decisions to open their
economies to the outside world will be greeted by growing protectionism in
the industrialised world.
Internally, economic reform has been no panacea for governments. While in
some countries - such as Mexico and Argentina - it has so far proved popular
and helped incumbent governments, in others, there has been a tension
between economic reform and the survival of democracy. In Venezuela, for
example, the government's reform programme, in spite of its relatively
modest scale, has been the focus of public demonstrations since a failed
army coup attempt last February. In Peru - a lesson for those who believe
left-wing revolutionaries have lost their potential to influence events - a
group of brutal Maoists threaten the state. Indeed, the most successful
economic reform movements in Latin America - Chile's of the 1980s and
Mexico's - have been pushed forward by two of the continent's least
democratic regimes.
Even in countries where reform has so far proved successful, there are
risks. Argentina's future development, for example, depends crucially on
stimulating its low levels of investment. And if the investment arrives in
Argentina, it is unlikely to arrive in all the countries that are
simultaneously opening their economies in the hope of stimulating
investment.
Amid such competition, aid practitioners are despondent about the ability of
much of Africa to attract meaningful amounts of private capital. Without
that, and with increased competition for western aid from eastern Europe,
the prospects for much of that continent appear dim. Furthermore, even if it
arrives, foreign investment may be perceived as exploitative, providing
potential problems for incumbent governments.
There are other areas where the market does not provide a complete answer or
where government will continue to have to play a significant role. In most
developing countries, raising capital for large project investments or for
small businesses is problematic, and in most there is a pressing need for
infrastructure investments. There is also a requirement for government
investment in sectors such as education: low wages are no longer, if they
ever were, a sufficient incentive for foreign investment, and an educated
workforce is an important draw for potential investors. As a decade of
austerity, the 1980s saw mounting social pressures in many developing
economies.
Another important development is the emergence of another value system which
has met with unmatched success over the past 20 years: that of Asia. While
the models offered by Japan and its Asian neighbours differ in detail, they
all place government at the centre of the development process. Japan is
growing in importance as a giver of aid and a provider of finance to the
multilateral institutions; Korea and Taiwan, once recipients of aid, are
themselves becoming donors. Meanwhile, the relative weight of the US economy
and the importance of the US as an aid donor continues to decline.
The disintegration of the Soviet bloc may in some countries be accompanied
by the simultaneous strengthening of democracy and the market economy. In
others, there will be tension or conflict between the two. In any event, the
hypothesis that the world is on the verge of an uncontested victory for
'western' values must be considered distinctly far-fetched.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
for any normal human being would by now have consigned the Uruguay Round of
talks on world trade liberalisation to the realms of failed diplomacy, and
would be battening down for trade war.
There is much to be pessimistic about. Failure would put at risk
international trade growth, estimated by economic modellers to be in the
region of Dollars 195bn a year by the end of the decade. The danger of
failure is now grave.
As negotiations towards the ambitious Uruguay Round trade deal drag through
their sixth year:
Deadlines so often set and missed can no longer be moved. The most critical
is the expiry in March next year of the US fast-track arrangements, which
prevent the US Congress from unstitching the agreement, instead forcing it
to either accept it or reject it in full.
Even if EC and US leaders can put aside their differences and reach
agreement before the end of the year, negotiations over trade in services,
and on market access, need months of attention. Fierce disputes over
shipping, financial services, and even ostensibly small matters such as
trade in bananas, lie in wait.
The creation of the single European market from January 1993, and agreement
on the North American Free Trade Agreement, signal an emerging preference
for regional and bilateral trading arrangements which could easily harden
into trade blocks. Exporters, particularly in Asia, fear that this will
foster protectionism and undermine the multilateral rules that provide order
in world trade.
Trade disputes are mounting relentlessly. Many have been held in suspense in
recent years, as negotiators have hoped a Uruguay Round settlement would
provide new rules to resolve them. Most imminent is a dispute between the US
and the EC over the EC's oilseeds subsidy programme, and over a boost for
subsidised US wheat exports, which could spill over at any time into trade
war. Queueing behind this dispute are simmering conflicts that include coal,
steel-dumping and public-procurement policies.
For the past 21 months, progress in the Uruguay Round has been stalled by a
clash between the EC and the US over liberalisation of farm trade. The nub
has been Europe's profligate farm subsidy regime, which has for many years
wreaked havoc in the world food trade. Painstaking negotiation has brought
the US and the EC to within inches of a conclusion - so close that most
observers are baffled that agreement remains so elusive.
Foremost among the dogged optimists who remain convinced that a Uruguay
Round deal will eventually be agreed is Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which polices world
trade, since 1980: 'I still have great confidence in the sagesse des
nations. What we are doing is like climbing the last few metres of Everest
without oxygen: we have to train a lot to be able to do it, and the last 200
to 300 metres are tremendously difficult.'
He remains confident that success will eventually come, because publication
in December last year of the 'final act' - a draft Uruguay Round text - took
talks 'beyond the point of no return', and because it provided negotiators
for the first time with a concrete picture of what stood to be gained: 'The
round has had more results than we think,' he says.
Furthermore, failure of negotiations would leave unresolved the problems
that forced trading countries to the negotiating table in the first place.
As a result, Mr Dunkel believes that a breakdown of the round could not be
sustained for long: 'If we came to the tragic situation of missing the
fantastic opportunities the round is offering, I will think it was an
accident.'
He recalls that throughout the turbulent and often hostile talks since 1982,
when a new trade round was first proposed, a large number of governments
have reformed their policies very much in line with the multilateral
objectives of Gatt.
The Gatt is being used more extensively than ever before, he notes. It is
seeing unprecedented activity in handling disputes, examining regional trade
agreements, reviewing countries' trade policies, not to mention dealing with
a long queue of applications for accession and observer status - including
Taiwan, China and a number of east European countries and former Soviet
republics. It is closer than at any time in its history to having a
membership that embraces the entire world.
He believes that the Uruguay Round has been so difficult because it is
'completely different' from previous rounds. Its dauntingly wide-ranging
agenda, covering everything from textiles to telecommunications, touches
upon areas that governments have always regarded as their autonomous
preserve - such as domestic farm subsidies or rules on services and
intellectual property.
There remains perhaps one window of opportunity through which the light of
Mr Dunkel's optimism can shine: that between yesterday's French referendum
on the Maastricht treaty, and the US presidential elections on November 4.
Hope rests on statements made by leaders of the Group of Seven industrial
nations, who met in Munich in July. At the end of the meeting, Germany's
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is widely believed to hold the key to a
breakthrough on farm trade, concluded: 'I'm not only optimistic, I will go
further. I expect that we will at last have reached (a breakthrough) by the
end of this year.'
The French referendum was critical because EC partners were unwilling to
endanger the unpopular President Mitterrand's prospects of a positive
referendum vote by further enraging French farmers with a Uruguay Round
settlement that involves cuts in farm subsidies and volume cuts in food
exports. France is Europe's leading farm exporter, so its farmers have most
to lose from new concessions. With the referendum over, French opposition
can be overridden.
The US elections provide a deadline because it is doubtful whether any deal
could be negotiated in the limited time between November 4 and the expiry of
fast-track authority.
Even assuming President Bush is re-elected, upheaval in the administration
is inevitable. It is unlikely to be 'business as usual' until January.
One can only hope that Mrs Carla Hills, the chief US trade negotiator, can
stick to her guns when she says: 'This is the final - I repeat - the final
week of the Uruguay Round. There will be no extension. The time for rhetoric
has passed. Now is the time for straight talk and bottom lines.' Unhappily,
she made that promise on December 3 1990.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (6): Doleful statistics -
Unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOW OR NO economic growth spells rising unemployment in almost all
developed countries this year. But high unemployment is nothing new. The
latest recruits to the unemployed will add to the seemingly permanent pool
of long-term joblessness that has scarred the US and European economies for
a decade or more.
Almost 30m people of working age will be both out of work and looking for
employment this year, according to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development. The average unemployment rate among the OECD's
24 member countries is expected to be 7.5 per cent, up from 6.2 per cent in
1990.
Yet these unemployment rates only tell part of the story, as the OECD
acknowledged in its latest Employment Outlook. Unemployment rates only
include people who are available and looking for work. They exclude the
'economically inactive': people who have no jobs but have given up searching
for one.
The charts show the international pattern of non-employment rates in the
1980s: the sum of the unemployed and the economically inactive as a
percentage of the total population. They cover men only, as males constitute
the bulk of the unemployed; and they include people of prime working age, to
exclude the impact on inactivity rates of higher educational participation
among young people and early retirement among older men.
Two patterns emerge:
Non-employment rates are much more constant across countries than
unemployment rates. The US, Canada and Australia have non-employment rates
similar to those in Europe. Only Japan and Sweden have low non-employment
rates by OECD standards.
Non-employment rose during the 1980s in almost every OECD country. In
continental Europe, this rise was largely reflected in the unemployment
statistics. Elsewhere - the UK, Australia, Canada and Sweden - the rise in
activity was at least as important as the rise in unemployment. The US is
the exception: its non-employment rate fell slightly, after rising in the
1970s. But it was the standard around which the rest of the OECD converged.
Little wonder the OECD has become increasingly worried about the impact of
high unemployment on economic efficiency and social stability. 'High
unemployment entails economic waste and widespread individual hardship,' it
said.
But the costs are more than economic. Internal OECD briefing papers write of
the links between joblessness and economic deprivation: drug use and abuse,
racial tensions and a rising tide of crime and violence. 'The accompanying
process of economic and social exclusion can endanger social cohesion,' the
OECD says.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Thin reprieve gives Twelve the
chance to take a deep breath - The Yes vote does not mean treaty can be
implemented in its present form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Yes vote in yesterday's French referendum is an almost unbelievably thin
reprieve for the 40-year-old enterprise of European integration.
For many years, public opinion polls in France have shown steady majority
votes of 60 per cent or more in favour of Europe. On this occasion the
French administration campaigned strongly in favour of Maastricht,
eventually with the support of the national leaders of all the mainstream
parties of government.
If a 50.7 per cent majority was the best they could muster between them, the
government (and the opposition, for that matter) are clearly under notice
that the Maastricht Treaty does not command the kind of popular support
which would be required to implement it.
In reality, there was almost no chance, even before yesterday's vote, that
the treaty could be implemented in its present form. The Danish people have
rejected it, and they cannot vote again unless the government can claim that
the situation has somehow changed.
There has been loose talk of some kind of declaration or protocol which
would reinforce the restraints on gratuitous meddling by Brussels in
national affairs. But even if this is what would be required to bring the
Danes back into the fold, it must mean a change in the Treaty, which would
open the door wide to a re-negotiation.
Secondly, the uncertain prospects of British ratification of the treaty must
have been further reduced by last week's collapse in the government's
strategy for sterling. Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party will be even
less amenable to Maastricht rhetoric.
Correspondingly, Mr Major's authority for imposing party discipline in
favour of a monetary system which even he does not wish to rejoin soon,
would seem small.
The Yes vote in France does not mean there is after all a chance for the
Maastricht Treaty to be implemented in its present form; but it does mean
the 12 governments can take a deep breath and decide where they go from
here.
First, they have to decide whether to try to rescue the specific objectives
of the treaty by replacing it by another treaty or (more likely) several
treaties; or whether to pause until circumstances are more auspicious.
The most specific questions they have to consider are whether the cause of
economic and monetary union is really being advanced by current conditions
of recession, economic divergence, and monetary turbulence; and whether a
programme which requires the political leadership of Bonn to override the
narrow monetarism of the Bundesbank is really plausible when the economic
credibility of Bonn is so clearly at a discount.
But the most general question is more fundamental: :are the 12 really
committed to a programme of integration based on common interests; or was
last week's fiasco in the currency markets a stark indication that we are
seeing the re-emergence of conflicts of interests, between the internal
German problems associated with unification, and those of the rest of the
Community?
It is too soon to give any general and durable answer to that question. Last
week's temper tantrums by British ministers and officials showed that the UK
government has no confidence that Germany is putting common interests first.
But perhaps they should reflect that French ministers and officials, too,
have repeatedly (if more temperately) revealed irritation with the high
level of German interest rates.
The difference is that the French economy is in much better shape to ride,
at least for a time, the consequences of the egotism of German economic and
monetary policy.
Here we have the bottom line. If the German government is still committed to
the idea of economic and monetary union, eventually, the French are probably
in a position to stay for the ride on the roller-coaster. But the British
are not.
If the French had voted No, we might have had a 12-speed Europe, or even a
No-speed Europe. What the Yes vote does is to preserve the option of a
two-speed Europe. In that sense, the dilemma for Mr Major is acute and
painful. He wanted to put Britain at the heart of Europe; but last December
he demanded the right to choose the slow speed in a two-speed Europe. His
wish has been granted.
As Oscar Wilde said: 'There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get
your heart's desire. The other is to get it.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Currencies to remain under
strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Exchange Rate Mechanism should now live at least another week,
if in a slimmer and weaker form. But the severe monetary strains within
Europe, which the French referendum campaign has highlighted, will not go
away and may intensify over the coming weeks and months.
Europe's finance ministers may have breathed a sigh of relief as early
reports suggested a narrow vote in favour of the treaty. The initial
reaction in the currency markets was muted, following the first exit poll,
suggesting that traders did not intend to test the resolve of the French
government to hold its parity with the D-Mark, at least for now. A No vote
would mean even greater turmoil during the course of today.
Two conclusions can be already be drawn from the events of the past week:
the era of the hard ERM involving almost all of Europe's currencies is over;
and a two-speed monetary regime is likely to persist for some months.
Two devaluations and two departures from the system over the past week have
broken the realignment taboo which has reigned since Italy realigned in
January of 1990. The events of the last week have demonstrated that when the
markets want a a weak currency to devalue there is little that the national
monetary authorities can do except acquiesce.
So it is far too early to tell whether or not there will be more
realignments within the ERM over the next few weeks. The peseta and the
Irish punt, along with the franc, remained near the bottom of their trading
bands at the end of last week.
Dealers may yet decide that Spain, like Italy and the UK last week, will not
be able to sustain its current high interest rate policy without a much
larger devaluation.
Both Italy and the UK appear to have decided they are better off outside the
ERM, at least for the time being, after the bruising and expensive events of
the last week. Both countries made it clear over the weekend that they would
not re-enter the system until German interest rates have fallen further.
But the great uncertainty is whether the ERM can survive at all as anything
more than a northern European greater D-Mark zone.
What matters most is the stability of the link between the franc and the
D-Mark. A No vote would almost certainly have meant a run on the franc and
probably a French devaluation or even withdrawal from the system. An
emphatic Yes vote might have meant a more rapid move to north European
monetary union.
But last night's marginal result resolves nothing. The closeness of the
French vote, and the uncertainty over whether the Maastricht ratification
process can be completed, make it doubtful whether the ERM will now evolve
into monetary union, at least for the foreseeable future.
Will the French elite be able, and the public willing, to tolerate more of
the same policy of high interest rates, high unemployment and slow growth
now that the goal of monetary union appears to have gone?
And would the increasingly friendless, but now more powerful, Bundesbank be
willing to support the franc if it does now come under pressure within the
ERM, something it was not willing to do for the lira or sterling last week?

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Europe's future still clouded

<TEXT>
THE French endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty does not lift the cloud of
uncertainty over the future of the European Community; nor does it mean that
the path toward political and monetary union set out in the treaty will be
made easier.
But the prospect of a political crisis in France, which might have spread to
other European capitals, has been averted.
The French result does not resolve the many questions about Maastricht and
the concept of European Union which the 12 Member states signed up to in
December 1991. The narrowness of the verdict in France, the driving force
behind European integration since the 1957 Treaty of Rome, is certain to
encourage doubters elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Britain.
Indeed, last week's turmoil in the financial markets, which led to Britain
and Italy withdrawing from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, leaves the goal of
monetary union for the Twelve by the end of the century a remote goal
indeed.
The financial markets imposed this reality last week; France's lukewarm
support for Maastricht will not remove the doubts about the economic
feasibility of the enterprise, nor the impression of a 'two-speed Europe'
with the stronger currencies gathering inside a D-Mark bloc.
The French vote will encourage the French and German governments, along with
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, to press ahead as fast
as possible with ratification of the treaty elsewhere in Europe.
The drive for solidarity may be politically understandable; but it puts
Britain and Denmark - the two countries harbouring the most doubts about
Maastricht's merits - directly in the firing line.
The French vote poses numerous problems for Britain, which holds the
rotating six month-long presidency of the EC. French rejection would have
allowed Mr John Major, UK prime mInister, to call for European co-operation,
but in a looser, less centralised form than in the Maastricht Treaty.
Now Maastricht limps on, and a weakened Mr Major must decide whether to
hobble along too. He must not only deal with the Euro-sceptics in his own
Conservative party, he must also reckon with pressure from Paris and Bonn to
put the Maastricht bill before parliament as soon as possible in the
interest of the whole Community.
The Danes are taking their time, knowing that they need several months or
longer to prepare Danish public opinion for a a second referendum. A senior
EC official said last week that too much pressure on the Danish people could
backfire.
Last night, EC officials expressed confidence that the French vote, however
narrow, would restore a measure of confidence that the EC could manage its
own affairs and that it had a clear vision of its future. Thus, the 12 could
focus on the business at hand: the completion of the Single Market, the
Delors II package for funnelling new funds to the poorer southern states
such as Spain and Portugal; and, more tentatively, the aim of enlarging the
Community.
Last night, the mood in Brussels was relief mixed with contrition.
As Mr Karel van Miert, the Belgian commissioner responsible for the
environment, acknowledged that it is important for the European Community to
win back public opinion, to remove the feeling that Brussels is run by a
technocratic elite out of touch with ordinary people in Europe.
The implication is that Brussels has learnt its lessons from the Danish and
French referendums and is ready, in some as yet unspecified way, to make
amends.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Dilemma for Major as UK doubts
grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS good for Europe and good for Britain. But that is not to say it is
good for the government.
That judgment, offered by a British minister last night on the Yes vote in
France for the Maastricht treaty, encapsulates the dilemma now facing Mr
John Major.
When the British prime minister was asked in the wake of last week's
sterling crisis whether he still hoped that the French would endorse the
treaty, he replied in the affirmative. But there was no enthusiasm in his
voice. It was the same last night as he offered his congratulations to
President Francois Mitterrand.
It is not hard to explain the ambivalence.
There is much in the treaty that Mr Major wants to preserve. He sees the
inter-governmental dimension which it adds to the Treaty of Rome and the
Single European Act as the route to Europe's future - and to Britain's
participation in that future.
There was serious concern in Whitehall that a No vote would have been
followed immediately by a new Franco-German initiative to secure European
Union for an inner core of EC nations - underlining Britain's retreat to the
fringe, after last's week enforced withdrawal of sterling from the ERM.
But Mr Major must also look to domestic politics, where Maastricht threatens
to re-open the wounds which led his party into civil war only two years ago
and prompted it to ditch Baroness Thatcher.
Pressing ahead with ratification will greatly compound the political
difficulties triggered by sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM.
After the debacle on the currency markets, the Tory Euro-sceptics have
gained new confidence - and many new recruits among the previously
uncommitted. They are promising a bloody campaign against any move to return
sterling to the ERM and against Maastricht ratification.
Mr Major, who has spent the past two years rebuilding a pro-European
coalition in his party, is seriously weakened. His demeanour over the past
few days points also to disillusionment.
Cabinet colleagues believe that will be a temporary phenomenon: when Mr
Major considers coolly the options, he will conclude as he did two years ago
that there is no place for Britain on the periphery of Europe. It may take
time.
The official message from Whitehall last night was that in its capacity as
president of the Community, Britain would now press ahead with the task of
securing ratification by the Twelve. But no one should expect too much too
quickly.
The narrowness of the French vote and evidence across the Community that its
citizens are restless with the pace of integration are seen in London as
demanding a thorough re-assessment by its leaders of the Community's
ambitions.
The expectation is that the emergency summit of EC leaders early next month
will consider how the voters of Europe can be reassured that Maastricht does
not represent the increased centralisation of power in Brussels.
The British Foreign Office has been working on plans to give substance to
the idea of 'subsidiarity', or decentralisation, enshrined only in outline
in the treaty.
The summit needs also to co-ordinate a response to Denmark's assessment of
the clarifications and changes it would need to persuade its electorate to
reverse the rejection of the treaty in a June referendum. The aim is to
secure a framework agreement with Copenhagen at the Edinburgh summit in
December.
More controversially, Mr Major wants the leaders to undertake a detailed
examination of the ERM - and in particular of the 'asymmetry' which loads
the burden of responsibility for defending existing parities on the
governments and central banks of weak currencies.
Those with longer memories in Whitehall have few illusions that the
Bundesbank - which Mr Major blames for sterling's collapse - would be
willing to compromise its independence. It has rejected too often demands
from France and Italy that in times of crisis it must share the cost of
intervention and demonstrate willingness to cut its interest rates.
But Mr Major's domestic politics demand that he uses the presidency to put
the issue at the top of the EC agenda.
As for ratification of the treaty, the best that the rest of Europe can hope
from its presidency is that the House of Commons will be asked again to vote
in principle on the issue later in the autumn.
Detailed consideration of the legislation will have to wait until next year.
Mr Major's oft-repeated aspiration to keep Britain at the heart of Europe
remains on hold.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Winners and losers in the
French campaigns

<TEXT>
THE biggest gamble of President Francois Mitterrand's career looked set to
succeed by a small margin last night, but it has been a costly victory on
both the European and domestic scene.
As expected, the initial returns indicated the French electorate had
approved the Maastricht treaty on European monetary and political union by a
whisker, with a 51-51.5 per cent majority in favour of the treaty on an
unusually high 70 per cent turn-out, according to exit polls.
The French electorate flirted with the unthinkable, and it was only after
intense campaigning from national political leaders of all parties and
several European heads of government that they shrank back from the brink at
the last minute and voted for the treaty.
Yet the project has already been battered, as has the reputation of many of
those who sought to save it. Maastricht had already suffered perhaps
irreversible damage from last week's currency crisis. Now it has received
only grudging approval from one of Europe's two main pillars.
A Yes under these circumstances can hardly be read as a boon to European
integration. On the contrary, it confirms that the pace of European
construction will now go ahead more slowly and cautiously.
Last night's result could also introduce a chill into France's relations
with Germany, whose leaders have had to swallow their irritation in recent
weeks as both Yes and No campaigners have played on fears of German
domination to bolster their cases. The Franco-German alliance is intact, but
weakened by the doubts exposed during campaign.
The other important lesson driven home by yesterday's referendum is that the
French political establishment is out of touch with a large part of the
electorate. Sensitive to this, the current Socialist government has already
promised that European matters will be debated more thoroughly in the
National Assembly.
When Mr Mitterrand called a referendum in early June, he knew he would spark
off an intense debate. Indeed, he claims to have welcomed the opportunity
for the French to have its first in-depth debate on Europe for four decades.
Yet the government gave the impression, by starting off its campaign on an
easy-going, if not complacent, footing, of having no idea of the sheer
strength of the opposition to Maastricht. The other Yes campaigners, the
RPR, the centre-right UDF and the Generation Ecologie, also had to work far
harder than they imaged to get the Yes vote into the bag.
But the strength of opposition to Maastricht was not the only surprise to
come from the French campaign. It also unearthed general anxiety about the
costs and obligations of European Community members, from agricultural
policy reform to industrial competition, plus widespread provincial
resentment of the Parisian governing class.
So where do the main players stand in the wake of last night's marginal Yes
vote?
Mr Mitterrand can claim that his authority is just about intact, even if his
illness casts uncertainty over how long he will be able to stay.
Former president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, president of the UDF, one of
the two main opposition rivals to succeed Mr Mitterrand, has emerged
strengthened from his part in the Yes campaign.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing's main opposition rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, president
of the Gaullist RPR, has been weakened by supporting Maastricht when most of
his party oppose the treaty. Yet the campaign has also showed that the RPR
has no other leader capable of handling - even if not reconciling - its
internal splits.
The leading anti-Maastricht RPR rebels, Mr Philippe Seguin and Mr Charles
Pasqua, both ended their campaigns admitting that Mr Chirac was the RPR's
best potential presidential candidate.
The outcome of all this is that the two right-wing parties, which have
agreed to choose a single presidential candidate, are now very likely to
field a pro-Maastricht leader - either Mr Giscard d'Estaing or Mr Chirac -
for the next presidential campaign.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: British Euro-sceptics claim a
moral victory - Growing hostility to the treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S so-called Euro-sceptics last night brushed aside Paris's
projections of a narrow Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht,
insisting that the closeness of the outcome vindicated their view that the
treaty was no longer viable.
A leading parliamentary campaigner against the treaty, Mr Michael Spicer,
said last night: 'This remarkable result shows that the French have great
concern about this. However, we in Britain have got our own choice to make.'
Other Tory opponents of the treaty pointed out that the French vote did
nothing to reverse the Danish rejection of the accord. Denmark would not be
'bullied' into a re-run simply because pro-marketeers did not like the
original result, they said.
The swift reaction of the Euro-sceptics to the referendum result came as
their campaign to pressure Prime Minister John Major to adopt a more
combative stance on European issues was given a substantial fillip by two
polls showing a marked shift against the Maastricht Treaty. Their findings
will fuel pressure on the government to grant a British referendum on the
accord - a move Mr Major's administration and the opposition Labour party
have repeatedly rejected.
As polling began in France, a survey in the Independent on Sunday newspaper
showed a similar plebiscite in the UK would deliver a 47 per cent No vote,
with 24 per cent saying Yes and 29 per cent undecided.
Before last week's sterling crisis, opinion polls had shown narrow
majorities in favour of the treaty. Opposition is now shown to be strongest
among Conservative voters, though the NOP poll and soundings taken by Mori
for the Sunday Times indicate that majorities do not believe that Mr Major
or Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, should resign as a
result of the exchange rate debacle.
Conservative MPs in London have been absorbing the details of the polls and
the impact of a blunt speech by the former prime minister, Baroness
Thatcher, in the US capital on Saturday.
Welcoming Britain's withdrawal from the ERM, she urged Mr Major to press
ahead with interest rate cuts and to drop his commitment to an eventual
return to the ERM.
Pressing home her implicit criticism of the government's policy of seeking
to be 'at the heart of Europe', she argued there would be 'chaos and
resentment' if the government continued to pursue the goals of the
Maastricht Treaty.
'It is high time to make as complete a reversal of policy on Maastricht as
has been done on the ERM,' she said. 'If the divergence between European
economies is so great that even the ERM cannot contain them, how would they
react to a single European currency?'
Lord Parkinson, a former Conservative party chairman, yesterday added his
voice to the lobby opposing return to the ERM. Describing the currency
system as 'a dead duck', he conceded the recession had been more prolonged
as a result of interest rates linked to those of the D-Mark.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Euro-sceptics rush to
seize high ground - An increasing number of British MPs are calling for a
more combative stance on Europe

BRITAIN'S so-called Euro-sceptics were last night on the offensive in the
race to fill the policy vacuum left by last week's exchange rate turmoil,
taking their lead from a belligerent Baroness Thatcher.
Their campaign to pressure Prime Minister John Major to adopt a more
combative stance on European issues was given a substantial fillip by two
polls showing a marked shift against the Maastricht treaty.
As the French went to the polls to give their verdict on the treaty, a
survey in the Independent on Sunday newspaper showed a similar plebiscite in
the UK would deliver a 47 per cent No vote and only 24 per cent would say
Yes, with 29 per cent undecided.
Before last week's sterling crisis, opinion polls had shown narrow
majorities in favour of the treaty.
Opposition is now shown to be strongest among Conserva-
tive voters, though the NOP poll and soundings taken by Mori for the Sunday
Times indicate that majorities do not believe that Mr Major or Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, should resign as a result of the
exchange rate debacle.
The tide of public opinion was, nonetheless, clearly in the minds of senior
Tory politicians yesterday as Mr Lamont sought in Washington to cool fears
of a rapid return to the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Conservative MPs in London, meanwhile, were absorbing the details of the
polls and the impact of a blunt speech by the former prime minister in the
US capital on Saturday.
Welcoming Britain's withdrawal from the ERM, Lady Thatcher urged Mr Major to
press ahead with interest rate cuts and to drop his commitment to an
eventual return to the system when conditions allow.
Pressing home her implicit criticism of the government's policy of seeking
to be 'at the heart of Europe', she argued there would be 'chaos and
resentment' if the government continued to pursue the goals of the
Maastricht treaty.
'It is high time to make as complete a reversal of policy on Maastricht as
has been done on the ERM,' she said. 'If the divergence between European
economies is so great that even the ERM cannot contain them, how would they
react to a single European currency?'
Evidence that Lady Thatcher may have struck a chord came in a Mori opinion
poll published in the Sunday Telegraph.
It showed that 74 per cent of those Britons polled are discontent with the
government's handling of the economy, two thirds back cuts in interest rates
and 59 per cent believe the pound should be able to float indefinitely.
Only 19 per cent of the 1,013 adults questioned on Friday and Saturday
supported the government's aim of returning to the ERM.
Last night Mr Lamont was returning to London from the Group of Seven meeting
in Washington two days ahead of schedule to oversee the British response to
the French referendum.
Yesterday, Lord Parkinson, a former Conservative chairman, added his voice
to the growing
lobby opposing a return to the ERM. Describing the currency
system as 'a dead duck', he conceded the recession had been deeper and more
prolonged as a consequence of interest rates linked to those of the D-Mark.
But he added Mr Major and Mr Lamont should not be particularly vulnerable as
the Labour and Liberal Democrat opposition parties had both adopted similar
positions to those of the government.
Sir Teddy Taylor, the virulently anti-Maastricht Conservative MP for
Southend, was more outspoken. He said that after the 'costly and humiliating
shambles' of last week it was absurd for the Tory party to be talking about
returning to the ERM.
Other Conservative Euro-sceptics believe their numbers could be swelled by
at least 100 when parliament returns for an emergency debate on the economy
on Thursday.
Forced on to the defensive, the pro-Maastricht faction in the party - until
last week a majority - has been slow to react to the rapidly unfolding
events.
However, Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast MP, underlined yesterday
that the likely outcome of the break-up of the current ERM would be the
creation of a two-speed Europe, with some countries pressing ahead with
Germany towards a single currency.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Cautious response from Europe
business leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE, TOM BURNS, ANDREW FISHER and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S narrow Yes vote last night drew a cautious and non-committal
response from European business leaders. After the buffetings suffered by
the Maastricht Treaty during the last few months, industrialists believed
the small French margin was unlikely to change the uncertain outlook for
full implementation of the treaty.
Typical of the guarded comments last night was the reaction of Mr Heinz
Schimmelbusch, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, the Frankfurt-based
metals group.
He said: 'I don't know if this will calm down financial markets. I rather
doubt it, as it is too close. If it had been a 56 or 57 per cent vote in
favour, then that would have been a clear vote. I feel that there is a
general lack of certainty which is now a common denominator in industry,' he
added.
'We are in a situation where caution adds to the long lists of negatives in
the international climate. I feel the great variety of regionalists are
rapidly gaining momentum - regionalism is an overwhelming feature of Europe
right now. We are in danger of losing European momentum.'
Mr Peter Davis, chairman of Reed International, the UK's largest publisher,
which has just agreed to merge with Elsevier, the Dutch publisher, said: 'I
think the French vote became irrelevant for us when we pulled out of the
ERM, and my own view is that we should stay out. We now know that when push
comes to shove Germany supports Germany.'
Mr John Robb: chief executive of Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group, said:
'The vote was not something that I was apprehensive about, and the result is
unlikely to have a major effect on our busi ness.'
A more confident tone was struck by Mr Carlos Ferrer Salat, chairman of
Unice, the Confederation of European Employers' Organisations: 'This result
allows us to go forward.
'We, the businessmen of Europe, have always defended the Maastricht
programme. We needed to know where we were going.
'A lot still remains to be done and clearly there are errors in the
Maastricht programme that need to be rectified. But at least we still have
our game plan.'
Mr Oscar Fanjul, chairman of Repsol, Spain's publicly-controlled energy
group, expressed relief at the outcome, in spite of the narrow margin.
Pointing out that Spain would have suffered disproportionately from a French
No, he said: 'This is a good result for an economy like Spain's. It means
that the Madrid government will be able to accelerate convergence with the
stronger European economies.
'A No would have meant a loss of market confidence in Spain. The Bundesbank
is already de facto the European central bank. It must now start to act like
one.'
Mr Ulf Hoegland, Swedish-born chief executive of the Tudor Group, the
Spanish industrial battery producer, which has 15 locations in Europe, was
one of the few industrialists to voice good cheer last night.
'This is going to make my life a lot easier. Let's hope it speeds up the
unification process that Europe needs, and that the Danes will reconsider
their rejection of Maastricht. There is no way of planning a pan-European
business without Maastricht and without a strong unified European
leadership.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Frontier areas back treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRONTIER areas of France voted generally in favour of Maastricht and closer
relations with their EC neighbours, while farmers, particularly the poorer
ones in the south and south-west, took out their frustration with EC policy
by voting solidly No.
Giving some interim results at about 9.30pm local time, Mr Paul Quiles, the
interior minister, admitted that 'rural areas, clearly in the south-west and
less clearly in other regions, had voted against the treaty'.
By contrast, frontier areas, presumably less xenophobic than inland regions,
showed solid support for the European treaty. Predictably, one of the
highest levels of pro-Maastricht support came from Strasbourg, home of the
European parliament, with a 72 per cent Yes vote. In general, Alsace and
Lorraine along the German border, Rhone-Alpes adjacent to Switzerland, and
Pyrenees-Atlantiques bordering Spain showed pro-Maastricht majorities, Mr
Quiles said.
The big surprise was Brittany, remote from any other country except Britain
across the Channel. Far from being a hotbed of anti-European sentiment, as
hoped by Mr Philippe De Villiers, the leading Maastricht opponent from
neighbouring La Vendee, a clear majority of Bretons backed Maastricht. The
Breton cities of Rennes and Quimper recorded majorities of 65-70 per cent
for Maastricht. However, the region of Nord-Pas de Calais, for all its links
with Kent and neighbouring Belgium (or because of such links), voted against
the treaty.
Earlier opinion polls had showed serious gains by the No campaign in the
Paris region. In the event, the region split, with the city of Paris
producing a 61 per cent vote in favour of the treaty, but its suburbs, where
the National Front and the Communists are strong, showed a majority dislike
of Maastricht.
But the further south, the higher the level of general opposition to
Maastricht, culminating in the 58 per cent No majority vote in Corsica. Mrs
Elisabeth Guigou, whose job it was as European affairs minister to lead the
pro-Maastricht campaign, found it impossible to convince her Vaucluse region
of the European treaty's merits.
The unnerving closeness of the referendum verdict was heightened by the fact
that, despite the confident opinion poll predictions of a Maastricht
victory, the first results showed a majority for the No vote. This was
because the first results came in from small towns and rural areas, where
the polling booths closed two hours earlier, at 6pm French time, rather than
in the big cities, where voting continued until 8pm.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMPAGNE had been flowing throughout the early evening at the Paris
headquarters of the anti-Maastricht campaign in expectation of a victory for
the No faction.
But the bubbly fell flat as soon as the first estimates of the referendum
results flashed across the television screens. The supporters of Mr Philippe
Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, the conservative right RPR politicians who had
been spearheading the No campaign, had been toiling throughout the summer in
a desperate attempt to swing French public opinion against the Maastricht
Treaty.
As soon as the result estimates appeared they knew that their hard work had
been worthless. 'No]' cried one. 'I just don't believe it,' said another. A
third man wiped tears from his eyes. 'To think that we came so close.'
Scores of No campaigners were squeezed into the offices of Mr Seguin and Mr
Pasqua on the rue Francois Premier in the glossy eighth arrondissement of
Paris. The offices, which had been hastily converted into the No
headquarters at the start of the referendum campaign in June, were decked
with posters bearing the slogan 'Liberte. Je cheris ton non.'
The narrow street was cluttered with television vans and radio cars. Inside,
the TV crews were reduced to the surreal spectacle of filming TV images of
the referendum results as the snappily suited anti-Maastricht campaigners
and journalists alike waited for statements from Mr Seguin and Mr Pasqua.
A leaden silence fell on the gathering as the results started to come
through. One man stood tugging at his 'Maastricht. C'est non' T-shirt as
though he could not believe what he was hearing. 'All that work for
nothing,' he said.
The mood could scarcely have been more different over the river at the
Socialist party headquarters on the rue Solferino, where the pro-Maastricht
campaigners were gathering to hear the results.
A band played can-can music as a group of festive Yes campaigners did an
impromptu dance for the benefit of the TV cameras.
The cobbled courtyard in the centre of the Socialists' opulent Hotel
Particulier had been turned into a carnival tent for the evening with a
marquee roof decked with the flags of all the European Community member
states.
'It's great,' said one campaigner. 'Absolutely fabulous,' shouted another.
'The results couldn't be better.'
The pro-Maastricht faction had prevailed by an extraordinarily slender
margin but that did not seem to bother the partying Socialists. All that
seemed to matter was that the Yes camp had won - not by how much.
A fresh cheer greeted the announcement of each result from the different
French regions.
'We're going to party all night long,' cried one man in a 'Oui' T-shirt.
'After all, we've won.'

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Delors hails 'strong
foundation' for union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Delors, president of the European Commission, last night welcomed
the French vote as giving a strong foundation to moves towards closer
European monetary and political union.
Speaking in Paris, he said: 'May they (French voters) be thanked for France,
for Europe, for democracy, for progress, for history.'
'The fact that the French have ratified by a direct process gives a stronger
foundation to the legitimate construction of Europe, even though it is
necessary to take account of the fears and anxieties of those who have voted
No,' he said.
Mr Delors, who had threatened to resign if the French had rejected the
treaty, also hit back at accusations of over-centralisation levelled at the
Commission by opponents of the treaty.
He said: 'It is the Council of Ministers and representatives of the 12
governments who must explain Europe in each country.'
Other European leaders reacted with immediate relief to the French approval
of the Maastricht Treaty, echoing Mr Delors' reaffirmation that the project
of a deeper, broader and politically united Europe remained on course.
However, approval of the French referendum result among EC governments was
tinged with concern at the narrowness of the outcome and apprehension about
the prospects for ratification of the treaty elsewhere in the Community,
notably in Britain.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said that despite the narrowness of
the vote, the result was a 'new boost' for Europe and pledged to work on
expanding the EC. 'Along with the deepening of the Community, we want in the
next few years to realise the second great goal of our European policy
quickly: that is the expansion of the future union with the Efta (European
Free Trade Association) states that have applied for membership,' he said.
Mr Kohl said he was sure that Germany would ratify the Maastricht Treaty
before the end of the year.
Other German leaders nevertheless cautioned that the narrow vote gave cause
for reflection. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, while calling
the vote a 'decisive step forward', cautioned that 'we must, however, think
over a few things'.
His warning was echoed by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, who
said that 'a narrow majority is significantly better than a narrow minority,
but added that the margin was 'no cause for triumph'.
Mr Jack Lang, the French education minister who co-ordinated the Socialist
government's Yes campaign, hailed victory minutes after the first computer
projections indicated voters had approved the treaty.
'I am proud that a majority of the French people have chosen Europe. It is a
victory for France, a victory for Europe,' he said.
However, leaders of the No campaign were equally quick to focus on the
narrow margin of the vote. 'It's a pseudo-success, a mediocre Yes,' said Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front.
The European architects of the Maastricht Treaty immediately greeted the
French approval with strong declarations that momentum towards European
unity had been sustained.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, said he 'breathed a sigh of
relief' at the likely Yes result. 'If the French electorate had not voted
Yes, the work of 40 years would probably have been undone, causing
irreparable damage,' he said.
However, Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch deputy foreign minister, described his
reaction as 'sombre'. He told Dutch television that 'the problem is that it
is a very small majority, and does not get us in the clear.'
He said the treaty still faced stern tests in Britain, where it must be
ratified by the House of Commons, and in Denmark, where a referendum has
already rejected the treaty.
Mr Karel van Miert, a member of the European Commission, also sounded a
pessimistic note, saying 'the damage has been done'. He said he was worried
that the Community was 'drifting apart and losing credibility'. He said:
'When things start sliding, it is difficult to stop them.'
Denmark, which voted against the Maastricht Treaty in a referendum in June,
hoped that the Yes vote would help it persuade other EC members countries to
accept its need for special arrangements with the EC, Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said last night.
'We could be very difficult for the other countries, but we have to ask
ourselves whether this would be clever,' he said.
'I think it should now be easier for Denmark to obtain a special arrangement
with the European Community,' he said. 'The European landscape today is
totally different from what it was in early June.'
Speaking in Paris, Mr Delors reasserted his belief that monetary union
should happen as quickly as possible. 'What happened on the exchange markets
a week ago was due to the absence of real and effective consultation between
the major currencies.'
He said the difference between US and German interest rates was also to
blame.
But 'that doesn't mean to say that the European monetary system is useless.
On the contrary. But under those circumstances economies which are not the
healthiest suffer,' he said.

FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: A battle is won, but not yet
the war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By DAVID GARDNER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S narrow endorsement of Maastricht was greeted with almost cathartic
relief in Brussels, and calls for the Community to redouble efforts to
secure economic, monetary and political union. But most officials recognised
that what had been won in France was a battle, not the war.
Quite apart from whether Danish voters can be persuaded to reverse last
June's rejection of Maastricht, concern is growing in Brussels about whether
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, can get the UK parliament to
ratify the treaty, after the government's humiliating defeat on sterling
policy last week.
In a direct reference to Britain, a senior Commission official said 'one
problem we can solve, but not two - especially if it is the UK.'
'The (British) problem was there even before we had the referendum,' said
Belgium's commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert. But asked whether the UK could
be the next weak link in the Maastricht chain, he said: 'I tend to believe
that is the case.'
Mr Van Miert was cautious about the immediate future. 'I think everyone has
a clear impression about how much damage has been done over the last few
weeks,' he said. 'The first task is to stop the drift apart in the Community
from worsening.'
Officials in Brussels expect the meetings today of EC foreign ministers at
the UN in New York, and EC finance ministers attending the International
Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, to extract every bit of momentum they
can from yesterday's vote. Nevertheless, they expected it would require an
emergency summit within the next month to get Maastricht really back on
track.
Officials last night in Brussels took comfort, however, in the renewed
possibilities of a Gatt world trade agreement opened by the French Yes.
They confirmed that the final push to unblock the Uruguay Round trade talks,
hung up on EC-US inability to agree how far to cut farm subsidies, would now
go ahead in an attempt to reach agreement before the US presidential
election on November 3.
The French vote gives us 'new arguments for a compromise', one official
said. France's reluctance to make farm subsidy concessions before the
referendum was what made impossible a settlement at July's summit of the
Group of Seven big industrial nations in Munich.
Despite last week's turmoil in the currency markets, senior officials argued
strongly last night that Mastricht's goal of monetary union remained intact,
thanks to the French vote.
Germany's senior commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, said it is 'quite clear
that only Emu (economic and monetary union) can bring an end to speculation
and that kind of situation in the markets.'
Brushing aside the rancour in the UK over the German Bundesbank's role in
last week's events, Mr Bangemann insisted that Emu promised 'one currency
defended by one central bank in Europe, with one desire to defend stability,
but looking after the European situation and not just one country's'
Nonetheless, his colleague, Mr Van Miert, conceded that political as well as
economic difficulties surrounding Maastricht meant that 'more bilateralism
and more of two speeds' could make it difficult to keep the 12 together.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (1): An interdependent
world pays for past excesses - After several false dawns, there is little
sign of a robust economic recovery, the outlook is for slow growth at best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS not supposed to be like this.
The 1990s dawned amid hopes of a new era of prosperity after the collapse of
communism. The end of superpower rivalry was the icing on the cake of
extended economic growth and rising living standards enjoyed by the western
industrial democracies in the 1980s.
Now, with just a quarter of the decade gone, disappointment abounds.
Global growth has been feeble. World output stagnated last year, according
to the International Monetary Fund. Some countries, notably Britain, have
suffered lengthy recession.
Unemployment in the 24 industrialised nations of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development has jumped from less than 25m two
years ago to about 30m today.
Leadership is in short supply. The three economic powerhouses - the US,
Japan and Germany - have become introspective as they struggle with their
respective problems of lacklustre growth, asset price deflation and the
inflationary strains imposed by German unification.
International economic policy co-ordination - a high priority for
policy-makers in the 1980s - is seriously weakened. Monetary and economic
policies among the Group of Seven leading industrial countries now follow
the 'Sinatra Doctrine' of 'doing it my way'. This principle has undermined
solidarity in the European Monetary System. In an unprecedented setback for
the EMS, Britain and Italy last week floated the pound and lira rather than
suffer the consequences of speculative attacks on their currencies.
There is still something to cheer about outside the charmed circle of the
industrialised democracies. Latin America appears to be getting up off the
canvas after a decade of low growth and falling living standards, triggered
by the Mexican debt crisis of 1982. The dynamic economies of south-east Asia
should also notch up more growth although at a slower pace than in the boom
years of the past decade.
But these few bright spots are eclipsed by problems elsewhere. Eastern
Europe is finding that the struggle to adapt to the market economy is far
more difficult than expected. Worse still is the position in the former
Soviet Union. Russia's economic reform efforts have run into ever greater
problems since the start of the year. The break-up of the single Comecon
trading block has greatly increased the adjustment problems of all the
former communist states. Africa, in the headlines again for starvation in
Somalia and civil strife in South Africa, seems condemned to lag
economically behind the rest of the globe.
Symptoms of tension are legion. Currency markets have succumbed to turmoil,
reflecting divergent economic policies and monetary conditions. Last week,
the EMS suffered the worst crisis of its 13-year history with three member
currencies forced to devalue or float.
Earlier, the dollar was driven down to historic lows against Germany's
currency as fund managers switched billions of dollars of investments into
high-yielding D-Marks.
More than funds are moving around the world, however. The wealthy countries
of northern Europe and north America are proving to be a powerful magnet for
economic immigrants from the world's poorer regions. The vicious rioting
against asylum-seekers in the eastern German city of Rostock in August and
in other cities this month highlighted the social and political dangers
posed by immigration.
Yet, the forums for discussing such north-south issues as migration are
woefully under-developed. The United Nations has its hands full with crises
such as Bosnia and Somalia. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank
are increasingly occupied in mobilising the industrial world's limited
financial support for the former Soviet Union. The OECD has put itself
forward as a clearing house for ideas between its 24 industrialised member
countries and non-member states, but the Paris-based body is underfunded and
taken less than seriously by its members. This year's annual OECD
ministerial meeting was notable for the virtual absence of G7 finance
ministers from the talks.
Suggestions that this year's G7 summit meeting in Munich might be the
prelude to closer north-south relations have been followed by a deafening
silence. The summit turned out to be little more than an expensive photo
call that failed to achieve any progress on the most pressing economic
problem on its agenda, the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks.
A successful conclusion to the talks being held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) could enhance the growth
prospects of industrial and developing countries alike. Freer trade could
help the former Soviet republics and the countries of eastern Europe
overcome their economic crises and help secure democracy in these regions.
After the Munich summit, there was talk of a 'window of opportunity' for
achieving a Gatt round breakthrough between yesterday's French referendum on
the Maastricht treaty and the US presidential election in November. But
nobody is banking on it. In Gatt matters, leaders propose while trade and
agriculture ministers dispose.
The world's present economic tribulations and policy paralysis have their
roots in excesses of the 1980s.
It was a decade in which politicians would hymn the virtues of sustainable
non-inflationary growth while failing to correct errors that would
eventually undermine this goal.
The US, for example, became hooked on debt; first as the expansionary fiscal
policies of the Reagan years spawned huge budget deficits and later as the
private sector caught the disease, with banks only too happy to provide
funds for leveraged buy-outs and property speculation on a grand scale.
In Britain, financial deregulation and insufficient official concern about
sharply higher bank lending and house prices resulted in a credit-fuelled
inflationary boom.
Japan experienced a stock market and property bubble created by a sustained
period of low interest rates that was intended to support the dollar and
hold down the value of the yen. Germany's problems came at the end of the
decade when unification triggered economic overheating, inflation and a huge
jump in government deficits.
Tight monetary policies were deployed to curb such excesses and they
continue to take their toll.
In the US, companies and consumers continue to pay down their debts in spite
of an aggressive easing of policy that brought the official discount rate
down to 3 per cent in August - its lowest level since 1963. Recovery in the
US therefore remains anaemic. Financial markets are correspondingly jittery
ahead of the November presidential election.
Japan's 'bubble economy' has been followed by an equally spectacular asset
price deflation that has hit consumer spending and the country's banks.
Although the government's Y10,700bn emergency economic package, introduced
at the end of August, triggered an immediate recovery of Tokyo stock market
values, its full effects will not be known for several months.
In Europe, the problems of German unification have increasingly transmitted
slow growth to other members of the EMS through the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The D-Mark's position as the dominant currency in the ERM, which has been
spectacularly confirmed in the recent market turmoil, has ensured that other
EMS countries have been unable to escape the impact of the high interest
rates used by the Bundesbank to counteract inflation and excessive monetary
growth.
Although the Bundesbank cut its internationally important Lombard rate by a
quarter of a point to 9.5 per cent last week, the floor that it sets for
interest rates among ERM participants is still a brake on growth in
countries such as France or Denmark.
There are, to be sure, some positive signs in the world economy.
Inflationary pressures have eased in virtually all industrialised countries.
In Germany, signs of economic slowdown and the Bundesbank's cautious
monetary easing hold out hope of reduced inflationary pressures and a
further reduction of interest rates.
But after several false dawns, there is little sign of a robust economic
recovery: the outlook is for slow growth at best. One result will be reduced
economic opportunities for the developing countries and the ex-Communist
states of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union which have invested
high expectations in western economic leadership and values.
G7 policy co-ordination created problems in the 1980s by focusing on
currency stabilisation while allowing inflationary excesses to build up. But
the subsequent divergence of policies and performance between Germany and
the US and inside the EMS have made for difficulties in an interdependent
world. It remains to be seen whether the past week's EMS changes will be
followed by greater co-operation in international economic policy-making or
continuing monetary turbulence.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (3): At the crossroads of
reform - Assessing the contribution of a radical Russian economist / Profile
of Yegor Gaidar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT FELL to Yegor Gaidar to be the first from the ranks of radical Russian
economists to give flesh to his theories. Before him, there were projects,
conceived by (among others) Nikolai Petrakov, Stanislav Shatalin and Grigory
Yavlinsky: none was carried through.
But the collapse of the Soviet Union gave Mr Gaidar his chance. Given the
portfolios of deputy prime minister, economics minister and finance minister
in November last year, following the collapse of the putsch, Mr Gaidar
assembled a team of his closest associates to fill the key economic posts
within the cabinet.
Mr Gaidar's success since then has been considerable. The price rises of
January 2 have again put goods in once-bare shops, and destroyed the huge
store of unspendable roubles built up in 1990-91. He has brought in sales
and profit taxes to begin a transition to a rational fiscal policy; has got
privatisation under way; has liberated trade and cut away much of the
subsidies from enterprises - especially defence-related enterprises - which
once took up much of the former Soviet budget.
Yet, he now stands at a critical stage. The government he heads (since his
appointment as acting prime minister in July) is now struggling to continue
the momentum of reform against steadily rising opposition. Appointments by
Mr Yeltsin of three new senior ministers have strengthened the hands of
those in the industrial lobby who have pleaded - successfully - for more
credits for industry. The replacement of Mr Georgy Matiukhin as chairman of
the Russian Central Bank by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, formerly of the Soviet
State Bank Gosbank, has brought into that post a man whose first actions
confirm him as no friend to the government's priorities of balanced budgets
and rouble stabilisation.
The largest charge against Mr Gaidar is that of over-ambition: of the laying
out, in the memorandum he agreed with the International Monetary Fund in
February of this year, of a series of targets which he could not keep. The
memorandum's targets - for much lower budget deficits, declining inflation,
a higher exchange rate for the rouble, a break in the circle of wage-price
inflation, conclusion of an agreement between the Russian Bank and the
central banks of the other republics on common clearing mechanisms, the
definition of a 'rouble zone' - have been missed, in some cases badly.
Throughout, the economy of Russia has continued to decline, with sharp falls
in the crucial energy supplies sector.
Because of this, what has been a qualified and partial success seems like
failure. Further, the political forces against him are now becoming very
strong. Once the political season resumes Mr Gaidar and his band of
ministers and advisers will face a renewed onslaught: at some point, perhaps
soon, they may have to decide whether to continue to compromise - or to
resign.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (2): A middle-class gap -
The former Soviet empire has inherited an outmoded feudal system which is
proving a difficult starting point for a modern, free-enterprise economy /
The Communist Legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ECONOMIST has described the problem of converting communist societies to
capitalism better than Mr Lech Walesa, the Polish president. 'It is like
trying to make a fish out of fish soup,' he once observed. But that is the
kind of inchoate broth that the peoples of the former Soviet empire
inherited from decades of an all too successful experiment in Stalinist
social engineering.
For most of the 20th Century the Soviet world was sealed off from the rapid
technological change which created unprecedented wealth and transformed the
social and institutional structures of capitalist societies. Instead of an
expanding, self-confident, property-owning middle class, the Soviet model
re-created outmoded feudal relationships.
At the heart of the economic problems confronting the new post-communist
governments is the lack of a middle class and the economic and other
institutions and attitudes connected with it. The all-powerful party state
was served by varying ranks of propertyless state serfs. Instead of a
naturally evolving middle class, the Soviet system left behind the
nomenklatura.
This party-selected, and therefore dependent, elite managed the system and
ran the militarised command economy. In the name of the party its servants
eliminated or subverted pre-existing political, civil, religious and
economic institutions, perverting memory and re-writing history as they did
so.
It is hardly surprising under these unpromising circumstances that the task
of building capitalism is proving more complicated than those who had little
previous awareness of communist regimes thought, especially in the first
flush of enthusiasm which accompanied the collapse of the Berlin Wall and
the disintegration of the Soviet state.
The surprise is the extent of transformation already achieved in central
Europe, where the Soviet system was in place for only 45 years, and the
determination with which market reformers are pressing ahead, in spite of
growing opposition from the old managerial and other elites, in Russia and
other Soviet republics where even the memory of capitalism had been largely
eliminated.
The problems caused by the lack of a middle and entrepreneurial class help
to explain why privatisation is at the heart of macro-economic strategies
throughout the former Soviet empire. The crucial sub-text of this mechanism
to transfer ownership from an amorphous state to private individuals and
companies, or foreign investors, is the consequent creation of an
entrepreneurial and proprietorial class with a stake in stability, and a
willingness to take decisions and bear responsibility.
Given the virtual absence of private capital, and the destruction of savings
through hyper-inflation, the privatisation process has perforce been
unconventional and imaginative. It is not easy to build capitalism without
capital. Hence the introduction of unprecedented coupon mass-privatisation
schemes pioneered by Czechoslovakia and Poland and watched with intense
interest by others, especially Russia and other newly-independent ex-Soviet
republics.
The pacemakers of reform are the central European countries of
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland which were relatively developed
capitalist societies in the inter-war period. They all have association
agreements with the European Community and are striving to fulfil the
requirements for full-fledged EC entry by the turn of the century.
Czechoslovakia was on a par with Germany before the war, while Poland
managed to retain most of its agriculture in private hands and thus kept a
large, albeit disadvantaged, capitalist sector alive throughout the
communist period. Individual Poles also became black market traders on a
large scale and this entrepreneurial talent helped Poland to privatise the
former lumbering state distribution system with extraordinary speed after
the communist regime collapsed.
The most difficult task of re-education is faced by the newly-independent
former Soviet states. They were all part of an authoritarian, centralised
empire before they became involuntary 'builders of socialism' for over seven
decades. Some, like Ukraine or Belarus, are having to build an independent
state for the first time. Others, like Georgia and Armenia, are
resuscitating ancient kingdoms submerged for centuries.
This state-building process is taking place in parallel with the
reconstruction of economic ties on a market-orientated basis. It has to cope
with the distortions left behind by the artificial, politically motivated
integration of the former all-Union economy.
The penchant for building giant plants capable of supplying the entire
Soviet market from one or two factories, and receiving their inputs from
similar plants elsewhere in this far-flung empire, has made all the new
states dangerously vulnerable to supply disruptions.
Throughout this huge area extending over half of Europe and half of Asia
fledgling businessmen and politicians are having to learn basic economic
concepts such as private property, the law of supply and demand, marginal
utility, rent, cost and profit and amortisation. Fundamental capitalist
institutions such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds, building
societies, accountancy firms, advertising and marketing companies existed
only in a primitive form, if at all, and are having to be created from the
ground up.
The unprecedented scale of the task is such that most of the effort and the
resources will have to come from those involved. Capital and know-how
injections are only forthcoming on a large scale in the specific and
untypical German case. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the
specially created European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),
have all made revealing studies and geared up to give modest financial
backing and technical support in key sectors.
But the main objective of the new regimes is to attract foreign equity
investment from companies prepared to inject their managerial skills and
integrate their new subsidiaries into their existing international
operations.
Until now little more than Dollars 5bn of equity capital has been invested
in the entire region since the old system collapsed in 1989, a tiny fraction
of the overall capital flows into south-east Asia or Latin America. But this
is only the beginning of a long process of development which will
fundamentally condition the shape of the 21st Century global economy.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (7): Fiscal rhetoric
versus reality - Why the IMF is chiding the G7 / Public Spending and Debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Communique after communique from the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries has paid lip service to the cause of fiscal consolidation. But it
is naive to read leaders' lips. Action matters far more.
In April, for example, the G7 finance ministers and heads of government,
meeting in Washington, underlined 'the need to reduce fiscal deficits in all
countries with large budgetary imbalances through credible medium-term
consolidation strategies. This is important,' they went on, 'both for
countries with long-lasting fiscal imbalances and for countries experiencing
exceptional adjustment challenges.'
The IMF was more direct. In its World Economic Outlook of May 1992 it
recalled the 'consensus reached among industrial countries at the beginning
of the 1980s that medium-term objectives were best served by adhering to
anti-inflationary monetary policies, by reducing fiscal deficits (preferably
by restrictions on government spending rather than tax increases) and by
eliminating structural rigidities.
'Lack of success in this regard is,' complained the IMF, 'particularly
evident in the US and Italy, which both missed the opportunity to
consolidate their budgetary positions during the long period of sustained
growth in the 1980s. More recently, two countries that were relatively
successful . . . , namely Germany and . . . the UK, have experienced a shift
from fiscal balance (Germany) or budget surplus (the UK) to substantial
actual and projected fiscal imbalances.'
The IMF is entitled to wag its finger. According to OECD estimates, there
has been structural and not merely cyclical deterioration in the general
government budget balances of most OECD countries (see chart). But this
pattern must be set against the rather more favourable trends in public
finance during the 1980s.
First, the growth of public spending was brought under control. Between 1970
and 1980 the share of government outlays in the GDP of the G7 countries rose
from 32.3 per cent to 38.4 per cent. In OECD Europe it rose more sharply,
from 36.6 per cent to 46.0 per cent. These trends could not continue
forever. In the 1980s, they did not. Between 1980 and 1989, the share of
government outlays in GDP remained essentially unchanged in the G7 and rose
only slightly, from 46 per cent to 47.6 per cent, in OECD Europe.
Second, fiscal deficits improved. For the G7 the general government
financial deficit reached a peak of 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1983, falling to
0.9 per cent in 1989, before bouncing back a little, to 1.6 per cent, in
1990. The pattern for the OECD as a whole was similar.
Finally, although fiscal deficits did not shrink fast enough to prevent the
overall burden of net public debt from rising in the 1980s, that increase
was not dramatic. Between 1983 and 1991, the ratio of net public debt to GDP
rose from 28.4 to 32.0 per cent in the G7 and from 35.3 to 41.3 per cent in
Europe. But there were a few dramatic deteriorations: Italy's debt burden
rose from 68.8 per cent of GDP in 1983 to 99.6 per cent in 1991, Canada's
rose from 22.9 to 48.3 per cent and that of the US rose from 24.1 to 36.3
per cent. But Japan and the UK reduced their fiscal debt burdens.
Mixed success in the 1980s, followed by back-sliding during the slow down is
the reality behind the rhetoric of fiscal consolidation. What then are the
prospects for the fairly immediate future?
The US is likely to contribute little to consolidation in the near future,
whoever is elected president. Meanwhile, Japan has just committed itself to
a breath-taking piece of anti-consolidation. The Y10,700bn (Dollars 86m)
fiscal package announced at the end of August is the largest emergency
package in Japanese history, even as a percentage of gross national product.
Meanwhile, Europe remains rhetorically wedded to the orthodoxy of the 1980s.
Thus EC ministers emphasised at their meeting in Bath early this month 'the
importance of early and full implementation of strict convergence
programmes.'
That would mean severe pain in several member states, according to the
OECD's latest Economic Outlook. Implementation of the Maastricht criteria
for fiscal convergence - a 3 per cent target for the overall deficit of
general government and a 60 per cent target for the ratio of public debt to
GDP - could force substantial absolute reductions in public expenditure on
Italy, Belgium and Greece.
A leaked report from the IMF says that the belt-tightening required to meet
the Maastricht criteria would slow growth across the EC by 0.4 to 0.8
percentage points a year between 1993 and 1996. Whether the Maastricht
treaty is ratified or not, fiscal consolidation is likely to be less than
advertised in Europe, at least without a spontaneous recovery in economic
activity.
Fiscal austerity remains the slogan. The reality is, and will remain, rather
different.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (8): Greener glow in
politics - The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro marked the beginning of an
attempt to set global standards / Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSIONS are not auspicious for the environment: greenery becomes a luxury
when times are hard. Nonetheless, the environment has clearly moved up the
political agenda this year in spite of the economic stresses facing the
world.
The main reason is obviously the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June at
which more than 100 heads of state solemnly committed themselves to a wide
range of environmental objectives.
President Mitterrand of France, for example, spoke of the need for a 'new
international order' which would combine disarmament, security, development
and respect for the environment.
Although it is still too early to gauge the full importance of Rio, the fact
that it was held at all and attracted such an impressive attendance ensured
it will have some impact. The question is: how much, and in what form? And
how will environmental considerations be balanced against other factors,
like the need to foster growth?
From the world economic viewpoint, Rio offered three broad themes.
One was the growing north-south divide, and the environmental degradation in
the third world that can be directly attributed to poverty. This, however,
is unlikely to have much immediate impact on policy-making. It was clear in
Rio that the rich industrial nations are heavily preoccupied with their own
problems, and are unwilling to make big financial commitments or trade
concessions to narrow the gap.
The second was growing acceptance of the need to get the world economy on to
a sustainable path, and stop consuming resources at the expense of future
generations.
To be effective, countries would have to start accounting for resources
which they regard as 'free', like air and water, or jacking up the price of
non-renewable resources to levels that make people realise they are being
depleted.
The third was in the area of practical measures to deal with threats to the
environment, in particular plant and animal life, and the climate. Two
treaties were agreed. One is aimed at encouraging reductions in emissions of
harmful gases believed to be causing global warming. But this had to be
watered down, because it was feared tough measures like curbs on oil
consumption or emission controls would smother economic growth. The other is
intended to control commercial exploitation of plant and animal life.
President Bush refused to sign this treaty, because he fears it will
undermine patent rights to medicines and other substances using natural
ingredients.
The third world came away from Rio disappointed. They were looking for more
financial or technological aid to help overcome their environmental
problems, but they left virtually empty-handed and, in many cases, angered
by demands that they stop chopping down their rain forests.
The industrial nations, on the other hand, made clear they had mixed
feelings about Rio. Their leaders were keen to stress concern for the
environment, but within strict limits dictated by the need not to damage
prospects for economic growth. Therefore, virtually no decisions were taken
that will have an immediate impact on the world economy.
Shortly after the event, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, sent a Rio
checklist to his counterparts at the head of EC and OECD countries, urging
follow-through action. Among his proposals were deadlines to ratify Rio
treaties and come up with implementation plans, support for follow-up
machinery, and a timetable to set up the Commission on Sustainable
Development, which is to be the UN body charged with ensuring that Rio
decisions are respected.
Rio has not changed anything overnight, but it has shown that environmental
factors will have to be built more fully into economic decision-making. It
drove home the message that resources are finite, and that many
environmental issues, such as those affecting the atmosphere and water, have
become matters of global rather than just national concern.
For many countries, particularly the more developed, this was only a matter
of reinforcing a message that had already been taken on board. But it is
probably true to say that Rio marked the beginning of an attempt to set
global environmental standards, and that these will evolve during the 1990s.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (9): Bafflingly slow
recovery - George Bush has presided over the slowest growth of any president
since Herbert Hoover / United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sluggishness of the US economy is baffling the experts. Most forecasters
expected a moderately robust recovery to get under way more than a year ago.
With short-term interest rates at the lowest level in a generation, few can
understand why the economy is still so lifeless.
What little confidence remained was squashed by the August employment
report. The figures were almost as shocking as the damage wrought by
Hurricane Andrew. Wall Street had been looking for an increase in payroll
employment of about 150,000. In the event, non-farm employment plunged
83,000; and the decline would have been close to 200,000 but for the
cushioning effect of a federal summer jobs programme.
The monthly figures are often erratic: the August drop in employment
followed unexpectedly good figures in July. What depresses analysts most is
the fact that private sector employment has been flat since April last year,
the month that many economists believe marked the formal end of the 1991/92
recession.
The jobs figures, moreover, are far from the only recent setback. Retail
sales fell more sharply than expected in August. Consumer confidence slipped
further last month after a sharp decline in July. Orders for durable goods
and new home sales also fell in July.
The economy is at best creeping forward. Real gross domestic product grew at
an annual rate of 1.4 per cent between April and June, to register its fifth
successive quarterly advance. This was roughly the average pace of growth
since the economy began to expand in spring last year. The betting among
forecasters is that the abnormally slow recovery will continue, but doubts
are growing.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and a veteran forecaster,
has been as surprised as anybody by the prolonged semi-recession. He has cut
short-term interest rates by two thirds - from almost 10 per cent in
mid-1989 (when the boom of the 1980s began to peter out) to just 3 per cent.
In most downturns such a decisive easing of monetary policy would have
stimulated a robust recovery. It has not done so only because the structural
imbalances' that developed during the 1980s have proved more severe and
enduring than anybody had expected. The unprecedented accumulation of debt
in the past decade, much of which financed speculative investments in real
estate and other physical assets, is still exerting a strong downward drag.
Parallels for such 'debt deflation', Mr Greenspan believes, can be found
only in the frequent booms and busts that afflicted the US economy before
the Second World War. The Fed's aggressive easing has prevented the plunges
in output and employment associated with 19th Century financial busts, but
has not yet spurred a convincing recovery.
One of the principal hurdles is the abnormally depressed level of consumer
confidence. American households are worried less by the slow recovery than
by the fact that living standards have stagnated for four years: George Bush
has presided over the slowest growth of any president since Herbert Hoover.
Some would say the worries run deeper still: many groups of workers have
seen no significant increase in wages since the early 1970s.
Economists differ over long-term strategies for reviving growth. Governor
Bill Clinton's advisers seek faster productivity growth via higher
investment in education, training and infrastructure; Mr Bush's are vainly
searching for a way to finance new tax cuts and hence increase incentives
for work and saving. But neither side thinks much can be done to improve the
immediate outlook.
With most other big economies either in or near recession, little stimulus
can be expected from exports. And the quadrupling of the national debt under
the Republicans appears to rule out a significant fiscal boost - whoever
wins the election.
The Fed's room for manoeuvre is also limited. The small cut in German
interest rates took some pressure off the dollar, but with the US economy so
weak the respite could be shortlived. But for exchange market
considerations, the Fed almost certainly would have cut the discount rate
following the shock of the August employment report. Instead it made do with
a quarter point cut in the federal funds rate; it is likely to remain
cautious.
In the longer-term, there are several chinks of light. Individual and
corporate debt ratios have fallen significantly in the past two years,
suggesting that the ground is being prepared for an eventual resumption of
borrowing and spending. Parts of the US - the south-west in particular -
could benefit substantially from the free trade pact recently agreed with
Mexico.
The lengthy period of stagnation, moreover, has served to reduce inflation
to the lowest level for a generation: many forecasters believe 2-3 per cent
inflation is now a realistic prospect. If recent opinion polls are to be
believed, however, Mr Bush may not remain in office long enough to claim the
credit.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (10): A humbling
experience - The monetary excesses of the 1980s are costing the country dear
/ Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a humbling year for financial authorities in Tokyo. For most of
1992, government economists and Bank of Japan officials insisted that the
Japanese economy was suffering from little more than a hard-to-explain bout
of self-doubt.
True, land and stock prices were plummeting as a result of a tight money
policy. But all calculations appeared to show that with the employment
market tight, and consumers flush with cash, brisk consumer demand would
keep a firm floor under the economy.
In the end, amid mounting signs of a financial crisis, the calculations
proved false, and the government was forced to step in at the end of August
with the largest emergency economic package in Japanese history, amounting
to Y10,700bn.
The action followed a rising fear that Japan may be passing quickly from a
Japanese-style slowdown into a full-blown American-style recession, with
several quarters of negative economic growth and significant unemployment.
What has gone wrong? In simple terms, Japan is paying a huge price for the
monetary excesses of the late 1980s, when record low interest rates prompted
a fantastic rise in stock and land prices. The Bank of Japan, under strong
international pressure at the time to cut Japan's trade surplus, held the
official discount rate to 2.5 per cent for more than 2 1/2 years to
stimulate imports.
This it did, temporarily, but the action led to asset and consumer price
inflation and an overheated economy. The Bank of Japan moved to squeeze the
money supply in 1989, and land and stock prices have fallen spectacularly.
It appeared until early this year, however, that the central bank had
managed to isolate financial and asset markets from the rest of the economy.
In retrospect, the sharp fluctuations in interest rates had set up the
country's mainstream manufacturing sector for a severe cyclical crash.
Vehicle and electronics companies took advantage of the historic low cost of
capital to raise financing. Indeed, they were frequently able to issue
convertible bonds in the stock market for 1 per cent or less, and earn a
higher return by depositing the money in the bank.
With capital cheap, and consumers spending money lavishly, it was natural
for companies to expand capacity, and private capital spending rose by more
than 10 per cent for four years running.
The spending, which had been a principal source of economic growth, however,
could not be sustained when the cost of capital began to rise. As a result
demand growth started to slow. As new plant opened, inventories piled up.
This in itself was enough to hurt profits badly, but it came at a time when
the bill for the binge of capital spending in terms of depreciation charges
was mounting heavily on profit and loss accounts.
The reaction has been to introduce further cuts in capital spending, which
led to a sharper contraction in demand. The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
estimates that total capital investment will be off 0.1 per cent in fiscal
1992, with manufacturing investment off by 8.7 per cent.
Japan's trusty consumers were supposed to prevent the situation from getting
out of hand by continuing to spend freely. This, the theory went, was
because of a structural labour shortage. In the end, however, Japanese
companies have been cutting overtime work, limiting bonus payments, and
reducing hiring. Bankruptcies of small manufacturing companies have been
rising. As a result, household income is not so secure after all.
All measures of consumer spending have turned downward. Department store
sales have shown a year-on-year decline for five consecutive months to July.
In August, new car sales plunged 18.6 per cent.
With capital investment and consumer spending accounting for 65 per cent of
Japan's gross national product, and both stagnating, there appears little
chance of the government coming anywhere close to its original growth target
of 3.5 per cent for the fiscal year ending March 1993. Many private
economists now believe growth will slip below 2 per cent, even with the
emergency spending package and its headline figure of Y10,700bn, which comes
to 2.3 per cent of GNP.
Only about half of the advertised total will contribute directly to GNP
growth, as this is pure spending for public works or housing. The balance
includes acquisition of land and a variety of loan programmes which, given
the weak state of demand, may or may not be taken up fully. The impact of
the package will not be felt until the new year.
As important as the extra spending measures, was the promise from the
government that a programme would be put in place to help banks get bad
loans off their books. These bad loans may now total Y25,000bn to Y30,000bn,
although no one knows the exact size. The cost of bearing so much bad debt
had wiped out bank profits and forced banks to sell securities to dress up
the accounts, thus further depressing the stock market and undermining the
capital base of the banks.
This, more than the slowdown in the economy, accounted for the sense of
crisis in August, and it was the promise of government support that later
turned the market around. It remains to be seen whether the government can
overcome the substantial political and technical obstacles to mounting an
effective rescue.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (11): The battle continues
 -A look at post-unification problems / Germany
</HEADLINE>

AFTER two years bucking the trend of international stagnation, thanks to the
extraordinary economic boost of unification, the German economy is suddenly
facing a grimmer reality. The optimists had been looking for a significant
recovery in exports in the second half of the year to take up the slack,
after the production boom for east Germany ran out of steam.
Instead, east German recovery is proving elusive, the west German economy is
labouring under the huge cost of public spending transfers (running at a
good DM150bn a year), and relief from the world economy is not in sight.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, went so far as to warn of a
'vicious circle' in his September budget speech. He saw a failure to spark
self-sustaining growth in east Germany placing an excessive burden on the
west, and in turn undermining recovery there.
And yet there are hopeful signs. Only two months ago, the principal domestic
and foreign pundits agreed Germany was set to recover from its 'pause' and
return to a moderate, steady growth path of 3 per cent a year. The upward
trend would be firmly established in 1994, most reckoned.
The question is how long the pause will last. Germany needs a return to
growth among its European partners to boost its own exports. But the other
European economies in turn are held back by the high interest rates set by
the Bundesbank, because of its fears over excessive monetary expansion,
caused by the huge cash flows to east Germany. All is interconnected, and
the Bundesbank is the link. The rates remain too high for the rest of
Europe, in spite of the bank cutting its Lombard rate by 0.25 percentage
points.
Working independently of the Bonn government, the central bank irritated EC
partners and angered Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, when it cranked up
its discount rate in July. No matter that the main impact was to dampen
domestic demand for credit, it further underlined the Bundesbank's
determination to hold its rigorous anti-inflation line. The stability of the
D-Mark was of paramount importance for Germany and the EC at large, the bank
said. the Bundesbank felt it had to act because it had been denied support
by Bonn's finance policy-makers and the social partners responsible for pay
policy.
Mr Waigel, who had recently unveiled his new 'hard as nails' finance policy
and pledged to cap federal spending increases with a 2.5 per cent nominal
increase each year until 1995, was miffed to say the least.
The latest Bundesbank move to cut its interest rates, as part of the
realignment of currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism was
greeted by Mr Waigel as a helpful signal, opening the way for improved
economic growth. At the same time, the prospect of a 'solidarity pact' to be
negotiated by government, opposition, industry, trade unions and local
government by 1993 has raised hopes of much more effective wage control, and
public expenditure control, next year.
The signals remain confusing, however. There are hopes for a compromise
agreement to save some DM11bn from the bloated health service.
IG Metall, the 4m-strong engineering union, is the source of another
encouraging indicator. As part of its 1992 pay deal, it accepted a 3 per
cent rise for 1993.
Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, wants no part of the joint European
Fighter Aircraft project, judging it to be no longer appropriate. And in the
macroeconomic battlefield, German inflation is on the retreat. Given no
external shocks, it should stabilise at around 3.5 per cent next year.
By then, pan-German gross domestic product growth (GDP) should be steady at
around 2.5 per cent a year, with the expected recovery abroad bolstering the
GNP measure to a good 3 per cent.
Taking the shorter-term view, the recent Germany survey from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), reckoned
inflation could be down at around 2.75 per cent by the end of next year and
GNP up to 2.8 per cent.
The organisation shared deep concerns, however, about the longer-term
prospects in the east. There are 340,000 workers officially listed as on
short-time, but effectively producing nothing in return for wages paid out
of the DM180bn Bonn will transfer during 1991. A further 390,000 are kept
off the unemployment register by 'work creation' schemes, also funded by
Bonn.
Eastern unit labour costs, burdened by agreements made during the
post-unification euphoria which promised full wage parity with the west by
the end of 1995, are almost double those in the west. The former GDR,
meanwhile, contributes only a meagre 7 per cent of pan-German GDP.
The effects of those short-sighted pay deals are now apparent. While private
capital investment in the east is hampered by high interest rates, it is
still expected to increase by DM20bn next year to DM120bn.
It is now universally accepted that economic convergence is going to take
far longer than was expected in 1990. However, what the OECD calls
'unrealistic expectations' persist on the pay front.
That is where Mr Waigel and others, jointly committed to squeezing inflation
and building a sound economic base in the east, face their toughest battle
next year. Persuading western trade unionists that the IG Metall's notional
3 per cent rise for 1993 should be the target for all will be hard enough.
Convincing the increasingly disenchanted people in the east that they must
wait even longer for pay parity may prove impossible.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (12): Falling prey to la
morosite - It is time to take stock of the socialist government's record /
France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT the summer one word has dominated the political and economic
agenda in France - Maastricht.
The referendum yesterday, at which the French were asked to vote on whether
or not to ratify the Maastricht treaty for European union, was of such
overwhelming significance, both to France itself and elsewhere in Europe,
that it dwarfed every other topic of debate. Now that the referendum is
over, the French public can concentrate on assessing the socialist
government's economic record ahead of the forthcoming elections.
If you listened to the conversation at a Parisian dinner party or a
Lyonnaise bistro, you could be forgiven for thinking that the government's
record was very bad indeed. Moaning and groaning about la morosite, or the
sluggish state of the French economy, has been a dominant topic in France
over the past year or so.
To the British, the Americans, or any other nation whose economy has really
suffered, the complaints of the French scarcely seem justified. France has,
after all, benefited from a much more robust economic performance than
almost all its trading partners in the early 1990s, as screeds of analyses
attest.
The reason why the French have fallen prey to la morosite over the past year
or so is that, although France has avoided the recession that has beset so
many of its international competitors, its economic performance has been, at
best, pedestrian.
France mustered growth of just 1.25 per cent last year, much lower than in
previous years. It is on course for slightly higher growth of at least 2 per
cent this year, according to Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, together
with an annual inflation rate of around 2.8 per cent and a trading account
that has moved from the red in 1991, into the black in 1992.
The problem for the French government is that most of this growth has been
export-led, as French companies have taken advantage of France's
consistently low rate of inflation to become more cost-competitive in their
international markets. By contrast, the domestic market has stayed
stubbornly sluggish because the high cost of borrowing - with bank base
rates of 9.85 per cent - has depressed consumer confidence and curbed
industrial investment.
This means that French consumers feel as though they are under financial
pressure as do companies, which have continued to shed labour thereby
creating a vicious circle in which the rising rate of joblessness - which
has hovered between 8 per cent and 10 per cent for the past eight years but
passed the 10 per cent barrier earlier this year - makes consumers even more
nervous.
Unfortunately for the French government the obvious remedy of reducing
interest rates is complicated by Germany's dominant role in the EC economic
system. So far France has failed to convince international investors that
the inflation rate has been so low for so long that the franc and French
bonds, are a suitable substitute for the benchmark investment vehicles of
the D-Mark and German bunds.
As a result, French interest rates are still dictated by those of Germany as
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, who preceded Mr Sapin as finance minister before
becoming prime minister this spring, discovered last autumn when he tried to
hold French rates below those of the Germans only to have to raise them
again little more than two weeks later to protect the franc.
This scenario seems set to continue with the uncertainty over Germany's
economic outlook making it even more difficult to predict when the Germans,
and then the French, will be able to reduce interest rates again.
In the meantime, both Mr Beregovoy and Mr Sapin have made it quite clear
that they will stick to their franc fort policy of supporting the French
currency.
Even with interest rates at their present level, the French economy is on
course to meet Mr Sapin's growth target of 2 per cent for 1992, according to
the latest forecast from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which also predicts a modest improvement to 2.5 per cent
growth next year.
In the short term this growth will continue to come from exports. It is only
in the longer term, according to the OECD, as the benefits of greater
international competitiveness filter through and lower interest rates
alleviate the pressure on the domestic market, that demand within France
itself will recover, the increase in unemployment will be halted and the
French economy will be ready to return to faster growth.
The international outlook is still clouded. There has been some progress but
the instability of Japan and the effect of the dollar's decline on the US,
both important markets for French luxury goods and drinks companies, could
pose problems, as could the continuing uncertainty over the prospects for
Germany and Italy, two important European export markets.
This may make it more difficult for France to continue its buoyant export
performance, and to counter the effect of the depressed domestic market,
over the coming year. The OECD warned that the fragility of the
international economy could be the main impediment to France's recovery.
As a result, although France still seems on course for continued growth, the
French public are likely to be moaning and groaning about la morosite into
the forthcoming elections.
The scenario could, of course, be very, very different if Mr Spain and Mr
Beregovoy showed the slightest sign of relaxing their tight control over the
economy.
But the socialist government seems set on being as rigid as ever in its
approach to the economy.
The OECD has applauded its rigour, maintaining that it would have nothing to
gain and everything to lose, in terms of tattered credibility, if it was to
change course.
As the elections approach, the one certainty on the febrile French political
scene is that, whichever party wins, left or right, it will not make the
slightest difference to the economic management of France.

strategy - Hopes will now be pinned on an improvement in competitiveness /
United Kingdom

IN BRITAIN a summer of discontent on the economic front has now ended in
tears. After nearly a month of struggling to hold the pound within the ERM,
through massive intervention in the foreign exchange markets, the government
has been forced to abandon this cornerstone of its economic policy. The
devaluation option, scorned less than two weeks ago by the prime minister,
John Major, has now, in effect, had to be adopted, leaving the government to
construct a wholly new economic policy.
Yet, even with a new lower exchange rate, interest rate policy is likely to
be constrained by the need to maintain the fight against inflation. As a
result prospects for recovery from the longest peacetime recession since the
1930s look relatively unpromising. There is a big question mark over whether
Britain will, as it says it wants to, re-enter the ERM, when market
conditions look more settled, or whether it will return to a policy of
letting the pound float.
To many economists, prospects appeared completely different four months ago,
shortly after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the April 9 general
election. Economic indicators were turning up, and the end to the recession
which began around mid-1990 seemed not far away.
But this mood did not last long. Last month a survey by the Treasury showed
the median view of the economics profession was for the economy to contract
this year by 0.6 per cent, followed by a 1.6 per cent growth in 1993.
The strain on the pound of the UK's weak economic performance has in the end
proved irresistible with a small cut in German interest rates, accompanied
by a devaluation of the Italian lira in mid-September, proving insufficient
to turn away the attentions of speculators convinced that sterling was
overvalued.
The gloom had already been underlined when Professor Douglas McWilliams,
economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, predicted in
August that Britain faced four more quarters of contraction, with recovery
delayed until 1994. Coming from a man who has been optimistic about an
upturn - and whose views carry a lot of weight - Prof McWilliams's remarks
added to the foreboding.
Some might argue that it is when such bleak views are being expressed that
the economy is ripe for an upturn.
According to this sentiment the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares - which
between election day and the beginning of September has come off by 10 per
cent as pessimism for business prospects has set in - should soon start to
rebound. Indeed, late last week, with the first signs that the period of
uncertainty might be coming to an end, the index put in a sustained rally.
Less than propitious trends remain, however, within the UK economy:
Bank base rates, although quickly restored to 10 per cent after a temporary
rise last week to 12 per cent (and a threatened 15 per cent) in a last
desperate bid to save the ERM valuation remain extremely high for a country
struggling to climb out of recession. While the German Bundesbank maintains
its present level of interest rates - which remain high in spite of last
week's actions - Britain's potential to ease borrowing costs will remain
small.
Consumer demand, which accounts for two thirds of GDP, remains low. This is
partly because of the high overhang of consumer debt, especially mortgages,
resulting from heavy borrowing during the late 1980s' economic boom.
Consumer spending has fallen 3.5 per cent since mid-1990, while during the
last recession in 1980-81 it fell less than 2 per cent.
After a 25 per cent fall in some regions of Britain in house prices over the
past four years, the housing market remains weak, with few signs of an
upturn. According to the Bank of England, up to 1m mortgage holders, or 10
per cent of the total, have a mortgage bigger than the value of their home.
The slump in the housing market has hit particularly hard sales of
big-ticket consumer goods such as refrigerators and cookers.
While manufacturing output has shown small growth in each of the first two
quarters of this year, providing some chink of light for the economy,
prospects for the rest of 1992 do not look particularly good.
Britain's ability to inject more demand into the economy by easing fiscal
policy is diminished by its rapidly rising public sector borrowing
requirement, which looks like climbing to above Pounds 30bn this financial
year after a PSBR of Pounds 14bn in 1991-92 and a small surplus in the
previous year. Nonetheless the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, a leading economics think tank, thinks the government might have
scope for some small measure of tax cuts or extra public spending to help a
recovery, adding up to a fiscal injection of some Pounds 2bn over the next
year.
Amid the gloom, what are the more positive elements? A fall in the value of
sterling against other European currencies, and in particular the D-Mark,
will help exports to EC partners. The prospects of companies exporting to
the US, will also have been improved .
Against this, the Treasury's previous strategy of pinning hopes for better
times on the large falls in inflation will have become much more problematic
with devaluation inevitably increasing inflationary pressures over the
medium term. To date, headline inflation, as measured by the retail prices
index, has fallen from nearly 11 per cent at the end of 1990 to below 4 per
cent in August, while the underlying year-on-year increase in average
earnings across the economy has come down over the same period from 9.75 per
cent to 6 per cent in July.
In manufacturing, largely because of the heavy falls in employment during
the past two years, productivity rises have been fairly healthy, giving some
hopes of a good platform for future industrial expansion.
Put alongside productivity increases, however, are the large falls in
factory investment during the recession. This has made some observers
pessimistic about the chances of the UK's manufacturers being able to
compete strongly over the next few years with overseas rivals, particularly
in important capital intensive areas such as electronics, cars and
production equipment.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (15): China in the
limelight - As Japan struggles to come to terms with its success, two other
potential economic superpowers in the region are stirring / Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Asia's most advanced economy is struggling to cope with the problems
of success, the region's other giants are stirring. Economic reform is the
fashion in most of the countries previously led by socialist-inspired
bureaucracies.
Notwithstanding Japan's problems, Asia stands out for its continued rapid
economic growth. This year, China has again burst on to the scene. If its
present growth rate is maintained its economy (though not per capita income)
would be as large as that of the US within just over 20 years.
That, as has already been seen since China embarked on the road to economic
reform, is a big if. Since the changes spearheaded by Deng Xiaoping, China's
88-year-old senior leader, began in 1979 the economy has boomed and bust
twice.
Reforms generate bursts of economic activity as regions, businesses and
individuals test out the new limits. They put tremendous pressure on the
barriers which remain in the system, especially in the price system, and
tend to push up inflation.
This year has seen another such burst. In January, Mr Deng visited the
southern coastal areas which are the showcase of Chinese reform, and urged
the whole country to speed up its efforts to boost economic growth and
change.
His visit had a strongly political aspect. Mr Deng no longer has any
official posts, but he was still engaged in a struggle for supremacy with
more conservative hardliners who fear that over-rapid reform will loosen the
Communist party's grip on power. Mr Deng believes growing prosperity is the
party's best hope of keeping power - and the crushing of the 1989
demonstrations in Tienanmen Square showed that he, like the other leaders,
was determined its position should remain unchallenged.
It took two months for the media to report Mr Deng's visit to the most open
and free area of China, only just over the border from Hong Kong. But when
they did, his message was taken up with astonishing vigour throughout the
country.
The Tienanmen Square massacre had occurred just after the beginning of an
economic austerity drive which responded to a reform-induced surge in
inflation. This year, the tight reins on the economy could be relaxed.
Credit became more free. Mr Deng's exhortations triggered a wave of
competition between regions for greater freedom along the lines of the
south's special economic zones.
Industrial production and investment soared, as all types of enterprises
sought to grow and as foreign investment, especially from overseas Chinese
in Hong Kong and Taiwan, poured in to the south.
The official target for 1992 economic growth had been 6 per cent. But
conservatives such as premier Li Peng have been forced to abandon it as the
growth rate surged to 12 per cent in the first half of the year, compared
with 7 per cent in the whole of 1991 and an average of 9 per cent since
reforms began.
Already, the planners in Beijing are worried about the economy overheating,
even though official measures of inflation so far show little cause for
alarm.
An official newspaper, the Economic Information Daily, asked in early
September: 'How long can our current fast speed of economic growth continue?
When will the 'express train' turn into a 'slow train'? Will it be like
1989, when we had to use the emergency brakes?'. It pointed out: 'Our
country has had 22 straight months of high economic growth. The pace of
growth has prompted discussion both at home and abroad on whether the
economy is overheated.'
However, the government freed the prices of a number of key materials for
manufacturing production from the beginning of September. Apart from a
tightening of banks' reserve requirements, there is little sign yet of
action to slow growth.
The challenge which the government faces is central to the transformation
away from a centrally planned economy to one in which the private sector is
given much greater play: how to maintain macroeconomic control while at the
same time loosening the restrictions on economic activity. The need is for
sharper, more delicate tools, but less bureaucracy.
China has already come a long way. Private sector activity accounts for more
than half the economy. Though state-owned industry remains a huge burden on
the budget, privately driven growth is progressively making it a smaller
problem in relative terms.
The region's other giant, India, has also undertaken a radical reform
programme which has its friends excited that the country's massive economic
potential could be released. Many of its problems were the same as China's:
unprofitable state industries and banks and excessively bureaucratic central
planning.
Unlike the government in Beijing, however, that of prime minister PV
Narasimha Rao has to change the direction of the economy in a domestic
political cauldron, with many politicians and senior bureaucrats deeply
suspicious of a policy which promotes the private sector.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has already abolished licensing -
the need for bureaucratic approval for corporate investments - and started
to dismantle the trade barriers and investment and currency restrictions
which had isolated the economy. But he faces political challenges in
reducing subsidies, cutting tariffs and privatising state-owned industries.
A similar reform programme is under way in Pakistan, with licensing also
abolished, all barriers to foreign investment discarded, and a rapid
programme of privatisation under way.
With communist Vietnam heading for a market economy, and Mongolia struggling
to do so in the face of huge economic difficulties, there are few countries
left in Asia whose economic policies espouse socialism (China's current
catchphrase is 'socialist market economy'). China has been exerting pressure
on North Korea, which still has a communist dictatorship, to go the same
way.
None of this yet threatens the other rapidly growing countries of south-east
and north-east Asia directly. Hong Kong and Taiwan are full participants,
through investment, in China's economic surge. But a continuation of
convincing reforms in the former socialist economies may soon have a wider
range of foreign manufacturers re-considering the location of new
export-oriented factories.

FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (14): A continent drifts
into crisis - Natural and man-made disasters, disease and debt are racking
Africa / Poverty and Hunger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE challenge facing Africa is exceptional . . . the cost of failure would
be appalling,' warned the World Bank nearly three years ago.
The challenge - to reverse the economic decline of the region - turned out
to be overwhelming, and the cost of failure is proving catastrophic. Without
a combination of further debt relief, additional resources assisted by
better management, and an upturn in the world economy, recovery in the
foreseeable future is out of reach.
Today sub-Saharan Africa, home to more than 500m people, is racked by
natural and man-made disasters, disease and the burden of foreign debt
exceeding Dollars 175bn. From Somalia to Zaire, from Mozambique to Sudan,
economies and social structures are collapsing, symptoms of the continent's
seemingly irreversible decline.
In its seminal analysis of the continent's plight - Sub-Saharan Africa: From
Crisis to Sustainable Growth - the bank said that 'overall, Africans are
almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years ago'.
To register 'a modest improvement in living standards', the report
calculated, 'sub-Saharan economies must grow by at least 4 to 5 per cent
annually'. Highly ambitious, given the region's past performance, the
report's authors acknowledged, 'but we believe it can be achieved'.
Nothing like that target has been reached, and nor does the bank's own
forecast of growth in the 1990s suggest that it will be attained in the
years to come.
Aggregate GDP for sub-Saharan Africa rose by 1.3 per cent in 1990, and
around 2.4 per cent in 1991: 'Not sufficient, in the context of Africa's
high population growth rate (3.2 per cent),' observes the bank's 1992 annual
report, 'to prevent per capita income from falling 0.6 per cent.'
Earlier this year the bank was expecting growth of 3.4 per cent in 1992  -
now being revised downward as the full affects of drought and a weak
international economy are taken into account - and projected an average
annual growth for the period 1990-2000 of 3.5 per cent.
'By 2,000, per capita gain in real income will be minimal for the region as
a whole', warned the bank in its report, Global Economic Prospects and the
Developing Countries, 'and may be negative in some countries.'
'Although relief can be expected from real increases in commodity prices and
debt and debt service reduction measures,' the report continued, sub-Saharan
Africa's limited stock of capital in equipment, infrastructure, and human
resources precludes any sharp improvements in living standards.'
Behind this detached analysis lies a tragedy of a dimension only partly
revealed by some of the grim statistics carried in the bank's annual report.
It calculates the number of poor at 228m - more than half sub-Saharan
Africa's population. Per capita income of Dollars 340 in 1990 is 'exceeded
by all the world's regions except South Asia'.
For many of the poor, their hold on life is tenuous. War and drought have
left 21m people at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa. In southern
Africa, enduring its worst drought this century, some 19m people need food
aid.
But what the statistics conceal is the extent to which the infrastructures
and institutions have been disintegrating, leaving a generation of Africans
without the resources to implement blueprints for recovery. With few
exceptions, civil services are inefficient, schools and universities
ill-equipped, and management weak.
Whether the existing levels of aid can be sustained in the 1990s is open to
doubt. Africa's worries that concessional assistance might be diverted to
eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, are valid,
acknowledges the bank: 'Unless donors' aid budgets are increased,' it warns,
'other developing countries may be affected.'
No significant help is likely in the form of external investment. One of the
most telling yardsticks of the loss of confidence in sub-Saharan Africa is
the flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Official figures show that
non-oil exporting countries in sub-Saharan Africa received on average less
than Dollars 0.5bn a year during the second half of the 1980s - 'roughly
what Papua New Guinea alone attracted during the same period', a UN report
wryly notes, and concludes: 'The low levels of FDI flowing to Africa
underline the increasing marginalisation of the region.'
Meanwhile, the spectre of Aids hangs over a continent already debilitated by
malaria, bilharzia, guinea worm and other parasitic diseases. Estimates of
the impact of Aids vary, but a conference last December in the Senegalese
capital Dakar was told that even at the most conservative official estimates
of the infection rate, at least 25 per cent of Africa's workforce could be
affected by 2010.
One in every 40 adults in Africa is already infected with the HIV virus that
causes Aids. These victims are part of Africa's economic engine - 15 to
49-year-old farmers, mine workers, even the educated elite.
Research presented at the conference on Aids in Africa found that the
labour-intensive agricultural and mining industries, the two pillars of the
economy of sub-Saharan Africa, are already suffering the impacts of Aids.
Some economists warn that the Aids pandemic poses a threat of unprecedented
economic disruption as the disease takes its toll. Some experts forecast
that Aids will kill 5m or more adults in the next eight years.
African officials argue that the world has a stake in helping their
countries stem a disease that could, they fear, cripple the key economic
sectors of the continent.
'Africa must not be abandoned,' says Dr Kekoura Kourouma, head of Guinea's
national Aids programme. 'Remember, a sick population will not be able to
work, will not be able to pay its debts.'
Whether such an appeal to self-interest in the west will have a greater
impact than humanitarian appeals remains to be seen. What seems certain is
that the worst of Africa's anguish may be yet to come.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Hi-tech sleuths who take art off the fence: Harriet Crawley
visits the Belgravia bunker from which Brigadier Emson traces stolen art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRIET CRAWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIGADIER James Emson has been a trouble shooter all his life. When London's
firemen went on strike he was appointed Chief of Staff for Military
Firefighters. Today he is leading another fight, against art theft.
The weapons are not hosepipes or guns but computers, and some slick software
produced in the US and installed in the basement of 13 Grosvenor Place, a
stone's throw from Buckingham Palace.
From his high tech bunker, surrounded by five university graduates with
degrees in history of art, the ex-Brigadier directs his fast-growing
operation.
The International Art Loss Register is a computerised database of stolen art
with over 40,000 items in its memory bank ranging from snuff bottles to
marble Venuses. Items (they must be over Pounds 1,000 in value) are logged
by description and by photograph on the state-of-the-art optical computer.
The fees vary. Insurance companies take out a corporate subscription for
Pounds 8,000-odd pounds, which means that whenever one of their clients is
robbed the theft is automatically logged with the ALR; otherwise you and I
pay Pounds 20 to register a theft, or Pounds 10 to conduct a 'search,' which
says Emson, has no cut off point.
The ALR was founded in 1990 by a consortium of leading auction houses
(Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips) and insurance companies (Hogg Group,
Lloyd's, Nordstern). It has confounded its critics and is proving
extraordinarily successful in tracking down stolen art.
Recently, a man in a double breasted suit appeared at the counter of
Sotheby's with a view of Westminster Abbey by John Inigo Richards, claiming
he had bought it in a car boot sale for Pounds 40 and had cleaned it with
Fairy Liquid. Sotheby's found the story far-fetched and rang the Register.
There, Caroline Wakeford fed details into the Register, to instigate a
'fuzzy' search, hoping for a 'match.' Up came an identical picture logged as
stolen a month earlier. A cry of jubilation went up in the bunker.
The police are making increasing use of the Register. The police have free
access to the ALR, and many of the 'dedicated' officers spend hours in the
bunker 'fuzzy searching'. Recently the Regional Crime squad paid a visit
with photographs of two stolen pictures, Charles I and Henrietta Maria,
copies of Van Dyke, which had been registered in 1991 by a loss adjustor.
This led to the recovery not only of the paintings but of nine other items,
all stolen from the same Somerset house.
'Liaison between the 52 different forces in Britain is poor,' said Sarah
Jackson, another articulate ALR sleuth. 'Increasingly we act as go-between.'
The Metropolitan Police logged the theft of several pictures from a private
London house with the ALR; six weeks later the City of London police found a
hoard of paintings in Jewry Street and, suspecting they must be stolen, came
to the register offices with photographs. After feverish 'fuzzy searching'
the paintings were identified as the same sea scapes by James Cleveley the
Elder and works by Thomas Luny, worth Pounds 60,000, which had been stolen
from a private house in Westminster and registered by the Met.
At the end of July, the Register identified a stolen item of furniture when
it was sold at an auction. This gave police the breakthrough which led them
to a series of 'fences' in London. They recovered 3,800 items stolen in
burglaries in the the southern half of England. The Register identified 198
of the items, 80 of which were insured with Lloyd's.
The new head of the Metropolitan Art and Antiques Squad, Detective Chief
Inspector John Butler, is so impressed with the Register that he is
installing a modem in Scotland Yard to give the police instant access to the
files. Emson is delighted: 'The police don't have a comparable stolen art
register which includes images, so we are filling a vacuum. We are the art
equivalent of the Lloyd's register for shipping.'
Sotheby's and Christie's, leading shareholders of the ALR, use it to have
their catalogues searched at a cost of over Pounds 20.000 a year. 'If we can
show a painting has been stolen they will withdraw it at once . . . both
Sotheby's and Christie's are determined to see a reduction in the traffic in
stolen art.'
Insurance companies have a vested interest in subscribing to the ALR
(corporate subscriptions run at Pounds 8,500 a year.) They want to get the
stolen art back so that they do not have to pay out.
'At last we're getting through to the loss adjustors,' says Emson. 'They are
beginning to see that it is worthwhile registering thefts with us.' The
figures speak for themselves: 134 Lloyd's syndicates subscribe and over
Pounds 400,000 of stolen art has been recovered. Syndicate 33 paid the ALR a
fee of Pounds 2,179.60 and recovered Pounds 67,350 of art.
'Value for money,' the ex-Brigadier purred.
But the art trade is showing little interest in the Register, even though
the Society of London Art Dealers and the British Association of Art Dealers
are both shareholders. Phillip Broadbridge of the London and Provincial Art
Dealers Association says his members are sceptical of a commercial body
which is doing the police's job for them.
Emson counters: 'The police are unlikely to get a national database of
stolen art . . . anyway even if they do it won't be available to the public.
A dealer can subscribe for only Pounds 36 a year . . . it must be in
everyone's interest to stop the circulation of stolen goods.'
And yet dealers are not coming forward. 'It's the hassle . . . police,
perhaps a court appearance, a lot of wasted time . . .' says Phillip
Saunders of Trace magazine, which circulates photographs of stolen art. 'In
my view dealers will never subscribe in any numbers . . . they should but
they won't'
In France dealers are obliged by law to register all purchases except those
bought at public auction.
'This draconian measure has been an effective deterrent against dealers who
may otherwise have been tempted to buy stolen art,' said Saunders. 'It's
only a matter of time before the same legislation comes to Britain.'
Meanwhile, the ALR is spreading its international net: the European dealers'
associations have subscribed, so have leading French, Swiss, German and US
insurance companies. A few weeks ago the head of the Italian national art
squad, Colonel Conforte, visited the Belgravia bunker.
Soon the ALR will be working round the clock. It is linking its computer
with Centrox, a US company which digests the catalogues from 178 auction
houses round the world. The ALR will be able to search for your Georgian tea
pot, Constable sketch or Chippendale chair, world wide. Unless the art
thieves think up a computer virus to stop it.

FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Itoman dissolved in merger
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S era of financial excess has claimed its most famous victim. Itoman,
a once staid textile trader turned property and art speculator, is to be
dissolved under a merger proposal announced by the Sumitomo group yesterday.
Itoman, founded in 1883 as an importer of fabric, is to be merged with
Sumikin Bussan, a steel trading subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Industries, a
core company of the Sumitomo group, which has taken responsibility for the
restructuring of Itoman.
The proposal, under which five Itoman shares will be swapped for one share
in the unlisted Sumikin Bussan, reflects the influence of keiretsu, or
corporate groupings.
Itoman executives said they had attempted to salvage the company, but were
hampered by the economic slowdown. They also announced what was likely to be
Itoman's last profits forecast - an after-tax loss of Y90bn (Dollars 720m)
for the year to end March, when the company is to be delisted.
Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) said it would look into trading of
Itoman shares in recent days, when volume has been higher than average. Any
further scandal linked to Itoman would continue a two-year run of
unflattering headlines at a company which was not alone in indulging in
speculation.
Sumikin Bussan emphasised that it would take over none of the debts of
Itoman, which still has an extensive international trading network in
textiles, food, and industrial machinery.
Itoman was estimated to have Y1,300bn in consolidated debt at its
speculative peak in 1990, before the collapse of the stock, property and art
markets. After the arrest of seven men last year in connection with alleged
corruption, prosecutors said speculation in golf courses, the works of
Modigliani, and apartments had caused losses of Y300bn.
The company has attempted to trade its way out of trouble, but was forced to
approach Sumitomo Bank, its main bank, for financial assistance in
restructuring. The bank proposed the merger with Sumikin, which is 59.5 per
cent owned by Sumitomo Metals.
Attempts to restructure Itoman were hampered by the negative publicity the
company has attracted over the past two years. The turmoil at Itoman is
cited as a reason for the fall of Mr Ichiro Isoda, the Sumitomo Bank
chairman, who resigned in 1990.
The close connection with the bank has been highly embarrassing for the
Sumitomo group, as, in 1990, 13 of Itoman's 47 executives had worked for the
institution, and the trading house's customers had believed its investments
came with the bank's blessing.
Itoman's ill-fated foray into property markets was once cited by executives
as an indication of its successful diversification away from traditional
trading pursuits. Ironically, Sumikin said yesterday that the Itoman merger
was a part of its diversification strategy.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Ambulance inquiry sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commons health committee was urged by Nupe, the public-service union,
yesterday to conduct an inquiry into the funding and management of the
London Ambulance Service.
LAS, the biggest ambulance service in the country, has faced increasing
criticism recently for delays in handling incoming telephone calls and
attending some emergencies.
Nupe, which has been among the most vocal critics, accuses the service's
management in a document circulated to London MPs yesterday of using the
capital as 'an experimental playing field' for the use of rapid-response
paramedic units and a helicopter. They are, the union says, soaking up
resources and contributing to the inability of LAS to provide a strong basic
service.
The Nupe report says the service's management is 'obsessed with economic
considerations'. LAS was 'slowly disintegrating into an expensive lame duck
with the frantic 999 caller becoming its least important customer'.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, responded to the report
yesterday by writing to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, asking
her to set up an inquiry into LAS.
He said the document was a 'damning indictment' of the present state of the
service. It revealed 'serious risks faced by Londoners because of the
underfunding and inadequate staffing which is undermining the service'.
The inquiry, Mr Blunkett said, should include an examination of the impact
of commercial and financial pressures on the service.
Mr Blunkett also wrote to Mrs Bottomley yesterday asking her to clarify the
position in relation to the supervision of the West Midlands Regional Health
Authority.
Sir Roy Griffiths, deputy chairman of the National Health Service board, has
been asked by Mrs Bottomley to help to strengthen the authority's management
after a critical district auditor's report into the handling of a contract.
Mr Blunkett said there appeared to be significant difficulties within the
regional authority, and it was 'in everyone's interest that the whole
picture is in the public arena as quickly as possible'.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Gardening: It's a hip scene in the bushes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIPS on my rugosa roses have never been finer or more plentiful. I am
not sure why because the crops of berries and other fruits in my garden are
rather patchy; but, of course, the hips set quite late and the flowering of
rugosas continues for a particularly long time and this year was very
prolific.
I grow two varieties of Rosa rugosa, both single-flowered. One named Alba
has white flowers and the other, Rubra, is magenta; both have the good
rugosa perfume. Both flower from late spring until autumn but the hips are
usually taking over by July.
These are big, flattened globes, rather like little tomatoes except that
each has a distinctive green top-knot composed of the old calyx segments of
the flower; this gives them a very distinctive appearance. They are carried
in good clusters.
These two fine roses must not be confused with the rugosa rose that is used
by nurserymen as a root stock for standard rose trees. This is closely
related but is probably a hybrid. Certainly, it is a very inferior garden
plant with quite a different habit, taller and laxer and with a pernicious
habit of producing suckers very freely.
By contrast, the true Rosa rugosa is about as wide as it is high,
well-branched and sturdy. Although it does sucker, it is not anything like
so wide-ranging as the root-stock.
I like my rugosa roses not only because of their long flowering season and
good crops of hips but also for their thick-textured, deeply-veined, dark
green leaves which I have never seen marred by disease of any kind. This
good health seems to be universal; even the pests keep off, as if the leaves
contain something obnoxious. I prune late in winter with a hedge-trimmer and
cut back only as far as necessary to keep the bushes from spreading too far.
Hybrids between Rosa rugosa and other roses tend to be sterile, which has
limited the number of garden varieties made with this parentage. But there
are some good ones, most notably Blanc Double de Coubert, Frau Dagmar
Hastrup, Roseraie de L'Hay and Scabrosa.
The first, as its name implies, is white. The flowers are semi-double and
the habit is sturdy and bushy, but it does not produce hips freely like the
single-flowered varieties.
By contrast, Frau Dagmar Hastrup does produce lots of hips and they are of a
particularly deep colour which contrasts well with the pale pink, single
flowers. It is also shorter and more compact and so is not suitable for
making a big hedge, but it can be used for a low one: say, 3-4 ft.
Roseraie de L'Hay is the best of the lot for flowers, which are semi-double
and have a particularly rich perfume. Only in its relative lack of hips is
it inferior. Scabrosa is extra-vigorous and everything about it is large -
flowers (which are magenta), leaves and hips.
Apart from these, there are a number of roses that are related to Rosa
rugosa but do not look anything like it. This, no doubt, is due to the
sterility of most of its hybrids. But there is one notable exception, a rose
now named Rosa kordesii. This has a remarkable history since it virtually
amounts to the production, in cultivation, of an entirely new species.
German breeder Wilhelm Kordes was attempting to raise seedlings from a rose
named Max Graff, which is a hybrid between Rosa rugosa and the vigorous,
climbing species R. wichuraiana. For a long time he failed to get any
fertile seed but, eventually, he produced two hips from which he managed to
raise two seedlings.
One of these proved to have double the usual number of chromosomes and, on
that account, to be fertile. This was the plant that was named R. kordesii,
and Kordes has used it to produce a number of new roses, all of which, I
think, are climbers.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Gardening: When you need an expert . . . - Robin Lane Fox
knows where to turn if his plants have fire-blight or Black Spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AUTUMN, leaves are suppose to fall romantically: this year, some of mine
have made a premature exit.
Old-fashioned roses took their clothes off in July; hostas have turned to
rags; some of the sorbus are wearing see-through and a particular type of
malus has gone topless for most of the year.
I know how to handle a ragged hosta: reach for the slug bait, where the
pet-friendly Growing Success is my No 1 choice. The other problems are more
difficult. They all involve diseases and, here, I know very few of the
answers. So do the experts, but sometimes they know one which we do not.
This week there has been one place to find an expert: the Royal
Horticultural Society's Great Autumn Show. It is a gentle mixture of
blood-red dahlias, blue autumn gentians with Scottish names and a heavy
emphasis on fruit.
This show is much less crowded than Chelsea, but it shows you all the things
which Chelsea is too early to permit. There are experts everywhere, experts
at visiting flower shows, experts at finding beige suits, experts at finding
things to do now that the children have grown up and a president who is
expert at making speeches of welcome which have very little to do with the
art of the gardening. If you mix with the rose-petal hats, you will soon
find the expert you want.
By the bi-coloured collarette dahlias I met the redoubtable Mrs Robinson and
settled my rose's treatment. Mrs Robinson has been a guiding spirit of the
great garden at Hyde Hall in Essex. Its roses are famous; it has the Arthur
Hellyer seal of special approval and the trust which now runs it is making
it safe for future public visitors.
Since the 1950s it is the creation of the Robinson family on one of
Britain's less favoured hills: Mrs Robinson is no ordinary Essex girl. Now
in the autumn of life, she knows how to make a rose bush happy: what should
we do with our naked old-fashioned roses which are plainly suffering from
the awful Black Spot?
Mrs Robinson recommends a double attack. When the first leaves appear early
in the year, spray them with diluted Nimrod T; try to spray fortnightly on
any new leaves which appear; at the same time water freely, preferably by
using a stretch of the newish dribble hosepipe, the type with leaky holes
which can be laid along a flowerbed.
The hosepipe is certainly a good idea for those of you who have a source of
water near. We have almost all forgotten the very dry spring, but it is
probably the reason why Black Spot and leaf drop were so serious so early in
rose gardens on less favoured soil.
What about denuded trees? Among the bigger nurseries, none is better than
Notcutts at showing something seasonal among trees and tall shrubs to the
best effect. Last week, their display of white and red berries on Sorbus
trees was heavenly: Charles Notcutt, one of its presiding geniuses, was
ready with all the answers. Your malus here are all very charming, I
confessed to him, but I was told to grow grey-leaved Malus Torringoides five
years ago and this wretched tree has lost its leaves every year in June.
Dump it, he answered, hitting the floor with his walking-stick: grow Red
Sentinel instead.
The family of Malus includes the crab apples and, apparently, my crab has
caught scab. Red Sentinel is much more resistant and the Notcutt view is
that the birds leave the red fruits on its sweeping branches until late in
the season. Otherwise, he suggests, grow Golden Hornet instead.
I wondered if, perhaps, they were not, well, a little too obvious? Not to
Notcutt: if they are so well known, it is simply that they are the best and
that is why most people plant them. The results are in Notcutt's favour.
What about that problematic Sorbus, Joseph Rock? From time to time I mention
fire-blight here and its special attraction for this lovely small tree,
previously one of my favourites in any list. Fire-blight began in the
south-west and readers as far north as Scotland have been writing to ask if
it is likely to hit them too and, if so, what should they do about older
trees?
The Notcutt view is that fire-blight is swirling in the atmosphere just
about everywhere (I wondered if it was present in some of the rose-petalled
hats) and that every garden is at risk to it. New plantings should therefore
avoid Joseph Rock: personally, he likes the red-berried Sorbus Matsudama
instead. Old plantings with existing Joseph Rocks need to be very careful
not to prune or damage them during the autumn or winter when the blight will
enter through scars. Nobody will be so tough as to pull up good old trees
but if one starts to die back, show no mercy. Chop the lot before they
infect roses and malus in the vicinity.
If this disease is all too much for you, why not sink your teeth into a
Continental strawberry instead? The king of new strawberries is Ken Muir of
Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. This year, he is marketing a new French number called
Maras des Bois which combines the lushness of a garden strawberry with the
subtlety of the small alpine variety from the woods.
The publicity did say that it would fruit in late spring, summer and autumn,
but Ken Muir seemed more cautious: de-fruit it early in the first year and
allow only one crop in the first two. Late cropping does happen, but wasps
love it: duly chastened, I sampled a Maras des Bois which is best tasted
when it has turned a dark red. I thought it an interesting bit of both, as
the marketing once called British Biscuit in America.
If you do not like this French little fantasy, you can always leave it out
for nearby French partridges: a French evening snack for my unannounced
visitors who have, incidentally, returned at full strength after doing their
best to destabilise the entire Anglo-French system before this weekend.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Fishing: A bite in the beck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESPONSE to my offer to provide trout for supper was, I thought, short
on trust and long on scepticism. Their expressions seemed to say: 'We've
heard that one before. Get the chops out of the freezer.' But I was quietly
confident, eager to assume the role of the hunter.
It was an old-fashioned Lake District day. Rain poured from an implacable
slate sky. The fell tops were invisible, the lower slopes streaked with
silver torrents. Drainpipes gushed; sheep, trees, and holidaymakers dripped
mournfully.
At such times you can forget the elegances of fly fishing. You need worms,
and plenty of them, in a box that will fit into the pocket of a sound,
waterproof coat. The other requirements are wellington boots, a packet of
hooks, some weights, a 10ft rod with a fixed spool reel, a bag for the fish,
and a sturdy indifference to the elements.
The trout of these lakeland becks are at the sharp end of life's struggle.
Little food comes their way in the turbulent pools; what there is must be
grabbed at once or lost for ever. A spate is their time of plenty as worms,
beetles, slugs and caterpillars are washed their way. Appetites are keen and
reflexes quick.
The technique is simplicity itself. The angler crouches beside the pool and
lobs the weighted worm into it, seeking out the eddies and holes behind
rocks. The line is held between the fingers and the reaction to the jab-jab
of the bite must be instant (otherwise, it will be found that the worm has
been filched or it and the hook swallowed).
Once a trout has been hooked, it must be transferred from its own sphere to
the terrestrial one as soon as possible. Forget about playing it and do not
encumber yourself with a net. Simply swing it out of the water over the
land; then seize it, unhook it, and either knock it on the head or return
it.
The technique is simple, but that is not to say it is easy. There are times
when the fish will not bite at all, and others when they will bite
everything except the portion of the worm containing the hook.
Most vexing of all is the amazing facility of these trout for wriggling free
of the hook mid-way through the swing from water to land. Hurling yourself
on your knees and clutching with bare hands at a slimy escapee is
undignified and usually fruitless.
This beck fishing is also physically taxing for those accustomed to
meandering southern chalk-streams. It involves much scrambling over
devilishly slippery rocks, and slithering up and down spongy, sodden banks
of moss. Sooner or later, you will slide or step into a pool deeper than
your boots, and wet feet will be added to other discomforts.
In such circumstances, self-control is lost easily. I remember watching a
brother fishing the best pool on this particular lakeland stream. He had
insisted, against all advice, on using a soft-tipped fly rod and, as a
result, lost each of the six trout he hooked. For a moment, I feared he was
about to stamp on the offending implement, until - with a visible effort -
he got a grip on himself.
I have had my share of such nightmares but was favoured on this recent
excursion with a tolerable proportion of success amid the usual blunders and
failures. The beck - it runs down not far from Ambleside, but I will give no
further clue as to its location - was in perfect order. In the first decent
pool, I took two nice fish. One was a full 6oz, a good specimen in this
Lilliputian world. In the next pool I lost two, thanks to a pestilential
overhanging branch which inhibited the landward swing.
Thus was the pattern of the morning established until, having forged my way
up two miles of valley, I found it wasn't morning any more. I was troubled
briefly by the recollection that I had promised to be back for lunch. But I
reminded myself that the chief duty of the hunter is to provide for his
dependents, rather than to observe bourgeois conventions such as mealtimes.
I arrived back late in the afternoon with 10 trout of edible size, having
put back as many more. In the event, the children and their mothers turned
up their ill-educated noses at the hunter's spoils, which I shared with
another brother.
Thirty years ago, when I first fished the beck, I was told by an old
Ambleside angler that its trout were the sweetest-tasting in the whole of
the Lake District. I am happy to report that they have lost nothing of that.

FT  19 SEP 92 / How To Spend It: So you want to be a paperback writer? -
Poplar fiction writers need a congenial work environment free of
disctraction, especially if they are knocking out a private eye novel that
has a protagonist - Harriet Costley - who is tracking a lost Mantegna and
eats strawberry ice cream for love food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL

<TEXT>
BOOK PUBLISHERS are anguished and despondent, just like everyone else. Yet
it cannot last indefinitely. At some point this side of the millennium there
ought to be a hiccup of recovery, a tiny burp of growth, which would-be
novelists like me can take advantage of.
Not that I want to be Patrick White, or even Hanif Kureishi. My aim is
strikingly modest: to write a thriller, set in London and starring a female
PI (private investigator), that someone will want to publish and others will
want to read.
Easy it is not. I only write at weekends. I have problems with minor
characters and problems of credibility. The mise en scene is blurred. I have
trouble depicting nastiness. I sometimes wonder if I am too nice and
sheltered - a good word is vacuous - to even be attempting it.
But on I bravely plod. I believe I am halfway through. And at least I have a
protagonist - sexy Harriet Costley - who bears not a flicker of resemblance
to the current brood of sweaty, boiled-knuckled, post-feminist female
investigators with whom publishers are enamoured. Harriet is investigating
the theft of a Mantegna drawing. Somehow the trail leads her into
ultra-right politics. She is intelligent and manipulative. She ought to be
in the movies.
I am sure I am not alone in my weekend endeavours - that there are
numberless beavering souls trying to break into the ranks of paperback
writers (or paperback righters, in the case of private-eye fiction, where
wrongs are righted, evil thwarted).
Perhaps you are thinking of trying it. If so, you will rapidly discover that
what a fiction writer needs most is a congenial environment free of
distraction. You need absolute quiet, because you must concentrate
absolutely. A few toys help. Here are eight things that will help create an
ideal work environment, or fiddle away the hours when creativity flags:
1) A table and chair. For some reason, I prefer working at a table to
working at a desk. But it has to be a large one. A PI novel needs plenty of
research. At present I use the dining table, but I am saving up for one of
the smart and chic tables available at the Aero showroom at 96 Westbourne
Grove, London W2 5RT. Aero produces an excellent range of modern furniture,
including shelving and lighting. The table I like most is called the Drennan
rectangular: cast aluminium base, glass top, designed by Robert Drennan -
Pounds 740. There is also a round version at Pounds 590.
2) A good supply of pens. I am not a home computer bore. I usually write in
longhand. I will probably buy a PC when I come to the first re-write, but
for now I am using pens. There are times, when writing fiction, when the
only thing you can do to chase away the blues is reach for a different pen.
Recently I visited The Pen Shop at 199 Regent St, London W1, which stocks
about 2,000 different pens and has demure and helpful staff. Normally I use
cheap pens. If I had the money I would buy the Waterman Man 100, which costs
Pounds 190. As it happens, the most expensive pen in the shop, at Pounds
5,000, is a solid gold version of the Man 100. There are other branches of
The Pen Shop in Leeds, Glasgow, Sheffield, Manchester and Newcastle.
3) A pot of artificial flowers to remind oneself, constantly, that nothing
is what it seems, not in politics, philosophy, business or fiction. I like
artificial flowers. I like a lot of things - patterned carpets, spotlights,
brightly coloured wallpaper - that the snooties abominate; no wonder their
homes are identically ruched and dull. You can buy artificial flowers
practically anywhere.
I bought some this week, at Felton's, near St Paul's Cathedral - sprays of
cream roses, you could hardly tell the difference. Someone who can tell the
difference is my assistant, Miss Lee, an unreconstructed Thatcherite.
Thatcherites like dried flowers artistically arranged in baskets and believe
that Agatha Christie is an under-rated writer.
4) Portable air conditioner. A nice-looking mobile air conditioner is the
Carrier Holiday 1 (the company's founder, Dr Willis Carrier, is the man
credited with inventing air conditioning, 90 years ago). The Holiday 1 plugs
into a standard power point and provides de-humidified hot or cold air
instantly. It is mounted on castors and is reckoned to be quiet enough to
use in a bedroom.
Like any proper refrigerated air conditioner, the Holiday 1 needs an exhaust
tube, which can be run (vented) through a porthole fitted into a window pane
or wall, up a chimney, through a partition, or through a slightly open
window.
It costs Pounds 949 plus VAT from the Air Improvement Centre in Victoria (23
Denbigh St, London SW1). Its director, the deeply-informed Valerie Taplin,
is almost as swishy as PI Harriet Costley. The centre supplies a wide range
of products, not just air conditioners but air purifiers, humidifiers and
de-humidifiers.
5) Ice-cream machine. When you're running hot, air conditioning alone may
not cool you down. Some weeks ago I spent an adventurous Pounds 250 on a
Gaggia Gelatiera. It is a professional's machine - not one of those
limp-wristed jobs you stick in the freezer, that seem to take forever - but
a free-standing pro job that makes unimproveable ice-cream and sorbet
(sherbert, to Americans), starting from scratch, in about 30 minutes. For
love food, Harriet Costley is fond of knocking up strawberry or date ice
cream in her Notting Hill kitchen. Cute, non?
6) Coffee machine. You cannot write fiction without putting in the hours. It
takes hundreds of hours of practice. Sometimes you need to rouse yourself. I
drink coffee. There are numerous machines to chose from; I happen to like
Gaggia's. Harriet Costley drinks gallons of espresso.
7) A blind to shut the world out. I find John Lewis a vexingly eccentric
store. It won't do this, it won't do the other. But I like its blinds,
especially the modern ones in Hockneyesque stripes and colours; and it is
happy to measure and fit them.
8) Tennis club membership. Just as fiction writers must entomb themselves
for hours at a stretch so as to plumb the creative depths, so, periodically,
they must escape outside for air. A lot of hacks play tennis. So do various
novelists. Like me, Martin Amis is a member of the Paddington Sports Club in
London's Maida Vale, which is friendly, well managed and has plenty of
courts.
A tennis membership costs Pounds 100 to join and Pounds 255 annually. Tennis
and squash combined: Pounds 100 plus Pounds 300. They also have bowls. If
Amis played tennis like me, he would be a happier little fellow. If I could
write like Amis, I don't suppose I'd be here.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Fashion: Women who boldly tread beyond the sex barrier - A
woman in a man's suit? Ugh. But a woman in suiting cut to fit the female
form  ... well that's another matter, as Avril Groom discovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY stride boldly through social history in their trousers, toppers and
boots. They are the great cross-dressers, women who have become famous for,
among other things, recognising the indisputable fashion paradox that
dressing like a man can make you more of a woman.
They are also the role-models for this autumn's definitive fashion image. As
lifestyle models they are more of a problem. Some go rather too far down the
path to androgyny, if the history of Vita Sackville-West is anything to go
by. But cross-dressing is absolutely no indication of sexual proclivity and,
as women such as Marlene Dietrich, Sarah Bernhardt and even Shakespeare's
Rosalind found, it adds a heady amount of feminine allure.
Donning male-inspired garb is, of course, nothing new. In the 15th century
Joan of Arc wore armour which, although her captors complained of her
masculine dress, appears to have been moulded to her female figure. And, in
essence, the rules have not changed since. A woman in a man's suit risks
looking unattractively butch. A woman in men's suiting, cut to follow and
flatter the feminine form, is another matter altogether.
The secret of success is the witty juxtaposition of items traditionally
considered either a male or female preserve. Wearing pinstripe pants with
lace-up brogues is far too literal; this is the first time for ages that
trousers with high heels have been stylistically correct - aficionados
choose a slightly chunky heel and a small platform.
Likewise, why wear a shirt and tie with your grey double-breasted jacket
when you could surprise the chaps with a lace-trimmed 'body'? Hair is
another area for attention, the bigger, softer or more carelessly piled-up
the better. But sport an Eton crop with pinstripes and your intentions could
be misinterpreted. Make-up, too, is a factor - remember Liza Minelli's dark
eyes peering from under her bowler in Cabaret. And cross-dressing need not
even include trousers. The most obvious way to feminise a mannish jacket is
with the new long skirt, provided it is cut sinuously tight across the hips
and lengthily split for ease of movement and for a glimpse of legs that,
after years of the short skirt, most women no longer feel they need to hide.
How these juxtapositions work psychologically is explained by fashion
historian Colin McDowell, whose new book Hats published next month (Pounds
24.95, Thames and Hudson) contains several examples of women highly
glamourised by wearing men's hats. 'Traditional men's dress, and especially
hats, are still symbols of authority and dignity in our society,' he says.
'Add that to the feminine glamour which is the basis of women's sex appeal
and you pack a very powerful punch. Men's styles are usually covered up
which, on a woman, is extremely sexy. Conversely, men in women's clothes
lose their authority and become figures of fun.'
It is tempting to ascribe serious sociological motives to 1992's rash of
cross-dressing. Perhaps women wish to celebrate their increasing power in
the professions by wresting the clothes from men's backs as well as the jobs
from their grasp. The truth, though, is more prosaic, just another turn in
the fashion cycle.
After several years of colourful near-vulgarity and clanking gilt
accessories, spawned by the conspicuously consuming Eighties, what could
look more perfectly new for the restrained Nineties than a plain, grey John
Major-style suit? Inevitably, this is the style which designers and stores
have most taken to heart. Apart from racy Marks and Spencer pinstripes, you
can find this look at every level, from Kookai's budget hairline stripe
polyester/viscose trouser suit at Pounds 108.99 and Alexon's birdseye check
wool at Pounds 198.95, to Jaeger's sleekly-cut grey wool twill suit at
Pounds 378 and Ralph Lauren's feminine, wide-trousered style at Pounds 960.
But there are many other ways to play the man's lady. Designers have let
their fantasies run riot on male stereotypes from the country squire to the
motorcycle courier. Take your pick but bear in mind that the final effect
should always be that of a strictly female male. And if anyone tells you to
walk like a man, ignore them.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Bargains from the belly-up - Art Fairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the worst summer in the memory of even the oldest antique dealer the
art trade is attempting to find new hope in the autumn fairs which are now
underway. Chelsea is the place to buy a bargain this weekend. The Old Town
Hall is taken over by the Chelsea Antiques Fair which, in its 72nd
successive year, is the oldest in the land, while along the road at Chelsea
Harbour interior decorators, who have suffered badly in the last two years,
are huddled together for support.
But the real test comes next week when the first major specialist fair of
the new season, the 20th Century British Art, fills the Royal College of Art
for five days. This is the sector which has been hit hardest by the
recession. Six of last year's 52 exhibitors have since stopped trading,
including such major names as David Messum and Trinity. And although their
places have been filled by the likes of Agnews and Berkeley Square Gallery,
there will be a feeling of apprehension when the doors open on Wednesday.
Colin Phipps of Austin Desmnond &amp; Phipps, who is chairing the Fair's
advisory committee, reckons that prices will be marked down around 25 per
cent on a year ago. And then the haggling starts. You could say that now is
an excellent time to buy that Matthew Smith, or the Tristan Hillier that has
been quite out of your price range since the speculative boom of the late
1980s. But it is possible that prices could go even lower if more major
dealers go belly-up, forced by the short sighted banks to put their stock on
a weak market via the auction houses.
Even so serious collectors now have the pick of an attractive crop of
pictures, not only from distress sales but because dealers are now being
forced to dispose of the works that they previously held back for their
private delectation. It could be the best fair for buyers for some time.
There are sales taking place. Phipps own gallery has disposed of five
paintings by Ivan Hitchens in recent months. Three years ago they would each
have averaged Pounds 30,000; now they were going for around Pounds 18,000.
It is interesting where they came from. One was from stock, one was acquired
at auction (or rather after the auction for a bargain price), one came from
another dealer, and two came from clients desperate to cash in their art.
Strangely, while the impulse buyer, prepared to pay up to Pounds 1,000 for a
painting, has disappeared, and the big punter splashing out over Pounds
50,000 is very rare, the old fashioned art addicts are still happy to spend
around Pounds 20,000 acquiring the painting that they have always lusted
after. And these tend to be the more challenging works: it is the simple
decorative paintings that have become virtually unsaleable.
The 20th Century Fair usually does well. Highlights this year include
sculpture, priced from Pounds 300 to Pounds 5,000 on Gillian Jason's stand;
John Bellany has created prints for the first time, on offer at Berkeley
Square; Julian Hartnoll is showing the late John Bratby; while Michael
Parkin and Agnews are both selling Sickert. Most of the major post-1900
British artists will be available, priced at 1986 values.

DAUGHTERS OF THE HOUSE by Michele Roberts Virago Pounds 14.99, 172 pages
'THE WAR was a sort of bookmark which divided the pages of history':
Daughters of the House is full of solid imagery like that. Each of the 50
chapters is named after an object: 'The Sofa', 'The Red Suitcase', 'The
Fish-kettle', 'The Chandelier', 'The Green Scarf'. Its descriptions are so
vivid that you know the way around house and village; you know colours,
textures, tastes and smells, the sensuous surface of everything, and the
wider atmospheric effects of weather and light. Michele Roberts has been
compared with Colette and in minuteness and immediacy, yes, there is
something in it; also in the fact that the setting of this novel recalls
Colette's world: nature in general and French country life in particular.
So far so good, and very good this side of it is. In a prosperous farmer's
household in Normandy an odd mixture of relatives and relationships makes
for tensions, disloyalties, passionate affections and lies. Across the
fields is the village with its peasants and shopkeepers and its sinister,
time-serving cure. Leonie and Therese are first cousins, Leonie half-English
but ending up the virtual owner of house and farm because Therese enters the
convent of an enclosed order, thus vanishing for 20 years. When she suddenly
comes out it is clear that something must give way, since Leonie is
passionately attached to her way of life and possessions and if a claimant
as good as Therese turns up her claim to them seems doubtful.
The story is not just, or even mainly, about possessions, though: more about
the unravelling of ancient secrets, about rancour left over from the years
of German occupation and the jealous scratching of personalities across
nearly 40 years. As the novel is short and the plot labyrinthine, there
seems rather too much crammed in, with the final surprise abrupt and a good
deal of the rest unexplained or inexplicable. Until quite far into it, who
is exactly who is hard to be sure of, or what is fact and what conjecture,
accusation or subjective judgment - things being understandably bizarre and
bitter in the post-war years of an occupied country.
What is best about the novel is its snappy, highly readable style and its
moments of acute insight, of strange, original intuitions, as when Leonie,
crossing the Channel, lives through the transformation of England into
France in terms of language. Or when the two girls, so closely linked yet so
inimical, play out their fantasies in bloodthirsty games of medicine or
martyrdom. The pointilliste technique that looks so simple (very short
sentences, minimal complexity of syntax, jabs of colour, cumulative small
effects) lends itself particularly well to these powerful thrusts of the
irrational.
On straightforward plotting and narrative it is less effective, condensed to
the point of confusion and with a crime-story technique of cues, hints and
red herrings that often leaves one puzzled rather than curious. What
happened in the cellar when Antoinette lost her show? What happens to
Therese in the final fire? Above all, what are those visions about demonic
possession or celestial visitation: hysteria or holiness, both or neither?
The overlap between dream and reality, supposition and fantasy and the facts
of the case, is often too great. If the physical world is perfectly
portrayed, every leaf in place, every scent recognisable, the everyday world
of actual happenings and credible characters is much more weakly handled.
Despite this it makes an attractive appearance in the Booker short list, an
accessible and intelligent good read where good reads are sometimes scarce.
A final point which adds piquancy is that Therese's surname is Martin, which
was that of St Therese of Lisieux, the Carmelite nun whose autobiography has
gone round the world since she died nearly a century ago, aged 24. Michele
Roberts never reveals this, as it were, double billing, though there are
hints for those in the know - the jacket with its portrait of St Therese,
the acknowledgement to her Histoire d'une Ame in the Author's Note, the fact
that the fictional Therese has written her own autobiography with the same
title, and that her father has a habit of calling her his 'little flower'.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Books: Portrait of the Revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLACE OF GREATER SAFETY by Hilary Mantel Viking Pounds 15.99, 871 pages
IT IS remarkable and perhaps telling that there have been so few successful
novels set during the French Revolution. One thinks of Dickens' Tale of Two
Cities, Anatole France's Les Dieux ont soif and Balzac's The Chouans, but
none of these would be widely accepted as great. There are even fewer works
of fiction which have the revolution as their central theme, or have
characters based on real historical figures.
It is equally curious that the narrative sweep of the revolution has
intimidated legions of historians and defeated most. There are plenty of dry
and rather unforgiving tomes; there are some entertainingly bizarre books by
Richard Cobb. Citizens was exceedingly well-timed for the revolution's
bicentenary, but was actively disliked by most historians, doubtless because
in his successful pursuit of literary and popular appeal Simon Shama bent a
few too many professional rules.
Such historical and literary difficulties have exercised generations of
scholars and writers, so when Hilary Mantel's thumper finally went to press
after 18 years' gestation, it was understandably accorded more than usual
interest. Mantel has enjoyed the privilege of explaining ahead of
publication what she is trying to achieve. To her the revolution is that
dangerous thing, a passion, almost an obsession. She aims above all to show
the private side of its central actors, to create around them a book one can
think and live inside. What were Danton, Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins,
their wives and mistresses too, like when the front door closed and the
public faces fell away?
Mantel is either confused or unsure how she wants to be judged. She might
make a fine historian. Her eye for facts and anecdote is keen, her research
certainly not lacking. Hers is unashamedly a Parisian revolution, and in
parts it is adeptly, impressively painted. But she wants to be a novelist,
so it is fair to address the writing as well as the endeavour.
Two hundred pages of our heroes' imagined early lives takes some reading,
and frankly not much happens; another 130 pages before Mantel has played out
the tame conceit that Desmoulins was bisexual - until then he is pretty
fevered anyway, so his confession comes as equal relief to the reader. The
characters are consistent, but their portrayal is not remarkably original.
Danton is done best, Desmoulins worst. Robespierre reminds one of nothing so
much as the austere perfectionist in Wajda's film Danton.
Could the action not have been hurried along towards the amazing period when
our actors briefly contested and won arbitrary and absolute power? And
therein lies the book's main weakness. This characterisation, background and
all, only has meaning, hence interest, because there were astonishing
events. Dispense with that and the actors have no stage, their personalities
pale. So we are offered a bad, long novel with a better history tacked on.
A simpler test is whether the book is a good read. Mantel's style is too
quixotic to pass. Dialogue is a clumsy mix of modern and dated idioms which
occasionally lapse into the ridiculous. Tenses are juggled anarchically,
perhaps deliberately to signal temporal confusion as a parallel of political
and moral chaos. Mostly, it jars.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Drawn to the age of Bruegel - Patricia Morison visits
the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINTS AND drawings were Frits Lugt's greatest love, which explains why his
name is not widely known beyond the circle of collectors. And yet it
deserves to be, because Lugt (1884-1970), a self-taught Dutch art-historian,
art-dealer, and connoisseur, created one of this century's major collections
of Western art.
Although Lugt's interests were wide he is associated above all with his
scholarly labours on Netherlandish artists between the 15th and 17th
centuries. He built up an enormous collection of drawings and prints which
in the Second World War was kept out of German hands by the simple expedient
of mailing it in 60 registered envelopes to Switzerland.
In 1947, Lugt installed his growing collection in the Fondation Custodia in
Paris. One hundred drawings have been lent to Amsterdam for Drawings From
the Age of Bruegel in the Rijksmuseum Print Room until November 8. It marks
the publication of Netherlandish and German Drawings of the XVth and XVIth
Centuries of the Frits Lugt Collection (Dfl. 600), an exceedingly handsome
catalogue by Karel G. Boon, former director of the Rijksmuseum.
In 1884 the Print Room was the scene of Lugt's triumph when, aged ten, he
overcame the disapproval of 'ageist' curators and was admitted to the study
room. One wonders how he might have reacted to the redecorated Print Room,
snazzy cherry-red display cases reminiscent of Dutch modernist interiors of
the 1920s.
Drawings From the Age of Bruegel is like a rapid tour of Netherlandish
workshops between 1520 and 1620, with a diversion via Lichtenstein to south
Germany and Bohemia. We find masters producing drawings for a striking
diversity of purposes. Drawings for stained glass, tapestries and
engravings, take their place beside careful studies of nature (a particular
treasure is an album of coloured miniatures by Jacques de Gheyn II), very
early life-studies of the nude, and landscapes - with and without happy
peasants.
Two outstanding portraits are a reminder that the Habsburg presence meant
fat pickings for artists. After being driven out of Denmark Christian II
went to live in style with his wife's Habsburg in-laws in Brussels where he
sat to Jan Gossaert. Perhaps Gossaert's florid pen drawing was intended to
provoke a commission for a painting? None survives although we can be
grateful for Gossaert's Hampton Court portrait of the king's three
enchantingly grave children
Lucas van Leyden's drawing of the Maximilian I was an opportunist move to
profit from the market for commemorative prints of the late emperor. He
based it closely on Durer's woodcut but made it more opulent and Italianate.
But in so doing the great master's proportions went seriously wrong so that
Maximilian, represented as if showing himself from a palace window, looks
positively deformed.
In 1520 Durer himself was in Antwerp, where he was impressed by the high
standard of living achieved by van Leyden and other successful colleagues.
He also cast admiring eyes on Dutch womanhood. A large, freely-drawn
portrait shows a young Antwerp widow of 38 who the artist had first glimpsed
in a religious procession, dressed in the white robes of a beguine. Durer
shows her with eyes downcast demurely enough but smiling ripely. It makes
one wonder whether he did really intend her as model for the Virgin Mary
reading.
As religion's crueller face showed itself in the Netherlands, there were
pressing reasons why many artists left their divided homeland. Among the
travellers were Roeland Savary and Pieter Stevens. Forest scenes in Bohemia
by the former, views of Prague from across the Danube by the latter, are
striking examples of Dutch artists exporting their famed landscape
speciality. Goltzius's view of the country near Haarlem and Joos de Momper's
winter scene, point the way to Dutch achievement in the next century.
Italy, of course, was the prime attraction for Netherlandish artists. Some
never went home, like the Bril brothers and Jan Van der Straet. Stradanus,
as erudite humanists renamed him, did well for himself. For Duke Cosimo I he
designed 20 different hunting scenarios, many quite absurd. A typically
unsporting scene in the Lugt collection shows a dozen would-be Papagenos
catching starlings with string.
While Protestant propaganda may not make particularly attractive art, it is
a striking feature of the exhibition. Old Testament imagery appealed to
Calvinist patrons and alike to artists who saw themselves as committed, like
the preachers and fighters, to leading the people of Israel from under the
heel of the oppressor.
Scenes like Goltzius's Idolatry of Solomon and Swanenbergh 's Josiah
Stamping out idolatry, in which huge fragments of falling statuary tumble
onto the priests of Baal, were the counterpart to the real-life desecration
of churches and their images. The she-bear devouring the children who mocked
Elisha could be read as an image of God's coming vengeance on Catholics. The
artist in question, Hans Bol, twice fled from the sack of his home by
Spanish armies: his troubles were by no means untypical.
Some artists even tried a novel Calvinist iconography. Christus Vera Lux by
the Leyden artist Lucas Cornelisz, shows a huge congregation kneeling in
front of Christ while the pope and his cardinals exit to hell. Van Mander
records that in Henry VIII's reign Cornelisz found a good market for his
paintings in England where he went to work as a cook.
A Leyden contemporary, Aert Claesz, may even have used sex to sell the
message. His scene of a picnic a trois, in which a bewildered lady is
flanked by two nobleman pawing at her breasts, could conceivably symbolise
the bewilderment of the Netherlands, torn between two faiths.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: The quiet conductor - Andrew Clark talks to Kurt
Sanderling on his 80th birthday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW OF the world's senior conductors have escaped the cult of personality as
successfully as Kurt Sanderling, who today celebrates his 80th birthday.
Apprenticed at the Berlin City Opera in 1931, Sanderling fled to the Soviet
Union when the Nazis came to power and eventually became Evgeny Mravinsky's
deputy at the Leningrad Philharmonic. When he returned to Germany in 1960,
it was to the communist East - as music director of the fledgling Berlin
Symphony Orchestra. He was 60 before he made his name in the West, standing
in at short notice for Klemperer in London in 1972.
Sanderling remains an underrated musician, partly because he has never
followed fashion or sought popularity, but also because he is difficult to
package commercially for modern audiences: there is no unnecessary gesturing
in his platform manner, he is publicity-shy and dislikes recording. And yet
he commands the respect of the world's leading orchestras, who respond to
his musical authority, his quiet charm and integrity. As German conductors
go, Sanderling is unusual: he is equally at home in the German and Russian
Romantic repertoire, having the structural grasp of his native tradition,
combined with the emotional warmth of the Russian school.
Anyone who makes their way to Sanderling's modest home in the East Berlin
suburb of Pankow gets a courteous welcome. His living room is full of
double-basses belonging to his second wife Barbara, a former orchestral
player who now teaches. Sanderling, looks fit and speaks in gentle, measured
tones. Why, as a Jewish refugee in the mid-1930s, had he chosen Russia and
not the West? 'There was no choice - you went where you could get bread and
work. I had an offer from Bodanzky at the Met, but I couldn't get a US entry
permit. I went to Moscow because an uncle there got me an immigration visa.'
After learning a wide repertoire in Moscow and the provinces, Sanderling was
invited to conduct the Leningrad Philharmonic at its wartime base in
Siberia. He stayed with the orchestra nearly 20 years. 'When I arrived my
knowledge of Russian music was extremely limited. That changed quickly. I
got to know some fine music that was hardly played in the West - Arensky,
Taneiev, Rimsky-Korsakov's late works. I wanted to conduct them. I was the
first to conduct all three Rakhmaninov symphonies.
'Nothing was forbidden, except for Richard Strauss during the war. I
conducted Hindemith, Schoenberg and the German classics. But we had
obligations, often depending on the stupidity or wisdom of those in power.
One year La Valse would be bourgeois decadent, two years later it might be
acceptable. There was no point fighting it. The public also had its taste -
we did Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony several times a year, which is why I no
longer have any desire to conduct it.'
Sanderling's Soviet exile left an indelible stamp. It took him away from the
sentimental German school of Tchaikovsky interpretation championed by
Nikisch and Furtwangler, nurtured a respect for foreign cultures which his
chauvinist German upbringing had denied him, and led to friendship with
Shostakovich. 'From the time he wrote his Fifth Symphony, it was as if he
was telling our common life-story. His whole music was a protest against the
life he was forced to live, and that was to a large extent my own life.
No-one escaped the Stalinist terror, the awareness that people 'disappeared'
without being able to talk about it. Russia saved my life and gave me my
career, but my feelings are ambivalent.'
Sanderling's reputation as a non-party leftist intellectual was in his
favour when he applied to return to Germany. There was no question of
settling in the West: it was difficult enough getting permission to leave
Leningrad. 'The Berlin I returned to was totally different to the city I had
left, but I wanted a spot I could call my homeland. That doesn't mean to say
I found East Germany beautiful and just, any more than the Weimar Republic
and Soviet Union had been.'
In his 17 years with the Berlin Symphony Orchestra he became known for his
qualities as an orchestral trainer and his wide musical sympathies. Today
his repertoire is deliberately small. He still conducts a handful of
Shostakovich symphonies - the Eighth is a favourite - and continues to
enthuse over Tchaikovsky's Fourth, which he believes is easily
misunderstood: 'It's a tragic symphony. The main theme of the finale is
based on a Ukrainian song about a lonely tree battered by the winds of fate
and finally trampled. If you treat it like a triumph, it sounds banal.'
In recent years he has been increasingly drawn to music with a positive
spirit, such as Bruckner, and is much in demand for Brahms - whose
symphonies he will conduct in a cycle with the Philharmonia next year in
London. His Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann are of the old school, with
doubled woodwinds and other changes in instrumentation which he believes
restore the 'chorale-like' balance of orchestral sound intended by early
romantic composers.
He loves the Sibelius symphonies, but says they demand a degree of
preparation that only a chief conductor has time to achieve. Of the Mahler
canon, he restricts himself to Das Lied von der Erde, the Fourth and Ninth
symphonies and Deryck Cooke's performing version of the Tenth. 'Mahler was
the hero of my dreams when I was young, but I can no longer believe him when
he's joyful - it's so obvious he's forcing himself. His nature is to grieve
for the world.'
His operatic work has been sparse - despite the fact that he started out in
the theatre, as a repetiteur in the Berlin company led by Bruno Walter. 'You
can't imagine how wonderful it was to conduct the Fidelio quartet, standing
next to the producer on stage while someone played the piano. The next time
it was the stage music in Act 2 of La boheme, and then something else.
That's how I learned to conduct.'

JESUS by AN Wilson Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15, 269 pages
AN WILSON'S biography of CS Lewis was a lovely book, abundant with the
contagious grace of its subject. And it may be that the enthusiasm of CS
Lewis for the stuff of Christianity - 'the very thing you like in poetry and
the romances, only this time it's true' - naturally conducts a biographer to
Jesus (as it did Humphrey Carpenter). The challenge of 'this time it's true'
is enough to tickle the interest of any investigative hack, the
opportunities to demythologise are legion; and to a biographer who is also a
novelist, the temptation to explore the play of personalities in the Gospels
must be almost irresistible.
But as Wilson fully admits, Jesus is wholly unsuitable for biography.
Despite the Dead Sea scrolls and sundry archaeological clarifications of
life in first century AD Palestine, little can be added to the well-known
corpus of sources for Jesus's life. The scrolls put detail on a claim made
over a century ago, by Ernest Renan, that Christianity was simply 'an Essene
sect that succeeded'; otherwise, nothing supplements the Gospels but
apocrypha, and of the making of apocrypha there is no end. The latest whimsy
 -Jesus the Man by Barbara Thiering (Doubleday Pounds 16.99) - is that Jesus
regained consciousness after his crucifixion and lived till 70 pottering
about in the company of the other evangelists until his retirement (with
second wife and family) to the South of France.
What value is to be fixed on those well-known primary sources, then?
Wilson's main problem is that neither John nor the Synoptic Gospels
accommodate his recognition of them as direct 'reportage' in some parts and
superb literary fabrications in others. He says that 'there are moments in
the New Testament where one has the sensation of having only just missed the
Presence' (without specifying); but equally he wants the Gospel writers to
be interpolators of entirely fictional devices, such as the suicide of
Judas. So when it comes to tricky points of New Testament exegesis, for
example the inconsistencies between the accounts of the trial of Jesus,
Wilson disowns all difficulty by asserting that none of the Gospel writers
knows 'anything about Jewish legal procedures'.
He snaps up what trifles he can (Jesus, it seems, was ignorant of the
dimensions of a fully-grown mustard tree), and tries to stay flinty when
describing the grief-steeped episodes of the Passion. But this is a
disorganised attempt at objectivity, from an author who is perfectly
sensible to the moral cogency of Jesus's teaching but suspicious both of its
foundations and of its conversion into the vaults and structures of the
Christian church. 'There is no historical task which so reveals a man's true
self as the writing of a life of Jesus': thus Albert Schweitzer, who tried
it.
Wilson's study carries the stigmata of one who is a renegade ordinand and
renegade scholar, and it is hard to see what sort of reader he is seeking to
satisfy. Practising Christians will be duly needled by his throwaway jabs in
their direction ('Few of the Christian churches have ever viewed the
teaching of Jesus with anything but contempt'); and New Testament pedants
will be irritated by his bold dabbling in exegesis and facile citations of
Professor So-and-So.
This is, frankly, the country of the blind, and I cannot salute AN Wilson as
its one-eyed king. His own natural tincture of scepticism ought to have
served him better: the problems presented by the supposedly 'historical'
evidence, which he outlines in his Preface and recalls throughout the main
text, do indeed prove insurmountable. So he, too, resorts to the same
speculation he derides in others. He suggests, on the feeblest of
philological reasonings, that the High Priest's servant aurally impaired in
the Garden of Gethsemane by Simon Peter was none other than a young St.
Paul. 'If I had the chance to return in time and meet Paul, I should take a
close look at his ears' - a comment which illustrates Wilson's accessible
but flippant style throughout. Then he hazards that the man seen on the road
to Emmaus was James, the brother of Jesus. To be fair, he glosses such
guesswork with 'I believe that', 'it would not be impossible to suppose',
etc., but no partisan of 'Gospel truth' is going to feel threatened by these
half-baked hypotheses.
If there are people hungry to know what can be known about the historical
Jesus, they would do as well to ignore this essay and stay with Humphrey
Carpenter's, which is cheaper and considerably more disciplined.

JUDY GARLAND by David Shipman Fourth Estate Pounds 17.99, 522 pages
ELDERLY Judy Garland fans - there still are quite a few of us around - find
their addiction excellently served by television. Her films frequently come
up at times like nine in the morning and two in the afternoon. Now that I
have learnt how to work our video, I tend to view them later in the evening
and they usually prove highly rewarding nostalgia. There is also - to
coincide with this massively comprehensive biography, Judy Garland by David
Shipman - a Judy season at the National Film Theatre lasting into October.
Seeing the films again, and then reading about the tantrums that surrounded
the making of them, offers a remarkable double-take. The peerless
professionalism of what is captured on screen (certainly in the ones for
MGM) seems to belie the image evoked by Shipman of a performer invariably
late if she turned up at all, terrified of the cameras before they started
rolling, capable of vicious verbal sniping at some of her closest colleagues
and best friends, and so chock-full of alcohol, barbiturates and other
assorted drugs that frequently shooting would cease while she was rushed off
to a nearby clinic to be nursed back into workable shape.
It is a frightening story, every bit as harrowing as the parallel one of
Marilyn Monroe. These two feminine movie-idols rarely met but closely
identified with each other. After Monroe's death Garland remembered Monroe
at a Hollywood party, following her from room to room, saying: 'I don't want
to get too far away from you. I'm scared.' Garland replied: 'We're all
scared. I'm scared too'.
By the time of Summer Stock (1950), the film Garland made towards the end of
her contract with MGM, with Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers in his pre-Bilko
days, she had a serious weight problem. The movie tried, with its
perfunctory plot about some actors putting on a musical in a barn, to revive
the girlish ingenue figure she had radiated in those early Andy Hardy family
movies when she was competing with the more sophisticated young women
surrounding Mickey Rooney, and also to recall her first great success as the
rainbow-orientated Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. And it all works
light-heartedly well, with Judy's 'Get Happy' sequence, the song composed
earlier by Harold Arlen, the high-spot of the picture.
Yet that had to be shot - after Garland had come out of hypnosis - three
months after the rest of the film. 'Her breath,' Shipman says, 'reeked of
paraldehyde'. The main shooting, according to Charles Walters, who directed
it, was a nightmare: 'God, she was a problem . . . She'd come storming in
and say 'Look, buddy, if you expect any acting out of me, forget it]''.
But her magic, when finally caught on screen, was such that her private
excesses were always forgiven; until the final straw, which came through her
vacillations over the movie of Annie Get Your Gun, and then walking out of
Royal Wedding in which she was to have performed with Fred Astaire. Her
behaviour then broke the studio's corporate back and she was finally out.
Garland made more movies after the firing, including the memorable A Star is
Born (which lost money first time around) for Warner Brothers, but they were
largely mediocre. Her main post-MGM career consisted of a series of
triumphant personal appearances, singing her heart out, live, over a range
of numbers with amazing variety of attack, in venues like Carnegie Hall, the
Hollywood Bowl and the London Palladium. The latter was her favourite stage:
she was always acclaimed by her loyal British following, the audience's
tears flowing as copiously as hers.
But just as she had become camera-shy in the studios, now she suffered from
stage-fright, and became increasingly unreliable as a live entertainer. At
first the precariousnesses of her performances became a negative asset,
audiences willing her to continue and cheering her at the end if she
succeeded in somehow getting through the show. But as she became more and
more incapable of delivering the goods, this asset soon dwindled to nothing.
Her weekly television show for CBS was a disaster. Yet, great trouper that
she was, her ability to bounce back, after spells in hospital, continued
almost until the end, with her undertaking taxing tours of Europe and
Australia when she was practically in a wheel-chair. She died in 1969 aged
47 and Dollars 4m dollars in debt.
The book is full of legendary names, all of whom at one time or another were
Garland's friends. Humphrey Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall summed her up in
these terms: 'She was a complicated woman of tremendous wit and intelligence
who had survived a distorted childhood and distorted marriages which left
their mark . . . It was hard for her to think beyond herself - it had been
that way too long'.
Shipman is an omniscient movie-historian and has researched the book
impeccably. He traces Garland's origins and her career as a child-performer.
She was born Virginia Gumm and before she was 10 she was out there as Baby
Gumm doing a song-and-dance act with her two older sisters. Their father
Frank was a local theatre manager who moved to the Los Angeles area. He was
secretly gay, like several of the men Garland would either have affairs
with, or would indeed marry, including her second husband, Vincente
Minnelli, the director of her smash-hit movie, Meet Me in Saint Louis.
Her most sustained marriage was her third, to Sidney Luft, Jewish and
decidedly straight, a rough, tough fixer and gambler who managed her affairs
in the post-MGM period, and by whom she had a daughter and a son. Garland
re-enacted her stormy relations with her formidable mother Ethel in her role
as mother to her own children, especially with her older daughter Liza, the
one by Minnelli.
That relationship was one from which Garland drew great strength both on
stage and off; but it was also one from which she felt a constant threat of
being superseded. No family has room for more than one mega-star. The
Liza-Judy conflict is only discreetly touched upon here. It will, I would
hazard, one day be the basis of a major Hollywood film. Nothing was ever
straightforward in Garland's life. Here it is in full, in a dispassionate
book that gives a shattering insight into the perils of stardom.

THE GREAT MELODY: A THEMATIC BIOGRAPHY OF EDMUND BURKE by Conor Cruise
O'Brien Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 22.50, 692 pages
CONOR Cruise O'Brien's book is worthy of Edmund Burke. Humane, passionate
and polemical in equal measure, it is more a vindication than a biography.
Yeats supplies not only the book's title, but also its theme and structure.
Burke's life and work is a 'great melody', a single, coherent crusade
against corruption, misrule and oppression, whether in George III's England
and America, Hastings' India, Mirabeau's France or Grattan's Ireland.
O'Brien is adamant that on all five fronts Burke was right. And not just
right, but consistent - consistently courageous, liberal, and influential.
The consistency of principle is hard to refute. 'I feel an insuperable
reluctance in giving my hand to destroy any established institution of
government, upon a theory, however plausible': those words, delivered on
Fox's India Bill, summarise Burke's stance in most of his controversies.
Circumstances is the key Burkean word: 'Circumstances . . . give in reality
to every political principle its distinguishing colour, and discriminating
effect. The circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme
beneficial or noxious to mankind.'
Circumstances precluded the abolition of the French nobility, and the
denigration of the Catholic Church by the Jacobins, every bit as much as
they forbade the taxation of the American colonists, enjoined religious
toleration, and required the impeachment of Warren Hastings.
O'Brien does well to stress that Burke was revered as much by 19th century
Liberals as by reactionaries then and since. More than anything, it was
because of his zeal in exposing and lambasting oppression and abuse of
power. To Burke, oppression was always a circumstance demanding reform, even
if circumstances permitted only of partial, piecemeal change.
'The happiness or misery of multitudes can never be a thing indifferent,' he
urged in one of his earliest tracts against the Catholic penal laws. Whether
it concerned the Irish Catholics, Marie-Antoinette, or the eunuchs of the
Begums of Oudh, tortured that Hastings might plunder their mistresses, once
Burke's emotional sympathy was engaged the torrent followed.
Gladstone, not Disraeli or his successors, is Burke's most credible and
creditable heir. The Grand Old Man read and re-read 'On Conciliation with
America' when grappling with Irish Home Rule. Government in Ireland could be
successful, he argued, after Burke, only if 'as in England, the law is felt
to be indigenous.' The Irish were manifestly capable of self-government, and
no time was riper for granting it than 1886. Parliament refused to follow
Gladstone as it had rejected Burke; it was wrong both times, to tragic
effect. Unsurprisingly, it is in relation to Ireland that O'Brien's
emotional insight deepest. He establishes fairly convincingly that Burke's
father, a Dublin solicitor, was a Catholic who conformed to the established
church in 1722 for fear of his livelihood - shortly after giving legal
advice to the hapless James Cotter who was judicially murdered for little
other than being a young, wealthy and extrovert Catholic. O'Brien has
Richard Burke's shame and bitterness concealed by a necessary and total
reticence (inherited by Edmund) continually obliging him to feign a
disinterested persona and hide his anguish about the plight of Irish
Catholics.
For all the conjecture, this seems entirely plausible. The 'Catholic layer'
helps explain not just the ferocity of Burke's reaction to the irreligion of
the French revolution, but a number of personal feuds and the contrast
between the extreme reserve he almost invariably exhibited when dealing with
Irish issues and the occasional impassioned outburst.
'I vow to God,' he told his Bristol electors, in his one public eruption,
justifying his support for the 1778 Act relaxing restrictions upon the
ownership of property by Catholics, 'I would sooner bring myself to put a
man to immediate death for opinions at once, than to fret him with a
feverish being, tainted with the jail-distemper of a contagious servitude,
to keep him above ground an animated mass of putrefaction, corrupted
himself, and corrupting all about him.'
Burke, we are told, divided his world into angels and devils. So does
O'Brien. Burke's enemies are his enemies, and much of the book, alas far too
much, is devoted to laborious rebuttals of almost every historian ever to
have under-rated or criticised the Master. Public Enemy Number One is Sir
Lewis Namier, now dead 32 years, whose manifold sins appear to be as much of
omission as of commission. Other critics are damned simply as 'Namierite',
in some cases with gross unfairness.
The same defensive ardour gives rise to perverse omissions and judgments. It
was emphatically not just 'George III's will' which kept the American war
going for five years after Saratoga (1777): popular fervour and large
parliamentary majorities supported it. The political immorality of the
Fox-North coalition is nowhere addressed; nor is the most damaging charge
against the Burke/Fox India Bill - that it gave the Indian patronage, almost
entire, to Fox's Whig relations and put it beyond parliamentary control. The
notion that Fox repudiated Burke's stance on the French revolution through
resentment of 'Burke's intellectual and moral ascendancy over him' rings
distinctly hollow.
O'Brien's portrayal of the revolution as the 'first great experiment in
totalitarian innovation' is apt, and Burke's Reflections were indeed, as he
argues (quoting Reynaud), 'a la fois liberale et contre-revolutionnaire.'
Yet Burke's view that a Bourbon restoration was the best policy for France
should not go unchallenged. To do that is to ignore the post-1793
circumstances of France, and the disastrous experience of Charles X's
reactionary reign - something a true Burkean would never do.

THE NEW EMPERORS, MAO AND DENG: A DUAL BIOGRAPHY by Harrison E. Salisbury
HarperCollins,Pounds 20, 544 pages
THIS COULD have been a magnificent book, an intimate, colourful yet
definitive double biography of China's two all-powerful post-revolutionary
leaders. Instead, it is marred by conceit and bias. It is, nevertheless, a
good read.
Harrison Salisbury has enjoyed enviable access to China doubtless because
his years as Moscow correspondent for the New York Times established his
anti-Soviet bona fides in Peking's eyes, and this book benefits enormously
from unbuttoned conversations with many of the main players and their
acolytes in Peking's palace politics.
His rival China watchers, who despite China's intermittent bouts of relative
openness must spend long years pouring over documents, fitting bits of
evidence into a complicated jigsaw, must gnash their teeth in jealous rage
as Salisbury casually attributes a fascinating titbit to a personal
conversation with China's president Yang Shangkun or with Mao's personal
secretary.
But the impact of such impressive footnote references is mitigated when
Salisbury gives equal billing to sources such as the aged New Zealand
Marxist poet Rewi Alley, Mao's hagiographer Han Suyin, or journalist Russell
Spurr (who will be amused to see himself billed as a historian and
specialist on Korea). More damaging are the names of many distinguished
China scholars and journalist labourers in the nightsoil of Chinese politics
meanly omitted from both the index and the bibliography. Salisbury has cast
himself in the twin roles of ace reporter on the spot and guru, and appears
reluctant to acknowledge rivals.
Nevertheless, the book represents a stunningly detailed account of two
enigmatic figures; their years as leaders of a revolution and thereafter of
a huge country; their tortured relations with each other, with their
colleagues and with the outside world (Salisbury is particularly good on the
Sino-Soviet relationship). Indeed, so detailed and circumstantial are some
of the accounts of private conversations that the reader's critical faculty
is jolted into suspicion that the line between history and gossip, even that
between fact and 'faction,' has been crossed.
Anyone who has conducted interviews in China, even on those occasions when
the interviewee has obviously received permission to talk pretty freely,
finds himself being fed an indigestible 'line' rarely enlivened by personal
touches and reminiscences which do not serve as parables to underline the
propaganda theme. The very detailed richness of Salisbury's anecdotal
evidence confirms that Salisbury is not so much playing the part of a
historian, but of a messenger boy for the Deng faction. This is the way
Chinese history has unfolded for generations: emperors attempt to influence
history's verdict on their predecessors; their successors do likewise.
Salisbury has obviously been fingered by the Deng faction to convey their
version of Mao, and of Deng himself, to the outside world, just as Mao's
wife, Jiang Qing, once picked out an unknown American sociologist, Roxanne
Witke, to tell her story. One can only wish that he had exploited the
resulting material by stepping back and putting both men into an objective
context. Instead, Salisbury has softened Deng's hard edges, accentuating the
pragmatic builder and glossing over the egotistical survivalist who ordered
the tanks into Tienanmen Square and sacrificed comrades like Hu Yaobang and
Zhao Ziyang, who were no longer assets to his interests, just as cynically
as Mao had dumped him. The hard-liners Deng appointed to keep the lid on
dissent in the aftermath of Tienanmen come across as essentially benign
realists.
The full viciousness of Salisbury's sources falls on Mao. He is deservedly
painted as a bloody tyrant, an increasingly neurotic Chinese Stalin who shut
himself away from the people he constantly evoked to justify his worst
excesses, who destroyed the bearers of bad news, and who brought death to
millions, from famine in the wake of the Communes and the Great Leap Forward
and from violent anarchy during the Cultural Revolution.
But the verdict of blood-stained tyrant does not fully serve the Deng
clique's ends. Further smears are called for: Mao is portrayed as a decadent
emperor, alternately fasting and gobbling braised bears' paws as millions of
peasants starve; addicted to sleeping pills and drugs, wallowing 'like a
rutting walrus' in his heated pool within the Zhongnanhai, the imperial
compound adjoining the Forbidden City, with assorted naked dancing girls.
All this may be true, or maybe exaggerated for foreign audiences The effect
is bathetic: 'Psst] I can exclusively reveal that Mao was not only a mass
murderer; he was an adulterer too]' All those leaking the dirt on Mao to
Salisbury, even those who, like Deng himself, suffered humiliation, prison
and worse at Mao's hands, were part of the machinery which put Mao at the
helm of China and kept him there. Today they still pay lip service to him
and his doctrines, denouncing as sacrilegious those Tienanmen demonstrators
who defaced his portrait which still dominates the great square. They are
the men who run post-Tienanmen China today in the forlorn Maoist hope that
China can import the West's technology, capital and business methods while
embargoing its ideas.
As often happens in journalism, privileged access leads to copy which could
have been dictated by interested parties. One can only assume that, like
many 'friends of China' before him, Salisbury wanted to maintain his access;
if so, his hands too bear traces of tar. He can comfort himself with the
thought that he has provided much of the material which someone will turn
into a better book.

I MEAN no insult to Essex if I say that in some ways the bottom of this
year's Britannic Assurance Championship is more interesting than the top. It
is more surprising. Whereas most people expected Essex to repeat last year's
success and emerge as county champions, few expected Durham to fail as
resoundingly as they have done in their opening season as a first class
county.
Durham entered the fray full of sound and fury, signifying everything from
the neglected north to the ageing celebrity. They have ended the season in
last place, winners of only two of their 22 games. With many players
recruited from other counties, Durham will need a lot of practice before
they work well as a team. David Graveney has not found it easy to lead the
pugnacious Australian, Dean Jones, Ian Botham and Wayne Larkins, once
muscle-man of Northamptonshire's batting, in harmony with Durham's other
acquisitions and with its young hopefuls, such as batsmen Stewart Hutton and
John Glendenen.
Hutton and Glendenen notwithstanding, Durham scored fewer batting points
than any other county. Their bowling lacked speed and suffered from a
surfeit of tired medium pace. Durham's lovely grounds, such as the
University one, under the cathedral's majestic eye, will doubtless produce
lovely county cricket as they grow into true county grounds. In the meantime
it is hard not to feel a twinge of hope that local talent will play a
stronger part next year, in preference to all Durham's famous refugees.
It would be unrealistic to pretend that county cricket is anything other
than an exchange market nowadays. With Yorkshire going the way of all
others, the home grown has lost its last battle with the free range. But
that does not mean that the market system is unquestionably the most
profitable one. This season has shown the value of a stable element, or at
least the danger of always preferring innovation to stability.
At Chelmsford they are in no doubt that staying power and steady leadership
are crucial. 'Cricket is like an elongated game of chess,' a club spokesman
told me with satisfaction, trying to pick out one strength above another in
the abundance of Essex's riches. 'It's not like football, all over in a
couple of hours. There's much more for a captain to do: boosting morale,
making tactical decisions, making plans. The captain leads the team. We keep
ours a long time - Graham Gooch now; Keith Fletcher for 12 years before
him.'
Essex have a tradition of loyalty from their players and boast of the way
foreign signings, even potentially difficult ones like Salim Malik last
year, come back for another spell. Chelmsford, Ilford, Southend and
Colchester do not nourish prima donnas. Essex's recent triumph in the county
championship continues to boost their confidence, which improves their play.
Essex's loss of their best batsmen, Gooch and Salim, to the Anglo-Pakistani
battlefield did not have a purely negative effect. 'It's been more of a team
effort this year.' Team effort has been a key to this year's county
championship. John Stephenson has flourished with the bat. Although Essex's
highest bowler in the averages is only 17th (Derek Pringle), they have kept
each other going. Peter Such, 19th in the averages, is taking over from
veteran off-spinner John Childs as one of the team's assets.
Several other counties have done well with their slow bowlers. Hampshire
have used Shaun Udal's off-spin cleverly. The same is true of Sussex with
Ian Salisbury's leg-spin and Kent with Richard Davis's slow left-armers,
with which he has taken 74 wickets. Now Somerset have nabbed Mushtaq Ahmed,
Pakistan's globular and aerodynamic wrist spinner, as their 1993 foreign
signing. Mushtaq is a welcome acquisition, a symbol of encouragement for
spinners and those who relish their arts.
Spin is one of the tools Leicestershire did not use in their recovery this
year. They are an outstanding example of the sort of team effort Essex value
so highly. Talent, in the person of Phil DeFreitas, David Gower and Chris
Lewis deserted Leicestershire. Not surprisingly, spirits fell. The
appointment of Australia's Bobby Simpson as cricket manager and resident
tough guy in 1989 was a mistake. When he left last season, Leicestershire
were next to bottom. This season they are eighth. Jackie Birkenshaw has
replaced Simpson. Their captain Nigel Briers has led from the front,
building solid opening partnerships with Tim Boon. What Boon and Briers have
done to help improve Leicestershire after a strained period, Alan Fordham
and Nigel Felton have done for Northamptonshire, up from tenth to third.
This has been a prosperous year for journeyman counties like these, which
lack stars but work hard with what they've got. If the arrival of four-day
cricket has had any effect, I'm afraid it has slowed the game down even more
and this has suited counties working their way along, with everyone making a
small contribution.
Only Derbyshire, ever individualistic, have used their fiery talent to blaze
their own way, on and off, to another good year. Ian Bishop has joined Devon
Malcolm and Dominic Cork in that county rarity: a real pace attack. Kim
Barnett and the county's new Tigger, Chris Adams, have batted with flair and
occasional brilliance. Were Derbyshire to develop a new, alien virtue of
steadiness, they would soon be the best county in England. But one of the
Derbyshire's qualities is that you never know. Nor do they.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Motoring: Treats to tempt the guilty speedoholic - Stuart
Marshall tries out four very different fast cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS MOST unfair. I am like an overweight chocoholic trying to kick the
habit whose friends keep bringing gift boxes of sinfully fattening hard and
soft centres.
My problem is fast cars. Deep down, I disapprove of the kind that sacrifice
the qualities which sensible motorists seek, simply to achieve performance
that is unusable legally and indefensible socially on public roads.
But what happens when I am invited to drive one? I give in as easily as a
chocoholic who yearns to be slim but cannot resist just one more praline.
Four fast cars, all quite different, have been my recent undoing: a Porsche
911 Carrera 2 cabriolet; an AC Mark IV Lightweight; a Subaru SVX and a BMW
M5.
The Porsche, in an eye-catching emerald green with matching leather
interior, was a Turbo-look limited edition. It had the Turbo's wide wheels
and tyres, brakes and suspension but a normal 3.3-litre, air-cooled,
flat-six engine producing 250 horsepower against the real thing's 320.
I have to say that 250 horsepower - and masses of torque (or pulling power)
from only 2,000 rpm - seemed more than enough. Most of the time I had the
car, it rained. It is imprudent to take liberties with 911s on wet roads
but, driven with conditions in mind, the Turbo-look did not put a foot
wrong.
The engine pulled so well low down the speed range that town driving was
never fraught. On the open road, a gently depressed right foot in fourth or
fifth gave vigorous acceleration. The effect of a prod on the pedal in
second or third was like pulling a trigger.
At Pounds 67,689, I rated the Turbo-look 911 Cabrio a lovely toy for the
wealthy and self-indulgent.
One could say the same for the AC Mk IV Lightweight, only more so. This
re-creation of the AC Cobra of the 1960s is the muscle car personified. A
huge five-litre, 325-horsepower, Ford V8 engine has been shoe-horned into a
tubular steel chassis topped with an open two-seat body, hand-beaten and
rolled from aluminium sheet.
Before the war, AC advertised its individually-built cars as 'true products
of the Savile Row of motordom.' The barrel-chested Mk IV Lightweight is true
to this tradition.
An AC Competition two-seater with cut-away doors and fold-flat windscreen
cost Pounds 500 in 1937, when a Savile Row suit was about Pounds 15. Both
have gone up a bit since then.
Savile Row suits now cost around Pounds 1,500. The key-in-hand price of a
hand-built AC Mk IV Lightweight is close to Pounds 100,000.
For this you get a macho machine, arrogantly impractical as an everyday car
but, even at legal speeds on public roads, joyously exciting to drive, It
has been timed at 4.2 seconds from 0-62 mph (0-100 kmh), 10.6 seconds from
0-100 mph. On a private circuit, it must be breathtaking.
Never mind the modern engine - it has the appeal (and wood-rimmed steering
wheel) of an aristocratic 1930s' sports car. But its squat, ultra-grippy
tyres and enormous disc brakes make it much easier and, in today's traffic,
safer to drive.
When I visited the AC factory near Brooklands, some of the same
artist-craftsmen who make the cars were running up the Merlin engine of a
second world war Hurricane fighter they have rebuilt. A thrilling sound -
but no more so than the song of a Mk IV Lightweight in second at 6,000 rpm.
Nothing could be more different from Porsche or AC than the Subaru SVX. Its
226 bhp, 3.3-litre, 24-valve, flat-six engine drives all four wheels. The
transmission distributes the power individually to each wheel, according to
tyre grip. ABS does the same for the braking effort.
Of the quartet of high performers, none impressed me as much as the SVX.
Styled strikingly with the windows curving up into the roof, it is a genuine
four-seater with a good boot. Automatic transmission, air-conditioning,
leather seats (the front ones heated, the driver's power-adjusted), cruise
control, power-operated windows and sun roof all are standard.
Satisfying, yet undemanding to drive, the SVX feels glued to wet or dry
roads, makes little mechanical, wind or tyre noise and, remarkably, gave me
a shade over 26 mpg (10.8 l/100 km). I cannot think how Subaru and its
British concessionaire, IMI Group, manage to sell it for only Pounds 28,000.
Finally, the third-generation BMW M5. This has just gone on sale in Britain
at Pounds 48,950, or Pounds 55,575 with air-bag, leather trim,
air-conditioning, remote-control anti-theft system and electric seats, and
without any chromium trim. The charge for getting rid of the glitter is
Pounds 90.
The M5 combines the virtues of a four/five seat, big-booted 5-Series saloon
with super-car performance. While top speed is limited to 155 mph (250 kmh),
it gets from 0-62 mph in 5.9 seconds and - more importantly for a business
driver - from 50-75 mph in 6.9 seconds in fourth gear. The engine is a
3.8-litre in-line six developing 340 horsepower.
The 17-inch wheels give sharp steering response and seemingly unlimited
cornering abilities, but at the cost of bumpiness on rough roads.
Electronically controlled damping adapts nicely to a driver's mood, although
the ride is on the firm side of luxurious.
The M5 has a dual personality. At 30 mph and a shade over 1,000 rpm, it
pulls unprotestingly in fifth gear. But drop into third and let the engine
spin and it takes off like a rocket. Manual transmission would not be my
choice in a car of this class but the gear-shift is good and, in view of the
power it has to transmit, the clutch is light.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sport: The revolution reaches Dursley - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEARS AGO, I played a few games of rugby for Dursley, the town where I grew
up, halfway between Cheltenham and Bristol.
My brother appeared for the first team. I struggled into the seconds when no
one was looking and you get an idea of how improbable, though enjoyable, it
must have been when I say that I played both hooker and full back, not to
mention positions in between, in my dizzy spell in the colours of Dursley.
Then, as now, Gloucestershire was a hotbed of rugby. Bristol and Gloucester
were as friendly as rival politicians and the Forest of Dean and Lydney were
places you went to only with a police guard. A middle level existed for
teams such as Stroud. And then you came down to the Dursleys of this world.
It was pretty coarse rugby even though we did not have to carry the posts
out on to the pitch to play.
The changing rooms were in the local Memorial Hall which was not a hall at
all but a glorified tin shed on the edge of the pitch. We did not have a
headquarters. A local publican, who was Welsh and, ergo, interested in
rugby, used to look after us.
At this time kicking to touch was allowed from anywhere on the field. As a
result play was a lot less open. The peel had become fashionable. Forwards,
the donkeys, were beginning to be expected to do more than jump at a
line-out and shove at a scrum. At Dursley, tactics were mentioned and ploys
thought up even though we were not well equipped to bring them off. We were
true amateurs, teachers, scientists, farmers, men for whom rugby was a
relaxation to be played on Saturday afternoons and it was not taken very
seriously.
All this came back to me last week when I spoke to John Darlaston, the
secretary of Dursley, to find out what preparations had been made for the
new season and how it had begun.
'The big change lately has been that we rebuilt our changing rooms and club
room during the summer,' he said. 'We did it using our own labour for little
more than Pounds 20,000. We get sponsored to the tune of Pounds 6,000 or
Pounds 7,000 each year and we need to have somewhere to entertain them.'
Sponsors were unheard of in my day and the only entertaining that went on
was when Fred Wilcox told his agricultural jokes.
Dursley run four teams and have about 75 playing members. 'We even managed
to lend the opposition nine players for a fourth team game last season,'
said Darlaston.
Then he said something that really brought home the difference between then
and now: 'Training began in the fourth week of June. We've been at it two
nights a week ever since.' From what I remember, training was fairly
haphazard. Actually, from what I remember training was non existent. Mine
certainly was. I cannot remember ever doing any. Perhaps that is why I did
not play very often.
Wherever you look in rugby, the talk is of leagues. Heineken have just paid
Pounds 2.1m to the Welsh Rugby Union to sponsor the leagues in Wales for
three more years and the leagues in England receive a similar sum from
Courage. League rugby, as opposed to rugby league, is crucial for the
Harlequins and Baths of this world but even at Dursley's level it has
considerable significance.
'We hope to move up from the third division of the Gloucestershire League to
the second division this season,' said Darlaston. 'We almost did it last
year. The top four went up. We finished fifth only because we couldn't
honour our match fixture against Cainscross.'
Bob Dwyer, the coach of Australia, has said he thinks the new ruck and maul
laws are making the game a combination of rugby league and basketball. That
was not a consideration down in Gloucestershire. 'The lads were a bit
shocked when they watched the All Blacks push the South Africans back 40
yards and then not get the put-in at the ensuing scrum,' said Darlaston.
'But they are not so concerned about the law itself. They don't think that
at our level it is going to make much difference.'
Dursley in the third division. Who'd have thought it? They have made an
inauspicious start to this, their 40th season, losing two of their first
three games. It has been difficult for their captain, Sid Smith, who was
injured in pre-season training.
'It is a bit tricky trying to generate some fire in the lads from the touch
line,' said Smith, a hooker turned back-row forward.
Good luck to Dursley, particularly this afternoon when they play Imperial
Tobacco from Bristol in the first round of the Provincial Cup, south west
region 2. I remember my time as a paying and playing member with affection.
Those days long before the breathalyser were happy times - Fred Wilcox's
jokes and all.

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK trade deficit widens to Pounds 6bn: Industry urges
Treasury to cut interest rates while pound floats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S current account deficit widened to almost Pounds 6bn in the first
half of this year as exports of invisible goods, such as financial services
and dividends, failed to match expectations.
The figures led the Central Statistical Office to revise upwards the current
account deficit in the second quarter from Pounds 2.6bn to Pounds 2.9bn,
bringing the cumulative total for the first half to just under Pounds 6bn.
This is only half a billion less than the forecast for the whole year by the
Treasury in the March Budget.
Throughout the recession, Britain has continued to import more than it sells
abroad, a trend which recently showed signs of worsening. Industrialists are
hoping that this week's devaluation of the pound along with the prospect of
lower interest rates will boost exports.
Yesterday senior industry representatives urged the Treasury to seek a quick
cut in interest rates to take advantage of the pound's new free-floating
state outside the European exchange rate mechanism.
The message from industry was pressed at a meeting between Mr Alan Budd, the
Treasury's chief economic adviser, and economists from some of Britain's top
companies including Imperial Chemical Industries, GKN, RTZ and Ford of
Britain.
According to the CSO figures, the surplus on invisible items in the second
quarter of the year was Pounds 336m, compared with an initial projection of
Pounds 600m. This was, however, an improvement on the first quarter figure
when the surplus dropped to Pounds 168m, the smallest surplus for seven
quarters. The deficit on visible, or merchandise, goods, was Pounds 3.2bn in
the second quarter compared with Pounds 3.1bn in the first quarter.
The news came as the Confederation of British Industry released a survey
showing that manufacturers' order books remain below normal with price rises
at their most subdued since the late 1950s.
The survey, carried out in the three weeks before the pound left the
exchange rate mechanism, revealed that manufacturers remained gloomy about
the economy, with most expecting output to fall over the next four months.
Mr Andrew Sentance, an economist at the CBI, said the October survey could
be more optimistic if interest rates were to fall.
Although some industry representatives at the Treasury meeting said they
hoped the recession had bottomed out, they gave a generally gloomy opinion
of the economic outlook.
One participant said: 'While the lower exchange rate is likely to boost
export sales, in the current climate of high interest rates and sluggish
world economy you have to be an optimist to talk about recovery.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / NatWest ends market-making in up to 300 small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET for shares in smaller UK companies suffered another blow
yesterday with the news that County NatWest, part of National Westminster
Bank, is to stop making markets in between 200 and 300 companies.
County's retrenchment follows a similar move by Warburg Securities, another
leading securities house, which dropped 360 small company stocks a fortnight
ago. Others, such as Barclays de Zoete Wedd, have also trimmed their
operations, though on a smaller scale.
The cuts leave a growing number of companies without at least two
market-makers willing to quote prices in their shares, making it impossible
for normal stock market trading to continue. Even before the Warburg and
County moves, some 130 companies had been forced on to the London Stock
Exchange's Bulletin Board, an electronic system in which brokers post 'buy'
or 'sell' orders in small company shares.
The exchange said its domestic equity market committee would meet next week
to consider ways of improving the Bulletin Board. The system has been
criticised by brokers, who say it does little to encourage trading.
The move by County, which has yet to decide exactly which companies it will
drop, was part of a decision to disband its small companies team, with the
departure of two analysts and two salespeople. Analysts specialising in
particular sectors would now be responsible for researching small companies,
said Mr Philip Augar, head of equities.
While most market-makers have pulled back from small companies, two  - Smith
New Court and Winterflood Securities  - this week said they planned to
extend the range of companies they covered.
The deterioration of the market in small company shares is causing growing
concern among the companies involved, who fear it will become more difficult
to trade their shares and raise money on the stock market.
'They have paid large amounts for listing fees and they've been relegated to
the position of second-class citizens,' said Mr Brian Winterflood of
Winterflood Securities. County said it had made 15 to 20 people redundant
last week out of a total of 120 to 130 in its equity department.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Chinese company seeks US listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA dramatically underlined its economic reform policies yesterday when a
state-owned business announced plans to become the first Chinese company to
sell shares in the US and to list on the New York Stock Exchange.
Brilliance China Automotive, a Bermuda-based company with a majority stake
in mini-bus manufacturer Shenyang Automotive, plans to raise only Dollars
70m to Dollars 80m through an initial public share offer. But the move is an
important test, designed to establish a precedent for equity fund-raising by
state-owned Chinese businesses in the leading western capital markets.
The Chinese could have chosen easier equity-raising routes, for example, a
private placement with large US institutional investors, but sought a full
public offering as the best means to test the western market. First Boston,
the US investment bank lead managing the offering, is also planning to offer
part of the issue in London and Zurich.
The accounting firm of Arthur Andersen has restated the company's entire
Chinese accounts to conform with US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, in an effort to satisfy the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC demands that foreign companies state their accounts in a way which
allows US investors to readily compare their performance with similar US
businesses. This has involved it in a heated dispute with the New York Stock
Exchange, which is keen to attract new foreign listings and would prefer
less onerous regulations.
Brilliance still requires SEC approval for its share offering, but the NYSE
said yesterday it that had already approved the company for a listing.
The offering consists of 5m shares in Brilliance, expected to be priced
between Dollars 14 and Dollars 16 a share.
Brilliance is owned by a Chinese government agency and is domiciled in
Bermuda for tax, legal and other reasons. The offering represents a stake of
about 14.5 per cent in Shenyang Automotive, which has an extensive
relationship with Toyota.
Its US accounts show 1991 net income of Dollars 8.4m on sales of Dollars
114.4m. It will use the proceeds for new equipment and to increase the
domestic content of its vehicles.
After the offering, Brilliance intends to apply for a listing of its shares
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where some other Chinese companies are
already quoted.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profit warnings are a hazard at this stage of the cycle, but for Philips
they have become alarmingly routine. Yesterday's unexpected announcement
that net income this year is likely to be no better than about half the 1991
result, for example, contrasts with an admittedly cagey but markedly less
gloomy statement in its report at the end of the second quarter.
The trouble for the market is gauging precisely the extent of the problem.
The company was clearly not alone in mistakenly seeing an early end to the
recession, but it is hard to believe that the dollar exchange rate is the
major issue. More worryingly, this may be a smokescreen for the extent of
price weakness and volume decline in European consumer electronics. The
question for the shares - down 7.5 per cent yesterday - must be whether the
latest action on costs is going to be enough.

Sun Alliance will be mightily relieved to have got rid of most of its 13 per
cent holding in Commercial Union at a small profit yesterday, not least
after bungling its first attempt at a bought deal earlier in the week. To be
fair to Sun the CU share price has outperformed the market by 23 per cent
since the day in August 1989 when it first picked up the loose stake. As the
company is all too painfully aware, however, this was no ordinary portfolio
investment.
Sun's ambition was to protect the UK insurance industry from foreign
predators anxious to build a UK presence ahead of the single European
market. But the widespread expectation was that it would not stop there. In
the event CU's relatively young management team was not prepared to
countenance a merger on friendly terms, and a hostile bid was never on the
cards. More pertinently, Sun's once legendary financial strength has been
sapped by huge losses on its mortgage indemnity account, a nightmare which
will overshadow its results until the mid 1990s.
CU shareholders are doubtless relieved that they have not had to shoulder
the burden of this black hole, though one can argue that a combined Sun
Alliance/CU would have gone some way to sorting out the UK insurance
sector's overcapacity. Further rationalisation is inevitable, but it will
happen more slowly and less visibly than might have been the case. The late
1980s enthusiasm for cross border alliances - once touted as the biggest
spur to greater efficiency - has been badly dented by bad experience and a
poor operating environment. Forthcoming interim results from the French
insurers are likely to demonstrate that it is not just Sun Alliance which
has to concentrate on putting its own house in order.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: German bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's French referendum, and despite the
collapse in convergence arguments following sterling's exit from the ERM,
German bond yields will almost certainly continue to be a reference point
for other European bond markets. German yields should remain well below
those of other states, even if a Yes vote eases pressure on the ERM. Yet
this week's issue of some DM6bn bonds for the Treuhand agency, responsible
for privatisation in eastern Germany, is a reminder that heavy supply is in
the offing. When the various elements are totted up, Germany's public sector
deficit is some 5 per cent of GNP. Official estimates that this will fall to
3 per cent by 1996 depend on projections of economic growth which look
over-optimistic.
Germany still lacks a credible policy to bring the deficit down, and the
reconstruction bill is mounting in the east. The Treuhand is likely to be a
heavy borrower over the next couple of years. As in the US, these demands
for public finance can probably be met while the economy remains depressed
and the savings ratio is high. But any return to trend growth in Germany
could mean consumption starving the bond market of funds.
If investors can be persuaded to move money from deposits into bonds,
monetary growth will slow, pleasing the Bundesbank. The trouble is that the
central bank's own tight money policy is keeping short-term deposit rates
above 9 per cent. So selling bonds on a yield of 7.5 per cent is an uphill
task. A bunching of new issues between now and the year end could exacerbate
the difficulty. Germany's good inflation record provides an underpinning for
bond yields, but investors should keep an eye on costs in the east.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Banking on lower rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the London market up nearly 200 points over the last week, there is no
disguising the sea change in perceptions prompted by Britain's withdrawal
from the ERM. One has to wonder, however, how great will be the change in
policy stance once the immediate shock is over. If the ERM survives
tomorrow's Maastricht vote in France, Britain will hardly be back inside.
That seems certain after yesterday's Anglo-German slanging match. But Mr
Major is adamant that he still regards tackling inflation as a priority. All
the more reason, then, to expect him to proceed with caution in cutting base
rates till a more coherent policy is back in place.
The beguiling notion is that, having bitten the devaluation bullet, the
government is free to set interest rates as low as needed to revive demand.
Weak money supply and credit growth suggests there is no inflationary
pressure in the pipeline. But it would only take a small acceleration of UK
price rises to erode the devaluation advantage when continental inflation is
low and falling. The very speed with which equities have risen during the
last three days suggests the British inflationary psychology was suppressed
rather than eradicated by the recession. Price pressures could build up
again quickly as hard-pressed companies avail themselves of every
opportunity to rebuild margins.
One difference from the non-inflationary depreciation of the early 1980s is
that then we had a fiscal squeeze. Curiously, the public spending round
seems all but forgotten now. The government still needs some way of
signalling it means business on inflation. Political pressure for another
cut in base rates is surely strong. If there is a response, it could be
grudging. The equity market is in danger of discounting too much too soon.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Travel: Hard ride to Hanoi - Mark Hodson forsook comfort on
a ride through Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE railway station in Hue, about 700 miles north of Saigon, an
embarrassed official explained how the Vietnamese government set its ticket
prices. It was fairly simple: tourists pay four times as much as locals.
The young man fiddled with the buttons on his uniform and adjusted the
oversized cap which kept slipping over his eyes. 'I am very sorry,' he said.
'It is the rule for foreigners.'
I had wanted to book a ticket for the 430-mile journey north to Hanoi and
was faced with an array of options. There were soft seats, hard seats, soft
sleepers and hard sleepers, slow trains, express trains and rapide trains.
The prices set for tourists were scrawled on a blackboard in the office, and
the figures looked like the national debts of various South American
countries.
I decided finally on a hard sleeper (middle berth) on Saturday's express
which would cost 419,000 dong, a little more than Pounds 20.
Four days later, armed with a bunch of bananas and a bag of chicken pate
sandwiches, I walked back to the station to catch my train. It was the start
of a long journey. Between Saigon and Hanoi there is just a single track on
which every train runs, whether it is going north or south.
At suitable points on the route, small sidings have been built where one
train can wait while another passes. In theory, this is not such a problem.
Local trains make way for express trains, express trains make way for rapide
trains and all three make way for the occasional water buffalo that ambles
on to the track.
In practice, there are problems. A single hold-up can mean every other train
down the line waiting in their various sidings, so that a single piece of
worn-out rolling stock or one set of jammed points can cause a delay that
echoes throughout the 1,600 miles of the Vietnamese rail network.
My berth was basic, to say the least. The hard sleepers turned out to be
planks of wood, six of which were wedged three deep into a compartment
measuring about 5ft by 7ft. The shutter was broken and the window jammed
open. Above my head, about 9in from my left ear, was a loudspeaker that
announced every town and village along the route.
I was sharing with a Swedish law student whom I had met in Saigon, a
Vietnamese couple, two French women and a mouse. We were each issued with a
thin pillow and a musty blanket about the size of a large hand-towel. As
darkness fell and we clattered north past mountains covered with forest, the
temperature dropped sharply. The cold was numbing.
I suppose I must have slept for a while because I remember being woken at
Vinh, a bleak grimy city about half-way to Hanoi. Women walked up and down
the track selling hard-boiled eggs balanced in baskets on their heads.
Children in rags stared open-mouthed into our compartment.
As dawn broke, we heaved up the shutter to find the landscape transformed.
The mountains had given way to mile after mile of rice fields swathed in
early-morning mist. Women working the fields - bent double and up to their
thighs in cold mud - stopped and waved as we passed. As far as the eye could
see there were houses ripped open by falling bombs and, more than 17 years
after the Vietnam war, still not rebuilt.
In our compartment, tentative conversations were started. The Vietnamese
woman said she was training to be a doctor in eastern Germany; her husband
was making the journey to Hanoi just to see her on to the aircraft.
As we pulled into Hanoi, we folded away the planks and passed around the
last of the bananas. The train came to a halt, the door was thrown open and
for several seconds we stood still, smiling and saying our goodbyes. It was
good to have arrived but somehow it seemed too soon to leave each other.
Then, without another word, we picked up our bags, stepped on to the
platform and went our separate ways.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Travel: A safari that ends on the beach - Richard Gilbert
divides his Kenyan holiday between the luxurious game lodges of Tsavo and
the Indian Ocean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DELICATELY laundered white mosquito net around my bed made the room look
like a bridal suite. I ordered a beer. As I quenched a thirst brought on by
a morning game drive in the bush, I glanced through the window and counted
eight zebra, five water-buck and nine elephants heading towards a
water-hole. It was early February in Kenya's Tsavo national park and the
temperature had not dropped below 93'c Fahrenheit all day.
Tsavo, halfway between Mombasa and Nairobi, is the largest game sanctuary in
East Africa. Thirty-six hours earlier we had struggled through fog to
Gatwick; now we were outbidding each other with sightings of exotic animals.
This was my first two-centre holiday - a week divided between the comforts
of an Indian Ocean beach hotel outside Mombasa and game rides into the bush
of Tsavo and the Taita Hills private game sanctuary.
Seven of us climbed on to a safari mini-bus for a game drive to Salt Lick
Lodge, a sanctuary in the Taita Hills that was once a sisal plantation. The
success of any game drive depends largely on the skills, prescience and
character of the driver-guide. With Hamid, we were lucky.
Off the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, Hamid turned the zebra- striped Nissan down
red dirt tracks surrounded by thorn scrub and short grass. He could
interpret the significance of a lump of animal dung or a patch of
smoothed-down grass with tremendous skill. Following trails and tracks, we
saw giraffes, gazelles, zebra, dikdik and exotic birds that would have
driven twitchers into a frenzy.
The game park lodges for overnight accommodation are a misnomer, having less
to do with Karen Blixen than with Conrad Hilton. Indeed, Salt Lick Safari
Lodge in Taita Hills is owned by Hilton. Built around a natural salt lick,
the clusters of rooms are on pillars to let the animals wander freely
underneath the lodge.
At dawn we set off north for Tsavo, once notorious for man-eating lions and
more recently for the Somali poachers who have plundered the black rhino
population.
Just when you think the views are unsurpassable, you reach Voi Lodge in
Tsavo East. Built on an escarpment, the lodge overlooks a remarkable series
of linked water holes. From my room I watched the gigantic amphitheatre fill
with dozens of elephants, their hides rusted from rolling in the red earth
around the water holes.
Waking at first light the following day, I disentangled myself from the
mosquito net and watched the continuing parade of wildlife, headed this time
by water buffalo and ostriches. The morning was still cool; the scent of
wild flowers filled the lodge.
The last lap of the safari took us to Tsavo West national park, with a
detour past Mzima Springs from where millions of gallons of crystal water
are piped daily to Mombasa. This oasis, surrounded by a valley of arid lava,
is a haven for hippos.
On the rough track to Ngulia Lodge, an inspired diversion by Hamid took us
to a pride of lions in a broad patch of long grass. Two new-born cubs romped
with elder members of the family; then, seeking a feed, they were gently
cuffed away by a lioness.
Ngulia Lodge, in Tsavo West, is a mecca for migrating birds. The lights of
the isolated lodge attract hundreds of species, and there is a roll-call of
rare visitors. Madagascar bee-eaters, penduline tits, hammerkops, wheatears,
warblers and waders are all regulars, together with a species bearing the
memorable name of 'red-cheeked cordon bleu'.
Four days of safari are rewarded with a long weekend of relaxation at Safari
Beach hotel outside Mombasa. How safe is a safari holiday?
The sudden spate of attacks on tourists in the Masai Mara, east of Tsavo,
earlier this year was unprecedented for Kenya and led to increased security.
Operators are insisting on a minimum of two vehicles travelling together on
particular game drives in the Mara's remoter areas. But travellers to Tsavo
 -unlike the Mara, Tsavo is controlled by the Kenya Wildlife Service - have
faced no difficulties. Kenya is still safer than Key West.
Richard Gilbert travelled with Portland Holidays, whose 'Portrait of Kenya'
combined safari and beach holidays start at Pounds 689 per person for a week
(from November 1). The cost for 10 nights' beach plus four days' safari is
around Pounds 823 per person (again, from Nov 1). Address: 218 Great
Portland St, London W1N SHG, tel: 071-388-5111, or 1 Portland St, Manchester
M1 3BJ, tel: 061-228-1188.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Travel: In Ceausescu's broken footsteps - Romania is free,
but David Pilling finds it is still a depressing place to visit or live in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCHAREST is in a bad way. The Intercontinental Hotel has no coffee and many
restaurants have little or no food. Buildings in the centre of town, many of
them once quite handsome, are coated in thick grime. Some are peppered with
bullet holes. The city smells of cabbage and cheap tobacco.
My taxi driver, on the way into town from the airport, told me that things
were better now. I was glad I had not come before. He said he was now free
to travel abroad, only he had no money with which to do so.
He could say what he wanted now. He said 'Ceausescu' and made an obscene
gesture, removing both hands from the steering wheel and causing the cab to
veer alarmingly in the near-deserted road. Bucharest boasts very few private
vehicles. Indeed, it has very little to boast about at all.
I might have guessed things were going to be bad in Romania as early as
Stansted airport. 'You're flight is due to leave on time, sir,' the check in
girl gushed, as though this were an achievement. I was flying with Romania's
national airline, Tarom.
The aircraft did not leave on time. It left two hours late, but I was amazed
it got off the ground at all. The inside of the aircraft was kitted out like
a troop carrier, with seat coverings of coarse green material and
stewardesses who looked so miserable I later decided they must have sampled
some of the inflight food.
My knees were somewhere near my chin for the duration of the flight, but I
felt privileged to have a seat belt. Many adjacent seats were not so well
equipped.
The fun really began at Bucharest airport with a mad scramble to push
through customs. Later, I wondered why everyone was so keen to get in.
I tried to change Dollars 100 at the airport bank. The clerk, a dishevelled
man in his forties with an unkempt moustache and greying sideburns that
seemed to sprout from his ears, thrust the note back at me and told me I
would not need to change more than Dollars 20.
I tried to convert the sum he had suggested but he lost interest, telling me
to change my money in town where I could get a better rate. His friend, the
taxi driver, would take me into the centre for Dollars 5.
The driver assumed I was Russian at first. 'Gavareesh pa Rusky?' he kept
growling in an insinuating sort of way. I finally convinced him that I spoke
English, a language over which he held about the same command as I do over
Russian.
Nevertheless, when someone wants to tell you something, they generally find
a way. On the approach to Bucharest the driver pointed to a statue of Lenin.
All that remained was a pair of boots, standing surrealistically on a
concrete podium. The driver wheezed and chortled hysterically.
'Rooshian army,' he said later, indicating a now-derelict strip of land
where barracks must once have stood. He found this highly amusing too. His
passing shot was to drive by the great residence Ceausescu had built for
himself, a chalk-white edifice with Greek pillars and, according to my
guide, 5,000 rooms.
The driver said the buildings around were erected in such a way that, from
the air, they spelled out Ceausescu's name. Many parts of Bucharest were
bulldozed to make way for the late dictator's fanatical construction plans.
I checked into a musty hotel and set out in search of food. Street lights go
off at about 9.30pm to save power, so I spent the evening wandering around
the dim and derelict streets looking for a restaurant prepared to cook me a
meal.
A guide book from pre-revolution days directed me to a place where I could
get 'great food' for 40 lei. One of the several waitresses - there were no
diners - ushered me into the kitchen with tremendous excitement. There I was
treated to the sight of a fat women in a greasy apron waving a gristly piece
of sausage about as though it were a pools-winner's cheque. I tried to look
enthusiastic and ordered a plate, a treat that set me back 400 lei and sent
me to the Intercontinental for all subsequent meals.
My next day I spent 'sightseeing.' I wandered down the city's fine
boulevards. I found a couple of tiny but richly decorated churches. I
visited some department stores where I discovered why nearly everyone
appeared to have bought their clothes at a 1970s jumble sale.
I sat in some of the city's fine parks, still beautifully maintained in
spite of everything. I went to the main railway station where a man with a
toasted-sandwich maker was doing a roaring trade. I tried to visit the art
gallery, but it was closed. I visited a pizzeria. Unfortunately it was open.
After one bite of its fare I dashed back to the Intercontinental.
The next day I met a young doctor and her boyfriend. Things were awful, they
said. Life, they had no doubt, would get better now that Ceausescu had gone,
but change would not come soon enough for them.
The girl said she would go to Sweden and find someone to marry her. Her
boyfriend did not look too hurt, such being the decisions Romanians must
make if they are to get on in the world. As a doctor she earned Dollars 50 a
month, more or less what my visa for Romania had cost me. She spoke
Romanian, English, French and a smattering of Swedish. She had never been
abroad.
My plane lifted off the tarmac a few days later for my return to London.
Unfortunately my luggage was not so blessed and had to be bundled on to
another Tarom flight to catch up with me 24 hours after. My rucksack has
thus spent longer in Romania than I have. I plan to take it somewhere sunny
as soon as possible.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: A guide to good companies - Diary of
a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson outlines his system for
deciding whether to buy shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A PRIVATE investor, I have already made use of the FT's new company
reports service and found it fast and efficient. For just the cost of an
ordinary phone call, I can receive a copy of a number of company reports.
Further details are given on the FT share price pages, where companies for
which reports are available are marked with an ace of clubs.
Unfortunately, only 130 companies have so far availed themselves of this
service, but I hope this number will increase in the near future. I would
particularly like to see more small to medium companies on the list; the
more interest taken in them, the more marketable their shares might be.
In these difficult and uncertain economic times, however, I remain very wary
about further stock market investment. It has to be a pretty good company to
attract my money.
I am, therefore, using a marking system when looking at company reports in
order to decide if further investigation - and possibly investment - might
be warranted.
Under my system, each company starts with 100 points. I then flip through
the pages of the report. If I see more than one photograph of the chairman,
I deduct five points. If the company has just moved to an expensive and
luxurious new head office building, 15 points are deducted.
I then look at the chairman's statement. Has he given a profits warning  -
perhaps shrouded in words like 'trading is proving difficult' or 'we are
well poised to take advantage of conditions when the current recession
ends?' If so, I deduct 20 points.
(The reason I deduct only 20 is that, theoretically, by the time the report
has been published, the market ought to have adjusted to take account of the
chairman's views and analysts' comments.
Also, a number of chairmen are unaware of the true state of their company -
or wish to conceal it - and so do not reveal as much as they might. So, as
an indication of prospects, the chairman's statement has to be viewed with
some caution).
I then look at the list of substantial shareholders (those owning more than
3 per cent of the company's ordinary share capital). If the list contains no
signs of any respected City institutions or major personal shareholdings, I
deduct 10 points.
Do all the executive directors own shares? Five points are deducted for each
one who does not.
Is the company in a niche market with very little competition or the owner
of undervalued brand names? If not, I deduct 10 points. Is the company
proposing a change in the date of its year-end? If so, 15 points are
deducted.
It is the accounts of the company and, more importantly, the note to the
accounts, that can cause most points to be lost: 75 are deducted if gearing
is more than 100 per cent.
If the company capitalises interest, 15 points are deducted. If the
short-term borrowings are greater than the long-term, the penalty is 25
points.
A further 15 are lost if the company has a large amount of borrowings in
certain foreign currencies where changes in the exchange rate could prove
costly.
Have there been any changes in the method of valuation of stocks? If so, and
the effect of this is to increase stock values significantly, then 20 points
are deducted.
Even without a change in valuation policy, there will be a further penalty
of 20 points if stock levels/values have increased considerably over the
previous year. I would be concerned the company might not be able to find
buyers for all its products stockpiled at profitable prices.
Has the company sold assets to companies in which it also has a large
shareholding, and attributed large profits to such asset sales? If so, I
deduct 60 points.
Has the company engaged in a number of deals where deferred consideration is
payable? If so, 15 points are lost.
If the company has changed its depreciation policy by considerably extending
the depreciation period of plant and equipment, then 15 points are deducted.
Is the pension scheme fully-funded? If not, I deduct between five and 15
points depending on the amount of under-funding. If the scheme is
over-funded and the company is having a pensions 'holiday,' five points are
lost.
Does the company have any contingent liabilities? If so, then five to 30
points will be deducted depending on their size and nature.
Does the company have a good cash flow? If not, 25 points are removed. And a
further 15 points are lost if the company does not have a healthy amount of
cash on deposit with reputable banks.
Do the accounts contain a statement along the lines of: 'The open market
value of the company's freehold properties is substantially in excess of the
book value?' If not, I take away 10 points.
Have the auditors qualified the accounts of the company? Depending on the
nature and number of such qualifications, 20 to 80 points will be deducted.
If staff costs have increased considerably over the previous year, then 10
points are deducted; and if the directors have had considerable salary
increases while the profits of the company have fallen, then a further 10
points go.
If the net asset value of the company is not more than its current market
capitalisation, I deduct 10 points.
Of course, I also look at the profits of the company. But, again, by the
time the report is published the market ought to have adjusted the company's
share price to take account of reduced or increased profits. On some
occasions I may, therefore, not deduct any points for reduced profits.
Any company that has lost all its 100 initial points (or more) will not, in
present circumstances, be considered by me for investment.
Every company will have lost some points by my system, and a company with
fewer than 35 remaining will be viewed with considerable caution. Naturally,
those with more than 35 would be investigated further before I invested.
For the record, Pentland Group and British and American Film Holdings would
have passed my test; companies such as Gresham House, Maxwell
Communications, Leading Leisure and the Lep group would have failed it.
I stress that this scoring system is based only on my personal judgments and
might well not suit others. But at least it ensures I go into future stock
market investment with my eyes open wider than before.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: BES slips past the Revenue's curbs -
John Authers explains how sponsors have reduced risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSINESS Expansion Scheme (BES), introduced to encourage investment in
cheap rental housing, has slipped the bounds set for it by the Inland
Revenue.
The original idea was to offer investors full top-rate tax relief in return
for two 'catches' - they had to put their money away for five years, and
take a substantial risk. But the schemes put on the market for the present
BES season seem to have eradicated both.
BES sponsors started limiting risk by asking housing associations and
universities to covenant to pay a fixed sum for BES shares after the
five-year tax-exempt period had elapsed. But these schemes had no
third-party guarantees from financial institutions.
Now, however, several clearing banks have been persuaded to underwrite
schemes. These companies are effectively as safe as the banks themselves.
The latest innovation, which turns the tax shelter market on its head, is
the non-recourse loan. Investors can take out a loan, with shares in a BES
company as security. This allows them to realise their investments well
within the usual five-year BES period.
Taking out leverage to benefit from tax reliefs would normally be risky. If
something went wrong with the BES, the borrower could find calls being made
on his other assets. But a scheme introduced last week by Johnson Fry, and
imitated immediately by others, allows for non-recourse loans.
Under this scheme, the bank was allowed to recoup its money only from the
BES shares and had no recourse to the borrower's other assets. This opens
the way for stupendous returns simply by arbitraging the Inland Revenue.
Johnson Fry was quickly imitated by Close Brothers' Bessa Blue Chip scheme,
guaranteed by Barclays, and both issues are now almost fully subscribed.
More schemes on similar lines seem certain to appear, however, as demand has
proved to be exceptional.
Under Johnson Fry's scheme, TSB's Mortgage Express agreed to lend investors
an amount equivalent to 76p for every Pounds 1 they invested. Top-rate
taxpayers would have received 40p in tax relief and so, in practice, would
have invested only 60p.
This is equivalent, after the delay in receiving tax relief is taken into
account, to an annual yield of 19.8 per cent.
Basic-rate taxpayers would only make a profit of 1p, having parted with 75p.
Close Brothers then introduced a non-recourse loan with identical terms of
76p per 100p invested after one year, and also offered to lend money at 72p
per 100p invested after six months - at about the same time the tax relief
would arrive. According to Close Brothers, this is an annualised yield of 25
per cent.
Terrace Hill Capital and Smith &amp; Williamson Securities are sponsoring two
schemes (with guarantees from large banks) which will buy newly-built
properties.
Accumulus, sponsored by Terrace Hill, will buy properties built by developer
Metfield Estates. After five years, Metfield will pay Pounds 1.25 for every
Pounds 1 spent now to buy back the properties. If Metfield is unable to do
this, the money will be paid by the Standard Chartered Bank instead. Loans
are available after one year, but fixed-rate non-recourse terms have not
been negotiated.
Cavendish Wates Guaranteed, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, is similar.
Wates, the developer, will build and then buy back the properties for the
same price of Pounds 1.25 for every Pounds 1.00 spent now. Wates' ability to
pay is guaranteed by Midland Bank.
The equivalent annual yield to a top-rate taxpayer of both these schemes is
14.7 per cent - better than the TSB and Barclays' offerings, which work out
at 13.8 per cent and 13.7 per cent respectively if held for five years.
Also on offer is the Third Johnson Fry University Cash-Backed scheme, which
will buy property for Loughborough university. There are no special loan
provisions, but the scheme is backed by a certificate of deposit held by the
Law Debenture Trust Corporation. The rate over five years is Pounds 1.28 1/2
for every Pounds 1.00 invested now. A similar offer is available from
Airways Assured II. However, analysts John Spiers of BESt Investment, and
Anthony Yadgaroff of Allenbridge have both found fault with the estimated
annual yield of 15.3 per cent published by the scheme. Spiers says it should
be closer to 14.9 per cent, they say. The cash backing arranged for the
scheme is sufficient only to cover 74 per cent of the necessary cash at the
end of five years.
Chamberlain De Broe, an independent adviser, is offering an execution-only
dealing service for BES schemes at a charge of Pounds 50. Alan Greening, of
Chamberlain De Broe, points out that locking in to the BES for five years
could still be wise, as there is no way of knowing what tax shelter
arrangements will replace it.
According to Greening: 'You are sacrificing the long-term returns by opting
for a short-term loan. We would recommend that after April 5, people should
be locking up for five years because we don't know what the alternatives to
BES are going to be.'
He accepts that the non-recourse loan was 'almost a stroke of marketing
genius' on the part of Johnson Fry, and he expects other banks to offer
higher loans. He regards 80 or 90 per cent loans as feasible because many
banks have large property portfolios.
Less secure BES companies are on offer. Kerrington MaxiGrowth is the latest
in a series of companies which buy property, rent it (hopefully, for high
yields) and then aim to sell for a profit after five years.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM an officer in British Army on the Rhine and I am treated as resident
for tax purposes. My wife has no job and will be here for several tax years.
Her unearned income from building society accounts in the UK exceeds her
personal allowance.
Is she allowed to open an 'overseas' account that would pay interest gross?
If so, would such a course alter her entitlement to a personal allowance for
UK income, and my entitlement to the married couple's allowance.
The tax office say an overseas account is 'inappropriate' but I cannot pin
them down to whether it is allowed.
While we cannot give investment advice (in view of the Financial Services
Act 1986), we invite your wife to consider whether it would not be more
convenient for her to move her accounts offshore, say to the Channel Islands
or to the Isle of Man. The administrative burden which the Inland Revenue is
imposing on UK building societies and banks with members and depositors who
are nor ordinarily resident in the UK makes it increasingly unattractive for
anyone who is living overseas to keep their account in the UK. You will no
doubt have seen reports that some UK building societies are already telling
their overseas members and depositors to take their business elsewhere.
Although others have offshore associates happy to take over the provision of
account facilities for a) overseas depositors and b) UK depositors who, for
example, want to receive untaxed interest rather than to wait for tax
refunds (with consequent loss of interest).
The location of your wife's accounts etc does not affect your entitlement to
the married couple's allowance.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT relief is limited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I have been in self-employed partnership for over 30 years.
During this time, we have run three separate strands of activity under
different trading names - each filing its own accounts, but with common
resources operating from our flat.
We made one of these a limited company because of the higher risk but it
still operated without employees, and using the common facilities of the
partnership.
We have received an offer for the limited company and its one product
activity. The Inland Revenue guidelines on CGT retirement relief for 'family
businesses' indicate that relief is only available to full-time family
directors. Over the years, the activity of the limited company has become
the principal source although our other work as a self-employed partnership
has continued inseparably from the limited company.
Our drawings from the company go into our main partnership account (with all
other income) on which we have always been taxed as self-employed people.
Can we qualify for the CGT retirement relief if the limited company is sold?
We are both over 60.
You and your wife do not appear to satisfy the arbitrary criteria for relief
under section 163(5) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. However,
the solicitor who acts for you in the sale of the shares will be best placed
to advise you, since he or she will have ready access to the relevant facts.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): A big sigh of
relief - Mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE wake of Wednesday's events, the reaction of those in the housing
market has been to heave a sigh of relief - first, because we have been
spared the catastrophe of mortgage interest rates at 13 or even 16 per cent
and, second, because interest rates may now fall.
Not everyone is euphoric. Fixed-rate mortgages at 10.4 per cent no longer
have the glitter that they had on Wednesday. Those who dashed into Abbey
National branches then to convert their mortgages into fixed rates of 10.35
per cent for seven years must now rue their decision.
Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, the UK's
fourth-largest building society, summed up the feelings of many lenders when
he said that 'if the outcome of Wednesday is indeed lower rates, it has all
been quite good news for the housing market.'
A few lenders have already begun to offer mortgages with interest rates
fixed below 10 per cent, and there will be a lot more of these in coming
weeks.
National Counties building society, for example, is offering a mortgage
fixed at 9.75 per cent till September next year and then at 9.95 per cent
for a further year. But I wonder if they will find many takers.
Many economists believe base rates could fall to 8 per cent by Christmas,
which would mean a mortgage rate of around 9 per cent. If building societies
continue their attempts to stimulate the market, rates for first time buyers
would be even lower.
It is, however, too early to judge how far interest rates may fall, and the
housing market is in such a mess that, whatever happens, it will take a good
while to recover.
Building society chiefs have been saying privately that September 1992 is
the worst month they can remember in the property market. Even re-mortgage
activity has virtually stopped. Meanwhile, house prices have continued to
fall and 305,000 borrowers are more than six months behind with their
mortgage payments.
A sharp cut in interest rates, if it happens, might restore some consumer
confidence and draw buyers back into the market, but the supply of houses
for sale is likely to outstrip the number of buyers for months.
Also, a partial recovery in the housing market may not be good news for
homeowners with serious mortgage arrears. One reason why lenders have shown
so much forbearance this year to those in trouble with their payments is
that there was no point in putting even more houses on the market under
present conditions. When the market improves, we shall see if lenders remain
as sympathetic to their struggling mortgage customers.
A further snag is that there will be very few 100 or 95 per cent loans
around for first time buyers. The collapse of the mortgage indemnity
guarantee market means that most would-be home-buyers will have to find a
chunk of cash if they want to enter the housing market.
For the short term, the prospect of a fall in rates might deter many
would-be buyers from entering the market. 'People should stay calm and not
take any decisions hastily. We do not yet know how things are going to
settle down and it is too early to be very optimistic. The housing market's
problems are so big that they are going to be with us for some time yet
whatever happens,' says John Wriglesworth, a housing finance specialist at
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Savings Rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THEORY, investors in variable-rate deposit accounts linked to the UK
money market stand to come out of the crisis worst.
Sterling is weaker, and the market is already assuming that a base rate cut
is to come. If base rates fall, interest rates for savers are bound to drop.
Savers cannot expect any preferential treatment either - the housing market
is in such difficulties, with arrears and repossessions mounting, that the
priority of banks and building societies will be to help borrowers first.
However, Anna Bowes, of Chase De Vere's Money Line, said no cuts to savings
rates had been made by the end of the week as the institutions waited for
the French vote.
For a minimum deposit of Pounds 250 it is still possible to earn 10 per cent
gross from Scarborough building society's instant access account - not far
short of three times the rate of inflation.
A gross rate as high as 11.75 per cent is available to those who put Pounds
10,000 or more into a Chelsea building society 30-day account.
Tessa rates have tended to be higher than those on normal accounts, with
some still over 12 per cent.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Gilts may
glister - Fixed Interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS could be allowed a hollow laugh at the phrase 'fixed interest'
after the events of the past week. But the attractions of an unchanging
interest rate are understandable.
The basis of most fixed interest products in the UK is the conventional UK
government bond (gilt). These can be invested in directly, via forms at your
Post Office, or through a gilts unit trust, which will charge more but
brings the benefits of professional fund management.
Gilts pay a fixed rate based on their original price of 100p, but the return
to investors depends on the trading price. A gilt originally yielding 5 per
cent will yield 10 per cent for someone who buys it for 50p.
Gilt prices were affected by two issues this week: the prospects of base
rate cuts, and of higher inflation. The former boosted the prices of short
dated gilts, while the latter depressed long dated prices. Simon Briscoe, of
Midland Montagu, says: 'Looking at a horizon of two or three years, I think
the 9 per cent yields on offer at the moment will look very attractive.'
Actuaries managing guaranteed income bonds have in many cases withdrawn from
offering any rate, and are awaiting the result of the French referendum.
According to Baronworth Investment Services, the best rates available have
slipped slightly, but 8.53 per cent is still available over one year (from
Prosperity Life), while Laurentian Life is offering 8.95 per cent over five
years. These figures are net only of basic rate tax - top-rate taxpayers
must pay more.
Some building societies also offer fixed rates - for example, the Coventry
is offering 10.6 per cent gross fixed until January 31 1994 for investments
of more than Pounds 20,000.

Inflation-beaters - Index Linked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMED that Britain faced a decade of low inflation. But sterling's
effective devaluation means that inflation might return, as the lower pound
forces up import prices. How can savers protect themselves?
The two obvious investments are index-linked National Savings certificates,
and gilts. The former offer a tax-free rate of 4.5 per cent, plus inflation,
if held for five years. So, if you assume that inflation will average 5 per
cent between now and 1997, the certificates will return a tax-free 9.5 per
cent. But if you surrender them within five years, you will not get such a
good return.
Index-linked gilts are rather more complicated but can offer protection over
a longer term - one issue does not mature until 2030. The repayment value is
based on the change in the retail price index (RPI) between the time of
issue and the date of maturity. (For technical reasons, a date eight months
before issue and maturity is used for indexation purposes). Thus, if the RPI
rises from 100 to 200 over the life of the gilt, it will be repaid at double
its issue price.
In addition, a small income is paid very year - normally 2 or 2.5 per cent -
which also increases in line with the RPI.
Because of these complications, the small investor cannot know for sure what
the actual return to maturity on an indexed gilt will be. You can only work
out the real (after inflation) return; on long-dated issues, that is now
more than 4 per cent.
With conventional gilt yields at more than 9 per cent and inflation at 3.6
per cent, it might seem that a fixed-rate gilt offers a better real return.
But the bulk of the return from an indexed gilt comes from capital gain,
which is tax-free.
Buying most conventional gilts means receiving the bulk of the return in
taxable income. Higher rate taxpayers might, therefore, find index-linked
particularly attractive.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Buyers take
care - Winners and Losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the stock market's euphoric reaction to sterling's devaluation, and
the assumption that interest rate cuts will follow, buyers were selective in
the shares they picked. There will be an immediate boost to the profits of
companies with overseas operations, because of the effect of translating
their foreign currency profits at a lower sterling rate. Groups such as
Lasmo, Unilever, Tomkins, Inchcape and Siebe make high proportions of their
profits abroad.
A lower rate for the pound also helps exporters, although this effect is
mitigated by the recessions in many countries which normally buy from the
UK. Big exporters include Guinness, British Aerospace and De la Rue.
Sterling's fall also makes imports more expensive, so companies which are
competing with imports - for example, textiles produced in cheap labour
areas - will have some of the pressure removed. Coats Viyella shares jumped
because of its high foreign exposure and improved competitiveness at home.
Losers were companies without overseas exposure, like stores and food
retailers, water and electricity companies, life insurance and banks. Some
were losers on other grounds.
Throughout the recession, investors have concentrated their portfolios on
defensive shares: those which would fare better in hard economic times.
These include food retailers, utilities like water and electricity, and drug
companies. Now, the situation is reversed. The market is looking for a
resumption of economic growth and is pushing up the shares of cyclical
stocks which would do best from recovery.
Thus, companies in the building sector saw their shares rise while the
expectation of lower interest rates also boosted store groups such as MFI
Furniture and Dixons which sell household goods

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Relief deal for French farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission was last night due to announce a relief package for
hard-pressed small French farmers, who all opinion polls say will vote
massively against the Maastricht treaty in tomorrow's referendum.
The measures follow Commission pledges to review anomalies left unresolved
when the Common Agricultural Policy was radically reformed in May. But the
timing reflects a plea for help from Mr Louis Mermaz, French agriculture
minister, who wrote to Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, 10 days ago
seeking eight changes to the CAP reform package.
Mr Delors was due to make the announcement in France last night, according
to senior Commission officials.
Small dairy farmers who keep 'suckler' cows for beef production, most of
them in central France, should get additional premium payments worth about
Pounds 100m, the officials said. The proposal, though approved by Brussels,
still has to be endorsed by EC farm ministers, who meet in Brussels on
Monday.
In southern France, producers of durum wheat (used largely for pasta) are
expected to have restored to them the 25 per cent premium over ordinary
wheat, abolished under the CAP reform except in a restricted list of
'sensitive areas'. The cost of this is unclear, as the Commission has not
finalised the proposal.
Although only a fraction of the more than 1m small farmers in central and
southern France will benefit, officials say a sweetener may temper their
hostility towards the EC.
Although Maastricht has nothing to do with the CAP reform, French government
opinion polls from as far back as mid-June revealed a bedrock of 70 per cent
opposition to the treaty among farmers.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: 'Sterling was being sold like water
running out of a tap'

IF THERE was a moment when Norman Lamont knew that his economic policy was
in ruins, it came a few seconds after 11am last Wednesday.
As sunshine streamed into Parliament Square, Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer rose from his desk in the Treasury, and stepped into his
richly-panelled outer office.
Half an hour earlier he had called John Major at the Old Admiralty building
in Whitehall where the prime minister was temporarily housed while repairs
were being undertaken to Number 10 Downing Street. Could he raise raise
interest rates by 2 percentage points? Yes, said Major over the secure
telephone line. Devaluation had to be avoided. The government's credibility
was at stake.
The announcement was to be released to the news agencies on the stroke of
11am. It would come as hammer-blow to a nation battered by recession.
A small group of advisers, the chancellor at their centre, gathered round
the Reuters news agency screen outside his inner sanctum.
All morning the Bank of England had been fighting a desperate battle to save
the pound from collapsing against the D-Mark and dropping through its agreed
floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. Billions of pounds were used
to try to stem the tide. Sterling revived briefly, then dropped back.
As Big Ben struck 11, Lamont and his team remained transfixed by the numbers
on the screen which monitored the currency markets. The chimes stopped and
still the pound was sinking. A minute passed. The chancellor broke the
silence. 'It is not moving,' he said. The government would fight a
desperate, rearguard action but the battle was already lost.
The extraordinary events of this week which have engulfed the pound,
shattered the British government's economic policy and shaken the ERM to its
core began in earnest two weekends ago in the elegant city of Bath.
European finance officials, under Lamont's chairmanship, met to prepare,
among other things, for the possibility of a No vote when the French deliver
their verdict on the Maastricht Treaty on European union tomorrow. There
would be turmoil on the markets. They would need to be united.
But the cracks were beginning to appear. The Germans argued that the weaker
currencies in the ERM, such as the pound and the lira, were out of line with
the rest. Germany's partners responded that the Bundesbank was keeping
interest rates too high and stifling growth.
Despite subsequent denials that this had ever been mooted, the German
delegation, led by Theo Waigel, the finance minister, and Bundesbank
president Helmut Schlesinger, offered to reduce their interest rates.
The price: a wide-ranging realignment of the mechanism  - one which, by
definition, would involve the pound. 'In the event, the others weren't ready
for it,' said one German official later.
In his statement after the meeting Lamont presented the outcome as a victory
for Britain. He had secured from the mighty Bundesbank a promise not to
raise interest rates. The following morning German interest rates were cut
by a grudging quarter of a percentage point and Britain's Tory tabloids took
up the theme. The Bundesbank was portrayed as buckling to political
pressure, its cherished independence compromised.
The Bundesbank's president later confided that he was so angry at the
conduct of the meeting that, at one point, he nearly walked out.
When Schlesinger set the record straight the next day, the private
disagreements became public. The markets began to smell blood.
After that, the markets began seriously to test the ERM's resolve. Currency
dealers sold Italian lire, the ERM's weakest link. By last weekend they had
sold more than Pounds 8.5bn worth of lire for D-Marks.
Last weekend increasingly worried finance officials across Europe hurriedly
conferred and cobbled together a deal: Italy would devalue the lira by 7 per
cent. In return the Italians would support a broader realignment. The
British contin-ued to resist.
The Bank of England had plenty of ammunition to fight the speculators should
they turn on the pound, or so it thought. Its Dollars 44.4bn (Pounds 25bn)
in reserves at the end of August had been supplemented by a more recent
Pounds 7.27bn borrowing in foreign currencies.
Shortly before lunchtime on Tuesday the lira began to sink. For sterling the
die was cast. Traders were beginning to believe that one devaluation was not
enough. 'As the lira fell, we started to notice that there was a big pick-up
in trading in sterling against the D-Mark,' said Mark Austin of the Hongkong
and Shanghai Bank.
By Tuesday afternoon, the currency again heading towards DM2.80. By late on
Tuesday, traders reckoned the Bank of England had bought around Pounds 3bn
 -but the pound was not responding. 'What are the British doing?' asked one
French dealer. 'If the franc were in this situation, we would have overnight
rates up at 40 per cent.'
But Britain is in the grip of a deep recession. Raising interest rates was
political anathema.
By Tuesday night the pound closed in London just a fifth of a pfennig above
its ERM floor of DM2.778, its lowest ever in the mechanism. There was a
growing feeling in Whitehall that the currency could be tipped over the edge
unless something was done.
The Treasury called a crisis meeting in Lamont's office with senior Bank of
England officials.
Beneath two glittering chandeliers, the details of the following day's
tactics were plotted around a large oaken table. Besides the chancellor, the
key actors who were to shape tactics on Black Wednesday were there: Sir
Terry Burns, the Treasury's gritty permanent secretary ('keep smiling' is
one of his aphorisms); his right-hand man, economist Alan Budd; Andrew
Turnbull, in charge of monetary policy; Bill Robinson, the chancellor's
special political adviser; and Sir Nigel Wicks, the Treasury's laconic
second permanent secretary in charge of international affairs.
The Bank group included: Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the aristocratic governor;
Eddie George, deputy governor and the man in overall charge of market
operations; Ian Plenderleith, associate director in charge of markets; Tony
Coleby, director of monetary affairs; and Andrew Crockett, international
director.
George, known in the City as Hard Eddie, outlined the strategy: take each
part of the battle as it comes; escalate the defence in discrete stages.
First there would be large and overt Bank intervention. A rise in interest
rates would be held in reserve for later in the day. One official pondered
as he left the room at about 8pm: 'I wonder if it will be enough.'
Elsewhere, events were already conspiring to thwart their plans. Five hours
earlier in Frankfurt, seat of the Bundesbank, two journalists, one from
Germany's principal business newspaper, Handelsblatt, and one from the Wall
Street Journal, were interviewing Schlesinger.
They released a summary to the news agencies. Schlesinger was reported as
saying that a more wide-ranging realignment of the ERM than the devaluation
of the lira, agreed at the weekend, could have reduced turbulence in the
currency markets. This was code for saying that the Germans believed a
sterling devaluation was necessary.
The story was later denied. But what Schlesinger was quoted as saying was
too close to the known views of many top officials in the central bank  -
including his own. It was dynamite.
When the FT called the Bank of England and the Treasury to seek reaction,
near panic ensued in Whitehall and Threadneedle Street.
Lamont was with his wife Rosemary for dinner at the Regent's Park home of
the US ambassador, Mr Ray Seitz. Treasury officials called him with the news
as they fought desperately to lessen the impact of the story. Leigh
Pemberton twice called Schlesinger at his home near Frankfurt to try to
clarify the report.
The academic Mr Schlesinger  - who years ago told a Bundesbank colleague:
'the markets do not interest me'  - appeared bemused by the news that his
quoted comments were creating havoc on the foreign exchange markets.
'The interview has not been authorised,' he twice told the Bank of England
governor, referring to the fact that both correspondents had promised to
check their text with him before publication. He appeared 'puzzled' by the
confusion, said a British official.
Throughout the night, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of
Japan supported sterling.
By 7.30am on Wednesday, a team of eight foreign exchange dealers assembled
in Eddie George's room in Threadneedle Street, hunched over their screens to
buy pounds. Plenderleith ordered them to spend about Pounds 2bn in three
separate interventions. By 8am the pound was pinned to its floor.
Dealers were baffled by the Bank of England's actions. Said David Cocker,
treasury adviser at Chemical Bank at about 10am. 'Why aren't interest rates
going up? Can we really be sure that the government is that committed?' By
8.30, the Treasury crisis group re-assembled in the chancellor's room. The
mood was sombre. Plenderleith called Lamont over a secure hot line. The
Chancellor, having spoken to the prime minister earlier, ordered more
intervention from the Bank's foreign currency reserves. Leigh-Pemberton and
George were smuggled into the meeting through a side entrance to avoid
photographers.
As the heavy artillery in the City began sterling's day long pounding, Major
took his armour-plated Jaguar the two-minute drive down Whitehall to the
Admiralty for a long-scheduled 9am meeting with Michael Heseltine, Douglas
Hurd, Kenneth Clarke, Richard Ryder, the chief whip, and Sir Norman Fowler,
the Conservative party chairman. The subject was supposed to be Maastricht
 -but the meeting became a de facto war cabinet.
By 10.30am, the call everyone was dreading from the chancellor came through.
Major left the meeting to take it. Hearing that the pound was sinking he
calmly approved the two percentage point interest rate hike to 12 per cent.
The prime minister made certain that this core group of ministers would
convene for the key decisions  - an insurance policy that the law of
'collective responsibility' would be invoked in full.
At 11am, the move was announced. The chancellor's group was aghast as the
pound barely moved. One member of the group thought to himself: 'It's all
over.' The currency market was coming to the same conclusion.
Lamont made a statement to explain his move: 'As the current extraordinary
pressures and uncertainties abate, I hope it will be possible to bring
interest rates back down.'
The markets were less than impressed. According to one analyst at the time:
'This may be what the public wants to hear, but it isn't nearly enough.'
By noon, Lamont ordered more intervention. He would say, later, that it was
like trying to stop a whirlwind.
There followed a short discussion about whether suspension from the ERM
would be in the Treasury's best interests. At 1pm. sandwiches were called in
to the war room. Many were left untouched.
When US markets opened at around 1.30 in London, US fund managers dealt in
huge sums. As one dealer put it: 'Sterling was being sold like water running
out of a tap.
At 2:15, the Bank fired its best shot, raising interest rates to 15 per
cent, the first time in history it had raised rates twice in a day  - both
since rescinded. The stock market's reaction was telling: it rallied because
traders believed even this would not stop the run on the pound. Sterling
would have to be devalued.
Total central bank intervention on Wednesday alone may have exceeded Pounds
15bn.
One senior minister commented afterwards: 'We were buying every single pound
in the foreign exchange markets. The reserves were haemorrhaging.'
Major began making plans for sterling's withdrawal from the ERM. He called
Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, and Chancellor Kohl of Germany.
Just before 4pm, the Bank of England organised a conference call with fellow
central banks and told them sterling was being suspended from the ERM.
Faced with the full scale of the defeat, Major once again summoned his
cabinet colleagues at 5pm, this time with Lamont and Leigh Pemberton.
The prime minister and chancellor spelled out their drastic solution. One
Whitehall insider says that while Treasury and Bank officials appeared close
to panic, Major remained calm. Retreat from the ERM was formally agreed.
Just over two hours later, with the twilight fading in the Treasury's
neo-classical courtyard, Lamont adjusted his tie and began to speak to the
forest of microphones and cameras.
'Today,' he began,' has been an extremely difficult and turbulent day ...'
That night he worked till 3am. Civil servants said the next morning he
returned to his office with a smile on his face and a spring in his step.
'I have had an excellent night's sleep and I feel fine,' he told them. 'For
the first time in a long while I haven't had to worry about the pound.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Europe's prospects hang on Germany /
Assessing the outlook for the continent's economies in the wake of the ERM
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN interest rates have fallen, a number of European countries have
devalued their currencies, but the outlook for the continent's economy
remains as uncertain now as it did a week ago.
Economic growth looks set to slow further next year in most European
countries, the result of the high interest rates in Germany and throughout
Europe that are responsible for the crisis within the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM).
The economic consequences of Germany's continuing power struggle between the
government and the Bundesbank will continue to dominate the European
economic scene, whether or not the ERM survives its current turbulence.
Only the UK can be relatively confident that its economic growth rate will
accelerate somewhat over the coming months as a result of last week's
turmoil. Burdened by unusually heavy personal and corporate-sector debts,
the UK economy has suffered more than elsewhere from the high interest rate
floor that Germany's tight monetary policy has given to Europe.
Freed from the ERM constraint, the UK government should now be able to cut
British interest rates below Germany's so long as it postpones any refixing
of sterling against the D-Mark.
Elsewhere the immediate outlook looks much less certain. Any positive
impulse towards lower European interest rates as a result of last Monday's
disappointingly small cut in the German discount and Lombard rates has
probably been offset by the rise in interest rate differentials resulting
from the growing uncertainty within the ERM.
A general breakdown of the ERM would be one possible route to lower interest
rates outside Germany. Far more likely, a No or narrow Yes vote in Sunday's
French referendum could provoke a similar speculative attack on the franc
and a general ERM realignment. Appreciation of the D-Mark against still more
currencies, and the resulting disinflation within Germany, would probably be
enough to persuade the Bundesbank to cut German rates once more.
For France, this could mean a welcome fall in interest rates. But the
chances of a noticeable acceleration in French economic growth before 1994
still look poor, even if interest rates were to start to fall.
In Italy, the opportunity to cut its interest rates below those in Germany
may remain elusive, despite its temporary departure from the ERM. The
government's finances remain in a parlous state. And without the stick of
the ERM commitment, and maybe also the carrot of membership of a European
monetary union, the Italian parliament may be reluctant to agree to a budget
package which bites deeply into its powers of patronage.
The government's proposed deficit reduction package of L93,000bn (Pounds
42bn) in new taxes and spending cuts in 1993 is bound to reduce Italian
economic growth in the short term if it receives parliamentary approval. But
the package may still prove too small to convince markets that the
government can finally set the public debt on a downward path. Unless the
government can also obtain executive powers to allow further budget
consolidation, the Bank of Italy will have to keep interest rates painfully
high.
For Italy, the collapse of the Maastricht Treaty could spell disaster. But
elsewhere in Europe, freedom from the treaty's tough fiscal policy
convergence criteria would also be good for economic growth.
Germany's economic problems will continue to place a question mark over the
medium-term prospects for European economic growth.
'Europe's growth prospects will improve and interest rates fall as a result
of an ERM breakdown,' says Mr David Walton, economist at Goldman Sachs
investment bank. 'But the medium-term outlook will remain closely tied to
events in Germany. If the German economy stays very weak, then the chances
of a robust European recovery are poor, whether or not the ERM survives.'
Whether slow growth will turn to recession depends, in large part, on how
long the Bundesbank will keep German interest rates high. Unless the
government can come up with a credible plan to cap its growing fiscal
deficit, interest rates may stay high for some time yet. ERM or no ERM, a
recessionary Germany spells danger for European economic growth.

ITALIANS have reacted with a mixture of shock and resignation to the
swingeing public spending cuts in next year's budget, unveiled by Prof
Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, on Thursday.
The L93,000bn (Pounds 42bn) package of revenue increases and savings is the
biggest attack on health and social security spending since Italy's welfare
state was set up after the war.
In a first reaction to the cuts, which also involve a wage freeze for about
3.5m public-sector workers, the country's three union federations yesterday
announced a series of demonstrations, culminating in a one-day stoppage for
public sector workers on October 2.
However, the unions stopped short of calling a general strike, as demanded
by some more militant members who took to the streets of big cities
yesterday in protest. The wage freeze should save L9,900bn next year.
Around 20m Italians will lose their entitlement to free outpatient health
care under the decision to make all families with incomes over L40m a year
pay for prescriptions and general practitioners' and specialists' services
in a move expected to save L5,000bn.
A further L13,750bn will come from by cutting the costs of the state pension
system, threatened with bankruptcy.
The measures triggered a recovery in the financial markets, with government
bond prices making up ground after Thursday's panic selling and share prices
rising by around 2 per cent. The value of the lira remained broadly stable
in relatively quiet trading in Milan.
Stockbrokers welcomed the measures, in spite of the introduction of a new
tax on companies' net worth.
Rates for securities repurchase agreements between the Bank of Italy and
commercial banks declined slightly to 21.01 per cent yesterday, after
hitting an all-time record of 22.22 per cent on Thursday.
Mr Luigi Abete, chairman of the Confindustria employers' federation,
expressed satisfaction with the government's measures, but warned that the
proposals would have to be translated into fact if recent sacrifices were to
have any effect.
Representatives of small businesses and shopkeepers' federations, the two
groups most often accused of tax evasion, said the moves were 'inevitable',
and rejected claims their members were persistent tax-dodgers. Denying
reports of unjustified price rises for foodstuffs following the lira's
devaluation, the shopkeepers expressed concern about the possible effects on
employment of the latest measures, which could cut consumption.
In a step overshadowed by the budget, the Senate, the upper house of
parliament, approved the Maastricht treaty on European union.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Poll shows backing for referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST Germans, in both east and west, favour holding a referendum on the
Maastricht treaty on European union, according a comprehensive opinion poll.
Some 75 per cent in the west, and 85 per cent in the east, want a vote.
At the same time, a narrow majority is still in favour of the treaty,
although many more believe that the replacement of the D-Mark with a single
European currency would be wrong.
There is a growing feeling that the European Community brings Germany more
costs than benefits, and scepticism about the advantages of the single EC
market.
The poll found more dissatisfaction with the German government, and with the
opposition, than at any time in the past 15 years. The only reassurance for
the political establishment was that support for the extreme-right-wing
Republicans has decreased slightly since the last poll.
Support for the EC has deteriorated rapidly among German people since the
Maastricht Treaty was agreed. This is not reflected in political circles.
In east Germany - with 20 per cent of the population - 55 per cent would
vote No in a referendum, against 43 per cent saying Yes. However they are
outweighed by western voters, 47 per cent of whom would vote Yes, against 37
per cent voting No, and 16 per cent undecided. The combined result would
leave a 46-to-41 per cent majority in favour, with 13 per cent undecided.
The overwhelming cause of dissatisfaction is concern about the future of the
D-Mark: 68 per cent in the west, and 75 per cent in the east, oppose its
replacement by a single currency. Eighty per cent believe a single currency
would be less stable.
All the views spell gloom for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has adopted
European integration as his theme for uniting the country. He comes bottom
in the poll of politicians' popularity.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bonn fears collapse into vicious
circle of recession - Pressure for interest rates cut may become
irresistible

<TEXT>
ONE OF THE great ironies of the soaring strength of the Deutsche Mark on
European currency markets is that it comes amid grim prospects for the
German economy.
Far from providing the motor for any European economic recovery, the soaring
costs of German unification threaten to become the brake on hopes of revival
in the rest of the European Community.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the German economics minister, warned in his budget
speech a week ago that drastic action must be taken to prevent the economy
getting locked into a vicious circle. He saw a failure of the east German
economy to pick up from its dramatic slump, coinciding with a western
economy held back from revival by the huge costs of state transfers to the
east.
It is those transfers, running at around DM150bn (Pounds 57bn) a year, which
are weighing down on the capital markets, and persuading the Bundesbank to
keep real interest rates high to hold back credit expansion and inflation.
Yet the transfers, overwhelmingly for infrastructure spending, unemployment
benefit and wage subsidies, are not yet having any appreciable effect on
recovery in the east, where industrial investment is running at only 60 per
cent of the western per capita level, suggesting that the east is if
anything likely to fall further behind the west.
The business magazine Wirtschaftswoche yesterday poured scorn on hopes of an
economic turnround in the wake of the Bundesbank's marginal cut in interest
rates last Monday.
It cited figures of an accelerating decline in business confidence
throughout the past year in western Germany, while in the east, the mood
remained overwhelmingly negative.
The gloom was reflected in the latest monthly report of the Bundesbank,
published this week, which warned that the duration and size of western
subsidies for the east would be far greater than first calculated.
Fears over the cost of unification, and the growing unwillingness of western
citizens to pay more (more than two thirds now say they are unwilling to
freeze or cut their own incomes to help eastern recovery), have inspired
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' among the
central government, opposition, local and state governments, employers and
trade unions.
While hopes for the pact are high, the starting points of the participants
are far apart.
Mr Kohl and the employers are clearly looking for severe wage restraint in
both east and west, to encourage investment. The trade unions are adamant
that no such restraint will be forthcoming without substantial increases in
the contributions of industry and the better-paid to investment in the east.
Mr Mollemann is looking for big reforms in labour practices to cut
industrial costs. His proposals arouse fury from both the unions and the
opposition Social Democrats.
The prospects of a deal on the solidarity pact, supposed to be agreed by the
end of the year, are therefore remote. Unemployment and hidden unemployment
in the east are stoking racial unrest there, with no end to the rash of
attacks on hostels occupied by foreign workers and asylum seekers.
The domestic political pressures on the Bundesbank to relax its harsh
interest rate policies may become irresistible by the end of the year, for
fear of tipping the economy into full recession.

FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Euro Disney packages to improve
group visits

EURO DISNEY, which has been clouded by bad publicity since the opening this
spring of its Euro Disneyland theme park near Paris, is introducing special
packages to try to lift group visits.
Since the opening, Euro Disneyland has come under criticism for failing to
make proper provision for block bookings, particularly for coach parties.
The company yesterday announced a new series of deals for group visits which
will include discounts of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent and 4 per cent
commission for travel agents. It is offering free entrance to the theme park
to coach drivers for a trial period.
Euro Disney is anxious to prevent a significant fall in attendance during
the seasonally slow autumn and winter months. It has always expected
attendance to slacken during this period, but has hoped to counter the
expected decline in foreign visitors by encouraging the French (whose
attendance has so far been below target) to visit when the park will be
quieter. The group packages form part of this initiative.
Euro Disney recently announced that a record 94,000 people had visited the
park on September 6 and that it had attracted over 6m visitors in its first
five months. However, the 6m tally suggests that Euro Disneyland will not
meet its initial target of 11m visitors by the end of its first year.
Societe des Bains de Mer de Monaco, the Monte Carlo-based hotels and leisure
group, saw net profits slip to FFr165.4m (Dollars 30.62m) in the year to
March 30 from FFr178.2m in the previous year. Turnover also dipped to
FFr1.7bn from FFr1.72bn. The group invested FFr280m during the year, notably
on renovating the Monte Carlo Beach Hotel.

staff

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONTARIO Hydro, North America's second-biggest power utility and one of the
most active international borrowers, is to cut 2,000 jobs and pare capital
spending amid growing public criticism over its economic management.
The utility, which is owned by the Ontario provincial government, fuelled
anger among business and individual consumers this week by announcing a 7.9
per cent rate increase for 1993 at a time when Canada's inflation rate is
less than 2 per cent. Electricity rates went up by 11.8 per cent this year.
The planned staff cuts amount to about 7 per cent of the total workforce. In
addition, the utility is considering cutting its capital spending by about
CDollars 10bn (USDollars 8.10bn) over the next 10 years, equal to about a
quarter of its planned investment budget.
The financial squeeze stems partly from the recession's impact on demand for
electricity. But Hydro has also suffered heavy cost overruns on the CDollars
14bn Darlington nuclear power station, now in the process of being
commissioned. The utility has said that rate increases could be limited to
about 2 per cent if it was not burdened by Darlington and by the cost of
repairing its other nuclear reactors.
A growing number of municipalities and large commercial users are
investigating construction of their own power generating facilities to
provide cheaper electricity. Mr Marc Eliesen, the utility's chairman,
earlier this week warned that siphoning revenues away from Hydro in this way
might require even higher rate increases in future.

SIEMENS, the Munich-based electronics and electricals company, is planning
to cut up to 1,800 jobs worldwide in its medical technology division in
1992-93.
The move comes a month after Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI),
Siemens's loss-making computer subsidiary, announced plans to cut its
workforce by 6,000 by September 1995.
It blamed a slowdown in market growth in Germany, and difficult conditions
in overseas markets, especially the US and the former Soviet Union. The
division's turnover was DM7.4bn (Dollars 4.93bn) last year and there are
31,000 employees worldwide, 13,000 in Germany.

PRE-TAX profits at Sasib, the Italian precision engineering company
controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir group, collapsed to L23.3bn in the
first half of this year from L61.1bn in the same period of 1991.
Sasib, which has expanded rapidly through acquisitions, often of loss-making
companies, blamed the fall on a 11.4 per cent drop in turnover to L322.8bn
(Dollars 252.4m) and the fact that a higher proportion of sales in the
period comprised low-margin items.
The company claimed the plunge in first-half earnings was not indicative of
prospects for the full year. By the end of last month, turnover had reached
L449bn, thanks to strong sales in July and August, leaving the total for the
first eight months down by only 3.3 per cent against the same period last
year.

OKI Electric Industry, the Japanese communications equipment maker, expects
to make an unconsolidated pre-tax loss of Y25bn (Dollars 200m) for the year
ending next March, its first loss for six years.
Oki blamed the slump in the semiconductor market. It added it will suspend
its dividend payment for the first time in 14 years. The company had
originally projected a Y2bn pre-tax profit and a Y3.5 dividend per share.
It revised down its sales forecast to Y580bn from Y600bn, and said it would
post an after-tax loss of Y16bn instead of an after-tax profit of Y9bn.
For the first half to September, Oki said it would register Y19bn in pre-tax
losses and Y9bn in after-tax losses, on sales of Y260bn. Oki said capital
spending for the full year would be reduced to Y50bn from the planned Y53bn.
The company said it would try to cut the workforce by 2,000 over the next
three years.
Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker, has revised upwards its forecast
for the interim period to September due to brisk sales in video game
machines. Its half-year pre-tax profit is expected to rise 6.5 per cent to
Y81bn. It plans to increase its interim dividend by Y10 per share to Y35.

BROKEN Hill Proprietary yesterday reported an after-tax operating profit of
ADollars 258.9m (USDollars 189m) for the three months ended August, 1992,
almost 11 per cent up on the same quarter last year.
Earnings per share for the Australian mining, energy and steel group
increased by more than 6 per cent in the quarter to 20.2 cents from 19
cents.
BHP plans to pay an unchanged interim dividend of 19.5 cents.
The steel operations recorded the best results among the company's
divisions, with profits up 8.2 per cent to ADollars 53m. The result was
attributed to profits from New Zealand Steel and to a reduction in the cost
of steel production.
Petroleum operations rose 6 per cent to ADollars 137.2m, thanks mainly to
the higher US dollar oil price and the weaker Australian dollar. Production
was also higher during the quarter with production starting in two fields:
Skua and Kutubu.
The minerals division suffered a setback with profits falling 10.5 per cent
to ADollars 158.4m. The weaker result was due to lower prices for coal, iron
ore and manganese ore.
Minerals division sales rose to ADollars 1.1bn from ADollars 1.06bn. Steel
division sales rose to ADollars 1.47bn from ADollars 1.4bn.

FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Profits warning by Philips sends
share price tumbling

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Philips, the Dutch electronics group, tumbled by nearly 7.5 per
cent yesterday after the company cautioned that profits would likely be
halved this year.
Philips said that full-year results from normal business operations were
expected to be halved from the 1991 level of Fl 981m (Dollars 557m) because
of the failure of world economic recovery to emerge, the continued malaise
in consumer electronics industry and the steep decline in the value of the
dollar.
The warning, which followed June's statement that 1992 results were likely
to fall below 1991 levels, caused Philips's shares to close down Fl 1.80 at
Fl 22.80, though above the new 12-month lows of about Fl 22.00 reached
earlier in the day.
Philips is scheduled to publish third-quarter figures on November 5. Last
month it said second-quarter net profit before extraordinary items dropped
by 56 per cent, reflecting difficult trading conditions in consumer
electronics, a sector which accounts for almost half of group turnover of Fl
57bn.
Difficulties prompted by fierce price wars in television sets, video
cassette recorders and other types of consumer electronics have been
exacerbated since the summer by the steep decline in the dollar, which
recently touched a series of new lows against the guilder.
Ironically, the latest profit warning came on the day that Mr Jan Timmer,
company president, officially opened the world's first factory for the
production of digital compact cassettes (DCC), a new audio product that
Philips hopes will prove to be as successful as the analogue audio cassette.
The factory, located in the Dutch town of Amersfoort, has been operational
since July. It is owned by London-based PolyGram, Philips's 80 per cent
owned music company, whose good profit performance in the software side of
the consumer electronics industry has not been able to compensate entirely
for the slide in prices commanded by the Dutch company's hardware.
DCC players, which Philips is counting on to revitalise consumer interest in
hi-fi equipment, are scheduled to go on sale in Japan on Monday, to be
followed by parts of western Europe in October and the US in November.

KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering, shipping and shipbuilding group, has
acquired the Warnow shipyard in eastern Germany for a symbolic NKr4m
(Dollars 682,000).
The deal, which propels Kvaerner into the very top league of world
shipbuilders, pushed the company's shares up sharply yesterday. Its A shares
jumped 8 per cent yesterday.
After 13 months of difficult negotiations the Treuhandanstalt, the German
state privatisation agency, has agreed to fund a NKr2bn restructuring
programme for the yard to be undertaken by Kvaerner through 1996.
The German agency will also cover losses of up to NKr2bn on new contracts
during the yard's restructuring.
'The sum is fixed and cannot be readjusted to match the actual level of
losses,' Kvaerner said. The yard has contracts to build seven ships.
For its part, Kvaerner will supply the yard with technology and knowhow
estimated at NKr400m and will provide NKr80m in cash for the purchases of
services required by the yard.
Kvaerner will invest an estimated NKr60m annually from 1996 for the yard's
maintenance.
It will shed 1,000 of its 3,000-strong workforce, costs which will be
covered by Treuhandanstalt.
The acquisition makes Kvaerner Europe's biggest shipbuilder. Shipbuilding
accounted for one-third of Kvaerner's NKr6bn plus revenue in 1991.
In 1988, Kvaerner acquired Scotland's Govan shipyard and three years later
purchased Finland's Masa-Yards.
The company said the Warnow yard was expected to generate revenue from 1996
and that the market for shipbuilding would improve significantly during the
second half of the 1990s.
The shipyard will build vessels of up to 180,000 deadweight tonnes.
It was established in 1955 and has largely delivered specialised tonnage to
eastern Europe, but has also supplied a number of vessels to the West.

<TEXT>
PLACER Dome, the Vancouver-based gold producer, is making a long-heralded
move into base metals by buying a 50 per cent stake in the Zaldivar copper
project in northern Chile.
Placer has agreed to pay USDollars 100m in cash to join Outokumpu of Finland
in developing a mine at Zaldivar.
In addition, the Canadian company will provide project financing of up to
Dollars 400m. The deal is expected to be finalised by December.
A final decision whether to go ahead with construction of the Dollars 500m
mine is expected in mid-1993, with copper cathode production starting two
years later.
Placer has been looking for some time for an outlet for its large cash
reserves. Its diversification plans suffered a setback last year when it
decided not to go ahead with development of the low-grade Mount Milligan
copper and gold deposit in British Columbia. It wrote off its Dollars 230m
investment in the project.
The Zaldivar project is close to La Escondida, the world's richest copper
mine which began operations in late 1990.
According to a feasibility study done last May, Zaldivar contains 560m
tonnes of ore with a grade of 0.62 per cent copper. Placer estimated that
140m tonnes of the ore has a grade of 1.2 per cent.
In addition, the recently-discovered Pinta Verde deposit, 1 km from
Zaldivar, contains 200m tonnes of ore with a grade of 0.62 per cent.
Placer and Outokumpu said there was considerable potential to increase the
resource.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): 'Come back
inflation, all is forgiven' - The Fund Managers' View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSIONAL fund managers who saw interest rates and stock prices gyrate
wildly this week are still pausing for breath.
David Rough, investment director at the UK insurer Legal and General, urged
caution before taking a view on stock or bond markets. 'I'd be a lot happier
if I knew exactly what the government's policies are,' he said.
If the government has decided to allow a decline in real interest rates  -
the difference between inflation and bond yields - the overall picture could
be good for equities. But, if the decoupling of sterling from the ERM is a
temporary affair, and John Major is still aiming for zero-inflation growth,
the picture could be very different.
'After the French vote (on whether to ratify the Maastricht Treaty) on
Sunday, I think we will have a clearer idea,' Rough said.
But with stock prices up 8 per cent in two days, fund managers are queueing
to jump on the equities bandwagon. 'The move to deflate sterling is very
bullish for equities,' said Hugh Sloane, investment director at GT
Management. 'Now that sterling has been floated there is a good chance that
the UK can move out of recession.'
Already, GT Management has decided to increase its weighting in UK equities
from 50 per cent of its total portfolio to something comfortably above that,
he said.
GT Management wants equities of companies with large overseas earnings
which, with a weak sterling, will produce hefty increases in revenues.
Shares of companies which are well-placed to benefit from a pick-up in the
UK economy look attractive.
The banking sector is likely to benefit as lower interest rates ease
pressure on hard-pressed borrowers who may be facing repayments
difficulties.
Simon Walters, investment director of Save &amp; Prosper, says that a watershed
occurred on Wednesday when Britain withdrew from the ERM. 'The restrictions
of the ERM have vanished. Come back inflation, all is forgiven.' The result
is good news for equities, he argues, and cyclical, high-yielding stocks
have already started to outperform.
However, the market has already risen to reflect one and probably two
percentage points off base rates. If that fails to happen the market may be
disappointed.
Nevertheless, Walters is looking forward to an export-led boom and he also
believes there could be a psychological boost to the consumer sector if
rates drop back into single figures.
Michael Hart, joint manager of Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, says it
has benefited this week from its big overseas currency exposure.
'If the French vote Yes, I wouldn't be surprised to see UK rates coming down
another notch,' Hart says.
'Given the sharp rally in UK shares, there's no need to race into the stock
market at this level; we've been nibbling away at lower prices. But we've
always been enthusiasts for equities and some institutions may be having
second thoughts about their recent move into bonds.'
Julian St Lawrence, a UK fund manager at Framlington, says that 'We'd be
more cautious than the markets about the speed of interests rate changes,
and thus we could see a correction to the recent rise.
'Nevertheless, equities have offered a pretty low return over the last few
years, and are down in real terms from their peaks of 1987. And we are
particularly interested in small and medium-sized company shares, which have
some catching up to do.'
St Lawrence warns that devaluation will lead to higher prices. 'We would be
surprised if the previous rule of thumb did not apply this time - that a 10
per cent devaluation leads to 10 per cent in inflation spread over a three
to four year period.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Shedding a
light on murky times - What they say - and what they mean Economist Giles
Keating gives an infallible guide to the future . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRIVATE investors, not to mention professional ones, may well be confused by
the events of the last few days. This guide to the events of the next few
weeks will help to shine a light through the murk.
Ireland, Portugal, Denmark and France issue vehement denials of any
intention to devalue:
Get a large bank loan in punts, escudos, krone or French francs and invest
it all in D-marks.
The French narrowly vote No in tomorrow's referendum:
Other people may be selling, give them a little time to drive down prices,
then move in and buy (some) UK stocks, buy gilts, buy European equities. A
No vote would destabilise what is left of the ERM and force the French franc
out of its band. John Major could pretend that the whole thing was a D-mark
revaluation, not a sterling devaluation, and pop the pound back into the
ERM. Even Schlesinger would be happy enough to cut interest rates.
Result: UK interest rates fall, though not very far, and the political
crisis is defused. The losers are companies heavily dependent on UK domestic
demand, because interest rates on this scenario would come down less than in
a free float.
The French vote Yes:
France might get away without devaluing - Major and Lamont will have lost
their chance of slipping sterling quickly back into the ERM behind the
fig-leaf of a general realignment. The pound will go its own way for months,
if not years. The UK can set interest rates mainly to meet domestic needs.
So buy equities, but do not get too enthusiastic. The government is still
keen to tackle inflation, so the interest rate cuts will not be very
generous unless the economy turns down further.
One of the UK's largest and oldest car plants shuts down with massive job
losses:
Buy shares in Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Old factories with 1960s-style
working practices would be uncompetitive even if the rate was DM2 to the
pound. The Japanese plants in Britain would be profitable with sterling at
DM3.50.
Sterling rejoins the ERM, but the Germans do not cut interest rates:
The chancellor has already said this is unlikely, and he is right. Even at a
parity below DM2.95, why should ERM membership be any more sustainable than
before? Sterling did not leave the ERM on Wednesday (sorry, get 'suspended')
because it was in at the wrong level. It left because of whispering by the
Bundesbank about realignments, and because the increase in UK rates was not
matched by a cut in German rates. The same can happen again, unless German
rates fall sharply, or unless (not very likely) the ERM rules are changed to
force the Bundesbank to support sterling properly at times of crisis.
The Chancellor announces a big support package for the housing market:
Sell your house. You will have to slash the price. Then move into rented
accommodation. There has just been a private meeting at No 11 Downing Street
at which the chairmen of the biggest building societies told the Chancellor
how bad things really are.
Even if base rates are cut by 1 or 2 per cent, house prices will still go
down, because consumer confidence is so low and debt burdens so high.
Remember the last attempt to stimulate the housing market, by suspending
stamp duty in late 1991 and the first half of this year?
The government gives in to Tory backbencher demands for much, much lower
interest rates:
Yet another U-turn, so this is quite likely. Buy equities, but do not hold
them too long; but above all buy into dollars, D-marks and yen, in fact
anything you can lay your hands on that is not sterling. In spite of the
UK's deep recession, a big enough fall in the pound will generate some
inflation. So a few index-linked gilts might be a good idea, too.
You might even consider buying a house . . .
Unemployment rises and retail sales fall sharply in both the UK and the US:
In this case hold only big blue chip shares, and even then try to chuck out
the ones with too much domestic business. There is not going to be a 'normal
cyclical upswing' - at best it will be weak in the UK, the US and Europe.
The only areas of the world set for good growth in the next year or so are
places like South China and Mexico. You do not have to buy directly into
their stock markets; instead go for the big global corporations that have
operations in those areas.
The French vote No by a wide margin and the whole ERM collapses:
The TV screens are filled by economists saying how good flexible exchange
rates are, but investors should be very cautious. This is a signal from the
big European nations of a complete inability to co-operate, which is very
dangerous at a time of high debt, high unemployment, and creeping
protectionism. If you want a scenario that points towards a new Great
Depression, this is it.
Giles Keating is director of economics at Credit Suisse First Boston.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): The Week
Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG results event of next week is on Wednesday when British Aerospace
reports. It is the one chance for John Cahill, the distressed group's new
chairman, to clear the decks and produce - as he has promised - a solution
to the company's regional aircraft problem.
At the interim stage a year ago BAe unveiled a sharp fall to pre-tax profits
of Pounds 86m (Pounds 146m) and a Pounds 432m rights issue. Whatever profits
it eked out in the first half of this year will be swamped by restructuring
costs which could approach Pounds 750m.
Next week will bring more results from the battered construction sector. The
reported profit or loss at Tarmac on Tuesday and Costain on Wednesday will
be less interesting than the news on the restructuring efforts essential to
their recoveries.
Tarmac will probably report an interim loss of about Pounds 14m (pre-tax
profit of Pounds 18.2m, itself a sharp decline from the previous year) and a
dividend of 2p (3p). Provisions are likely on the value of its land bank and
for restructuring costs. Investors are also anxious for news of a buyer for
Econowaste, the UK waste management business.
Costain might make a minimal profit of around Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 5.7m) but
it too needs to take some hefty provisions. Partial flotation of its
Australian coal business has yet to be finalised but should generate a
much-needed Pounds 45m or so. But the markets will want to hear of further
restructuring plans.
Barratt Developments, the house builder, took its pain in 1991 with a loss
of Pounds 106m. For the year to June it should report a profit of up to
Pounds 7m and perhaps a modest dividend. It is back under the management of
Sir Lawrie Barratt, its founder, but is suffering from the margin and volume
reductions of the housing market. Given the prospect for lower interest
rates, Sir Lawrie will probably be even more optimistic than usual.
Laura Ashley, the fabrics and frocks group is likely to report a small
interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 528,000) on Wednesday as its
energetic chief executive Jim Maxmin continues to press ahead with his
corporate changes.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Balance is
the key - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT ON earth is going on? That must be the understandable reaction of
savers in a week when the pound has plummeted, share prices have soared, and
interest rates have done both.
Early in the week, newspaper headlines proclaimed that mortgage rates were
about to fall; on Thursday morning, the press pronounced that rates were
sure to rise. In fact, they have yet to move one jot.
Faced with this turmoil, the temptation must be for the investor to see the
markets as an incomprehensible casino, and to retreat into the apparent
safety of the building society.
For those who depend on their savings for income, that might prove a
dangerous strategy.
So much has happened that no-one can be confident about what the government
will do next. There is the remote chance that the government, like a
punchdrunk boxer, will climb back into the ERM ring for another battering
from the markets.
Political pressures, however, would suggest that the government will make
the best of the crisis. Norman Lamont seemed to hint as much yesterday when
he essentially said that Britain would only rejoin the ERM when the Germans
got their act together.
The recession was prolonged because interest rates were kept high to defend
the pound; now that the currency battle has been lost, why not cut rates and
revive the economy?
The cynic might suspect that base rates will be cut as a morale-booster
before the Tory conference. Such a policy change will probably be highly
popular.
For most people, the benefits of ERM membership were somewhat theoretical;
15 per cent interest rates would not have been a 'price worth paying' for
small businessmen or homeowners.
With inflation at 3.6 per cent, a base rate cut to 8 per cent would still
leave real rates at historically high levels; and it is always possible that
rates could fall to 6 or 7 per cent. That would be very good news for anyone
with a variable rate mortgage.
Savers should recognise that we could be seeing a return to traditional
British values; a falling pound, higher inflation and isolation from Europe.
Traditional investment strategies are, thus, likely to be successful once
more. The prospect of the low-growth, low-inflation decade has been
postponed. The cult of the equity might not be over.
Shares have traditionally been the best performing financial asset over the
longer term; far better than gilts or building society deposits.
The rally in equities on Thursday and Friday highlights the hopes that the
conditions of 1982-3 might be repeated; a falling pound helping British
companies to escape from recession and improve profits.
However, the surge in the market also means that the investor might be
better placed investing in shares via a savings scheme than jumping into the
market on Monday.
If the pound continues to fall, then investors should also benefit from
overseas investments; from buying the bonds of those countries which
continue to track the anti-inflationary D-mark or, if you believe in the
resurging dollar, US Treasuries.
The more adventurous might look at overseas equities. This week GT, the fund
management group, held an emerging markets conference which highlighted the
attractions of shares in areas such as Asia and Latin America; and Fund
Research launched a new guide to the funds which specialise in those areas.
The recession may limit inflation in the short term. But its probable long
term resurgence highlights the need for investors to hold assets such as
index-linked gilts and National Savings, which currently offer very
attractive real yields.
What about conventional gilts? Prices could rise in the short term. Yields,
at 9 per cent, are well above inflation; and short-dated prices should rise
as interest rates fall.
But, in the long term, higher inflation would be bad news for gilts; and
devaluation will make foreign investors wary of buying our bonds.
Furthermore, the government still has plenty of gilts to issue, because of
the growing budget deficit.
The greatest problems will be faced by those who have been relying on high
building society rates for their income. They face the dual squeeze of
falling interest rates and a rising inflation rate.
Of course, devaluation is not really an easy option. It is the same policy
that Britain has followed consistently since the second world war, and it
has led to the ruin of many generations of savers.
This week's events have re-emphasised that savers cannot survive on deposits
alone; they need a balanced portfolio, including equities and index-linked,
to protect them from inflation.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Patience is
the virtue - What the Financial Advisers Say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THE passionate arguments about the broader economy, personal financial
advisers are reassuringly unanimous in the advice they are offering to
savers. Virtually all of them warn that investors should be patient before
reacting to this week's turbulent events in the financial markets.
'If the UK and the EC can't buck the market, I fail to see how the private
investor can do so without an extraordinary slice of luck' says David
Harris, of Chantrey Vellacott. 'Therefore, if you haven't taken any
precipitate action, you shouldn't'
John Cole, of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, agrees. 'We are advising clients in such
difficult markets to sit it out for a day or two. Missing the bottom is less
dangerous than going in and seeing your capital base reduced.' A similar
line comes from Peter Smith, of Hill Martin, who says: 'The crisis has shown
the difference between strategy and tactics. If you have the right strategy,
you shouldn't be too bothered by one day's turmoil.'
Still more caution comes from Peter Hargreaves, of Hargreaves Lansdown, who
says that those with funds to invest should make fixed interest their first
port of call. By this he means National Savings, gilts, and guaranteed
income bonds. He is not totally negative about equities but he feels private
investors should not try to make a killing because the timing is so
difficult. He adds: 'I always think the people who are pleased with equities
are those who buy them slowly.'
Cole takes a similar line. 'We are looking out for fixed-interest
opportunities; the international bond market has some attractions. We see
the longer-term appeal of equities, but we are attracted to the phased
investment approach.'
Robert Noble-Warren, of Murray Noble, also is recommending fixed-interest
products. But Noble-Warren is worried that equities will continue to go
through a rough patch while economic instability continues, and so is
removing some clients from zero-dividend preference shares of investment
trusts.
These normally are regarded as very safe, but he now feels that the level of
cover for their final redemption value might not be adequate in many cases.
Instead, Murray Noble is buying those zeros which benefit from the strongest
cover, plus guaranteed income bonds, gilts and National Savings.
One adviser expects a very rapid decline in rates. Richard Boyton, of Boyton
Financial Services, says: 'I would expect to see interest rates declining to
between 6 and 7 per cent within a very short term. Debt distress will remain
high and credit relatively expensive when inflation is taken into account.
As a result, credit demand will remain scarce, probably forcing interest
rates lower in the long term.
'It is doubtful whether house prices will rise, as consumers will remain
unwilling to saddle themselves with large house debts. The market still has
considerable overhang from repossessions.' Boyton concludes: 'I believe we
are entering a new era of risk-averse investment. This will favour bonds and
gilts.'
One real gilt enthusiast is Stephen Hallett, of Pentre-Vere, who says:
'Gilts are as attractive now as a week ago, if not more so. The enormous
deflationary pressure in the UK economy will take a long time to unwind and,
if policy had been unchanged, it would have increased. Given the state of
the economy, the little inflation that might be imported will only slow down
the further build-up of deflation, let alone reverse it.'
What about areas apart from investment? Smith points out that there are
still very high real interest rates on borrowings and consumers should
reduce any excess accordingly. Given the still-troubled UK economy, Smith
adds: 'People are less secure in their jobs and should make sure that their
pensions are properly funded.'
On mortgages, Cole thinks that a fixed-rate loan 'does have a place around
the 10 per cent level, especially those who are taking out a big loan. But
he cautions: 'I would personally expect interest rates to fall.'
Graeme Barnes, of Wilfred T. Fry, the Sussex-based firm which specialises in
advising expatriates, says this week's developments have been good news for
those with earnings in other currencies, or with sensibly diversified
portfolios. For others who have kept their funds in sterling deposits, he
recommends protection against falling interest rates by going into
fixed-rate investments.
So the experts' view seems clear - just as at the end of last week, a
portfolio with a large share of gilts and fixed interest, plus regular
savings into equities, is favoured overwhelmingly.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): The week
investors scented freedom - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ERAS are the stock in trade of equity analysts and newspaper columnists.
New dawns, crucial turning points, decisive breaks with history - they rest,
shiny and inviting, on the well-stocked shelves of the Cliche Department.
To have one new era in a 12-month period might seem enough, two surely
excessive. Yet that is what we have been offered since last autumn. First, a
new era of low inflation, low equity returns, and German-style investing
patterns. Now, a second new dawn is promised, looking suspiciously like the
dawn-before-last: falling interest rates, rising equities, and - ultimately
 -inflation-eroded fixed income securities.
The plausibility of this outlook is discussed by John Plender and other FT
writers elsewhere in today's Financial Times. Whatever its merits, it had
become a stock market article of faith by the end of Friday afternoon. The
FT-SE index closed at 2567.0, up 83.1 points on the day, and up 196.1 on the
week. From Wednesday's low point of 2,291.3, at the moment when the
government first put up interest rates, it had risen 12 per cent.
The completeness of the market's conversion to this view is borne out by the
nature of the rally. You only have to run your eye down the list of sectors
which did best on Thursday to get the measure of this particular new era:
Contracting and construction up 12 per cent; Banks up 11 per cent; Metals
and metal-forming up 10 per cent; Building materials up 9 1/2 per cent.
These are the battered cyclical stocks, the worst sufferers from the
recession of the past 2 1/2 years.
The shares that did worst out of the day's 100-point rise in the FT-SE index
are also familiar: electricity and water utilities, the defensive stalwarts
of the recent past. The electricity sector fell by  1/2 per cent on
Thursday, the water sector by 2 per cent.
All self-respecting new eras must be born from the wreckage of the old.
Traditionally, this process used to take several decades, giving plenty of
time for fin-de-siecle musings and lavish quotations from that Yeats poem
about things falling apart, centres not holding, rough beasts slouching
towards Bethlehem, and so on. The pace of modern life, however, has reduced
the shelf-life of the new era to a matter of months; and technologists are
now working on bite-sized new eras which can be consumed between meals.
Although the collapse of the old era is now a swifter process, the scale of
the wreckage has, if anything, increased. Consider the events of this week.
On Sunday, the lira devalued. On Monday, there was a small cut in German
interest rates. The pound edged up, the stock market rose 51 points. On
Tuesday, both reversed course, with shares down 52 points. On Wednesday,
with the pound on the edge of the abyss, interest rates went up first to 12
per cent, then to 15 per cent. Each time interest rates went up, the stock
market dropped. But sterling was still falling, kept within its ERM band
only by unprecedented central bank intervention. As that thought sank in, a
vast electronic gale of laughter convulsed the stock market.
You could see it sweep across the Topic screens: share after share turned
blue, indicating that the price was rising. The old era had reached its
accelerated moment of crisis: no-one now believed that the policy of pushing
interest rates ever higher to defend the pound was sustainable. The damage
that 12, then 15 per cent interest rates had done to equities was swiftly
undone, and the market closed serenely up 8.3 points on the day. Given the
scale of the drama, it was a remarkably unremarkable figure.
The next two days' share trading saw the acceptance of the new dawn, by the
government as it dropped out of the ERM and by investors generally. Shares
moved upwards in heavy volume, suggesting that some serious buying was
taking place.
By the end of the week, with shorter-term interest rates indicating that the
market was expecting something like a half-point cut in base rates in the
not-too-distant future, the new era was in fall swing.
City economists were calculating the impact of a low-interest-rate,
cheap-currency policy; equity analysts were coming up with lists of shares
that stood to do well out of an escape from the strait-jacket into which the
government had clamped the economy for the past two years. From Bank to
Edinburgh New Town, people were digging out graphs such asthe ones that
illustrate this piece, which show that almost all recent devaluations have
been followed by rising equity markets.
Once new-era fever strikes, history is bunk, historical statistics little
better. Thus, the figures reported this week, depressing though they were,
had little impact on the market's thinking. They illustrate the cage from
which investors now hope to break free: rising unemployment - up in August
to a five-year record of 2.8m, with a 47,000 rise on the month - together
with flat order books and a stagnant money supply.
Two striking corporate events of the week were, arguably, relics of the old
era. One of them dated from the era-before-last: a profits warning from Body
Shop, the last of the high-performing niche retailers that had provided so
much excitement in the pre-recession era. Anita and Gordon Roddick, who run
the company, announced that pre-tax interim profits would fall from Pounds
9m to 'not less than Pounds 8m'. The suggestion that the company's
spectacular growth might be slackening sent its shares down 41 per cent on
the day, and they closed the week at 181p, down 85p.
The other event was an echo of all that single-market euphoria of the past
couple of years. (Indeed, in some respects it was a reversion to a pre-war
concept: the Anglo-Dutch cross border merger.) Reed International, once a
newspaper and newsprint group but now a magazine and business publisher,
announced that it was merging with Elsevier, which publishes scientific
journals and Dutch newspapers. The market had no doubt whose shareholders
were getting the better of the deal. Reed shares rose sharply, ending the
week at 541p, up 55p from the moment of the announcement, Elsevier's closed
at Fl 102, down 12 per cent.
Corporate news could scarcely grab the attention, however, when there were
grand strategies to be drawn. After all, this week's new era might itself be
outdated by the time the markets opened on Monday, depending on the outcome
of the French referendum. For City analysts and newspaper columnists, there
is much more scope for astonishing insights.
As usual, however, WB Yeats had the last word. In that very same poem that
everyone quotes, obviously reflecting on a bruising experience with the
Dublin traded options market, he gave his considered verdict on the trade of
financial analyst. 'The best lack all conviction,' he mourned, 'while the
worst//Are full of passionate intensity.'
And now they're on television, too . . .

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Foreign
furore downgrades domestic data - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Europe has lurched from currency crisis to crisis this week, Wall
Street has watched with baffled, and slightly superior, fascination. It has
not, of course, been entirely immune to the ructions overseas. New York's
currency trading desks have been frantic - especially in the afternoon
sessions. 'It's absolutely crazy,' yelled one Merrill Lynch trader on
Wednesday afternoon.
But, for the most part, Wall Street's interest in the currency mayhem can be
summed up in two questions. First, does this mean lower interest rates in
key European countries which, in turn, might speed another domestic easing
by the Federal Reserve? And will the chaos affect economic growth rates in
Europe - which, again, might have a knock-on effect for US manufacturers ?
At the beginning of the week, the answers looked simple. The cut in German
interest rates was read as unequivocably positive for the US economy. Wall
Street traders were already betting on another lowering of domestic interest
rates by the Fed, after the latest data on producer prices gave no hint of
an inflationary problem. Lower German rates would merely make the Fed's task
a little easier.
And, reasoned investors, the German interest rate cut might also stimulate
European economies, helping the fortunes of US companies with large overseas
markets. Share prices duly soared on fairly heavy buying by both
institutional customers and private investors. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average ended the day more than 70 points higher.
Such euphoria did not last long. By Tuesday, Wall Street had realised that
the modest German cuts were unlikely to spur a more widespread reduction in
European interest rates, at least in the short term. Disappointed, the Dow
gave up almost 50 points.
Then, on Wednesday, traders grappled to make sense of the British moves to
defend sterling, and currency's subsequent suspension from the exchange rate
mechanism. In the confusion, the Dow itself eased only modestly, but many of
the American depositary shares of European companies encountered sharper
mark-downs.
There matters rested for the rest of the week. Faced with all the
uncertainties in Europe ahead of the French Maastricht vote, and a 'triple
witching' on Friday - when options and futures on stock indices expire on
the same day - investors were disinclined to do anything.
Given the week's overseas focus, domestic data largely was overlooked. Not
that the latest round of economic statistics revealed much that was new. The
poor performance of the retail sector during August had already been evident
in returns from the major department store chains, and the official 0.5 per
cent fall in retail sales last month was merely confirmation.
The store chains had been quick to blame the relatively late Labor Day
weekend - which, they claimed, delayed some of the back-to-school spending.
Still, the overall slip in sales last month is the biggest drop since March.
At the very least, it smacks of minimal consumer confidence.
Similarly, news of an 0.3 per cent increase in consumer prices in August
brought no gasps of alarm. Higher food prices, notably for fruit and
vegetables, accounted for part of the rise while the smaller 0.2 per cent
increase in the 'core' rate (which excludes food and energy) was unchanged
from the previous three months.
Finally, on Thursday, the industrial output figures showed a decline of 0.5
per cent in August. That resulted, in part, from the disruption caused by
Hurricane Andrew and the labour dispute at one General Motors facility which
caused other plants operated by the car manufacturer to shut-down. But the
obvious lack of economic momentum was reinforced by a separate Commerce
Department report which showed that businesses increased stocks by just 0.1
per cent last month. Normally, a significant rebuilding of stocks, is one of
the early signs of economic recovery.
Even individual stocks had difficulty in grabbing much of the limelight.
Federal Express, the biggest overnight package delivery firm, garnered some
attention on Wednesday after revealing a sharp drop in first-quarter profits
caused by weak domestic demand and fierce discounting tactics. Its shares
slumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 and, by Friday, had slipped to
Dollars 36 1/2 .
Procter &amp; Gamble, the large consumer goods producer, fared better when it
announced that it was pulling out of the 100 per cent fruit juice market by
discontinuing or selling brands. P&amp;G shares gained  3/8 to Dollars 48 3/4 .

FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Six days that
shook the pound
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunday September 13
Italian authorities announce that the Lira is to be devalued by 7 per cent
against the D-mark. The Bundesbank says it will cut interest rates the
following day. Norman Lamont welcomes both measures and confirms he will
take 'whatever action was necessary' to defend sterling's central rate at
DM2.95.
Monday September 14
London stocks soar - the FT-SE 100 opens up 99.5 at 2,470.4. Pound rallies
from DM2.79. Bundesbank announces new interest rates - cut of 0.25 per cent
in Lombard rate to 9.25 per cent, and of 0.5 per cent in discount rate to
8.25 per cent.
Shares drop. FT-SE closes at 2,422.1 (up 51.2 for the day). Sterling closes
2 pfennigs higher at DM2.8125, safely above the ERM floor of DM2.778. It
stands at Dollars 1.8945, compared with Dollars 1.958 three days earlier.
Tuesday September 15
Pressure on the pound resumes, following reports of comments by Helmut
Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, that 'there was room for no more'
interest rate cuts, and that a more general realignment of ERM currencies
(including a devaluation of sterling) would have been preferable.
The Bank of England buys pounds in an attempt to support the currency, but
by the close sterling stands at DM2.78 in New York - its lowest since
joining the ERM and one-fifth of a pfennig above the minimum permitted
level. FT-SE closes off 52.1 at 2,370.0.
Wednesday September 16
'Black Wednesday'. Pressure on sterling continues. The FT-SE 100 drops 28
points at the opening. Bank of England buys Pounds 1bn, at 9am, with no
significant effect, followed by intervention by the Bundesbank and Bank of
France at 9.30.
Pressure on sterling continues. At 11am, UK base rates are raised by 2
percentage points from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. Within minutes, the FT-SE
hits 2,291.3, down 78.7 for the day (its low for the week).
Sterling does not recover, even after Bank of England spends another Pounds
3bn. Pound falls below permitted level. It is announced that base rates will
rise by another three percentage points to 15 per cent by the opening of
trade on Thursday.
Pressure on sterling continues, but shares rally as dealers work on the
assumption that a devaluation is imminent. FT-SE closes at 2,378.3, up 8.3
for the day, in spite of the increase in lending rates. The pound closes at
DM2.75, well below its permitted level.
At 7.45pm, Lamont announces that it has been a 'difficult' day. Sterling's
membership of the ERM is to be suspended, while the second base rate rise is
cancelled. The pound moves lower.
Thursday September 17
FT-SE opens 106 higher at 2,484.9 while pound continues to fall. However,
shares fall back to register a gain of only 25.8, until the 10am
announcement that base rates have returned to 10 per cent. The Cabinet
accepts responsibility, Major and Lamont insist they have no intention of
resigning. Meanwhile the French franc, Danish krone and Irish punt all fall
to their ERM floors, amid further central bank intervention.
Stocks resume their surge, FT-SE 100 closes at 2,483.9 (up 105.6). Sterling
stands at DM2.64 and Dollars 1.7795 by lunchtime in New York - 4 per cent
below its previous floor, and an effective 10 per cent devaluation compared
with its original ERM central rate.
Friday September 18
London stocks continue to rally. A modest opening rise is followed by buying
in force once a radio interview with Lamont is interpreted as meaning that
the pound will stay outside the ERM for some time to come.
The market closes up 83.1 at 2567.1, with analysts agreeing that a cut in
base rates to around 8 per cent has been discounted. Sterling falls
slightly, amid the acrimony between Lamont and Chancellor Kohl, to stand at
DM2.61 when the market closes in London.

FT  19 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance stake placed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPOSITE insurance group Sun Alliance, took full advantage of the recent
upsurge in market sentiment and turnover to sell the majority of its holding
in fellow-composite Commercial Union (CU). In a 'bought deal' operation Sun
sold a block of 60m shares to Smith New Court, the securities house, which,
acting in conjunction with Cazenove, the agency broker, placed the shares
with a number of institutions. The placing was completed in a matter of
minutes, according the dealers.
Sun confirmed it had sold the CU stock at 470p a share. Smith New Court and
Cazenove placed the shares at 475p a share, indicating that the two broking
houses made a Pounds 3m profit of the deal, probably split fifty-fifty.
It is thought that Sun Alliance attempted to sell its CU shares earlier this
week but that word of the deal leaked into the market, triggering a big
slide in the CU share price as marketmakers sought to head off any sizeable
selling of the stock.
Sun Alliance acquired a 13 per cent stake in CU in August 1989 at 465p from
Adelaide Steamship, the Australian investment company then run by Mr John
Spalvins who had built up the stake during the previous year. Sun Alliance's
stake in CU has long been targeted as one of the few remaining sizeable
'loose' holdings in the UK market.
The ease with which the 60m shares were placed ensured that CU were never
under any real selling pressure. The stock ended the day unchanged at 489p,
having dipped to 480p at worst.
Turnover, almost entirely made up of the 60m-share 'bought deal', reached
123m shares. Sun Alliance closed 10 higher at 273p with a hefty 20m shares
traded.
BAe raided
British Aerospace (BAe) appeared to become the victim of a bear raid and the
shares took a dive shortly before the market close to make it the worst
performing FT-SE stock in the percentage terms.
The story doing the rounds late yesterday was that the much predicted deal
with Taiwan Aerospace on BAe's regional aircraft division had fallen
through. This, so the argument went, would mean BAe will have to close the
division forcing the company to make large provisions. Analysts however
remained sceptical about the validity of the story.
There was also talk that the company could announce losses when it reports
interim figures next Wednesday. Many analysts are already predicting a
dividend cut when the results are announced.
The shares which yesterday enjoyed their last day as a FT-SE constituent had
slowly crept forward, though underperforming the market for most of the
session before the bear stories led to a reversal in the direction of the
shares. They ended 10 lower at 189p on turnover of around 2m shares.
Guinness disappoints
The disappointing interim results from Guinness that were reported on
Thursday, finally took their toll yesterday sending the shares tumbling
against the strong market trend, as investors were advised to switch out of
the stock.
Explaining the retreat Ms Michelle Proud at County NatWest said, 'people are
looking at the stock and saying there is no growth this year, and the stock
is at a considerable premium to similar stocks in the sector.'
The shares closed 11 down at 523p, with a majority of the day's trading
involving switching out of Guinness and into Allied Lyons which jumped 39 to
623p. Turnover in Guiness was again heavy and reached 8.6m. Also wanted was
Grand Metropolitan in which shares jumped 22 to 454p, in busy trade of 8.4m.
The oils remained in the forefront of the market's advance, amid another
burst of buying interest prompted by the big impact on sterling oil prices
of the pound/dollar rate.
BP delivered another disappointing performance, the shares managing only a
minor gain, closing 2 1/2 up at 214 1/2 p on big turnover of 26m. Dealers
said there had been no let up in the steady stream of selling orders from
domestic institutions which outstripped persistent US buying. Shell,
meanwhile ran up 9 more to 531p on 13m traded with the market pleased with
the proposed deal between Shell Chemicals and Montedison.
Lasmo edged up 1 1/2 to 147 1/2 p after big two-way trading. Mr Alan
Sinclair, oil analyst at Smith New Court, said the market had been
'erroneously concerned about Lasmo's dividend paying ability; if there were
doubts about the dividend with oil at Pounds 10 a barrel it's inconceivable
they remain with oil now at Pounds 12 a barrel; with Enterprise at this
level, Lasmo should be 200p a share.' Burmah Castrol's big overseas earnings
helped the shares jump a further 40 to 653p.
Hints that a series of hefty profits upgrades are being prepared by many of
the market's leading analysts saw the big internationals and pharmaceuticals
stocks extend the impressive performances that have followed the effective
devaluation of sterling. Glaxo rose 28 to 841p, SmithKline Beecham 13 1/2 to
554 1/2 p and Wellcome 36 to 933p. ICI put on 32 to 1137p and Reuters 32 to
1127p.
The prospect of a reduction in UK interest rates rather than the 15 per cent
crisis level reached earlier in the week continued to drive the banks higher
although there was consternation around the market at the slide in NatWest.
The shares dropped 11, or just over 3 per cent, to 346p.
The sudden burst of big buying interest in the equity market, which brought
with it hopes of a steep increase in corporate activity as the UK economy
picks up, saw the merchant banks strongly supported. SG Warburg climbed 29
to 475p, Hambros added 22 to 236p and Kleinwort Benson rose 20 to 261p.
Another scintillating showing by UK markets gave a significant boost to the
insurance companies solvency margins, and were reflected by big gains in
share price. Lifes were equally in demand with Legal &amp; General, also helped
by the excellent interim figures, up 29 to 352p.
Shares in Thorn EMI moved 27 ahead to 720p boosted by recommendations from
several brokers. BZW yesterday turned buyers of the stock and upgraded its
year end profits forecast.
After a meeting with the company, analysts at the securities house came away
less pessimistic about the interim figures expected in November, citing a
better than expected performance of the music division. They now expect
interim profits to remain around Pounds 95m. BZW however upgraded the full
year figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds 330m to take account of the benefits of
integrating recent purchase Virgin Music into the company.
County NatWest were also recommending thestock.
The reduced value of sterling continued to power Forte and the shares added
another 22 to 161p. Turnover was a hefty 10m shares.
Food retailers were in demand yesterday. Argyll, gained 18 to 325p,
following a positive meeting with analysts.

FT  19 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPIRY of the September contract on the FT-SE Index in no way impaired
another powerful performance in derivatives yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
The expiry passed off comfortably at the appointed time - just after 10.00am
 -and the December contract recorded 23,246 contracts by the official close,
when it showed a a comfortable premium of around seven points against fair
value, which is the estimated level allowing for carrying costs and
dividends.
The December contract was spurred ahead by widespread predictions that UK
base rates will be cut by at least two points before the end of the year.
Such optimism was encouraged by comments from the UK chancellor of the
exchequer and by falling short sterling rates. At best, September touched
2,644 but at one stage lagged slightly behind an over-excited underlying
equity market.
Another heavy day in Traded Options saw 73,698 contracts dealt, against
69,249. The FT-SE traded 28,933 contracts compared with 27,204, an the Euro
FT-SE was also busy, with 8,360 contracts. BP, 4,921 contracts, headed the
list of individual stocks.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Gold
shows a muted reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE IT is true that the gold price has moved ahead this week, the subdued
extent of the rise reveals the market's lack of response to the chaos in
European currency markets. Yet again, it appears that an international
crisis has by-passed the gold market.
However, there is no doubt the market is jittery. Gold closed on the London
bullion market last night at Dollars 352 a troy ounce, up Dollars 11.75 on
the week and Dollars 3.75 on the day. Yesterday's rise came in late trading
after a quiet day which saw the afternoon fix at Dollars 347.20.
London was boosted by the early advance on Comex, where the active December
gold contract was Dollars 4 up at Dollars 353.80 at midday in thin and
nervous trading ahead of the weekend IMF meeting in Washington and the
French referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Most of the week's rise came on Monday as traders responded to the morning
cuts in German interest rates, and ignored the strength of the dollar. The
market rose Dollars 6.30 to close at Dollars 346.25, having moved above
Dollars 348 during the day after the New York market opened higher than
expected. There was little sign of heavy producer selling and traders said
the market was looking to consolidate between Dollars 345 and Dollars 350.
That is exactly what it did throughout the currency market upheavals which
followed. The London market closed at Dollars 349.40 after the Wednesday
hike in UK interest rates, a rise of just over Dollars 3, and eased to
Dollars 348.25 on Thursday.
Mr Andy Smith, precious metals analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland,
believes that gold's behaviour has been unusual rather than remarkable -
'outpacing the dollar's rise and emphasising the Euro-epicentre of the
uncertainty.' Taking September 3 as the market low at Dollars 338 and this
week's high of Dollars 350, the market shows a rise of 3.5 per cent. In
terms of Yen it has risen by 3.9 per cent; in Swiss francs by 6.5 per cent;
in D-Marks by 10 per cent; in Lira by 20.6 per cent; in Australian dollars
by 2.5 per cent; and in South African Rand by 6.7 per cent.
Italy, where local gold prices are up by one-fifth, is the biggest single
European market for gold jewellery, Mr Smith points out. At the same time
Australian and South African producers are getting ADollars 480 and R1,000 a
troy ounce, prices they have been happy to take for forward sales.
'There has got to be something else - another shock - to make the price
jump,' says Mr Smith. 'Otherwise the market will come off again.' All eyes
in the market will be on the outcome of the French referendum.
Trading on the London Metal Exchange has been both nervous and thin during
the currency market shenanigans. In the words of Nick Moore, analyst with
Ord Minnett: 'Base metal markets have behaved like the proverbial startled
rabbit caught in the flare of the headlights.'
Copper, showed the most gains, closing yesterday at Pounds 1,383.50 a tonne,
up Pounds 141 on the week, but in dollar terms it is only about Dollars 25
ahead. Helping to support prices has been the re-emergence of the threat of
industrial action at Poland's KGHM, where a 24-hour strike has been called
for next Wednesday.
The aluminium market has had only bearish news, particularly the Wednesday
news from St Petersburg that exports from the CIS are expected this year to
reach at least the same level as in 1991 - 843,000 tonnes - and possibly to
exceed that figure by a further 100,000 tonnes.
Cash aluminium closed yesterday at Dollars 1,249.50 a tonne, down Dollars
22.50 on the week.
Of the softs, the cocoa market has seen the most action, soaring on
Wednesday as sterling slumped, triggering short covering purchases. The
London December contract closed at Pounds 655 a tonne, but has since
retreated to close yesterday at the day's low of Pounds 629, only Pounds 11
ahead on the week.
Bearish news arrived from Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house owned by ED
&amp; F. Man, which yesterday predicted a reduced world cocoa production deficit
of only 25,000 tonnes for 1992-93. This compares with an estimated deficit
of 88,000 tonnes in the current season.
The London market has also ignored this week's International Cocoa
Organisation talks, which have mooted the idea of selling off the
organisation's buffer stock to Russia with the aim of reviving the country's
chocolate industry. But as one delgate put it: 'They are feeding soup to a
dead man.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Another strong session for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY CONCERNS regarding this weekend's Maastricht referendum in France were
pushed aside yesterday in a London stock market now focusing on the chances
of a reduction in UK base rates to at least 8 per cent by Christmas time.
The FT-SE Index gained a further 83.1 points to 2,567, rounding off a two
week equity trading account which has brought a gain of around 8.7 per cent
in the Index.
Trading volume was again very heavy and stock index futures indicated that
optimism remained strong;some London marketmakers plan to open for telephone
trading at 6.30 on Monday morning, two hours ahead of the official start of
trading on the electronic trading screens.
Seaq volume reached 1,298.1m shares, just below the 1.4bn of the previous
session. The all-important value total of retail, or genuine customer
business, in equities surged to Pounds 2.5bn on Thursday, following Pounds
1.2bn on Wednesday; these totals compare with recent daily levels of around
Pounds 700m, and confirm the presence of the big institutions.
The pace was set by an early morning radio interview with Mr Norman Lamont,
the UK chancellor of the exchequer, which was interpreted as encouraging
interest rate optimism. Hopes for an early cut in UK rates were also
strengthened by quotations of 8 1/4 per cent on short sterling futures and
reflected in a squeeze in the government bond market when a US house came in
as a heavy buyer. Short-dated gilts, beneficiaries from a rate cut, jumped
by nearly one point, but even long dates, at risk from inflation prospects,
closed with only minor losses; index-linked gilts moved higher.
Equities opened slowly but were quickly driven ahead as London dealers
completed buying orders from the US which had been left open overnight.
Excitement also mounted ahead of the expiry, just after 10.00, of the
September contract on the FT-SE Index.
At least four trading programmes moved across the trading screens during the
session and Sun Alliance took the opportunity of a strong market to carry
off the sale of most of its stake in Commercial Union, attempted earlier
this week.
The gain in the Footsie was trimmed briefly from 63.3 to 37.4 points, until
the squeeze in gilts triggered fresh demand. At its best, the Footsie was
93.8 ahead for a two day gain of 188.7 points, outperforming the response to
re-election of the Conservative government.
Retail business in equities has begun to recover from dismally low levels as
the stock market has sensed that base rates could soon be reduced.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Heseltine moves to offset
revolt by Tories - Major breaks silence on crisis / Chancellor expected to
reiterate fears over German policy - Boost for home buyers urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT moved to reassert its European credentials yesterday in the
face of increasingly open dissent within the Conservative party.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said that the week's
turbulence should not be perceived as the end of Britain's move towards
Europe. His remarks came as Mr Kenneth Baker, former party chairman, moved
to place himself in the forefront of the Tory Euro-sceptics.
In an article in The Daily Telegraph, followed by an interview on BBC Radio
4, Mr Baker made clear his opposition to the pound's early return to the
exchange rate mechanism, making more likely a strong Tory backbench revolt
in next week's emergency Commons debate on the economy.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, a Treasury minister, last night emphasised that ERM
membership was still seen as crucial to the government's long-term economic
strategy. The policy of delivering low inflation and sound money remained
'precisely the same tonight as it was last Friday'. This desire for a stable
long-term environment was why Britain joined the ERM and why the government
had 'made clear its desire to resume active participation in the ERM as soon
as conditions allow'.
Mr Heseltine, during a visit to the north-east of England, said companies
must not be deflected from urgently needed preparations for the single
European market. 'We have to persuade the people who work in our companies
to take the readjustment to the single European market seriously and
urgently,' he said.
Any misreading of Britain's approach to Europe might also affect inward
investment, which the UK had success-fully attracted in the 1980s.
'They didn't come here because it was Britain, they came here because it was
Britain in Europe,' Mr Heseltine said. 'If there were to be any doubt about
that, then many of these companies who have positioned themselves in Europe
by basing themselves in Britain would have to reconsider that strategic
judgment.'
Last night, in a speech to the Northern CBI, Mr Heseltine said: 'The
underlying dynamic of our relationship with Europe is not the Maastricht
treaty but the single European act. Nothing must deflect our attention from
the significance of the changes in that market place.'
Mr Baker said that conditions for sterling to re-enter the ERM would take 'a
very long time to get right'. The UK 'should not be too keen to re-enter the
ERM, even if it survives'.
He added: 'The Maastricht concept of a single currency for the whole of the
Community will not come about this century.' Mr Baker also urged Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, to make further rapid cuts in interest rates  - down
to 6 per cent.
Conjuring up a vision of Britain  - untrammelled by the ERM  - buoyed by the
fastest growth rate of any western economy, he said: 'Interest rates in
Britain are now not determined by bankers in Frankfurt. The chancellor is a
free man.'
The government's position of a return to the ERM 'as soon as conditions
allow' was criticised more forthrightly by other Euro-sceptics. Sir Teddy
Taylor, secretary of the Conservative European Reform Group, described it as
'arrogant and bumptious'.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, former Conservative Tory minister and another prominent
Euro-sceptic, said that Britain needed to rejoin the ERM like it needed 'a
hole in the head'.
Support for the government, though, came from Mr Hugh Dykes, Tory MP for
Harrow East and chairman of the European Movement, who said membership of
the ERM was 'essential for this country's future prosperity'.
The row over the ERM grew as the agenda for next month's Tory party
conference was published. The motions on the agenda were submitted before
July 13 but include a number of pleas for Britain to leave the ERM and
several calls for a referendum on Maastricht.
It also emerged that Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, will
attend the Brighton conference, posing a delicate stage-management question
for party organisers.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Housing market holds its breath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning Abbey National launched a 10.5 per cent
fixed-rate mortgage scheme offering to freeze payments until the end of the
century. Six hours later the offer was sold out and closed.
All the funds allocated for the scheme were used up in six hours, according
to Abbey National. People who received their letters the following day
missed out  - or did they?
Customers who signed up for the Abbey offer, which must have looked a snip
when base rates appeared set to rise to 15 per cent on Thursday, must now be
wondering if they have got such a good deal.
Mortgage lenders, instead of putting up rates, are now saying that they
might even come down by 1 or 2 percentage points by Christmas. It has been
that kind of week for home owners  - from despair, to relief, to hope, in
less than two days.
People who rang estate agents on Wednesday to pull out of a house purchase
will this weekend be reconsidering whether to reopen the deal, try to
renegotiate a lower price, start renting, or give up altogether and
emigrate.
Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to the conundrum. That will depend
on which economic policies the government adopts in the wake of sterling's
withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism.
There is no question what those who make their living from buying and
selling houses want the chancellor to do: cut interest rates and then cut
them again.
Mr David Holliday, president of the House Builders Federation, says: 'The
needs of the domestic economy must now be put first, and that means further
reductions in interest rates from 10 per cent to 8 per cent or less.'
Most builders, estate agents and, no doubt, many homeowners would be
prepared to pay the price of higher inflation in return for letting sterling
float and getting lower interest rates.
The worst scenario for them will be if the government, in its pursuit of
lower inflation, continues to maintain high real interest rates while
letting the pound float. House prices and sales would continue to drift and
recovery would be delayed for even longer.
The market, meanwhile, remains flat on its back. Builders say that sales in
September, even before this week's currency crisis, had been desperate.
ECC, the world's biggest producer of china clay, this month announced a
Pounds 13m provision, mostly to cover falling prices in its depressed UK
housebuilding business. Mr Andrew Teare, its chief executive, says: 'It is
every bit as bad as you could imagine it to be.'
The events of this week will have pushed confidence even lower. 'I cannot
see anybody wanting to rush out and buy a home at the moment,' says Sir
Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation.
He says lower interest rates will not be enough on their own to kick-start
the housing market. He wants the government to end stamp duty on house sales
and raise the ceiling for mortgage tax relief.
It is going to take a long time for confidence to return to the housing
market, even assuming that interest rates come down. For a start, there will
be a large backlog of repossessed homes to shift before the market can get
anywhere near back to normality.
People will also have to be convinced that they will not lose their job in a
still weak British economy before going out and buying a new home; and the
shock to home owners of watching their house price fall below the value of
their mortgage is likely to blight the market for some time.
House prices in southern England and East Anglia have fallen by between 25
per cent and 30 per cent on average since 1988-89. Even assuming that prices
rise at an average 5 per cent a year from 1993, people who bought in the
late 1980s will have to wait until next century to get their money back.
Of course, prices could rise faster if inflation was allowed to let rip
again, but there is no sign that the government has abandoned its aim of
reducing inflation through monetary discipline.
It is also worth remembering that the bottom of the last housing cycle was
in 1981 and that it was not until the mid to late 1980s that prices really
began to take off again.
All those thoughts will be crowding the minds of people vacillating this
weekend over whether to complete that house purchase after all.
Whichever way the government jumps, a rise in sales is unlikely to start
before next year.
Even then, volumes will have to increase substantially before prices start
recovering. History may show that the housing recovery began with Britain's
withdrawal from the ERM, but it is going to be a very long haul back.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Theory of bond investment
culture comes unstuck - How the ERM crisis has dented a fashionable economic
viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE period between Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism in
October 1990 and the negotiation of the Maastricht treaty late last year, it
became fashionable to talk about the development of a 'bond culture' in
Britain.
With the country beginning to import lower German-style rates of inflation
via the ERM, it was suggested that the relative attractions of equities
would decline vis a vis gilts; fixed-interest securities would become much
more attractive in a world that harked back to the more stable price
conditions of the 19th century.
It was always a contentious thesis and after the events of this week it
scarcely looks tenable. Within the ERM the Bundesbank provides the nearest
alternative in the modern world to the gold standard on which the 19th
century operated. Britain's exit from the ERM demonstrates, among other
things, how hard it is to recreate the kind of climate in which currencies
do not lose half their value in the space of a mere decade or two.
The problem was neatly encapsulated in BZW's latest Exchange Rate Monitor,
which pointed out that since Britain came off the gold standard in 1914,
only one government has left office with sterling at a higher level than at
the outset. The government in question was the Conservative administration
in which Winston Churchill returned to gold at the pre-First World War
parity of Dollars 4.48.
The depression followed. And that, of course, was the way stable prices came
about in the 19th century. If Mr Major and Mr Lamont had been born 100 years
earlier and had presided over a comparable crisis, they would have seen runs
on the banks, with interest rates soaring to unconscionable levels. The
denouement would have been accompanied by falling prices, as a shellshocked
populace retreated into the prudent financial behaviour that invariably
precipitates deflation.
Britain today could, like Sweden, have tried to shore up sterling by
resorting to further intervention, 500 per cent overnight interest rates and
the rest. But the financial system today is less able to take the strain.
Indeed, its whole structure is predicated on a bail-out in such
circumstances.
A 19th-century banker operated on a ratio of capital to deposits that
sometimes went as high as 40 per cent or 50 per cent. Modern ratios of 8 per
cent-plus in effect presuppose the existence of a lender of last resort. So,
too, does the growing dependence of building societies on wholesale
deposits. With more than half their net inflow of funds coming from the
wholesale markets, building societies would not have survived for long a
serious attempt to defend the pound.
The miracle is that the Bundesbank managed to establish such
anti-inflationary credibility in a world without a link to gold. But then it
is easy to forget how long it took for the German central bank to acquire
that reputation. Even when a central bank has succeeded in winning
credibility, it may still take an extraordinary time for the portfolio shift
into bonds to run its course.
In a British context, with more than two thirds of equities in institutional
hands, a full shift to a bond-dominated investment culture would probably
not have come until the occupational pensions system went back to
denominating its contractual liabilities in nominal terms.
With sterling floating, the immediate case for bonds can only be made on
conventional grounds. Many brokers are raising their forecast for retail
price inflation from 3 per cent next year to 4 1/2 per cent or even 5 per
cent after this week's events. On that basis, long gilts are no bargain,
although the short end of the market will benefit if the government
encourages rates to come down thicker and faster than now anticipated.
The government is rightly perceived to have suffered a humiliating defeat
this week. Yet in the long run the real losers from the ERM debacle may,
paradoxically, turn out to be Germany and the Bundesbank.
The recent turmoil in currency markets reflects the German failure to manage
the fiscal consequences of unification. As Mr Brian Reading of Lombard
Street Research points out, the whole resource cost of German unification
has been borne by foreigners through the deterioration in the German current
account.
In the end, the share of west German real disposable incomes in national
income will have to be cut to foot the unification bill. The strength of the
D-Mark has merely deferred the problem. It follows that the D-Mark, like the
dollar in comparable circumstances in the mid 1980s, will weaken in due
course.
If a hard core of the ERM survives, the D-Mark and the credibility of the
Bundesbank might sustain a damaging blow. Whether it is sufficient to test
the German bond culture remains to be seen.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Return to ERM not imminent, PM
says
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night gave notice that there would be no 'imminent'
return of Britain into the European exchange rate mechanism.
Breaking his two-day silence on the UK's abandonment of the ERM in a series
of broadcast interviews, the prime minister said that the system had
revealed 'fault lines' over the past few days that provoked extraordinary
movements of currencies.
'What we have decided to do is to stand aside from the mechanism for the
time being,' he said.
Mr Major added that when Britain joined the ERM it was not a particular
fetish of the Conservative government  - it was the view of the
Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the Labour
party, the Liberal Democrats and most economic opinion.
In two years, membership of the ERM had meant a drop in inflation from near
11 per cent to '3.7 per cent and falling'.
He added: 'What we have seen in the last few days in the exceptional
circumstances of the market, there are fault lines in the existing working
of the ERM. We must correct those fault lines.'
Asked when Britain would return to the ERM, he replied: 'We have to address
those fault lines in the ERM before we can return. Clearly, it is not
imminent.'
He emphasised that it was 'not necessarily the case' that Britain would
re-enter at a lower rate.
On the Maastricht bill, Mr Major said it would not come back to the Commons
until the Danes had made clear what they would do. 'There is a great deal in
the Maastricht Treaty very much in the interests of British policy,' he
said.
'The treaty provides for the development of European policies outside the
Treaty of Rome, outside the European court and outside the authority of the
European Commission. We have sought that British policy for years.'
Questioned again about resignations, Mr Major said: 'There are circumstances
when ministers should resign. I do not think these circumstances apply when
an external, unforeseen event overthrows a policy which in principle is
right.
'The principle Norman Lamont was following to bring down inflation and build
prosperity was right. That was overwhelmed by circumstances that neither he
nor anybody else foresaw or could have dealt with. It was quite right for
him to stay in position. I believe he is doing a good job. I wish him to
continue to do so.'
Asked if he would therefore 'sink or swim' with the chancellor, Mr Major
replied: 'The chancellor's policy is my policy, and it is the cabinet's
policy.'
He added: 'I do not think it is the chancellor's fault. I think it is quite
unreasonable to blame the chancellor for a market movement of the sort we
have not seen for over a quarter of a century.' He said the sensible thing
for the chancellor to do was to 'stand aside from the mayhem for a time',
adding: 'And that is precisely what the chancellor did.'
The prime minister said the policy objective was to continue to bring down
inflation. 'The ERM is one means of achieving that policy. When it works
properly, it is the best policy to achieve that objective.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Lamont to quit IMF meeting
early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, plans to leave the Washington meetings of
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for London early on Monday to
deal with any further developments affecting the UK economy and sterling.
He was originally due to stay in Washington until Wednesday to deliver
speeches to the IMF and World Bank annual meeting in his capacity as UK
governor of the IMF and current president of the European Community's
council of economics and finance ministers.
The chancellor  - due in Washington last night  - will take part in today's
meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries and Sunday's meeting of the IMF's
policy-making interim committee. The results of the French referendum on the
Maastricht treaty are expected during the afternoon session of the interim
committee meeting.
The G7 meeting will bring Mr Lamont together with Mr Theo Waigel, German
finance minister, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, for the
first time since the two countries became embroiled in a bitter row over
responsibility for the currency turmoil of the past week.
It is likely that the chancellor will again express concern about the
present state of German economic and monetary policy. In an interview on BBC
radio yesterday Mr Lamont said he wanted 'to be satisfied that German
policy, which has produced many of the tensions within the exchange rate
mechanism, is actually going to have some changes and to be able to operate
within a more stable environment'.
UK Treasury officials say Mr Lamont remains especially concerned about
Germany's policy mix, where large budget deficits are helping to keep
interest rates at high levels.
At the Bath meeting of EC economics and finance ministers two weeks ago the
chancellor singled out the large-scale granting by Germany of subsidised
credits to eastern Germany as an issue to be tackled by the Bonn government.
He was also critical of the Bundesbank's policy of targeting M3, the broad
money aggregate. Britain has argued that Germany's high interest rates are
part of the difficulty of German M3 expanding at a rate far higher than the
official target range of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.
The British view, endorsed this week by the IMF in its World Economic
Outlook report, is that Germany's high rates are contributing to M3's
higher-than-targeted growth by causing investors to switch long-term funds
into short-term bank deposits.
The chancellor has also been concerned about the rapid growth of 'off
budget' spending by the German public sector. The UK says that Germany's
public-sector accounting practices give a flattering picture of the deficit
because borrowing by bodies such as the Federal Post Office or the Treuhand
agency in eastern Germany do not count as part of Germany's public-sector
borrowing requirement.
The Bath meeting saw the first serious outbreak of tension between Mr Lamont
and Mr Schlesinger. It has been reported that Mr Waigel had to persuade Mr
Schlesinger not to walk out after Mr Lamont demanded an immediate cut in
German interest rates.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: 'Inflation option' criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH accused the government yesterday of taking 'the inflationary
option' in an attempt to undermine its claim that defeat of inflation
remained at the core of its economic policy.
In a letter to Mr John Major, the Labour leader referred to the prime
minister's statement last week that 'the devaluer's option' would be 'a
betrayal of our future.' He said: 'Since then you have allowed the pound to
be devalued by 10 per cent.'
In spite of yesterday's statement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that
reducing inflation was still the government's overriding priority, 'you have
taken what you yourself described as the inflationary option', Mr Smith
said.
'For two years you have been telling the British people that all of the pain
they have suffered from the recession - soaring unemployment, bankruptcies
and high interest rates - was solely designed to achieve the the 'great
prize' of zero inflation.'
Mr Smith said Mr Major had remained 'totally silent' since the 'catastrophic
economic events' of Wednesday.
'Yesterday, you told your cabinet that the chancellor should not be seen as
an air-raid shelter,' he said. 'That is exactly how you have used him during
the last 48 hours.'
The letter follows Labour claims that the government squandered Pounds 500m
of public money as part of the failed attempt to prop up the pound.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that that
money could have created 50,000 Youth Training places, as well as 10,000
more offers of Enterprise Allowance and set up a temporary programme
creating 150,000 jobs.
Leftwingers called on Labour to drop its policy of opposition to a
referendum on the Maastricht treaty and grab the opportunity to defeat the
government in the Commons.
Mr Tony Benn said: 'Labour has been told for 13 years that whatever we do we
must defeat the government. Here is an opportunity to defeat the
government.'
Labour faced intense pressure from within its own ranks for a referendum, he
said.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Cold comfort in Midlands for
Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MR Norman Lamont had bought his lunchtime sandwiches at Five Ways,
Birmingham, yesterday he would have found the reception as grey as the
drizzle. No arm round the shoulders and 'Nice one, Norm.' Rather a mix of
anxiety, anger, bewilderment and indifference as worries about the future
surfaced.
'I'm just sitting and waiting to see if my husband's still got a job,' said
Mrs Yvonne Turk, a teacher. 'Interest rates are finishing the firm off. If
interest rates go down, that's okay.'
Concern among shoppers was not so much with the technical merits of the
European exchange rate mechanism - which many confessed they knew little
about - but with how the government handled the currency crisis and what it
means for the economy.
Miss Karen McAuley, who works for a finance house, argued that 'it's not
done us any good going into the exchange rate mechanism - but I don't
understand a lot of it' - but she was more concerned about the prospects of
buying a house. 'A lot of people are wondering whether they've done the
right thing by voting the Conservatives in,' she said.
Mr Neil Halliday, an accountant, considered that the events this week were
'a disaster from start to finish'. He added: 'It was a waste of time and
money to hold sterling's value. The decisions (to float the currency) should
have been made far sooner. The government has certainly not covered itself
in glory.'
His view was widely shared. 'Total mismanagement. Absolute shambles,'
complained Mr Roger Baker, a Conservative-voting computer-services
executive. Mr Ken Cameron, a computer installation engineer, said: 'I'd felt
for some time the pound would get devalued. It was inevitable. The
government actions were very amateurish.'
There seemed to be little inclination to pin the responsibility for
sterling's plight on perfidious Europeans. 'This country needs to be in the
front line of Europe,' said Mr Osei Nana, an acoustic consultant. But there
were mistakes in the past, he said. 'We should have devalued the pound a
long time ago. If we had done there wouldn't have been a crisis.'
Mr Cameron said: 'I don't think the Germans can be blamed for it.' The UK
government was 'stuck in a train of thought which is out of touch with
reality'. Mr Cameron was quite clear that there was 'too much dogma'. But Mr
Baker had a word of warning about Europe. 'We should have closer ties, but
on the trading side,' he said. 'This getting closer politically: you've only
got to see what's happening in east Europe. Everybody wants to go their own
way.'
Miss Lee Shue, a civil servant, thought 'we should be with Europe, but it
doesn't make any difference'. She added: 'The Tories don't know what they're
doing anyway.'
Such implied lack of power over the great affairs of state led Five Ways
shoppers generally to shrug their shoulders at the thought of government
resignations. And it led to expressions of indifference on the part of two
messengers, gossiping in the rain. 'It don't bother me,' said one of
sterling's plight. His companion let loose: 'Once they get in power they
just change everything. It doesn't matter what you do. They're all liars.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / Food and Wine: Luxury in the old style - Grand Hotels In the
first of a series on the world's great hotels, Nicholas Lander enjoys the
old-fashioned opulence of the Crillon in Paris. There, with the city at his
fingertips, he tries hard not to feel the pinch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of spending a weekend at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris was
beginning to interfere with my work. I wrote the hotel's name and address
down on a piece of paper and put it on the corner of my desk, only allowing
myself to look at it after a good day at the word processor.
I had mentioned where we were staying to the Frenchwoman responsible for the
export of French food and wine to the UK. Far too sophisticated to say 'Ooh
la la]' she nevertheless offered me some good advice. 'Pinch yourself while
you are there, just to make sure it is happening to you.'
But before turning to this very particular hotel's charms, let me begin with
one or two negatives. Do not think of going to stay at the Crillon if you
want to do some laps in the pool, burn off the calories on a jogging track
or in a gymnasium. Such American-isms do not exist at the Crillon.
Nor is the Crillon for you if when you enter your bedroom you like to fling
your hat and watch it disappear into a far distant corner of the bedroom.
Their bedrooms and suites are extremely comfortable but constructed on the
archi- tectural principles of 18th century Paris rather than 20th century
Houston.
Instead, go and stay in the Crillon for what it has offered since it was
transformed in 1909 from a private house belonging to the Crillon family
into an hotel for the paying public - its location, its interior and the
comfort and charm it exudes. And, if you do not stay, do eat in the
restaurant, Les Ambassadeurs, where the combination of a stunning dining
room and the youthful partnership of General Manager, Herve Houdre, 34, and
chef Christian Constant, 38, can produce a most memorable meal.
The Crillon, on the north of the Place de la Concorde, looks out on to a
magnificent slice of Parisian life. To the west is the Eiffel Tower, due
south the National Assembly, and the Obelisk of Luxor behind which you can
see the bateaux mouches plying along the Seine. To the east the Tuileries
and beyond the Musee d'Orsay and Notre- Dame.
Paris, it seems is at your fingertips even if, when you are in the Place de
la Concorde, you realise that you have to share it with countless others.
The entrance and interior of the Crillon are equally impressive. In the late
18th century when the Crillon was finally finished much greater emphasis was
given to the large public rooms, which were to impress by their size and
splendour, than to the bedrooms, reserved for more private conquests. Today
the mirrors, brass and marble brilliantly reflect the light from a string of
chandeliers while a log burning fire adds a homely touch and smells more
redolent of the French countryside.
Les Ambassadeurs is immediately on your right as you walk in. On our first
night it looked impressive and romantic with tall white candles burning on
each table; it was as dignified for breakfast on the Sunday morning in spite
of the highly polished bowl of All-Bran occupying pride of place on the
central buffet table.
Michelin gives the restaurant two stars, the highest rating of any hotel
dining room in Paris. What is particularly exciting about the food is the
confidence Christian Constant, the chef, shows in searching for, and
finding, new and adventurous combinations of foods and flavours.
A crustacean lasagne with lobster butter that even looked perfect; a
circular arrangement that mixed slices of firm, young potato, lobster and
chives. A thick piece of cod topped with thin slices of chorizo, the spicy
Spanish sausage, on a puree of flageolets and a fillet of sea bass with
cous-cous, all showed a sureness of touch and a sense of style. With the
desserts Constant's team show the same flair and an eagerness to experiment
with geometrical forms.
There were minor quibbles - the service was not faultless and the wine list
in the restaurant not quite as exciting as the food - but the overall
impression the Crillon emanates is one of magnificent luxury. Some time
after our return we still pinch ourselves just to remind ourselves that we
did stay there.
Hotel de Crillon, 10 Place de la Concorde, 75008 Paris. Tel: 44-71-15-25.
Fax 44-71-15-04. Double room from FFr2,900 (Pounds 305) a night.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Food and Wine: Cheaper bubbly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS of cheaper champagne have been enhanced by a sharp,
unprecedented cut in the officially recommended price of grapes in the large
vintage now in progress, writes Edmund Penning-Rowsell.
They are down from FFr30 to FFr24 a kilo for those from the top-rating
villages to FFr19.1 for the outlying ones.
Although the lower prices will take some time to work through the blends,
this is accompanied by a quality-raising elimination of the inferior third
pressing and a reduction in the maximum quantity of grapes permitted per
hectare, plus a blocking of surplus still wines to prevent excess sparkling
wine production from a vintage that may yield at least 250 million bottles -
20 per cent more than estimated sales this year.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Food and Wine: The '82 first-growth clarets / Assessing the
vintage ten years on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1982 clarets were widely acclaimed even before the grapes reached the
fermenting vats.
Emile Peynaud, the eminent Bordeaux University professor, said there is more
sugar in the grapes than in any year since 1947, and comparisons were
readily made with that year and the celebrated 1961.
The alcoholic strength was high, the colour exceptionally deep, and the
acidity low. Definitely a Merlot year, with a record crop of 3.5m hl of red
wine: nearly 1m more than in 1981.
Initially, the Bordeaux trade said there was no reason for increased en
primeur prices but they were increased sharply. First-growths opened at
FFr170 (Pounds 18.88) a bottle, ex-cellars, compared with FFr100 the year
before. Merchants capitalised on the prevailing buying euphoria and resold
immediately at up to FFr225.
This did not restrict demand, and speculation ran wild in the US. Typical
British opening prices in bond ran from about Pounds 290 a case for
Haut-Brion to Pounds 325 for Lafite, and the others fell between.
This led to a duty-paid, delivered cost to the consumer of between Pounds
340 and Pounds 385 a dozen. This was the only fairly recent vintage to date
in which buying futures yielded a real profit, provided the wines were not
held for long.
Accordingly, this was a special occasion for a group of six, including two
Masters of Wine, which meets each year to dine and drink (not just taste)
the eight first-growth clarets when ten years old. They set a standard for
each vintage.
Decanted at least an hour in advance, the 1982s were served in the customary
order: Haut-Brion, Margaux, Lafite, Mouton-Rothschild, Latour, Ausone,
Cheval-Blanc and Petrus.
Here, then, are my notes made at the table, followed by representative
comments noted at the same time by the other five diners.
As all viewed the colours as deep, with Haut-Brion and Ausone a little less
full than the others, the notes on this have been omitted. My notes are in
italics.
Haut-Brion: Austere nose that opened up beautifully in the glass. Strong,
fruity, medium length in the mouth. Distinguished wine. Nose developed meaty
in the glass, very distinguished, brick, earthy taste, rather high acidity;
savoury, lively nose, classic Haut-Brion taste impact, dry finish, slightly
bricky, dusty nose, with good length, dry finish; blackcurranty, a bit
lightweight; sweet initially, some sourness later, not much body.
Margaux: Very closed nose initially, but much better later, edgy, peppery,
seems to lack fruit and extract, needs more time. Nose muffled at first, but
soon evolved in glass, high marks, lovely crisp berry-like fruit; fleshy,
opulent nose, well-mannered taste, unformed but impressive, has a long way
to go, easy to under-estimate; deliciously sweet first on palate,
beautifully balanced; lovely rich middle taste, good length, too young;
aromatic nose, rather thin initially but richer later.
Lafite: Fine nose, elegant, distinguished flavour, good balance but when
refreshed later had lost some body. Nose low-key at first, but developed
creamy, spicy, vanilla, quite powerful, considerable extra tannin, acidity;
rather dry, stalky finish, savoury nose, but can't see it developing
dramatically; wonderful nose, meaty, substantial flavour, but dry in the
mouth; delicious nose, candlewick, but gone down when refreshed; raffine,
thin at end.
Mouton-Rothschild: Very closed nose, quite strong, aggressive at first, but
better later. Flavour a bit dull. Youthful for an '82, thick, biscuity nose.
Massive wine, dry, full-bodied, tannic yet soft; exotic nose, very sweet
palate impact, delicious tonight, but definitely leaner than Latour; still
very young, dense, concentrated; huge almost Petrus-like, sweet,
Californian; lacks elegance, rich, full sweet.
Latour: Full Pauillac nose, rich fruity wine, with a good deal behind it,
but not ready, yet less backward than usual. Touch of banana and vanilla on
nose, fragrant after one hour, loads of tannin, great future; not much nose,
very sweet palate entry, almost porty, first wine with perceptible tannin,
backward; nose you could cut with a knife and fork, dumb, backward; unready,
strong banana smell, not very enjoyable now, intense, sweet with sharpness
afterwards.
Ausone: Chocolate nose, big, round, well-balanced wine, needs time as much
behind it. Pleasant, mature nose, very sweet, medium body for an '82, dryish
finish, a point; fruitcake nose, lovely tonight but I'd back Cheval-Blanc
for the long term; sweet and succulent in mouth, the first wine really
ready; cabbagy, herbal nose, more Italian than Bordeaux; slight sharpness on
nose and a little neutral on taste.
Cheval-Blanc: Fairly fruity on nose, but flavour richer than expected; nose
came out of glass when refreshed, a very enjoyable wine. Gentle, sweet,
harmonious bouquet, very sweet, lovely flavour and balance, nice now;
unformed nose, hint of tea, lovely sweetness at first taste, currants
macerated in alcohol, very long; very rich, concentration on nose and
palate, if anything slightly too ripe; very approachable wine not near its
peak; strong, sweet, beguiling.
Petrus: Near-burgundian, rich nose, sweet taste but not a lot behind it. Is
there enough acidity to keep it? Rich, meaty, slightly malty nose, packed
with fruit, virtually faultless, yet not exciting; hint of rusty nails on
nose, treacle on taste, not appetising, a bit flabby; very rich and lovely
length, is it too big as always?; rich, ripe and Californian; smooth, sweet,
rich, lovely.
After all glasses were refreshed, the order of preference was taken: from
one to eight, with the lowest total first. 1 Cheval-Blanc (11); 2
Mouton-Rothschild (18); 3 Petrus (22); 4 Ausone (23); 5 Latour and Margaux
equal (25); 7 Lafite (43); 8 Haut-Brion (48). The wines were judged on the
night and, as can be seen, the first six were close together. All agreed
there was not a bad bottle among the eight. As always, it must be emphasised
that bottle variation may occur at this age, and only one bottle of each
wine was opened.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Food and Wine: If it's September, it must be onions -
Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGHT of button onions and courgettes galore in the shops and markets is
a sure sign that September is here. The other thing that unites these
otherwise disparate ingredients is that each can be absolutely delicious or
remarkably nasty, depending on the mercy of the cook.
Just to think about pickled onions, sozzled brutally with vinegar, sets my
teeth on edge. On the other hand, the gluttonous memory of a dish of
buttery, glazed onions served with a leg of lamb last Sunday sets the saliva
sprinting.
Overgrown courgettes lack finesse. I would rather have good, honest marrow.
Miniature courgettes are as bad as bloated big ones. I have only bought
dwarf courgettes once - and that was once too often.
Did I strike unlucky with a particularly unfortunate batch or are they
always tasteless, bordering on unpleasant? The price of the dwarf offerings
from Thailand also was hard to swallow.
Smallish, youthful and very fresh courgettes are the only truly desirable
sort. Ideally, they should be picked so recently that they come complete
with flowers at their tips blooming brightly. Then, you can enjoy a double
treat.
GLAZED ONIONS WITH CINNAMON (serves 5-6)
Apart from the chore of peeling, this is quick and easy. It is excellent
with grilled chicken, chops and steaks, roasted meats and game birds. Unless
you hand-pick each onion when shopping, it is best to buy 2lb or so. That
way, all the onions used for this recipe can be more or less uniform in
size; save the runts and the fatties for other dishes.
Ingredients: 1 1/2 lb pickling onions; scant 1 1/2 oz unsalted or clarified
butter; 1 slightly heaped teaspoon of sugar; a pinch of ground cinnamon (or
freshly grated nutmeg or chopped parsley for serving).
Method: Peel the onions and choose a heavy-based pan or flameproof casserole
into which they will fit, as near as possible, in a single layer.
Heat the pot and melt the butter in it. Add the onions and turn them to coat
all over with fat. Sprinkle on the sugar, stir again, and cook half-covered
over moderate to low heat (for 15-20 minutes depending on the size of the
onions) until tender, streaked with gold and caramelised here and there.
Stir the onions occasionally as they cook. (Turn the heat right down, or
cover the pan completely, if they are browning too fast or if too much
moisture is being lost).
Onions cooked this way can be kept hot for some while without spoiling.
Season and dust with cinnamon (or nutmeg or parsley) just before serving.
COURGETTES FRIED WITH THEIR FLOWERS (serves 4)
Life is too short to stuff a flower. Nor do I bother to dip courgette
flowers in batter before frying. Simply dusting them with well-seasoned
flour seems to me as much embellishment as they need.
Ingredients: 8 small courgettes complete with their flowers (plus extra
courgette flowers if available); a few black olives (preferably tiny ones
from Provence); half a lemon; the leaves stripped from a sprig or two of
thyme (preferably lemon thyme); a little chopped parsley; olive oil; a
little well-seasoned flour.
Method: Separate the flowers from the vegetables and slice the courgettes.
Check that the flowers are clean and cut each one down its entire length on
one side, from the tip of the petal to the juicy, thick base. Remove the
pistil, fan the flower open so it lies flat and cut into two or three
pieces.
Saute the sliced courgettes until just tender in a hot pan barely filmed
with oil. Do not cook them so long that the skins lose their fresh green
colour. Transfer them to a shallow serving dish. Add the olives, herbs,
citrus zest, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Toss to mix and
keep hot in a low oven.
Quickly add extra oil to the pan - to about a quarter-inch deep. Dust the
flowers with well-seasoned flour and fry them very briefly so they become
wafery crisp, yet retain their lime green and gold colouring. Drain the
flowers well, arrange them in a garland around the courgettes and serve
straight away.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Wine and Food: Crumbs of discomfort - Nicholas Lander finds
that life can be tough in a French bakery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 7 am, the village baker's daughter opened the doors to me, her first
customer. On my way out I bumped into the mayor, who pumped my hand like a
good politician and bemoaned the fact that the bar owner had overslept and
he would have to wait for that day's Midi Libre.
Along the main road came the baker's apprentice, on his shoulder a large,
brown plastic container with 80 assorted baguettes, ficelles and pains de
campagne fresh from the oven. While I strolled back, he ran, so that five
minutes' later, as I walked past the baker's laboratoire (all French
artisans, even butchers, give their units of production this name), he was
busy loading the oven again.
The following Tuesday at 12.30 am, the 19-year-old apprentice, now known to
me as Yannek, opened the laboratoire door to me, his assistant for the
night. His boss had not yet arrived. And so began an Englishman's
involvement in supplying a French village with its staple food.
The first task was to calculate the quantities. In a small village of 600,
consumption is constant, and a look at the previous Tuesday's sales gave the
totals for tonight's production: 70 long and 48 short loaves; 130 baguettes;
six pains de campagne; four other different types of loaf, including one
without salt and one wholemeal (French bakers are finally adding various
types of brown bread to their range); plus 3.5 kg of croissants, pains au
chocolat and pains aux raisins.
Just after 1 am the baker arrived, complaining of the heat. Stripped to the
waist, he and Yannek took yeast from yesterday's production  - the crucial
element, according to the baker  - plus salt, water and flour and, with the
aid of an enormous 40-year-old mixing bowl, made the dough.
The flour, which came from a nearby mill in 50 kg sacks, contained 1 per
cent farine de feves: broad bean flour which ensures that the dough (and,
therefore, the bread) emerged white rather than grey. The mass of dough was
dug out into 11 kilo balls which would each make 20 loaves. Then, to the
shout of 'On attague,' the dough was cut mechanically and thrown into what
looked like an old-fashioned mangle. It emerged in the shape of embryonic
baguettes, which were laid on trays to wait for the fermentation to bring
them up to their proper size.
The activity brought a healthy glow to the baker and his assistant. In the
baker's case, it was enhanced by numerous cups of chicory-flavoured coffee
laced with rum and a packet of Gitaines Mais.
His immediate complaint was the lack of a family holiday this summer because
of the recession, although he and his wife were concerned for their only
son, enlisted recently in the army and possibly en route to Yugoslavia.
Professionally, he complained that the French were buying less and less
bread. He predicted that supermarkets would soon ring the death knell for
most village bakers.
When I asked him if he made a living, he shrugged his shoulders. The shop
provided a flat and income for the family; but when the annual increase in
the price of bread was passed by the French government, it was greeted by
his customers with howls of protest.
The only time his eyes lit up was at the mention of the Spanish and
Portuguese grape-pickers, who would soon invade the area during the
September harvest. They, at least, are still great bread-eaters.
At 3 am, the oil-fired oven was lit and the peace of the night shattered; it
would reach its optimum temperature at 4.30. Until then, the baker retreated
into a small kitchen and made his patisserie  - apple, peach or plum tarts,
Paris-Brest or the local speciality, fougasse  - which, he assured me, was a
more remunerative occupation than baking bread.
This finished at 4.30 and, with the oven at its correct temperature, the
baker and his assistant went upstairs to sleep.
Just before 6, the vital incisions were made in the tops of the baguettes
and the oven loaded with the first 120 loaves. The trays of croissants were
given a final brush of butter and slid into a convection oven. By 6.25, as
the dawn broke, the air was filled with aromas of baking bread.
The baker slid the first lot from the oven at 6.40 but he was not too happy.
He complained that the cold northerly wind had slowed the fermentation and
that Yannek had allowed the oven to get too hot. He threw me the first loaf,
which I very nearly dropped. I have worked in commercial kitchens, but this
was the hottest thing I had ever held.
As Yannek carried the first container up to the shop, two workmen called in
for their pains au chocolat. Then the baker turned his attention back to the
oven and, pleased to have an audience for once, shouted: 'Now, watch an
expert' as he began to load his oven with more loaves.

THE crisis in French prisons deepened yesterday when the army was sent in to
a number of jails and a policeman was injured as picketing prison officers
tried to stop a squad of riot police from entering Baumettes prison near
Marseilles.
Tension mounted during the day after an incident early in the morning when
an escaped convict from Clairvaux high-security jail was shot dead by
police. The man was one of seven inmates who broke out of Clairvaux last
Friday in a shoot-out during which a warder was killed.
The Clairvaux shooting sparked the strike by prison officers which has
wrought chaos in the French jail system this week.
Only 60 of France's 182 prisons were operating normally yesterday, despite
the government's attempts to negotiate a settlement with warders who are
demanding more staff and better security,
Riot police have been installed in a number of jails. Police unions have
protested against the use of their members to supplement staff.

ECUADOR yesterday threatened to become the first member to leave the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel since its founding in
1960, Neil Buckley writes from Geneva.
The second-smallest producer in Opec, it has fallen out with the
organisation over its desire to raise output and increase its revenues to
help pay off its Dollars 13bn (Pounds 7.3bn) debt.
Ecuador, which joined Opec in 1973, said it intended to withdraw at the
cartel's next meeting in November.
Ecuador's statement was a second blow to the organisation, after Mr
Gholamresa Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, said Iran did not accept
Opec's communique issued late on Thursday.
Opec's ministerial monitoring committee pledged to freeze total production
at 24.2m b/d for the fourth quarter, although Kuwait was allowed to continue
raising output as it rebuilt its oil industry after the Gulf war. Iran had
been pressing for a cut in production, and said an opportunity had been
missed to drive oil prices up to the target of Dollars 21 a barrel for the
Opec basket of crudes. Mr Aghazadeh said Iran would now adjust its
production according to world demand, but did not intend to disrupt the oil
market by substantially raising output, as had been rumoured.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Clinton, me and a question of draft-dodging: Amid the
controversy over the Democratic candidate and the Vietnam war, US Editor
Jurek Martin recalls his own experiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILL Clinton was not the only young man in Britain at the end of the 1960s
contemplating the prospect of military service and, worst of all, fighting
in the Vietnam war. At least one was not even an American citizen.
One Saturday morning in the autumn of 1968 a letter, with a California
postmark, was delivered to a south London address. It summarily instructed
the recipient to report for induction into the US Army at Fort Ord at a date
which, on close inspection, turned out to be three weeks before the letter
actually arrived.
This was distressing, because the recipient had recently been told by his
employer that he was about to be posted to its Washington office. The
prospect of having to withdraw from what was then, and still is, one of the
best jobs in journalism, led to a miserable weekend.
The Monday mail brought miraculous relief, another letter with a California
postmark one day later than the first. It acknowledged a 'clerical error'
and confirmed that the recipient was indeed 'an alien not currently liable
for military service'. Both letters had been sent surface mail and had taken
the best part of six weeks to arrive.
It may only be a minor part of Mr Clinton's explanations that his draft
board communicated with him in Oxford by steam packet, but personal
experience confirms that this is exactly what draft boards did in those
days. Indeed, the controversy surrounding the Democratic presidential
candidate revives a lot of half-buried memories of the fear of any
communication from them.
I had gone to live, and teach, in California in 1963. Before the changes in
US immigration laws in 1967, it was easy for any Briton not a card-carrying
communist and without a prison record to emigrate and acquire the coveted
green card. You were obliged, however, after a six-month grace period, to
register with your local draft board and were liable to be called up.
Before the Vietnam war escalated, it was a small risk. In any case,
educational, occupational and marriage deferments were available. Even after
President Lyndon Johnson cancelled many of these in 1965, prompting a
deadline-beating rush from California to the 'quickie' wedding chapels in
Reno, Nevada, many of whom mysteriously stopped the clock in their records,
there were always pullable strings with the local draft board.
I was teaching at a new private school and was technically not qualified for
an occupational deferment. But the school principal, who had served 30 years
in the US Marines, was an intimate of my rural draft board and if he could
not fix things the school owner, a big rancher, certainly could. It was
common knowledge that the only young men that draft board did send to serve
 - the lottery was not introduced until 1969  - were the offspring of
parents without clout, such as resident Mexican farm labourers.
It became more complicated after I left the school, and thus its protection,
but stayed on doing other things in California. I was reclassified 1-A, a
prime candidate for the draft. I appealed against this, in writing, a
process which took some months, but was unsuccessful.
Continued dissembling and prevarication with the draft board was possible,
but the net was obviously closing and so was the fear that the bureaucracy
would make connections. A tax return or a traffic violation, for example,
might serve as a tip to a draft board. Another English friend in the same
boat was arrested one night and left the country as soon as he was
discharged the following day.
I would never claim to have been vocal against US policy in Vietnam but the
thought of fighting in a war which, like most young American friends, I
strongly opposed did not exactly appeal. Unlike them, I had a way out, to
'go home', and duly did in 1966, advising the draft board of my London
whereabouts and having my status re-classified; and that, excepting one
awful weekend over two years later, was where it has all rested.
This is just one tiny personal story. Many others have long since come out
of the closet, none more effectively than James Fallows's 1975 magazine
article about the contrasting experiences of his class at Harvard, less than
10 per cent of whom ever served, and the fate of the less privileged
children of the Boston working class, who did, in droves.
The point is that there is a whole generation of Americans to whom, for good
reasons and bad, avoiding a system which had become institutionally corrupt
was the most important thing in their young lives. Thousands went so far as
to go into exile.
The lottery did not render it pure again because there were still ways round
it. Bill Clinton set out his reasons for seeking to avoid it in a 1969
letter that was painfully honest in its reasoning and remarkably frank in
its confession that, even then, he was only registering because he harboured
political ambitions.
Is this the fatal flaw which will deny him the White House? The Bush
campaign cleverly contends that it is not what he did then which is at
issue, though it surely is a subtext, but how he recalls it, selectively,
now. A more revealing comment this week from a Republican official was the
promise to 'rip the skin off the guy'.
Picking holes in his explanations of the events of 23 years ago seemed this
week the biggest shot left in the president's re-election armoury and, in
such a personalised political environment, it may still pack firepower.
If so, then Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney and Phil Gramm, three Republicans with
presidential ambitions but no military service, may wonder if they, too,
will one day fall victim to the Vietnam syndrome.
But it stretches credulity that it will make enough of a difference. Today's
war is not Vietnam but the economy. If it were the other way round, the
above true story would probably never have been told.

FT  19 SEP 92 / US, UK oppose Bosnia no-fly zone
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Britain are opposed to any immediate attempt by western nations
to enforce a 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia as a means of preventing air attacks by
Serb forces.
Their caution over French proposals for a ban on military flights became
clear during two days of talks in London with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence
secretary. Mr Cheney said yesterday the idea was still being discussed but
described the proposed ban as 'a bit of sideshow' compared with the main
problem of how to achieve a political solution in the former Yugoslavia.
Meanwhile, the UN and EC peace talks on Bosnia-Hercegovina began in Geneva
yesterday with the mainly Moslem Bosnian government refusing direct talks
with Serb and Croat representatives and a hardline statement from the
Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, again staking Serb claims to more
than half the country.
The two co-chairmen of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and the Finnish mediator on Bosnia, Mr Martti
Ahtisaari, met separately with the three sides during the day. Further
meetings are scheduled for today and Monday.
Prospects brightened, however, for a resumption of relief flights into
Sarajevo. Speaking before a meeting with Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Karadzic confirmed that he would support a 'no
fly' zone in the vicinity of the humanitarian aid corridors, though not for
Bosnia as a whole.
Mrs Ogata had said earlier she would recommend an immediate restart of the
Sarajevo airlift if she received satisfactory assurances from the warring
factions on the safety of flights.
Mr Karadzic said that in the Bosnian talks he would be pressing for an
'immediate and unconditional' ceasefire, to be followed by negotiations to
set up a confederation of three constituent states controlled by Serbs,
Croats and Moslems.
The UN Security Council appeared close to majority agreement last night on a
resolution that in effect would nullify Yugoslav membership of the UN,
writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
Initiated by Western members with the backing of Moslem states angered by
Serbian attacks in Bosnia-Hercegoviona, the projected resolution would
reject the Belgrade governments claim to 'automatic continuity' as successor
to the former state of Yugoslavia and require that it apply for admission
like any other candidate.

JAPAN'S money supply growth remained at record low levels in August, with

Bank officials said the slight increase in the growth of M2 and certificates
of deposit from the record low of 0.2 per cent in July did not mark the
start of an upturn in the money supply.
The bank recently cast doubt on the usefulness of the broad money supply as
a measure of credit conditions. August's low growth suggests, however, that
July's half-point cut in interest rates to 3.25 per cent has barely
stimulated bank lending.
Officials expect M2 growth of less than 1 per cent in the third quarter as a
whole, which implies growth of less than 0.5 per cent in September. Broad
liquidity, another closely-watched broad monetary indicator, which includes
deposits in the postal savings system, grew at a record low of 3.3 per cent
in August, down from 3.5 per cent the month before. The slow growth of money
supply, which was growing at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in August last
year, will fuel speculation that the bank may have to cut interest rates
further to stimulate the economy.
The economy's depressed state was confirmed by the steel industry, which
yesterday became the first industry to apply officially for government
assistance to help pay for the transfer or retraining of laid-off surplus
workers.

RUSSIA will need Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn in external financing next year
to bridge its balance-of-payments gap even after a 'reasonable' foreign debt
rescheduling, Mr Peter Aven, the foreign economic relations minister, said
yesterday.
Mr Aven and his colleagues will make the first detailed presentation of
'four or five scenarios' for a rescheduling of the former Soviet Union's
Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39.5bn) foreign debt to the Group of Seven industrial
nations in Washington over the next few days.
He said the various proposals had one common goal: to ease the debt burden
so that Russia would only have to pay about Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn next
year instead of the Dollars 20bn falling due in 1993. But even if that was
agreed, Russia would still need additional balance-of-payments support while
it pursued painful market reforms.
He rejected a claim by the International Finance Institute, a
Washington-based banking lobby, that Russia was capable of repaying more
money if it put its house in order.
Although he has himself estimated annual capital flight from Russia at
Dollars 3bn, Mr Aven said 'only Hitler or Stalin' could stop such phenomena
quickly.
If a rescheduling accord is not ready for final endorsement by the wider
Paris Club of creditor nations at the end of the month when a present debt
deferral expires, the latter is to be extended for 15 days.
Russia is also trying to persuade other republics to renounce claims on the
former Soviet Union's assets in return for which Russia will assume sole
responsibility for its foreign debt. None of them can make hard currency
repayments, except possibly Turkmenistan, which has gas.

The spokesman for the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Mr Rabah
Kebir, who three weeks ago fled house arrest in Annaba and took refuge
abroad, has reiterated his movement's willingness for 'dialogue' with the
Algerian authorities, writes Francis Ghiles. However, four conditions would
have to be met.
All those arrested since the electoral process was suspended and the FIS
banned last January, should be released and 'arbitrary arrests' stopped. FIS
municipal councillors elected in the June 1990 poll should be reinstated and
all those arrested 'compensated'. The second round of the elections, whose
first round last December 26 gave FIS candidates 48 per cent of the popular
vote, must be allowed to proceed.

<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday insisted that public
funds could be used to assist the troubled banking system, contradicting the
Ministry of Finance, which says public funds will not be used.
Meanwhile, the National Tax Administration Agency announced the relaxation
of rules on the writing-off of bad loans. Banks will be able to claim as a
loss any loans on which payments have not been made for a year, down from
two years.
Public support for ailing banks is a controversial issue, as previous
suggestions that public funds would be used have prompted widespread
complaints from ordinary Japanese, who argue that banks should take
responsibility for their non-performing loans.
Mr Miyazawa's open support for the use of public funds contrasts sharply
with the policy statements of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, who has
insisted that public funds will not be used in supporting the banking
system.
The government has been reviewing tax breaks and loan disclosure regulations
relating to banks, as yesterday's announcement by the tax agency shows. Mr
Hata has said a more detailed disclosure of non-performing loans will help
to restore confidence in the banking system.
In spite of the minister's statements, the finance ministry is studying
overseas cases of support for troubled financial institutions, but ministry
officals hint that a detailed public support programme will only be
announced if the health of the banking system worsens in coming months.

<TEXT>
EC interior and justice ministers yesterday emphasised that the Maastricht
Treaty could help them beat organised crime in Europe and agreed to step up
joint efforts to tackle international criminal organisations such as the
Mafia, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Interior ministers also agreed to meet again - possibly before their
scheduled November meeting - to discuss the problem of refugees from the
former Yugoslav republics, as soon as officials have completed studies of
possible solutions.
The public relations value of yesterday's meeting was seized on by the
French government delegation, two days ahead of the French vote on the
Maastricht accord.
Fears that organised crime might spread across open EC borders has been
played up by French opponents of Maastricht, but in an EC presidency
statement after the meeting, ministers welcomed the impulse that the
Maastricht Treaty would give to closer co-operation on police and judicial
matters.
Security at the Brussels headquarters of the council of ministers was
tightened up for the meeting, which was held at the request of Italian and
French justice ministers following the assassinations of anti-Mafia judges
Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino in Sicily.
The Italian delegation included Mrs Liliana Ferraro, Mr Falcone's successor
as director of penal affairs at the Ministry of Justice and a possible Mafia
target.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, Britain's home secretary and chairman of the meeting,
conceded afterwards that intergovernmental action on immigration and police
issues would continue even if the Maastricht Treaty was rejected.

PRO-BEIJING newspapers yesterday published strong criticism of Hong Kong's
revised proposals for financing its new airport, raising doubts about
whether China would agree to them.
The newspapers called the plan to raise direct government investment in the
HKDollars 163.7bn (Pounds 11.2bn) project by HKDollars 40bn 'insincere and
unconstructive'.
Ta Kung Pao, a communist newspaper, said the government had 'ignored the
principle of cost-effectiveness, spending Hong Kong taxpayers' money at its
discretion on the one hand and trying to use the special administrative
region government's profits in advance on the other'.
Wen Wei Po, another newspaper, said: 'The financial problem can only be
solved when the British side comes up with a proposal that can reduce
costs.'
Mr Hamish Macleod, financial secretary, said he was disappointed by the
reaction, but the government would wait to hear China's official response.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Dancing amid the ruins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE HAVE never seen anything like it before. Not the disorder in the currency
markets, for that is an oft-told tale; but the spectacle of the stock market
mounting a champagne celebration to mark the discomfiture of a Conservative
government. In economic terms, this judgment may well prove apt.
The cost to the UK of trying to achieve monetary convergence had become
unacceptably high, and its departure from the system is a potential economic
liberation.
But the political cost of the crisis, not just to Mr John Major but to the
whole of the European community  - including those still waiting for
admission  - is incalculable. The market reaction shows not just the
devaluation of a group of currencies, but of the whole idea of an integrated
Europe.
This is not a gain of any kind. There is no alternative vision on offer, nor
any political leader strong enough to impose one even on his own electorate,
let alone his partners.
Market disillusion with the project for economic union has been evident for
many months. The first signs appeared even before the Maastricht treaty was
signed. Bond yield differentials, which had been narrowing for some time in
the hope of lasting economic convergence, started to widen just as the
convergence plan was being officially ratified. Then came the collapse of
the ECU bond market, which had been seen as the commercial precursor of
monetary union: there were not enough interested investors to constitute a
workable market. They were not impressed with visions of 1993, let alone
1997 (the hoped for Maastricht date for a single currency).
Red meat
All the same, the currency markets remained calm. The world banking system
has been so debilitated by bad judgment and bad lending that nearly all
banks had forbidden their dealers to take speculative positions for more
than an hour or two. Exchange markets responded not only to light central
bank intervention, but even to veiled hints from those in authority. Only a
few weeks ago, the idea that dealers might suddenly eat red meat, and turn
to defy concerted intervention across Europe, looked far-fetched. British
hopes that firm official words could control the financial tide look silly
now, but must have seemed quite plausible then.
In the event it was not sterling or the lira, but the US dollar which fell
first. This seemed at first to have official blessing, as the Administration
took a public position which was very near benign neglect. But the telling
moment came when the combined central banks made a quite obviously
half-hearted attempt to check the fall. For the first time in many months,
dealers who kept an open position against their central banks during a
trading day closed their books in the evening with useful profits, and at a
time when banking profits were hard indeed to earn. The sharks were freed to
hunt; the lira devaluation a week ago poured blood into the water.
Popular doubts
European leaders would no doubt be blaming the whole crisis on the dealers,
if they were not so busy blaming each other; but this would put cause and
effect the wrong way round. What we have seen is not politicians struggling
with markets, but markets responding to politics. The Danish vote, the
strength of French popular doubts about Maastricht, and ever louder
criticism of Mr Major's policies from his own back benches were all known
before the markets ran out of control. A vacuous meeting of Group of Seven
officials deepened the general scepticism, and reports of a furious shouting
match when Europe's finance ministers met in Bath set the timing.
By Monday, a French 'Oui' to Maastricht may reset the direction of European
development, though now on a long, two-speed route. This should restore some
calm, but it will do next to nothing to calm fears of world depression, to
meet the hopes of the ex-Communist countries of Europe, or to end the threat
posed by revived populist nationalism.
It would be easy to urge the Group of Seven or the whole membership of the
IMF, whose meetings are just about to begin, to set a new lead. Such an
effort would be difficult in economically lean times, which always inspire
national selfishness. While the US is in mid-campaign, and Anglo-German
insults are being rallied across the North Sea, it would be futile. Any
attempted solution will have to wait on the election of new leaders to
replace the tired and discredited men of the moment  - a group which Mr John
Major has at least temporarily joined.
The world leaders could, however, aim for an important second best. They
should agree to refrain from competitive devaluation, and to tackle the
Uruguay round of trade talks with a new sense of urgency. Such a pact should
be achievable, even through clenched teeth. It accords with everyone's
stated aims, and would counter a short-term setback with some long term
hope.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Smiling through the tears: After a week of angst, John Major
must start again from scratch. Philip Stephens takes the measure of the man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It could not have been a crueller week for Mr John Major. In the space of a
few hours the foreign exchange markets brushed aside everything the prime
minister has worked for during nearly two years in 10 Downing Street. He
must now start again from scratch.
It is not an impossible task. Too many made the mistake five months ago of
judging Mr Major's April general election victory as the precursor to
permanent Conservative government. It would be equally wrong now to view
the, albeit bloody, defeat he suffered this week at the hands of the
currency speculators as the prelude to inevitable self-destruction. Politics
is not that simple.
There is no doubt, though, that the next year will be gruelling. The events
of this week have greatly weakened Mr Major's political authority and left
his government without a coherent economic strategy. They have exposed and
widened the fault lines in his party over Europe.
Mr Major's own reluctance yesterday to set any date for sterling's return to
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System indicated that
the personal pain of his defeat is clouding a more considered judgment of
how he can rebuild his strategy.
The mood at Westminster yesterday did not reflect that reality. In the
extraordinary way of politics, the despair which had gripped the
Conservatives on Wednesday night, when sterling was withdrawn from the ERM,
had been replaced by a surreal euphoria.
For many in a Tory party desperate to see an end to the recession, and one
in which a streak of xenophobia is never far from the surface, breaking the
link with the D-mark was a cathartic experience.
Mr Norman Lamont, the embattled chancellor, caught the mood when he talked
yesterday of running a 'British economic policy'. Ministers joined Tory MPs
in predicting an early interest rate cut and in prophesying that a devalued
pound would hasten recovery. And Britain would no longer be pushed around by
the Germans.
In a strange way it is easy to see how, in the short term, life could be
easier for Mr Major. The chancellor was at pains yesterday to stress that
anti-inflation policy would remain the first priority. But the implication
of his comments was that the ERM obligation to hold sterling at DM2.95 had
been imposing too tight a squeeze.
A cabinet colleague said the government had recognised for some time that
the tensions in the ERM caused by German unification meant that the British
economy was 'disinflating too fast'. It had decided to stick with DM2.95
because of the long-term credibility that it would buy with financial
markets. But now it had been forced off that rate, it could recognise a more
realistic approach was possible.
A more junior minister offered a Pounds 10 wager that interest rates would
be below 10 per cent by the time Mr Major rises to address the Tory party
conference on October 9. Added to a few harsh words about the Bundesbank, it
would guarantee the prime minister a rapturous standing ovation.
The minister was scornful of the suggestion that the conference might wonder
about past promises to the Tory faithful to keep the pound pegged to the
D-mark: 'Our capacity for collective amnesia is infinite.'
An apparently ineffectual Labour opposition tied by its own support for the
policy of holding the pound at DM2.95 added to the strange mood of optimism.
But Mr Major cannot afford to relax. It may well be that life in the short
term will be easier. It may be still easier if the French electorate votes
tomorrow to reject the Maastricht treaty on European union. 'That would
solve a lot of problems,' one of the prime minister's colleagues said this
week.
But as he reflects this weekend on the traumas of Wednesday, the prime
minister cannot be sanguine. Since the day in October 1990 when he persuaded
the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher to take sterling into the ERM he has invested
as much of his own credibility in a single policy as any British politician
in recent history.
For two years he has poured scorn on the long list of predecessors in Number
10 who promised to defend the pound and then failed. Only 10 days ago he had
this to say of the then Mr Harold Wilson's decision to devalue sterling in
1967. 'Did this lead to a sustained improvement in the UK's
competitiveness?' he asked rhetorically. 'It did not. A brief flurry only.
Retail price inflation doubled over the following year and any improvement
in competitiveness swiftly ended. No greater competitiveness and doubled
inflation: what sort of bargain is that?'
Such phrases will come back to haunt him in coming months and years. Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, is promising a litany of them during what will be
be a bruising debate on the economy in the House of Commons next Thursday.
But there is more at stake than personal or political pride. Mr Major justly
has the reputation of being a pragmatist. He is fond of telling people that
he is neither an intellectual nor a philosopher.
His steady yet spectacular rise through the ranks of the Tory party during
the 1980s owed much to his shrewd determination to be branded neither a
Thatcherite nor a Wet - but to seen by his peers as both. It is those traits
which have brought the wounding comparisons this week with Mr Wilson, the
arch-pragmatist of post-war British politics.
But the prime minister's approach to inflation is different. His repeated
assertions that Britain's poor inflation performance is at the root of the
nation's economic decline represent conviction rather than convenience.
He sees inflation as a moral as well as a political issue, a phenomenon that
erodes the social fabric of society and drains its economic strength. Thus
last week he quoted approvingly from Keynes that: 'There is no subtler, nor
surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the
currency.'
It was from that perspective that over nine difficult months as chancellor
in 1990 he persuaded Mrs Margaret Thatcher to put sterling in the ERM. When
he replaced her in 10 Downing Street a fixed parity for sterling against the
D-mark was confirmed as the fast-track to the Holy Grail of stable prices.
Barely two months ago Mr Major was wondering aloud at cocktail parties how
long it would take before sterling joined the D-mark in Europe's
hard-currency club. It sounded fanciful but he meant it. Now the pound has
been bracketed with the lira and the peseta. He must add another two years
at least to whatever the timescale - a decade or so - he had in mind.
It was not just the prime minister's economic policy that lay in ruins on
Wednesday evening. His second ambition when he got the job was to rebuild
from the wreckage left by his predecessor a consensus in the Tory party over
Britain's place in Europe. He is not a federalist and never will be. But he
was and is convinced that Britain could not risk being stranded on the
fringes of the European Community. Just as Mr Major wanted the pound to be
spoken off in the same breath as the D-mark rather than the peseta so, too,
was he convinced that Britain had to be in Europe's first division.
He painstakingly rebuilt the bridges with Chancellor Helmut Kohl that had
been so merrily burnt by his predecessor. In literally scores of meetings
with groups of sceptical Tory backbench MPs he persuaded them that the
government had to live with Europe rather than revile it. Mrs Thatcher was
marginalised as the new prime minister declared that the Maastricht deal -
albeit with its opt-out clauses - represented 'game, set and match' for his
brand of pragmatic Europeanism.
Ironically the seal was to be set on that policy during the current
presidency of the Community, with December's Edinburgh summit confirming
with great fanfare Britain's return to what Mr Major is fond of calling the
'heart of Europe'.
Instead it is the Euro-sceptics who now have the upper hand. The swathe of
uncommitted MPs in the Tory party at Westminster are beginning to wonder if
the irreconcilables - the small band who have always opposed the ERM and
Maastricht - were right in blaming sterling's link to the D-Mark for the
economic pain of the past two years.
Mr Major's thinly-veiled attacks on Germany and Mr Lamont's appeal to the
spurious notion that there can be something akin to a uniquely British
economic strategy have not helped his own cause.
He questioned yesterday the basic structure of the ERM. But the D-Mark's
domination of the system is nothing new. Mr Major, a former chancellor,
cannot claim to have believed the Bundesbank would be anything but
inflexible about its domestic anti-inflation strategy.
Mr Major's present stance will help reassure the Euro-sceptics. And perhaps,
after such a shattering week, it is not surprising that Mr Major should want
nothing more than a period of peace and quiet at Westminster.
But over the coming months he will have to rebuild a European policy which
consists of more than blaming the Germans. He presides over a pro-European
cabinet.
The senior ministers he gathered around him on Wednesday to share in the
decision to leave the ERM - Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr
Kenneth Clarke - still see Britain's future at the heart rather than the
periphery over Europe. And, as Mr Heseltine signalled yesterday, they do not
believe there is a long-term future for the pound outside the ERM once the
single European market is in place.
Nor do they doubt that the prime minister still shares his ambition of
stable prices and partnership rather than conflict with Germany and France.
During the crisis hours on Wednesday it was Mr Major who demanded
confirmation and reconfirmation from the Treasury that the government had
fulfilled all its ERM obligations before he took the decision to withdraw
the pound.
His colleagues expect Mr Major's understandable angst to be replaced in
coming months with a return to the pragmatism which persuaded him to join
the ERM and his party to jettison the anti-Europeanism into which Mrs
Thatcher had led it.
It will be a long and painful journey, punctuated by further outbursts of
internecine strife in the Tory party.
But Mr Major has invested too much in his anti-inflation strategy and in the
ERM to break loose now; and too much in Europe to declare that he too is a
Euro-sceptic.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Fear and loathing on the loose: The task facing UN troops in
Baranja, eastern Croatia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
War seems a long way off from the lush, sun-drenched cornfields of Slavonia,
eastern Croatia. Yet this time last year, the Yugoslav army and Serb forces
were fighting against Croat soldiers in these meadows from where mortar and
artillery rockets were launched. Entire villages and towns were razed.
Since April, UN troops deployed in three sectors of Croatia have steadily
overseen the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army and the disarming of local Serb
police forces, a process which is continuing. Despite these troops, the UN's
protected area in 'sector east', eastern Croatia, is lapsing into
lawlessness.
The Serbs, who seized this and other parts of Croatia last year, are
determined to hold onto their gains. Mr Boronje Zivanovic, president of the
council of Beli Manistir, the main town in the Baranja, which comprises the
entire northern part of sector east, said the region would never again
become part of Croatia.
'This is our territory. This is part of the Serbian republic of Krajina,' he
said. He called the Belgian UN battalion, deployed in this part of sector
east, 'fascists'.
Mr Zivanovic says Serb leaders want to set up their own state in the
Baranja, even though it is Croatian territory. 'Those Belgians are
preventing us from doing that,' he said. He added that the local Serbs
authorities are applying laws passed in September 1991 by the
self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina, which includes the Baranja. As
part of the creation of a greater Serbia, Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic had hoped to link the Krajina with Serbia proper.
The recent upheavals have altered the ethnic composition of the Baranja.
Forty-two per cent of Baranja's 54,000-strong population was Croat and 25
per cent was Serb. During the fighting, 25,000 Croats and Hungarians fled
the region. Since the war, 10,000 Serb refugees have been resettled there.
Today, Serbs make up more than 70 per cent of the population.
The determination of the Serbs to hold onto the Baranja also accounts for Mr
Zivanovic's insistence that it is 'ridiculous' to expect the Serbs to give
up all their weapons under the UN peace plan for Croatia. 'We fear an attack
from Croatia. Croatia has already expelled many Serbs from that republic.
Serbs who remain there have no rights whatsoever,' he said.
To compound matters, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is demanding that, on
September 30, the UN start allowing Croat refugees back to the Baranja. 'The
conditions for their return, which include their safety, do not yet exist,'
said Ms Blandina Francis Negga, the UN's civilian affairs co-ordinator in
sector east.
Another UN official said Mr Tudjman would try to send back 'refugees' who
were 6ft 6in tall, young, fit, and well-trained. 'We would have a war on our
hands,' he said. 'We are in a no-win situation. If we do not allow the Croat
refugees back to the Baranja, we will be accused of exacerbating the refugee
crisis in Croatia and facilitating ethnic cleansing of the Baranja.'
Another senior UN military official added: 'We are hated by the Croats
because they accuse us of consolidating Serbian gains in Croatia. We are
hated by the Serbs because they accuse us of preventing them from setting up
their own state in the Baranja.' The UN's mandate does not permit state
structures being established in sector east. 'What we can do is report cases
of intimidation against the ethnic communities to the local authorities,'
said Ms Negga.
UN officials say that killings, aimed at forcing out the non-Serb population
are frequent, with between 10 and 15 incidents taking place each day. Since
they arrived last April, they know of 40 ethnic murders, and 400 terrorist
acts against the non-Serb population.
'We have documented proof, including identification by victims, that members
of the (Serb) regional police forces have taken part in terrorist acts,' a
UN military official said. Mr Zivanovic said he had heard about some of
these cases, but denied any complicity by the regional police. Colonel
Dragan Novakovic, chief of Baranja's regional police, also denied any
involvement by the police in terrorism, or any organised policy of
intimidation of non-Serbs.
But Croat and Hungarian homes in the Baranja are easily identifiable (they
have a white cloth or a red mark put on their houses by the authorities).
Many live in fear. 'My friend was butchered last week,' said a 65-year-old
Croat peasant woman. 'They killed two of my friends in front of my house.'
The UN know about this, and other cases. 'Can we place a patrol outside
every Croat and Hungarian house?' asked a UN military official. 'We have not
got the resources.'
He turned to the problems of neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'Can you
imagine the UN trying to set up protected areas there given our problems
here? The Baranja is just a tiny, tiny, microcosm of Bosnia. This is a
step-by-step process of restoring stability here, where the desire for
revenge runs deep. It will take years before Serbs and Croats can live
together again.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Spanish stocks falter on economic
worries - But 1993 prospects may improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No-one could have scripted a more nerve-wracking scenario than the one
facing Madrid's unhappy stockbrokers next week.
For more than a year now, with the general index languishing mostly in the
mid to low 200s, brokers have been desperately trying to convince clients
that the market is cheap and that a major rebound is just around the corner.
It has never come.
Earlier this year the markets were stunned again by very bad inflation
figures but the government seemed to have grasped the nettle in March when
it published a rigorous plan to contain public spending and converge the
economy with those of leading European Community member states.
A few weeks later, however, data began to show a massive overshoot on public
spending and the current account deficit, making it clear that spending
targets contained in the convergence plan could not possibly be met this
year.
In June the Danes voted against the Maastricht treaty and foreign investors,
the mainstay of the equity markets, began to desert in droves. The
government, determined to try and keep the convergence plan on target, then
sideswiped the market again, just before the August holiday, by announcing a
tough fiscal package which included raising VAT and income tax, raising the
amount retained on incomes, and a slew of cuts on 1992 ministerial budgets
not already committed.
Interest rates rose from 12.4 per cent to 13 per cent, but it was about then
that the scale of French resistance to the Maastricht treaty began to become
apparent; the peseta came under pressure.
In a fair world, the 5 per cent devaluation of the currency forced on the
Spaniards this week should have been the last straw. But no. Tomorrow the
French vote on the Maastricht referendum and in the next few weeks Mr Carlos
Solchaga, the finance minister, will inflict probably the meanest budget in
10 years of government by the Socialist Party.
The market simply did not know what to do with the devaluation, so long
resisted by the government and so often demanded by industry. On Thursday
the index moved hardly at all, to close marginally down at 210.98.
Yesterday, while the government was working hard not to raise interest rates
and insisting that devaluation would put less than than half a percentage
point on inflation, the index gained 3.99 to 214.93 on renewed hopes for a
Yes vote in France. The market has risen 4 per cent on the week.
What might the market do on Monday? In the worst case, and as far as the
Spanish are concerned that means a No vote, brokers are preparing themselves
for a fall. But even if the vote is a Yes, there is no guarantee that the
market will behave any differently from the way it was behaving before the
French referendum became an issue.
Partly, this is because the scale of this year's deficits. Also, doubts
about interest rate cuts have forced long bond yields upwards, close to
short term yields; and the Treasury is to finance the bulk of the Dollars
17bn requirement for the rest of the year in short term paper, thus draining
more liquidity from equities.
Secondly, short-term interest rate uncertainty could hurt the rate sensitive
but popular utility stocks. And the prospect of a tough budget (with public
spending rising, possibly, no more than 5 per cent, down from the 8 per cent
being suggested before the devaluation) will hurt already damaged
construction and cement stocks.
But if the peseta survives a No vote, and the government sticks to its
budget 1993 is actually looking quite bright.
For a start, the rise in VAT planned for 1993 was brought forward to last
August. That, combined with the fact that the economy is slowing down so
quickly now, with 1992 growth estimates having fallen from around 3 per cent
to around 1.5 per cent, is more than likely to drive prices down and open
the way for interest rate cuts next year. Even yesterday, the peseta was
beginning to claw its way back, close to its new D-Mark parity of Pta68.42
after falling as low as Pta71.00
In the meantime, perfectly good stocks are still likely to be ignored.
Spain's profitable big banks, by any measure, are cheap, with average price
earnings ratios close to half of what they were in 1989. But the banks have
huge capital adequacy ratios, about 14 on average, and have already
provisioned about 4 per cent of their total loans.
Construction stocks, the other favourite with foreign and local investors,
will probably have to wait longer for a fulsome recovery as public spending
limits are going to cut deep in spite of Madrid's commitment to continue
infrastructural spending.
Industrials are also likely to struggle to take advantage of devaluation,
even although Spanish exports should be boosted by its effect. Industrial
exports are low anyway, and with economic slowdown in the EC, Spain's
biggest market, 5 per cent may not be enough to overcome the fact that very
few companies  - Tudor, the battery maker, and the Campofrio processed meats
group among others  - have well developed export networks.

Wall Street
US EQUITIES withstood the first round of yesterday's 'triple witching' with
equanimity, although prices moved broadly higher as the last round of
afternoon expirations kicked-in, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.35 higher at 3,327.05, in
reasonably heavy volume of nearly 238m shares, with advancing issues leading
those declining by 1,118 to 634. Among other market indices, the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 was quoted 2.99 higher at 422.92, while the Nasdaq composite rose
1.30 to 589.12.
On Thursday the Dow closed 3.51 lower at 3,315.70.
The quarterly 'triple witching', when stock-index futures, stock-index
options and options on individual stocks all expire, is usually marked by
volatility. Yesterday's session was notable for its comparative calm.
In the bond market, trading was light as investors awaited the outcome of
the French referendum on Maastricht tomorrow. In late trading, the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up  5/32 at 99 1/8 , yielding 7.317
per cent, after losing ground in morning trading. Shorter-dated maturities
moved in a narrower range, ending the day slightly higher.
Blue chip stocks dominated big board trading through the day, with Chrysler
climbing Dollars 2 to a year-high of Dollars 23 3/8 , Merck gaining Dollars
 1/2 to Dollars 47 3/8 , Coca Cola adding Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 45 and
International Business Machines off Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 83 1/2 .
Boeing edged Dollars  7/8 lower to Dollars 34 1/2 , a 52-week low, after
PaineWebber cut its rating on the stock and reduced earnings predictions for
the company, reflecting a weak market for jet aircraft.
Boeing shares lost ground on Thursday on news of the company's agreement
with PGA Group to defer delivery of aircraft worth Dollars 5bn for up to
three years. Both companies said yesterday that the value of GPA's
commitment to Boeing had not changed.
Shares in McDonnell Douglas, another big US aviation company, lost Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 .
In the insurance sector, shares in USF&amp;G added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10
3/4 in spite of news that the company expects its losses from Hurricane
Andrew to be about Dollars 45m after taxes and reinsurance, compared with
earlier estimates of about Dollars 40m. Shares in Aetna, which has a large
exposure to Hurricane Andrew, rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 39.
Photographic equipment maker Eastman Kodak rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44
3/8 . The company said that its chief financial officer would retire on
February 1.
In Nasdaq trading, Borland International tumbled Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 41
7/8 in hectic business after Goldman Sachs cut its second-quarter earnings
estimates for the company to 20 cents a share from 25 cents, and reduced its
fiscal 1993 projections by 20 cents to Dollars 1.45.
Other active Nasdaq stocks included Microsoft, down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
79 7/8 and Intel, up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 65 1/4 .
Food Lion, which reported third-quarter net earnings of 10 cents a share,
against 11 cents a year earlier, fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 9 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO ended little changed in active trading. The TSE 300 index fell 1.10
points to 3,444.95 in volume of 30.9m shares valued at CDollars 326m.
Advances led declines 275 to 269. On the week, the index was up about 4
points.
Industrial products, gold and consumer products rose moderately while mining
fell and banking and energy were flat.

FT  19 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euphoric response to Italian
budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEGREE of euphoria in Italy was one of the main features yesterday, as
bourses waited for the result of the French Maastricht referendum on Sunday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN welcomed the L93,000bn of deficit-cutting measures presented in Rome
late on Thursday. The Comit index rose another 8.36 to 375.51, up 2.3 per
cent on the day, and by the same figure on a week which saw drops of 3.3,
1.6 and 4.9 per cent on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Most leading blue chips rose, with Montedison up 6.7 per cent following the
merger of its polypropylene operations with Royal Dutch/Shell. Mr John
Stewart of Pastorino &amp; Partners said that the deal put together Montedison's
technical expertise with Shell's raw materials, that the high debt of
Montedison's Hiomont subsidiary might be subsumed in this venture and that
the deal could have a significant effect on Montedison earnings in 1993.
Pastorino were worried, however, by the budget's provision to tax corporate
net assets by 0.75 per cent per annum, pointing out that this could cost
Fiat, for example, 10 per cent of 1991's L1,114bn earnings.
FRANKFURT extended current share price themes as the DAX index rose 10.66 to
1,589.33, up 4 per cent on the week but well below its intraday high of
1,598.23.
Traders said that futures-related buying from the Deutsche Terminbourse
(DTB) had pushed prices higher, but that selling pressure from abroad more
than negated that.
The expiry of index and futures contracts pushed turnover up from DM5.9bn to
DM9.7bn. Banks and insurance shares continued to outpace the market, lifted
by interest rate cuts, the prospect of them and the rise in bond values
reflected in a fall in the average bond yield from 8.21 to 7.76 per cent
this week.
In carmakers, conditions continued to favour BMW, up DM7 to DM551.50,
against Volkswagen which rose only 30 pfg to DM321.10 in a week marred by
the currency threat to VW's overseas profit margins, and what economic
austerity might to to its sales in the home market.
Constructions rose on hopes of lower interest rates, Bilfinger &amp; Berger by
DM,40 to DM900, and Holzmann by DM33 marks to DM925.
PARIS, quietly confident of a Yes vote in tomorrow's Maastricht referendum,
closed at its highest level since the beginning of July. Assuming a positive
result, a cut in interest rates is anticipated, and has been reflected this
week in the rise of financial and bank stocks. The CAC-40 index closed 30.20
up at 1,882.94, 4.5 per cent better on the week. Turnover swelled to FFr4bn.
Peugeot went against the market after some analysts downgraded the stock
following a meeting with the company in Paris yesterday. It was reported
that Peugeot sales will suffer in the depressed European car market and
lower full year profits are forecast. The shares dipped FFr39, or 6 per cent
to FFr595.
Axa was another loser, down FFr28 or 3 per cent at FFr800 although it denied
rumours that talks were being held with Aegon of the Netherlands on a
possible merger.
AMSTERDAM had a good day in spite of a profits downgrade by Philips, which
saw its shares lose Fl 1.80 to Fl 22.80. The CBS Tendency index put on 1.0
to 113.6, a 4 per cent advance over the week. BRUSSELS eased in late trading
as the Bel-20 index slipped 1.32 to 1,130.24, up 4.7 per cent on the week.
Turnover was BFr1.2bn. Delhaize retreated just before the close as its US
division forecast disappointing third quarter earnings. Its shares fell
BFr70 or 4.1 per cent to BFr1,640.
STOCKHOLM rallied on hopes that talks between the government and opposition
parties would lead to a package of measures to reduce the budget deficit.
The Affarsvarlden general index closed 23.4 higher at 758.7, up 5.3 per cent
on the week.
While most sectors performed well, one of the day's losers was Skanska, the
construction group, which said that it faced increased financing costs of
SKr100m a day because of the 500 per cent marginal lending rate. Its free
shares slipped SKr7, or 12.5 per cent to SKr49.
OSLO's advance was assisted by the stronger dollar and the composite index
gained 11.97 to 336.15, a 7.2 per cent rise on the week. The industry index
put on 20.97 to 594.30. Among the day's active issues Kvaerner free shares
gained NKr11 to NKr146 on news that it was to take over an east German
shipyard.
VIENNA, which has been outperforming many European bourses in recent days,
closed the week in positive mood. The ATX index gained 29.69 to 835.70, up
12 per cent on the week. Austrian Airlines was actively traded, advancing
Sch110 or 5.8 per cent to Sch2,010.

political support

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE equities closed marginally higher on late afternoon index-linked
buying after Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said that the
government would, if necessary, take additional fiscal measures to support
the economy, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 50.28 at 18,166.80, barely changed on the week,
recording a day's low of 17,758.13 and a high of 18,273.58. Profit-taking
pushed the index lower during most of the session. However, late afternoon
buying by arbitrageurs and investment trusts buoyed the market in the final
hour.
Volume rose slightly to 330m shares from 283m. Analysts pointed out that
dull volume represented possible near term sluggishness in share prices.
Declines outnumbered advances by 527 to 399, with 203 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.58 to 1,354.05 and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.23 to 1,085.70.
While some traders blamed volatile currency markets for the quiet trading
others remarked that the effect of European currency movements on Japanese
financial markets seemed to be minimal.
Activity centered on short-term trading of speculative issues. Mining and
metal issues which rose on Thursday on reports of a gold mine discovery in
southern Japan were traded actively. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most
active issue of the day, advanced Y17 to Y470. However, Sumitomo Metal
Mining fell Y34 to Y748 on profit taking.
Securities houses saw downward earnings revisions, and there was a modicum
of downward movement although analysts said that the weak business prospects
had already been discounted. Nikko Securities fell Y8 to Y725 and Yamaichi
Securities Y25 to Y635, but Nomura Securities, the largest broker, remained
unchanged at Y1,630.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 110.26 to 19,391.15 in volume of 20.3m
shares.
Roundup
A SELECTION of domestic and international concerns exercised the region
yesterday.
AUSTRALIA put News Corp and BHP ahead of currency worries as the All
Ordinaries index closed 11.8 higher at 1,523.6, 1.5 per cent up on the week
in turnover of ADollars 163.4m.
News Corp's presentation to analysts in Sydney, taking in a forecast of 20
per cent rearnings growth in 1993/94, pushed the shares up by 96 cents to
ADollars 24.36, while BHP rose 20 cents to ADollars 12.20 after good first
quarter results.
HONG KONG strengthened in moderate trade, reflecting gains in local stocks
in London overnight and encouraged, too, by progress in Sino-British talks
over the financing of Hong Kong's new airport. The Hang Seng index rose
51.42 to 5,689.32, 2.7 per cent higher on the week in turnover down from
HKDollars 1.94bn to HKDollars 1.82bn.
HSBC again topped the active list and closed HKDollars 1 higher at HKDollars
54.50, followed by Wharf Holdings which leapt 70 cents to HKDollars 16.30.
TAIWAN plunged at the opening after Thursday's 6.1 per cent drop, but
finished mixed on institutionally-led, blue chip buying. The weighted index,
down more than 120 points in early trade, ended 4.09 lower at a 20-month low
of 3,437.60, 9.2 per cent down on the week. Turnover was a thin TDollars
16.6 billion.
BANGKOK's finance, securities, property and bank shares rose on
post-election bullishness, pushing the SET index to a new 1992 high, in the
most active trade in the 17-year history of the market.
The index jumped 11.19, or 1.4 per cent to 835.45, 4.2 per cent higher on
the week, in turnover of Bt16.67bn. Eight finance and securities issues were
among the 10 most highly traded stocks, and several in this group reached
new highs for the year.
BOMBAY took a breather, the BSE index rising just 5.44 to 3,383.62, up 5.1
per cent on the week.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Paisley boycotts talks in Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REV Ian Paisley and his Democratic Unionist party said last night they
would not travel to Dublin on Monday for talks with the Irish government.
Mr Paisley returned to the talks on Northern Ireland's political future in
Belfast yesterday after a week-long boycott. He made clear, however, that he
would not follow the pre-agreed process and cross the border next week.
Yesterday's discussions were about the Irish government's territorial claim
over Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley withdrew from the talks last week because
he felt the constitutional claim was not high enough on the agenda.
The Ulster Unionist party will attend the Dublin meeting but it is unclear
if Mr James Molyneaux, the party leader, will be in the delegation.
The party's decision to go to Dublin has caused a rift between the two
unionist parties. The Rev William McCrea, the Democratic Unionist MP for
Mid-Ulster, yesterday insisted that all unionists should withdraw from
Monday's meeting.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Manx plan to compensate depositors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man government is to introduce a Pounds 4.45m ex gratia
compensation scheme for depositors in the Savings and Investment Bank, which
collapsed 10 years ago with Pounds 42m of depositors' funds.
Mr Miles Walker, the island's chief minister, said yesterday the scheme
would be put before Tynwald, the Manx parliament, next month if
administrative arrangements could be agreed in time with the bank's
liquidators. Payments  - to a maximum of Pounds 5,000  - would be made to
nearly 2,000 depositors early next year.
The move was attacked by Miss Gwendoline Lamb, who had Pounds 30,000 in the
bank, as 'morally shameful'. She said the trial judge who in 1990 dismissed
fraud charges against eight bank shareholders, officials or agents because
of delays in bringing them, had suggested that Pounds 10m saved in court
costs should be used to compensate depositors.
Mr Walker said the ex gratia payments would give them the same as they would
have had under the UK's depositor protection scheme of 10 years ago. The
Isle of Man, a self-governing Crown dependency, had no scheme at the time.
Government attempts to make ex gratia payments in 1990 were thwarted when Mr
David Cannan, who had been dismissed as finance minister after political
differences with Mr Walker, persuaded Tynwald to wait until publication of
the official report on the bank crash by Mr John Chadwick QC, an English
barrister appointed by the Manx High Court.
The move was designed to force disclosure of the report, which is severely
critical of the 1982 Manx government, but publication had to wait until
associated trials in England were over last month. The report will come out
on Tuesday. Much of its criticism of government officials is already known
because of court proceedings and a parallel report on supervisory standards
by the Bank of England, published in 1990.
Those facts were not, however, available when depositors pursued a claim
against the government to the Privy Council  - the island's ultimate court
of appeal  - in 1989. The Privy Council ruled that the government had no
duty of care to depositors, and the action failed.
Mr Cannan said yesterday: 'Once the Chadwick report is out, it will be up to
depositors to consider whether they should return to the Privy Council and
ask for another hearing on the grounds of new evidence, which they may well
feel the report provides.'
The crucial element of the report is likely to be that the Savings and
Investment Bank was insolvent on several occasions during the last 16 months
of its life, but that the island's Treasury allowed it to carry on trading.
Attempts to bring the SIB's principals to trial and disclose the background
to the collapse started only after a new Manx government, under Mr Walker,
took office in 1987. Manx supervision has since been tightened and is now
regarded as among the toughest.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Council offers deal for pay freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOCAL authority is offering its town hall staff of nearly 1,400 a
guarantee against compulsory redundancies if they accept a pay freeze next
year.
Walsall Council is believed to be the first authority to have made such an
offer. The move is surprising because Walsall is not one of the few local
authorities to have opted out of the national bargaining machinery.
Local-authority analysts said such moves by councils might become more
frequent as the predicted tight public-sector pay round next financial year
curbs budgets.
About 500 members of the Nalgo public-sector union have rejected the offer.
Nupe, another public-sector union, and the GMB and TGWU general unions have
yet to respond.
Nalgo said: 'We are still at the very early stage of the budget-making
process. We cannot be certain the guarantee could be delivered.' If members
gave up next year's increase, they would be outside national pay bargaining
machinery and would find it difficult to catch up with staff at other local
authorities.
Mr Mike Bird, council leader, said: 'The council is facing financial
problems and needs to make cuts of about 20 per cent. We are offering
employees the chance to safeguard their jobs.' If the deal is accepted it
will save the council Pounds 3.5m of the Pounds 14m it needs to save.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Papers leak 'could have damaged BCCI probe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office's investigation into the collapsed Bank of Credit
and Commerce International could have been gravely damaged by the leaking of
confidential documents to a suspect's solicitor, an Old Bailey jury heard
yesterday.
Mr Chris Dickson, an SFO assistant director in overall charge of the BCCI
inquiry, told the court evidence might have been destroyed, witnesses
interfered with and the SFO's reputation with the US Justice Department and
the Bank of England damaged.
Mr Mark Braley, a former Coopers and Lybrand accountant seconded to the SFO
for the inquiry, and Mr Bernard Lynch, a freelance accountant, both deny
conspiring to pervert the course of justice.
The prosecution alleges the two men plotted to supply confidential
information from the inquiry to Mr Michael Barrett, a solicitor acting for
Mr Syed Akbar, the former head of BCCI's treasury division. Mr Barrett
notified police of the plan.
Mr Akbar, now living in France, is under arrest and the subject of
extradition proceedings in both the UK and the US.
Mr Dickson, a prosecution witness, said the documents would have disclosed
the extent of the SFO's knowledge and the lines of its inquiries.
'The fraud involving the treasury division alone was a massive fraud,' he
said.
Possible targets of the SFO inquiry might have destroyed evidence and left
the UK, he said.
Information-sharing with the US authorities could have been hampered and the
Bank of England may have been concerned about the SFO's ability to look
after sensitive documents.
Publication of the documents would also have hindered attempts to persuade
people in the Middle East to co-operate with the SFO, he said.
The trial continues.

FT  19 SEP 92 / BBC to cut 1,250 more support jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is to cut 1,250 jobs from its central bureaucracy in a move that it
said yesterday would save Pounds 150m over five years.
The latest job cuts follow an extensive review of all the BBC's support
functions and will come in areas ranging from printing and systems
development to market research and publicity.
It is the first time there have been such swingeing job losses among support
staff. Most of the 1,250 jobs will go over the next 18 months. The aim is to
reduce BBC overheads in advance of the full introduction of Producer Choice
next April.
Under Producer Choice, BBC programme makers will have the right to buy the
services they need from the outside market if it is more cost-effective.
The savings in support services are designed to ensure that internal
resources are competitive with the outside market.
After a review of BBC radio resources, 17 studios will be closed and 20
outside broadcast vehicles withdrawn.
Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, said yesterday: 'The two
reviews continue the clear policy of making the BBC more efficient, putting
more money directly into programmes and making more BBC programmes outside
the south-east of England.'
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the broadcasting union, said last night:
'We are shocked by the scale of this. Most of the people going are doing
real jobs  - these are not bureaucrats.'
The union said it would force the BBC to justify every single job to be
lost. Bectu added that it seemed to be a case of assistant heads rolling.
The BBC said yesterday it would be the last large tranche of job losses. The
future scale of employment in the corporation would be determined by how
successful staff were in competing with the market.
About Pounds 30m of the Pounds 150m in savings will be needed to meet a
shortfall that resulted from the 1991 licence-fee settlement, which was set
below inflation.
The cuts will bring job losses in BBC radio and television between 1986 and
the end of next year to 7,000. The total reduction has, however, been 6,000
because of 1,000 jobs created by new programme developments.
At present the BBC has a staff of about 23,000.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Unions seen to be still significant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN out of 10 British employers in companies with more than 200 employees
still negotiate with trade unions, according to the latest Cranfield Price
Waterhouse survey of European industrial relations.
The figure is surprisingly high, given the recent decline in union
membership and influence. British trade unions have lost 3.5m members since
1979 and the proportion of employees in unions has fallen to about 40 per
cent.
A preliminary report on the survey says the figure puts into perspective
'the much vaunted predictions of the terminal decline, or even death, of the
trade union movement (which) seem, to say the least, much exaggerated.'
The UK level of seven out of 10 larger employers  - covering both private
and public sectors  - recognising unions is average for the 12 European
countries covered by the survey.
In many of the organisations, though, unions represent a relatively small
proportion of staff, and in only four of the 12 countries  - Denmark, Spain,
Ireland and Portugal  - do more than half of the organisations report union
membership above 50 per cent.
The survey, which has been running for three years, is based on
questionnaires returned by about 5,500 of the 35,000 organisations
contacted.
A majority of the respondent organisations report no change in union
influence. The overall trend is a small reduction in influence, but some
countries, including Germany and Spain, report a marked increase.
Industrial relations remain relatively centralised, with policy decisions
being made at HQ level in more than 40 per cent of organisations in all
countries except France and the UK. A high degree of centralisation is
especially evident in southern European countries.

A ROYAL Air Force munitions depot at Chilmark, Wiltshire, is to be closed as
part of a reorganisation of the armed forces' facilities for storing and
maintaining armaments.
The measures are the last in a series of cuts in military support services,
and involve responsibility for many RAF weapons being transferred to the
other services.
The Chilmark site, which employs 250 civilians, is to close in 1995.
Officials said compulsory redundancies would be kept to a minimum.
The Ministry of Defence has also decided to begin a redundancy programme at
the naval depot of Trecwn, in south-west Wales.
A plan to bring forward the closure date from 1996 to 1995 was discarded,
but the MoD now plans phased redundancies among the 500 staff.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Major calls for ERM reform: PM backs Lamont in row with Kohl
 -Bank of France intervenes as franc falls

<TEXT>
THE WAR OF WORDS between Britain and Germany following the collapse of
sterling intensified yesterday as Mr John Major called for a reform of the
European exchange rate mechanism.
In his first interview since the pound was withdrawn from the ERM, Mr Major
implicitly backed Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, who had
earlier become embroiled in sharp exchanges with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany over who was responsible for this week's turmoil on the currency
markets.
The British prime minister argued there were structural 'fault-lines' within
the ERM that needed to be tackled.
In one remark clearly aimed at Germany, Mr Major said: 'We have to make sure
that monetary policy is run in the interests of all the countries of Europe
and not veered to the national interests of any individual country.'
Moreover, in words which will be interpreted as support for Mr Lamont in his
attack on Germany, he insisted the UK would not return to the ERM until it
was reformed and until Denmark clarified how it intended to proceed after
its No vote on the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary
union.
Asked how soon that might be, Mr Major replied: 'Clearly, it is not
imminent.' He said the chaos in the markets had stemmed from 'a good deal of
Europe' being caught between low dollar exchange rates and very high
interest rates in Germany. 'This is a problem far apart from the British
government. It is a problem which has stretched right across the European
Community - and outside it.'
Mr Major gave notice that the mechanics of the ERM would have to be
reviewed, possibly at a heads of government summit to follow Sunday's French
referendum on Maastricht.
Downing Street confirmed last night that such a meeting was being
considered. The prime minister's intervention came after an extraordinary
clash between Mr Lamont and Mr Kohl that looked set to sour still further
the already strained relations between Britain and Germany. Earlier in the
day, Mr Lamont had openly fuelled the tensions by placing the blame for the
week's events firmly at the Germans' door. 'We want to be satisfied that
German policy that has produced many of the tensions in the ERM is going to
have some changes that will lead to a more stable environment,' he said.
In Italy, Mr Kohl issued a swift public rebuke to Mr Lamont for making Bonn
the scapegoat, describing his comments as 'inappropriate for a minister'.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank deputy president, denounced UK criticism as
unfounded. 'I think there were certain comments, which were not exactly
characterised by 'fair-play',' he said.
'But when one is in a difficult position then such a reaction is sometimes
also understandable,' he added.
Mr Amato had shrugged off suggestions that Italy had bowed to the dictates
of Germany by referring to puppet shows watched by three- and
four-year-olds. 'There is always the good guy being beaten with a stick by
the bad one,' he said.
Mr Kohl said in relation to Britain's attitude to Germany: 'Similar
considerations apply.'
Both men reiterated their faith in the Maastricht treaty's vision of
economic and political union despite the week's turbulence which forced
Britain and Italy to float their currencies outside the ERM. Mr Kohl
endorsed Italy's call for a summit to reassess developments in the
Community.
It emerged that Italy might be having second thoughts about its ability to
comply with Thursday's commitment to rejoin the ERM next Tuesday.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Cabinet divided over speed of re-entry to system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES within the cabinet over the speed of Britain's return to the
European exchange rate mechanism emerged yesterday, raising the prospect of
a prolonged strug-gle within the Conservative party.
Early in the day, the Tories' so-called Euro-sceptic wing was jubilant at
remarks by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, suggesting that there were now
considerable obstacles to a rapid return to the exchange rate mechanism.
Speaking on BBC Radio's Today programme, Mr Lamont, one of the least
enthusiastic Europeans in the cabinet, made clear that in the interim he
would pursue a staunchly nationalistic policy.
'We are floating and we will set monetary policy in this country to meet our
objectives and it will be a British economic policy and a British monetary
policy,' he said.
But later, Mr Michael Heseltine, the strongly pro-European trade and
industry secretary, stressed that a long-term absence from the currency
system could have serious consequences for foreign investment.
'If it was perceived that we were going to be part of a slow stream Europe,
do you think all those Japanese companies would continue to invest here on
the scale that they are?' he asked an interviewer.
The contrast in tone came after both ministers agreed that the government's
prime aim continued to centre on squeezing inflation. Mr Lamont added,
however, that in the changed circumstances a secondary goal would be to help
create a revival in the economy.
Moreover, he gave notice that he would need to consider three factors before
a return to the ERM would be undertaken. These were developments in the
currency markets, changes in German economic policy that enhanced
international stability and an examination of co-operation between EC
governments.
Mr Lamont's remarks provoked a surge in the stockmarket where traders are
anticipating a further cut soon in interest rates. They also spurred
Euro-sceptic backbenchers to insist that the British government rule out
permanently any return to the ERM.
Mr Kenneth Baker, a former Tory party chairman, joined ERM critics by
insisting that the target of a single European currency by the end of the
century could now be ruled out. He argued that interest rates should come
down to 6 per cent.
Pro-European Tory MPs stepped up their efforts to counter the onslaught,
however. Mr Hugh Dykes, a federalist backbencher, argued that ERM membership
remained a key to 'the country's future prosperity'.

FT  19 SEP 92 / EC's fate may hinge on vote in French overseas territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CHILLING thought is sweeping through the foreign ministries of Europe as
the world waits for tomorrow's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
The future of European union may be decided not in the suburbs of Paris or
familiar Mediterranean departements but in a group of exotic territories
sprinkled around the Caribbean, South Pacific, the Indian Ocean and North
Atlantic.
With opinion polls still pointing to a perilously close race, the British
Foreign Office  - responsible because of the European Community presidency
for drawing up elaborate contingency plans for any outcome - fears that the
voters in France's overseas territories and domains could hold the key.
The so-called Domtoms  - departements d'outre mer and territoires d'outre
mer  - account for more than 1m voters, or 2.6 per cent of the 38m French
electorate, in places such as Martinique, Reunion, French Guiana and New
Caledonia.
If the French electorate is finely divided, votes from these far-flung
locations could be crucial. The trouble is no one quite knows what their
opinion is. The pollsters who busily questioned everyone and anyone in Lille
or Marseilles apparently did not get around to them.
Worse, the leisurely pace of the count in far-away places like the Indian
Ocean island of Mayotte (population 94,410 in 1991) and the islets of St
Pierre and Miquelon (6,392) off the coast of Newfoundland could severely
disrupt plans for orchestrated displays of relief or unity by EC
governments. While the outcome in mainland France will be known by tomorrow
evening, the Domtom returns will not be collated until Monday afternoon.
French government officials reckon that, if anything, the Domtom vote will
may slightly strengthen the Yes vote  - though for the most perverse
possible reasons.
The turnout will be very low because there is almost no interest in the EC.
In one or two places, independence parties have urged voters to send in
blank ballot slips to protest against French rule. But there have apparently
been few appeals for a No vote.
One official has concluded that the proportion of Domtom residents voting
Yes could be up to 10 percentage points above that in mainland France.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Europe's currencies face heavy selling pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the remaining currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism
came under intense selling pressure yesterday as investors grew anxious that
France would vote No in its referendum on the Maastricht treaty tomorrow.
For the second day running, the Bank of France intervened heavily on the
foreign exchange markets, buying francs for D-Marks, as its currency came
within one centime of its floor against the German currency in the ERM.
Investors also sold the Danish krone and the Irish punt in exchange for
D-Marks. The switch out of the punt pushed up the interest rate at which
commercial banks can lend to one another overnight in the Irish money market
to 300 per cent.
Sterling, which withdrew with the lira from the ERM this week, again came
under selling pressure after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, cast further
doubt over an immediate return to the system. However, dealers in the
sterling money market priced in an imminent half percentage point cut in UK
base rates.
The pound lost another 2.75 pfennigs in London yesterday, closing against
the German currency at DM2.6125. At this level, it is 12 per cent below its
former central ERM rate of DM2.95. In late New York trading it was at
DM2.605. Against the dollar it fell more than 4 cents in London to Dollars
1.74 and lost further ground in New York to Dollars 1.735.
However, sterling's suspension from the system continued to raise hopes in
equity markets that there would be a cut next week in the UK's bank base
rates, currently at 10 per cent. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares
closed up 83.1, at 2,567.0, after a 105-point rise on Thursday. The gains
took the index, up 196 points this week, to its highest level for three
months.
Rates in the sterling cash market also priced in a cut in UK base rates.
Three-month money, an important indicator of what the market thinks the next
move in base rates will be, closed at 9 5/8 per cent on the offered side
from 15 per cent the night before.
The French franc was supported by several factors apart from the Bank of
France's intervention, including the temporary suspension by the French
central bank of one of its key lending facilities to commercial banks.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy president, helped the French
currency by saying: 'The franc is in no way at risk. The franc is a very
strong currency which has achieved inherent stability.' The franc closed in
London at FFr3.4230 to the D-Mark, 0.75 centimes above its ERM floor against
the German currency, and in late New York trading was quoted at FFr3.4210.
In Belgium the central bank governor, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, said the Belgian
franc would move to a slightly wider divergence against the D-Mark.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Punt protected by exchange
controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE REMNANTS of foreign exchange controls in Ireland saved the the Irish
pound (punt) from further pressure yesterday, burning the fingers of
speculators who had forced the punt to the floor of the narrow band of the
exchange rate mechanism on Thursday.
The punt was yesterday trading around DM2.64, comfortably above its floor
rate of DM2.619, as buyers came back into the market, many seeking to cover
short positions they had taken out as sellers the day before.
Mr Chris Johns, the head of research in the Bank of Ireland, said: 'The
market for the punt is not a deep and liquid one, as it is for sterling. It
is very difficult for a speculator who is short of Irish pounds to get ready
access to them.'
Exchange controls have been progressively lifted in Ireland since 1988 but
there are still a few restrictions, which are due to be phased out by the
end of this year. They limit the freedom of banks in Ireland in lending
Irish currency abroad, especially for short-term speculative purposes.
Speculators who took a short position on Thursday  - who contracted to sell
punts, expecting to borrow them to cover the contract and to buy back into
the currency at a lower price later  - found by Friday morning that there
were very limited funds available to borrow.
Overnight money market lending rates for the punt shot up to more than 300
per cent in London and other European financial centres yesterday. A trader
in Jersey said: 'Overnight rates for the punt have gone crazy. We are not
even quoting it.'
Rumours of some quotes exceeding 10,000 per cent for overnight funds were
widespread, although it is not thought deals were struck.
There was no need for central bank intervention to support the punt
yesterday.
In confident mood, Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, said the
recovery of the punt 'demonstrates the confidence the markets have in the
strong currency position of the Irish pound within the narrow band of the
ERM'. He added: 'Our trade performance is an indicator of the underlying
competitive strength of our economy. Our trade surplus was IPounds 1.76bn in
the first six months of 1992 and is expected to be about IPounds 2.7bn for
the year as a whole, over 10 per cent of GNP. This far exceeds the expected
surpluses of countries such as Japan and contrasts favourably with the
negative balance expected for the EC.'
Figures published on Thursday show that Irish inflation has fallen to 2.8
per cent for the year to the end of August. Earlier this year, the
government projected a 3.75 per cent inflation rate for 1992.
Overnight interest rates are quoted on an annualised basis. A trader at
Barclays said a quoted rate of 250 per cent was equivalent to 1.5 per cent
payable in interest after 24 hours.

THE economy continues to be stuck in recession, according to the latest

per cent in the year to the end of August, the same figure as for the 12
months to July 31. M4, a broader measure, which also takes in bank and
building society deposits, rose 5.5 per cent in the year to August 30, after
5.7 per cent in the year to the end of the previous month.
The seasonally adjusted figures indicate little upturn from the economic
decline that began about two years ago.
Lending in sterling by banks and building societies to the private sector
rose Pounds 2.3bn last month, less than the figure of about Pounds 2.9bn
expected in the City.
The picture of a flat economy fitted in with figures from the British
Bankers Association, which said the big commercial banks lent a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 700m last month, the smallest figure for five months.
A breakdown which is not seasonally adjusted shows that loans to
individuals, mainly for mortgages, rose in the month by Pounds 1bn.
That, however, was more than offset by repayments by companies, particularly
manufacturers. Overall, individuals and companies repaid a net Pounds 211m
to big banks, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis.
Much of the extra lending to people was linked to the extra demand for
mortgages caused by the stamp duty holiday that ended on August 19.
The association said: 'In the continued absence of company borrowing, the
recent recovery in (seasonally adjusted) bank lending is likely to come to
an end.'

A DELAY in the start of a transatlantic balloon race increased its cost by
Dollars 10,000 because of the sterling crisis, Mr Alan Noble, the race
director, said.
Five teams took off from Maine in the US on Wednesday after he used his

As the balloonists floated over the Atlantic, sterling fell and Mr Noble

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Forecasts span triumph and
disaster - Industry and investors optimistic - Jaguar seeks cut in interest
rates / CBI reports expectations on prices 'subdued'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS

<TEXT>
ECONOMIC forecasters have taken a beating in the past two years. But, set
against the appalling record of the Treasury model, the credibility of the
City pundits does not look so bad.
The FT asked three leading City forecasters to outline the possible economic
consequences of alternative routes that the government might be tempted to
take. The results, as with any forecast, should be interpreted with care.
The two alternative courses, which Treasury ministers and civil servants
will probably be pondering this weekend, are:
Stay on course. Sterling rejoins the exchange rate mechanism after the
French referendum at a new central rate of DM2.65. That means the pound has
been devalued by 10 per cent, but interest rates remain at 10 per cent and
fall only in line with the forecasters' expectations for German interest
rates. Go for growth. The government does not rejoin the ERM but instead
cuts base rates to 7 per cent in the last quarter of this year. Sterling
falls to DM2.40, a devaluation of 19 per cent, and then hovers around that
level over the next two years. Two of our forecasters assume that interest
rates remain at 7 per cent, but Mr Keith Skeoch found the scenario too
unbelievable and forecast a rise in base rates back to 9.7 per cent next
year and 12.7 per cent in 1994.
The three pundits, as is natural, disagree more than they agree about the
consequences of the two approaches.
First the common ground. In each case, lower interest rates means higher
growth next year, with manufacturing benefiting more than the whole economy
because of the larger sterling devaluation. But the cost of the strategy is
higher inflation in 1994 than in 1993.
There the similarities end.
Inflation explodes outside the ERM in the economic models of Mr Kevin
Gardiner and Mr Skeoch. Higher imports mean that the devaluation makes
little difference to the current-account deficit in Mr Gardiner's model. But
under Mr Skeoch's assumptions, inflation and the current account rise so
much that the government is forced to raise interest rates to protect the
pound.
Mr Bill Martin, long an opponent of ERM membership, is much less worried
about the inflationary threat from the devaluation.
Depressed consumer and business sentiment mean only a modest recovery in GDP
growth under either strategy in 1993. The larger devaluation delivers a
lower current-account deficit but also marginally lower inflation in 1993.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Industrialists dream of 80s
boom re-run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE extraordinary upheaval in the UK government's economic policy has left
British industrialists more pleased than they care to admit.
A week ago, they were broadly united in their public support for the
principles of strong sterling and tight money. Never mind the damage to
their profits and balance sheets: the principle of defeating inflation had
to be upheld.
They have now been suddenly presented with the traditional British answer to
their problems: a devalued currency. It is likely they have difficulty
containing their relief, whatever they say in public.
Investors agree, judging by the surge in the stock market since devaluation
was announced. The hope is that UK industry might enjoy a re-run of what
happened a decade ago, when a period of excessive monetary discipline in the
early years of the first Thatcher administration was followed by devaluation
and plummeting interest rates.
It is worth recalling a few statistics. In early 1981, base rates stood at
17 per cent and sterling stood at Dollars 2.44 and DM5.06. Within two years,
sterling fell by 40 per cent against the dollar and 30 per cent against the
D-Mark. Base rates fell to 10.5 per cent. Industry's profits doubled and
dividends rose by 60 per cent. The 1980s boom was under way.
How far those conditions can be reproduced is debatable. In the early 1980s,
many of the UK's most important trading partners were coming out of
recession rather than slipping deeper into it. The UK's budget deficit was
under control and the trade balance was in surplus. Perhaps most important,
British industry was emerging from a traumatic but ultimately beneficial
period of de-manning and rationalisation.
Nevertheless, there is room for optimism. Mr Richard Freeman, chief
economist at Imperial Chemical Industries, says: 'There will be a surge in
corporate profitability, especially for exporters. Companies will use that
to rebuild their balance sheets. I wouldn't entirely agree that companies
are working from a more efficient base this time round. There is still quite
a lot of scope for improved productivity, which is why I expect unemployment
to keep rising for quite some time.'
Mr Sushil Wadhwani, an economist with the merchant bank Goldman Sachs,
agrees: 'There is still scope for cost-cutting. Months ago, we were asking
our analysts why their earnings forecasts were so high. They told us it was
because companies had all been telling them about the efficiency
improvements they can still make.'
Mr Sudhir Janankar, deputy director of economic affairs with the
Confederation of British Industry, says: 'Companies have been taking some
pretty tough decisions. Corporate profits have been falling much more slowly
in the past six months than in the year before. Companies have applied the
lessons they learnt in the early 1980s and have been quicker to react to
difficult conditions.'
A more optimistic assessment again comes from Ms Ann Robinson, head of
policy at the Institute of Directors: 'Industry's position is far better
than 10 years ago. We hadn't had the supply-side revolution then, business
wasn't so well invested and we hadn't had the privatisations.
'Since then, the UK industrial base may have been eroded, but what is left
is very good. There are companies now that are world beaters and their
profits might rise considerably,' Ms Robinson said:'An excellent example is
British Airways, compared with Lufthansa. And British Steel. 'There are a
lot of problems with the service sectors, such as the banks. But banks in
Britain are still a lot more efficient than they are in Germany or Italy.'
No one really expects a bounce in profits like that of a decade ago. 'It's
almost inconceivable,' Mr Wadhwani says.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Rate plea as 120 Jaguar jobs go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 120 jobs are to be cut by Jaguar, Ford's luxury car division, on
top of 700 announced last month.
The intended cuts were disclosed yesterday by Mr Nick Scheele, Jaguar's
chairman and chief executive, who also called for further interest rate
reductions to stimulate the UK economy.
Mr Scheele said:'The current rate is still too high.' He forecast that
Jaguar's total sales this year would be unchanged at about 25,000 units.
Sales in the first half of this year declined further from year-ago levels,
to 11,900 from 12,900, but Mr Scheele said he expected a minor
strengthening, partly due to sterling's effective devaluation.
Only Jaguar's salaried staff will be affected by the latest cuts. They will
bring Jaguar's total employment down to just over 7,100, compared with
12,100 in 1990 and slightly more than 8,000 at the end of last year.
Last month's reductions mainly affected production workers, as Jaguar
trimmed output plans to make only 23,000 cars this year, compared with an
earlier forecast for the year of 27,000.
The new figure is less than half the output level of the late 1980s.
Renault Truck Industries, the French vehicle group's loss-making UK
commercial vehicles subsidiary, announced that it was cutting 35 of the
remaining 517 jobs at its manufacturing plant in Dunstable, Bedfordshire.
The company blamed the severely depressed state of the UK truck market for
the job losses, most of which are expected to be compulsory.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: The rising threat to return to
growth - Emma Tucker explains why the jobless present an obstacle to an
economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUSTAINED recovery in growth as a result of Britain's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism might be severely hampered by the growing
pool of unemployed left in the wake of the government's tight monetary
policy.
Figures this week showed that unemployment in the UK has grown to 2.8m, its
highest level for five years, and most economists expect it to carry on
rising next year even if interest rates creep downwards.
The Treasury's economic model suggests that a 10 per cent devaluation of the
pound, with no change in interest rates, would reduce unemployment by
204,000 over two years. Economists are sceptical.
Ms Ruth Lea, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank, said: 'The immediate outlook
for unemployment is not very good. It tends to be a lagging indicator anyway
and I don't expect to see a rapid turnaround.'
The extent of damage already inflicted on the jobs market in the UK was
highlighted this week in a survey carried out by the Department of
Employment in the spring.
The Labour Force Survey, quarterly results of which were published for the
first time this week, gives a more comprehensive measure of economic
activity than the monthly figures published by the department, which simply
record the number of people claiming benefit.
The latest LFS involved more than 60,000 households across Britain, and
covered about 150,000 people. In addition to the so-called 'claimant count'
unemployment measure, the LFS covers many groups that do not qualify for
benefits, such as women returning to the labour market after raising a
family, the self-employed and young people aged 16 and 17 who do not have
places on Youth Training schemes and are actively seeking work.
The survey throws light on those sectors of the economy which have suffered
the most damaging losses in the past year.
Contrary to the impression that this recession has been concentrated in the
service sector, it shows that every sector of the economy has recorded a
bigger percentage fall in employment than the services sector.
The numbers of people employed in services was only 0.9 per cent lower in
spring this year than in spring last year. That compares with a 9.2 per cent
fall in construction and a 9 per cent fall in energy and water supply.
Employment in manufacturing fell 5 per cent. The biggest fall was in
agriculture, forestry and fishing, where the number employed fell 10.5 per
cent.
Furthermore, a breakdown of how different occupations have weathered the
recession shows that while non-service sector occupations have suffered
damaging losses, the number employed as managers and administrators has
risen since last year, as has employment in professional occupations such as
solicitors, businessmen and doctors.
The number of craft workers either self-employed or working as employees
fell 10.6 per cent, the sharpest fall out of nine groups of occupations. The
numbers working as plant and machine operators fell more than 8 per cent.
The only other group of occupations where employment rose was in personal
and protective services, which covers the armed forces, catering, nursing
and childcare.
This pattern of unemployment - among unskilled workers and often in
manufacturing industry - is very similar to that created in the last
recession. Unemployment rates are much higher for men than for women and
among unskilled and poorly educated workers.
In the 1980s, when the rate of unemployment reached 11 per cent, the jobless
total continued to rise until 1986, more than four years after the economy
emerged from recession.
The debilitating effects of long-term unemployment on the skills and
motivation of those workers meant that unemployment stayed high even after
the recovery gained
pace.
Furthermore, the shortage encouraged skilled workers to force up their wage
demands with an inflationary effect on the economy.
Whether unemployment starts to fall in two years or four years, the high
levels of skill shortages created by prolonged unemployment may well hinder
the recovery once more.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, the Japanese bank,
said: 'We have invested too little in capacity and too little in people.
Skills shortages are going to be a problem that constrains growth for some
time.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Order books still down, CBI
says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH manufacturers' order books remain well below normal and expectations
of price rises are more subdued than at any time since 1959, the
Confederation of British Industry said yesterday.
In its latest survey of industrial trends, carried out shortly before the
recent turbulence on the financial markets, three out of five companies
questioned said their total order books were below normal.
Manufacturers, surveyed between the end of August and mid September, said
they expected output to continue falling during the next four months. Those
expectations are likely to have changed since Britain's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism heralded the prospect of lower interest
rates.
Export order books are broadly steady, but 44 per cent of companies said
they were too low and only 11 per cent said they were above normal. Demand
for exports showed no improvement, but was not as weak as in July.
According to the CBI, manufacturers' hopes of increasing prices were at
their weakest for 33 years. Only 8 per cent of the 1,439 businesses in 50
industries said they expected to raise average prices for domestic orders in
the next four months. Stocks of finished goods have risen to levels that are
thought to be too high in relation to expected demand.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry spokesman, said: 'What businesses
now need to hear is a government willing to say that it will take all
measures necessary to get the economy on the road to real recovery.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Maastricht lifts lid on French fears
 -Yes and No votes in tomorrow's referendum are only a guillotine blade's
breadth apart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS evening, 3 1/2 months of campaigning grinds to a halt as 38m Frenchmen
and women ponder whether and how to vote in tomorrow's referendum on the
Maastricht treaty, and Europe's politicians and the world's money dealers
hold their breath for the first results shortly after 8pm French time.
The stakes remain virtually as high as on June 3, when President Francois
Mitterrand called the referendum in France, in reaction to the treaty's
defeat in Denmark the day before.
French rejection will seal the doom of the treaty, though some claim that
this week's explosion in the European Monetary System may have mortally
wounded Maastricht's single currency project anyway.
Likewise, a No verdict will create political upheaval in France, though the
president's newly-discovered prostate cancer has heightened the feeling that
the Mitterrand era is already drawing to a close.
The eve-of-poll strengths of the Yes and No camps seem to be a guillotine
blade's breadth apart. The French have responded to the first great debate
their country has had in 40 years on European integration with all their
famous political volatility.
The No voters clawed their way up from 30 per cent in the June opinion
surveys to a narrow majority in late August, only to fall back slightly by
the time public polling ended a week ago. Since then, the rumour mills have
been whirring with whispered results of secret surveys.
So, the sure bet Mr Mitterrand seemed to be making in June on the pro-EC
sentiments of his fellow citizens has come to be the riskiest of gambles.
His not-so-hidden motive was, of course, to deflect from his own
unpopularity by discomfiting the main opposition parties on an issue that
splits them.
But his public rationale  - the need for popular endorsement of France's
participation in further EC integration  - has acquired a life and
legitimacy of its own. Judged by its import for present and future
generations in France, Maastricht warrants a referendum far more than, say,
the last issue to be put to such a vote in 1988, a new constitution for
remote New Caledonia.
Yet the range and complexity of the treaty's provisions make a verdict very
hard to reduce to Yes or No, as the large number of undecided  - as many as
30 per cent in the last public polls  - attests. Indeed, Maastricht has
lifted the lid on a Pandora's Box of French gripes and fears about the
Community, and about France's place in it.
Back in June when the French parliament was going through the first stage of
the ratification process by amending the constitution, the only contention
was whether foreigners (citizens from other EC states) should be allowed to
vote in France's local and Euro-elections. The issue was of little moment,
except to Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National Front.
But the open debate of the referendum campaign brought out four big guns
against the treaty  - the 'three musketeers', Mr Charles Pasqua, Mr Philippe
Seguin, Mr Philippe De Villiers from the main opposition parties; and Mr
Jean-Pierre Chevenement from the ruling Socialists  - and four big issues.
The broadest has been the debate over French sovereignty: whether Maastricht
would compromise or protect it and how the EC should be made more
democratic. The French desire to maintain influence in Europe has shown
itself in the campaign to be largely defensive. That is to say,
pro-Maastricht arguments that Europe should project itself as a superpower
through common foreign and military policies have struck far less resonance
than assurances that Maastricht would help protect France from unwanted
immigrants and imports. The prospect of technocrats in an independent
central bank, alien to French tradition, running a Euro-currency has been
extensively and ably exploited by the No campaigners. But this week's
monetary turmoil will have reminded many French voters of the instability of
the current system, and may make them heed the warnings of the Yes camp that
worse would follow rejection of Maastricht.
Swirling around these issues has been the future of France's key
relationship with Germany, the one country which it constantly measures
itself against and which it feels outstripped by.
Even if domestic political considerations do not chiefly determine how many
French vote tomorrow, they will be uppermost in French minds, once the
result is in.
Mr Mitterrand rightly calculated that a Euro-referendum would fracture the
opposition more than his own Socialists. The RPR and UDF have committed
themselves to presenting a single candidate at the next presidential
elections, which they failed to do in 1981 and 1988. But Mr Jacques Chirac
and Mr Giscard d'Estaing remain rivals for that candidacy, having failed to
share a platform during the campaign. And Mr Mitterrand's health problems
almost certainly do not give them much time to make common cause.
But no assumptions are safe about how the wily president will react to
tomorrow's verdict. Obviously, he will take a Yes verdict as a personal
endorsement, but one which perhaps allows him to resign fairly soon, with
honour amid relative political calm.
A No decision will undoubtedly shift the French political landscape.
Foremost, it will be a slap in Mr Mitterrand's face. But it might also see
the 'three musketeers' and Mr Chevenement bursting the bounds of their
respective parties and splitting in opposite directions towards the solidly
anti-Maastricht National Front and the Communists. Mr Mitterrand might well
then feel, as captain of a storm-tossed France, he must stay on at the helm.
In doing so, he would be able to see whether there are political
realignments to his own party's benefit.
THE QUESTION        OUI ..   NON ..
Approuvez-vous le projet de loi soumis au peuple francais par le President
de le Republique autorisant la ratification du Traite sur l'Union
Europeenne?
'Do you approve the draft law put to the French people by the President of
the Republic authorising the ratification of the Treaty on European Union?')

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Private polls show Yes vote

PRIVATE opinion polls over the past week show a small margin for a Yes vote
in the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.
Five surveys over the past few days show between 52 per cent and 56 per cent
support for the treaty, a right-wing political party disclosed yesterday.
The sources are confidential because publication of opinion surveys in the
week before a national vote is forbidden.
This last-minute indication of support for European union came as
anti-treaty campaigners accused Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, of
holding the franc 'hostage'. The three leaders of the anti-Maastricht
campaign, Mr Philippe Seguin, Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Philippe de Villiers,
said Mr Beregovoy had acted against national interests by warning that a
victory for the No camp would harm the franc.
Mr Beregovoy replied that the anti-Maastricht campaigners had 'called into
question our currency by irresponsible comments'.
The past week has proved a bonanza for the polling organisations, but has
also led to widespread criticism of the ban on publication of polls. Mr
Michel Brule, a director of BVA, which has conducted polls every day for
private clients since last weekend, argues that the ban restricts
information to the privileged few, able to pay up to FFr50,000 (Pounds
5,500) for a survey.
Mr Jean Saint-Geours, president of the Commission des Operations de Bourse
(COB), the stock market watchdog, is also critical of the ban, but has
nevertheless pledged to ensure that it is strictly observed. The COB has
launched an inquiry into all trading from September 12, when the publication
ban came into effect, until its expiry at midnight tomorrow.
As a result, securities houses are being ultra-cautious about how they
handle confidential polls. One US firm has allowed only its top two European
directors to see the results of its privately commissioned polls. They are
allowed to take account of the findings but have been ordered not to
communicate the results.
However, there are reports of at least one poll, for an unidentified
opposition party, indicating a No majority.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: US, German clash likely
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Germany are expected to clash over interest rates at today's
meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations in
Washington's Dumbarton House.
The US has been urging Germany to take more active measures to stimulate the
world economy, and Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, will argue
that Germany must make further cuts in interest rates to help growth in the
European Community.
While US treasury officials welcomed the Bundesbank's reduction in official
interest rates on Monday as 'a significant change in direction', they made
it clear that they believe more cuts are needed soon.
'I think you can say in due course in Germany you will look forward to lower
interest rates,' said Mr David Mulford, US treasury undersecretary for
international affairs. 'That's clearly the signal they sent. The timing of
that is a complex matter dependent on developments in Germany, developments
in markets and so on.'
Now Japan has met insistent demands by the US for faster growth with an
ambitious government spending package, Germany will be the chief target for
the US at today's G7.
Senior US treasury officials say the German economy is now showing clear
signs of slowing down, and the Bundesbank may not be giving itself enough
credit for success in controlling the inflationary pressures of unification.
But in the absence of any credible US commitment to reducing its vast budget
deficit - which many countries feel poses a more significant problem for the
world economy than German interest rates - Mr Brady will have little to
offer in return for the rate cuts he seeks.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Silver lining for dollar in clouds
over the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MELTDOWN of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) has shaken confidence
throughout Europe, but left many US investors feeling more, rather than
less, secure. The consensus view of Wall Street analysts is that the dollar
has turned. The strong gains registered in the past week are widely seen as
just the beginning of a sustained, if sometimes bumpy, recovery for the US
currency.
The Bundesbank's agreement last weekend to a quarter-point cut to 9.5 per
cent in the Lombard rate is seen as the turning point. 'The principle was
established that the Germans would respond to pressure,' says Mr David
Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston, the New York broker. At the
meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries in Washington
today , Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, is expected to press
hard for further cuts in German rates.
Speaking in Washington yesterday, Mr Brady said lower interest rates in
Europe were 'inevitable if that continent is to return to growth'.
On Wall Street, the turmoil in the ERM is seen as bringing forward the
timing of cuts in European rates. 'The breaking apart of EMS (European
Monetary System) discipline will force larger interest rate cuts in Europe
sooner than would otherwise have occurred,' says Mr Robert Giordano, chief
US economist for Goldman Sachs, the investment bank.
'The dollar's appreciation reflects the fact that people are now more
optimistic about German interest rate cuts,' agrees Mr Philip Suttle, an
economist who follows European developments for JP Morgan, the New York
bank.
In the short run, exchange rate chaos in Europe has also served to enhance
the dollar's status as a 'safe haven' currency. Ahead of tomorrow's French
referendum on the Maastricht treaty, the future of European economic and
monetary integration hangs in the balance. By contrast, a huge, politically
stable, unified American market for exports and investment can be taken for
granted.
The safe haven argument for the dollar should not be exaggerated, however,
because the US is facing one of the most open presidential elections in
recent history. Financial analysts, moreover, are shifting to the view that
Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic contender, will win. Normally, the prospect
of a political shift from right to left would send tremors through financial
markets and undermine the dollar.
Such fears, however, are balanced by a recognition that it would be hard for
Mr Clinton to perform less well economically than the incumbent. Mr Bush has
not only presided over the slowest growth since Herbert Hoover, he has also
lost control of federal spending and run up even larger budget deficits than
did his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
The dollar is unlikely to appreciate without setbacks, however. US economic
figures this week were weaker than expected, raising fresh doubts about the
momentum of the domestic recovery.
Retail sales and industrial production both fell by 0.5 per cent last month.
There were mitigating circumstances: production was affected by Hurricane
Andrew and the fall in retail sales was partly balanced by upward revisions
for July. Nonetheless, these were hardly figures to inspire confidence.
And some analysts think there is worse to come. Mr Geoffrey Dennis, a
US-based economist for James Capel, the UK stockbroker, predicts very weak
employment figures for September. The combination of soft economic numbers
and the dollar's rebound is widely seen as increasing the pressure for US
interest rate cuts.
Early this month, the Federal Reserve shaved short-term interest rates by a
quarter-point to 3 per cent, but was prevented from easing more aggressively
by dollar weakness. Mr Jones at Aubrey Lanston thinks there is a 50:50
chance that poor employment figures would persuade the Fed to complete that
easing move by signalling a half-point cut in the discount rate to 2.5 per
cent early in October.
The case against another cut, however, is that the Fed would not want to
look politically partisan so close to an election. Without a prior easing of
interest rates in Europe, a unilateral Fed move would also threaten another
bout of instability on currency markets.
Looking beyond current uncertainties, most US forecasters expect the US
recovery to gather momentum next year. US interest rates are thus expected
to begin firming within six months or so. At the same time, many US analysts
believe European - and especially German - economic troubles are deeper than
previously suspected. Perhaps naively, many expect German intransigence on
interest rates to recede as recessionary forces become more evident.
How much might the dollar rise in such circumstances? Mr Giordano at Goldman
Sachs says that he would not be surprised if the dollar rose to DM1.60
within a few months. Purchasing power parity comparisons of relative price
levels suggests the potential gains could eventually be much greater.
In any case, movements against the D-Mark may understate the dollar's
underlying strength. If the de facto outcome of this week's turmoil is a
revaluation of the D-Mark in Europe, the dollar will appreciate faster
against weak European currencies, such as sterling and the lira, than
against the D-Mark. Whatever happens, another roller-coaster ride seems in
store for the world's currency markets.

Sir, Gordon Roddicks's slur - 'You have only to look at the customers in
Boots to know that they are not the same as ours' - made me hopping mad
('Body Shop shares fall 40 per cent on profit warning', September 17). The
two-headed monsters currently trawling round Boots for the things you can't
buy at the Body Shop (prescriptions and all proprietary medicines leap to
mind) can now take heart and pick up Boots' own-brand 'green' cosmetics with
a clear conscience.
If falling profit predictions encourage the Roddicks to look for ways to
make their chain attractive to those untermensch, could I make a couple of
suggestions? A few more polite, trained staff, particularly at the tills,
would make paying for the goods less of an assault course. And turn off that

FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: High money changing charges reflect badly on
European banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANCOIS P JEANJEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Could I add a few comments related to your excellent editorial
concerning the British clearing banks charges on current accounts ('A PR
coup for the banks', September 2).
After retiring from a career in international finance I decided to bum in
Europe with my son on a budget of Dollars 40 a day each.
This called for an examination of all expenses and, in my view, the bank
charges for changing money was one of the two worst rackets in Europe (the
second is the inability to obtain free tap water).
Canadian chartered banks are not philanthropic organisations, yet the spread
between buying and selling for major currencies is about 3 per cent for
small amounts; generally speaking, there are no extra charges. In England
and in most of Europe the spread is about 10 per cent).
In addition, most European banks, including British ones, charge a
commission which can vary from 2 per cent to 6 per cent and some change
offices, especially in Amsterdam but also one in Britain's Victoria station,
have an 8 per cent commission.
To top it all some banks will accept Visa traveller cheques, but will have
another fee to cash an American Express traveller cheque and vice versa. Not
a bad business to be in.
This is the time when I appreciated my credit card and the ability to
withdraw money in any currency at a fair price, but I cannot help but feel
that the banks are not improving their reputation with all the young
travellers who had no choice but to use their services.
This is the case for a common European currency, if there ever is one.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: Cause and effect of the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am starting a new business, with my own money. Nothing remarkable
about that except that I cannot get anyone to take it.
Lloyds, with whom I have banked for 30 years, flatly refuse to let me have a
credit card facility because mail order is involved. Midland, where I
subsequently opened a business account, cannot provide me with documentation
to operate that account. The fulfilment house failed to turn up at the
meeting arranged to finalise my arrangements with it and has not been heard
of since.
The magazine in which I wanted to advertise shows no desire to take the
advertisement.
A personal introduction from a senior colleague proves insufficient reason
for the insurance broker to do anything in response to my calls.
When these people announce their no doubt abysmal results they will blame
'the recession'. My recent experience suggests the recession is the effect,
incompetence the cause.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: Big is not necessarily beautiful in auditing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH SEELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with bafflement the Accountancy Columns's coverage of the Land
Travel collapse (September 3).
One of the 'warning signs' that Land Travel was about to collapse was
apparently the fact that 'Price Waterhouse - one of the largest UK firms -
resigned last year as auditor, to be replaced by a local firm'.
Such a comment indicates a misplaced bias and a total ignorance of the
accountancy needs of businesses and the high quality work being carried out
by many 'local' firms to address those needs.
Against the backdrop of numerous spectacular collapses in recent years and
the financial shambles at Lloyds, the majority of which were audited by the
big 6 firms or nearly big 6, perhaps you could explain the basis on which
you can infer that if a company changes its auditors from one of the big 6
it is one of the 'warning signs'.
Notwithstanding the misplaced bias of organisations such as yours, my firm
is attracting substantial amounts of audit work from the big 6. The
companies include plcs which are looking for better customer care, value for
money, and a more hands on and pro-active approach which will make them
better able to survive the present grim trading conditions.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Importance of not being George: Joe Rogaly pinpoints Bill
Clinton's greatest attraction to American voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Clinton might be the next president of the US, but with more than
six weeks to go that is all that can be said. His principal asset, I was
told over and over again in Los Angeles and Washington this week, is that he
is not Mr George Bush. He is young; the president is not. He is something
new; Mr Bush is all too familiar. He has a plan for the country's salvation;
the incumbent is blamed by many voters for setting the US economy on the
road to perdition. Yet there is no guarantee that Mr Clinton will win, in
spite of a lead that the conventional wisdom declares to be unassailable.
The Democratic candidate's problem is that he has the appearance of a
striver who is not quite 100 per cent gilt-edged. This is partly due to the
well-known accusation that he is an adulterer, a draft-avoider, and a man
who, when a student, puffed on a joint or two. In some eyes these are
peccadilloes but, in his anxiety to please, he has made the worst of them.
His successive explanations tumble over themselves. The danger for him is
that one day he may trip himself up.
He is attractive when addressing a crowd or moving within it to shake hands
and sign his autograph. He appears to enjoy pressing the flesh. To my eye,
he spoils it by a manner that is a touch over-studied. The gestures, the
hair-do, the smile, could have been designed to revive the image of Robert
Kennedy. If so, the comparison is to the disadvantage of the governor of
Arkansas. Where the former had soul, the latter has calculation.
This is not to say that Mr Clinton is more untrustworthy than any other
politician. In the eye of heaven, he may be judged to be possessed of
greater political integrity than President Bush. That is, however, beside
the point. What counts is that the challenger is vulnerable to attacks on
his character.
The intensity of such attacks, orchestrated no doubt by Mr James Baker, is
likely to increase. Nothing else that the president has tried seems to have
worked. The appeal to 'family values' - in reality a sigh of despair at the
changes that have taken place in society since the 1960s  - is politically
lucrative among the older generation, particularly in the southern states,
but less so elsewhere. The attempt to copy the subtext of the Conservative
election campaign in Britain earlier this year - 'sure we made you poorer
but the Democrats will make you poorer still' - has not so far been
effective.
In short, Mr Bush is still well behind in the race in virtually every state.
Former president Richard Nixon, now enjoying an established reputation for
shrewd political analysis, has advised the Republicans to forget about
California, where Mr Clinton seems set to win. That would give him 54 of the
270 electoral college votes necessary to put him in the White House. This
week, the challenger was back on the west coast again, a relaxed candidate
nailing down his huge lead.
His highly professional team placed him in south-central Los Angeles, where
burnt-out reminders of this year's riots can still be seen. At an
'employment preparation center' (vocational training school), he talked of
federally subsidised community development banks and federal matching funds
for the poor who save for a house or an education. He promised enterprise
zones, and the sharpening of a law (currently most honoured in the breach)
that obliges banks to invest specified sums in local areas.
There is courage in parts of this standard package: he is offering workfare
to the poor. That means that, after a while, social security ends if the
recipient does not sign up for a job, training or community service. The
students, hand-picked by advance teams, cheered and waved their pom-poms and
banners.
On to a Mexican independence day rally in the Hispanic area of Baldwin Park.
With practised passion, Mr Clinton preached his give-the-market-a-hand
interventionism. Mrs Hillary Clinton, splendid in pale blue, favoured the
sun-drenched audience with her best Princess Diana smile; the crowd, perhaps
aware of tendentious Republican attacks upon her, responded with loud
cheers. Mr Clinton talked again of helping the market to help people make
the best of their opportunities. In this part of town his language was a
shade more conservative than it had been earlier in the morning.
Watching, my mind raced back to 1968, when Hubert Humphrey lost to Mr Nixon
by a hair's breadth. Mr Humphrey was a man of substance, a New Dealer, a
socialist by today's definitions. He was, however, genuine. I heard him make
the same speech at brief stops in 48 states; he surely believed his own
words every time. The Humphrey promise was all about government handouts,
with nothing that I can recall on enterprise zones, or workfare. He offered
to perpetuate President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
Mr Clinton is so far to the right of Mr Humphrey - and, for that matter, of
Mr Robert Kennedy - that he could be running as a Republican. He is offering
what all serious parties of the left must put forward today. This is an
activist government programme, dressed in free market clothing. It is hard
to combine the two streams of thought into something that appears
unadulterated.
President Bush is trying to find a vulnerable point: he has begun to
characterise the Clinton programme as 'social engineering' of the kind that
led to wholesale nationalisation in western Europe.
This is sheer electoral hyperbole. By European standards Mr Clinton's
policies are fairly centrist, some of them tending towards the centre-right.
On non-economic matters he is no lefty: he is a cruelly proven supporter of
capital punishment. Yet, as president, he would constitute a full-stop to
the anti-government years that began with the election of President Reagan.
He is no free-market minimalist. The Democratic Congress would be likely to
support his bills where it opposed his immediate predecessors'. He would, as
Americans say, make a difference.
Not too much should be made of this. The arithmetic of Mr Clinton's
proposals, which shifts spending around and increases taxes on the rich, is
not wholly convincing to anyone who regards reduction of the budget deficit
as a priority. Mr Bush's failing is that he does not appear to understand
the need for domestic renovation; Mr Clinton's that his principal motivation
appears to be to get elected. For that to happen, American voters must trust
him all the way to November 3. It could be tricky.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Rising tide of disillusion: The road from Maastricht has
been paved with miscalculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The politicians who launched Europe towards political and monetary union
last December knew they were treading a narrow causeway. They did not
imagine, however, how quickly the waves of confusion and hubris would be
lapping around their ankles.
The road from Maastricht has been paved with miscalculation. Even if the
French vote No tomorrow, the journey towards European integration will not
come to an end. Yet the route will become more perilous - and the number of
countries determined to carry on may diminish.
From the beginning, uncertainty has been inherent in the treaty, reflecting
the pathwork of nebulously-worded compromises aiming to satisfy the demands
of the document's 12 signatories. Would Maastricht turn the European
Community into an intolerable 'superstate', as Lady Thatcher, the former UK
prime minister, has claimed, or mark the first step away from EC
centralisation, as stated by Mr John Major, her successor?
Would the treaty repair drawbacks in the 1987 Single European Act, which
established the way to a border-free 'single market', as President Francois
Mitterrand declared on French television a fortnight ago? Or would it
exacerbate these deficiencies, to the detriment of millions of Gallic
workers and farmers, as his opponents in the French referendum campaign
claim? Would it extend German monetary hegemony across Europe, as many
French voters fear - or would it allow the Paris government to get its hands
on the D-Mark, as many Germans (including the officials of the Bundesbank)
believe?
Confronted with these contradictions, as well as the Community's
ineffectiveness in dealing with challenges ranging from immigration to the
conflict in the former Yugoslavia, voters seem puzzled and disillusioned. In
the Netherlands - traditionally in favour of a federal Europe - 44 per cent
of voters are undecided about Maastricht, while more than half do not
understand the treaty, according to two recent opinion polls.
Just nine months ago, the Maastricht trail looked a lot less stony. At the
EC summit in the Dutch border town, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor,
projected fulsome confidence. He agreed a small private wager - six bottles
of wine from the Rhineland-Palatinate village of Gimmeldingen against a
crate of British vintage - that the UK would join economic and monetary
union (Emu) by the Maastricht timetable date of 1997 or 1999.
The German chancellor has again been trying to ease tension, claiming that
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, told him that Britain would 'soon'
rejoin the exchange rate mechanism. In fact, the turmoil in the European
Monetary System has now sharply lengthened the odds against Emu being
established - and relegated to the realms of dreams the notion that Britain
could take part in it.
Everywhere, governments appear to have underestimated the degree of
deflation which the tough Maastricht Emu targets, together with high German
interest rates, would impose on European economies. The financial markets'
belief that these deflationary pressures would prove politically
unsustainable in the weaker currency countries has been the main factor
behind the ERM unrest.
Other misjudgments have been in the political sphere. Mr Mitterrand's
referendum gamble may by tomorrow night have blown up in his face. Compared
with the president's expectation three months ago of a sizeable Yes
majority, the best he can now hope for is a small margin in favour. That
would salvage the treaty. But, in a country which, with Germany, has been
the motor of European integration, such a grudging outcome would leave grave
doubts about whether the Community can maintain the drive forward.
The Danish government, presiding over an electorate habitually sceptical
about further integration, took another form of risk by holding an early
referendum in June. It chose not to wait for other countries to embark first
on the ratification trail.
The Danish No was spurred by a mixture of motives. Top of the list seems to
have been ordinary people's concerns about Community interference in their
lives - fears which are very similar to the worries expressed by many in
Britain.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the pro-Maastricht Danish foreign minister spent
the summer pondering why the Danes (by a small margin) turned the treaty
down. He believes he has now come up with an answer. 'The whole idea of
European co-operation has simply become too far removed from the daily lives
of our people. The Danes showed they were sick and tired of reading in the
newspapers or hearing on the radio every morning that new things had been
decided over their heads.'
Since Maastricht needs to be ratified by all 12 members, the Danish No
ensures that the treaty cannot become operational until next year, at least.
Even if it surmounts ratification hurdles elsewhere, the treaty will require
the blessing of another Danish referendum next spring.
Still more important than the legal quagmire it created, the Danish
rejection had a catalytic effect in spreading doubts elswhere. Crucially, it
suddenly became respectable in Germany for opponents of Emu to make public
their qualms about abandoning the D-Mark. The agonising over whether the
planned new European currency will be as stable as the D-Mark is likely to
be given a fresh public airing when parliamentary ratification starts in
Germany later this autumn.
Attempts to re-establish the ERM on a sound footing are unlikely to be
successful while the present strains and recriminations persist. For some
German critics, the writing is on the wall. Mr Hans Barbier, the economics
editor of the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, yesterday signed
off a trenchant front-page article by declaring that the European Monetary
System was worthless. 'One should not be sad if (such systems) fall apart.'
With weaker currencies, led by sterling and the lira, now clearly detached
from the ERM's D-Mark-based 'hard core', the group of countries which could
participate in Emu has been reduced to no more than six: Germany, France,
the Benelux countries and, possibly, Denmark. If France votes No, even the
prospect of a slimmed-down Emu grouped around a Franco-German nucleus would
vanish.
One warning signal for the future has been the resurgence of national
antipathies. This week's articles in the British tabloid press about 'the
Bundesbank bullies' have been just one sign. Many Germans have been
irritated by the fears of German dominance which have played a large role -
in both the Yes and No camps - in the French referendum campaign.
Complaining about the anti-German overtones in France, Mr Rudolf Augstein,
the publisher of Germany's most important news magazine Der Spiegel, wrote,
perhaps somewhat drastically, this week: 'What worries us most is the fact
that the oft-proclaimed Franco-German friendship in practice hardly exists.'
If French voters - for whatever reason - ditch Maastricht tomorrow, the
Community will not suddenly lose its raison d'etre. In a speech in London on
September 7, Mr Major spelled out seven separate items on the Community's
agenda which would still require active attention even if the Maastricht
process failed: the single market, the EC budget, enlargement, links with
eastern Europe, the Gatt negotiations, and so on. If Maastricht is buried,
the Community would none the less need to make a giant effort to recover
from the shock. According to one maxim favoured by EC officials, the
Community is like a bicycle: the only way it can remain steady is by moving
forwards. This week, everyone's fear of toppling has suddenly intensified.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Plan for staying afloat: What John Major should tell the
House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week Mr John Major will have to defend himself before the House of
Commons against the charge of leading his government and his country into
the ERM disaster. This is, after all, the man who said, less than two weeks
ago, that 'changes in economic and monetary arrangements . . . must work
with the grain of the market and not against it. This is of course what the
ERM does.' After what markets have done, what will the prime minister say?
Ideally, something like this:
'I must apologise to honourable members of this House. I was wrong. The
government was wrong. But so, I would remind this House, was the Opposition.
'Not having suffered the disadvantages of a university education in
economics, I have little excuse. People with first class degrees and
insufficient confidence in their country found attractive the
simplifications and the defeatism that lay behind our ERM policy. I cannot
plead this justification.
'Why defeatism? How else can one describe the view that the best possible
monetary target for the UK was German broad money and the best central bank
the Bundesbank?
'Why simplifications? Over the past twenty years, governments first received
plaudits for trying to get the exchange rate down, whatever its effects on
the money supply; then for deciding to control the money supply, whatever
its effects on the exchange rate; and finally, for keeping the exchange rate
up, whatever its effects on the money supply. This drunken walk from one
over-simplified nostrum to the next has perfectly matched the behaviour of
the economy.
'The ERM policy has, in the end, damaged our credibility and our relations
with Germany. The system is, in fact, half-baked: too rigid to accommodate
the pressures of the markets and too flexible to resist them. The logical
policies are either a single currency or a floating exchange rate. The
Germans will not soon grant the former, at least to the UK, so the UK must,
for the moment, choose the latter.
'A floating pound provides an opportunity, but also a danger. I remain
convinced that this country should aim for steady, non-inflationary growth.
Monetary policy will not deliver the growth. It is our old supply-side
policies - competition, privatisation and low taxation - plus our new
supply-side policies - more spending on economically productive
infrastructure and a radical overhaul of education and training for the
over-sixteens - that will deliver growth in the longer term. But monetary
policy can provide support.
'How, the House may wonder, is the government going to pull off this
miracle? It is not. The Bank of England is. Daily operation of monetary
policy is to be the Bank's responsibility. A bill to grant it operating
independence and reconstitute the Bank's court of directors will be before
the House shortly.
'You must all wonder how the Bank of England is going to manage its task.
That, I am glad to say, will not be the government's problem. But I imagine
that like the Bundesbank it will look at broad money - rather a reliable
indicator ever since we stopped targeting it - the exchange rate and long
term interest rates.
'The Bank will still be accountable. First, the government will be able to
override its decisions. But it will have to do so publicly. Secondly, the
Governor will have to explain the Bank's policies to the House. I wish her
every success.
'Many of my honourable friends hope for yet another dash for growth, with
interest rates down to 5 per cent tomorrow. That is neither what we intend
nor what the country needs. What it needs is an export-led recovery and
continued control over inflation, so building on the one success of the last
two years. The latter is what the Bank will be expected to deliver.
Nevertheless, my honourable friends will be pleased to know that the
government will cut base rate by another two percentage points. We intend to
take advantage of our last period of monetary responsibility to make this
fully justified cut just before the party conference.
'Once monetary policy is out of our hands, our aim will be to stop the
fiscal haemorrhage. We intend to eliminate the deficit over the next several
years, not because of the mechanical Maastricht convergence criteria, but
because of the need to limit the government's call on private savings.
'As the economy recovers, current spending will come back under control. But
we will also be taking a longer term and more radical look at the structure
of spending. In the meantime, the growth in public sector wages will be
limited to 2 per cent a year over the next three years.
'I have only one more announcement to make. My honourable friend, the
chancellor of the exchequer, is to resign his post. This is not because he
was responsible for the ERM calamity - the House knows he was not - but
because he has become a liability to Anglo-German relations. Our blundering
has hugely damaged those relations. We will do whatever needs to be done to
improve them. Our firm promise not to rejoin the EMS should help. I can
assure the House that this time we mean what we say.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: Bundesbank only advanced day when UK bit devaluation
bullet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL JAMIESON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The whingeing about the Bundesbank and its president, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, has been taken to excess. Britain's economic woes are of its
own making. The government's monolithic handling of economic policy, while
worthy in its goals, has been based on false parameters, not least the
D-Mark rate at which sterling entered the ERM.
The Bundesbank and Mr Schlesinger deserve our thanks. The Bundesbank lowered
interest rates. If I remember correctly, that is what the 'economic
scribblers' and others in Britain had been pleading the Bank to do for
months. Mr Schlesinger's statements merely advanced the day when the
government had to bite the 'sterling-devaluation' bullet. He has helped to
stop the current bout of cancer which, had it continued, may have proved
terminal for both the government and British industry. Neil Jamieson,

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharp downturn at Hornby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SQUEEZED margins and a swing from interest receivable to payable lay behind
the sharply reduced pre-tax profits at Hornby Group, the USM-quoted toy,
hobby and sports boat manufacturer, in the six months to June 30.
Profits fell to Pounds 158,000 (Pounds 541,000) pre-tax on increased
turnover of Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 10.3m).
Mr Alan Cox, finance director, explained that the interest turnround from
Pounds 65,000 credit to Pounds 58,000 charge derived partly from lower
interest rates in the first quarter when Hornby has cash on deposit, but
also from higher seasonal borrowings caused by the investment in Cassy, the
new doll concept, and retailers, fearful of overstocking, ordering later.
The November acquisition for Pounds 400,000 of the Dell Quay boat range
helped Fletcher, the boat-making side accounting for 10 per cent of Hornby
turnover, sell more units.
In its well known branded toys, Mr Cox said that Hornby Railways and
Scalextric, the racing car game, had been selling steadily and well. 'Brands
can sell throughout the year, not just at Christmas.'
Earnings fell by 3p to 1.2p per share. Again there is no interim dividend,
because of the seasonality of the business.

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TVS to be sold to US cable group for Pounds
38m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS ENTERTAINMENT, the ITV company which has lost its licence, is to be
taken over by International Family Entertainment, one of the largest US
cable television companies.
The company runs The Family Channel, which is devoted to wholesome
entertainment with more than 56m subscribers in the US. Its origins lie in
the Christian Broadcasting Channel, founded by Mr Pat Robertson, the first
of the television evangelists who ran for president in 1988.
The deal is worth Pounds 38.2m and is likely to be seen as something of a
coup for TVS shareholders. The shares of the company, which failed the
quality threshold in last year's competitive tenders for new franchise
because its Pounds 59.76m was seen as too high, has been down as low as 3
1/2 p.
The deal is worth 25p per ordinary and 45p per preference share. It already
has the support of 30 per cent of shareholders.
The shares were suspended yesterday at 18 3/4 p pending the announcement. It
was delayed awaiting Takeover Panel approval, which came later last night.
IFE is buying TVS mainly for MTM, its US production company responsible for
programmes such as Lou Grant and Hill Street Blues. It also wants to expand
into international production and will use the acquisition to expand into
the UK market.
The company is now quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. CBC still has a
stake in IFE but they operate separately. The Family Channel carries
programmes that are not overtly Christian.
IFE will not formally take over until January 1 when Meridian takes over the
south of England ITV licence from TVS.
For some time TVS has been investigating two different future strategies.
One was to try to rise again from the ashes as a media company by acquiring
strategic stakes in other companies. TVS looked at the possibility of buying
Carlton Communication's 51 per cent stake in Zenith, the independent
producer. But in the end TVS decided it did not have enough money to make
significant acquisitions.
The other was to sell the assets for the best price that could be obtained.
The appearance of a serious purchaser in IFE tipped the balance strongly in
favour of selling out.
Mr James Gatward, the founder of TVS who was ousted as chief executive of
the company, said last night he did not think the deal was a good one for
shareholders, particularly those who held ordinary rather than preference
shares.
'TVS is worth far more than that,' said Mr Gatward, who is one of the
largest individual shareholders.

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Chairman resigns from Taylor Woodrow
offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Hedges yesterday resigned as chairman of Taylor Woodrow Property,
one of the construction company's biggest divisions.
It is the latest in a series of senior management changes at the group which
incurred a Pounds 16m pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year.
Taylor Woodrow said that Mr Hedges, 49, was leaving 'to pursue other
interests in management, property investment and industry.'
Mr Hedges is thought to have been a candidate for the chairmanship of Taylor
Woodrow, which was given to Mr Colin Parsons following the departure in
March of former chairman, Mr Peter Drew.
One of the first acts of Mr Parsons was to dismantle a top heavy senior
management structure which included two deputy chairmen and three joint
managing directors.
Mr Hedges, although he retained his power base as head of one of the group's
important division, was stripped of his titles of group deputy chairman and
joint managing director.

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Liberty falls sharply as recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Liberty, the fashion and fabric group, fell sharply, from
Pounds 1.65m to Pounds 648,000, in the six months to August 1, against a
background of continuing recession on the high street.
Mr John Pugh, finance director, admitted: 'The results are not terrifically
exciting, but it has been pretty tough in the UK.' However, recent events,
which will allow tourists to spend more, 'have to be positive for us'.
The main reasons for the downturn were doubled losses to Pounds 1.11m
(Pounds 564,000) in retailing where turnover rose some Pounds 400,000 to
Pounds 23.3m, and halved profits to Pounds 869,000 (Pounds 1.82m) in
converting and wholesaling where turnover declined to Pounds 8.69m (Pounds
11.3m). He said there was a lack of larger ticket sales, like furniture and
furnishing fabrics, because of the poor housing market, and a shift away
from printed fabrics in the fashion industry.
Mr Brian Myerson, speaking for Concerto Capital Corporation, his family's
investment vehicle and owner of 15.6 per cent of Liberty's voting shares,
described the performance as 'dismal, very disappointing'. However, he
thought it was 'not a company problem - Liberty has enormous potential - but
a management problem'.
He said the results vindicated his concerns about the way the company was
run, concerns he raised in the extraordinary meeting in June when he called
for equality of voting rights and the appointment of non-executives to the
board. He said he would remain a pro-active investor.
Mr Pugh pointed to the rise in profits - to Pounds 538,000 (Pounds 492,000)
on turnover up at Pounds 4.37m (Pounds 3.88m) - in the French printing
operations, and said that July 1991's rent review was showing a benefit,
with rental income growing to Pounds 782,000 (Pounds 607,000). Debt was cut
and gearing reduced from 19 per cent to 7 per cent.
Earnings tumbled to 0.46p (5.13p) per share, but the interim dividend is
held at an uncovered 1.85p. Mr Pugh was 'not worried at all' by this,
pointing to the seasonal bias of the business.

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Elonex ahead and plans flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELONEX, the privately-owned north London personal computer manufacturer
which has grown to become the biggest direct seller of PCs in the UK,
yesterday reported sharply higher full year pre-tax profits and turnover,
and announced plans to seek a stock market quotation 'within the next 24
months.'
Pre-tax profits in the year to April 30 increased by 24 per cent to Pounds
9.08m (Pounds 7.34m), on turnover which grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 57.8m
(Pounds 45.5m).
Net current assets at the six year-old company almost doubled to stand at
Pounds 10.5m (5.45m) at the end of the period and capital and reserves grew
to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 6.64m).
Despite the recession and fierce competition, Elonex has bucked the industry
trend increasing the number of employees from 130 in 1991 to over 200 today.
Growth has been self-financed and the company's only long term debt is the
mortgage on its London headquarters and production site.
However Mr Michael Spiro, finance director, added that after six successive
years of growth 'we can now start to lay the foundations for publicly quoted
status.' He said a share flotation 'will enable us to assume better control
over the production and distribution of Elonex products worldwide, and will
provide our staff with a bigger stake in the company's continued success.'

2.84m

   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACALLAN-Glenlivet, the Scotch whisky distiller, reported a 15 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30, because of reduced demand
for new whisky from blenders.
Profits fell to Pounds 2.84m (Pounds 3.33m) on reduced sales of Pounds 6.93m
(Pounds 8.18m).
Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.36m (Pounds 2.86m) as demand for new
fillings from blending customers fell by 36 per cent.
Sales of the company's own brand, the Macallan single malt, increased by 17
per cent, widening its international distribution.
Mr Phillips expected overseas sales, particularly in Italy, to remain
buoyant. 'The devalued pound should make it easier to export,' he said.
'Despite poor conditions in the domestic market, the board expects profits
for the full year will be close to those of last year,' he stated.
Pre-tax profits in 1991 increased by 10 per cent from Pounds 6.69m to Pounds
7.38m.
Midterm earnings per share fell to 1.77p (2.34p). The interim dividend was
increased to 0.3p (0.25p)

Whinney Mackay-Lewis, the USM-quoted architectural practice, fell into the
red in the second half leaving it with a full year pre-tax loss of Pounds
435,000, compared with profits of Pounds 576,000.
The company blamed difficult trading and the postponement of two important
projects. Included in the loss were 'significant' redundancy costs and an
exceptional refurbishment charge of Pounds 163,000.
On prospects the company said that the prolonged recession in the
construction industry was making it difficult for any business in the sector
to look forward with confidence.
Turnover for the year to April 30 was lower at Pounds 5.68m (Pounds 7.66m).
Losses per share were 5.1p (earnings 5.1p). After the passing of the interim
dividend directors are not recommending a final. Last year there was a total
of 2p.

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Acsis deficit cut in first half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Acsis Group, the healthcare and interior contracting concern, cut pre-tax
losses from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 285,000 for the first half of 1992.
Mr Ephraim Barsam, chairman, said that during the period, NMS, the
international healthcare company, operated profitably and increased the
number of nurses working. However, the poor economic climate in California -
one of the major markets - has slowed the rate of growth.
The continuity sales division traded profitably and was successful in
reducing stock levels. The interior contracting side incurred a loss, but
won significant new contracts valued in excess of Pounds 2m which has
improved its order book for the second half.
Mr Barsam pointed out, however, that the group's performance was largely
dependent upon exchange rates as a substantial part of its earnings and debt
were denominated in US dollars.
Turnover for the period dropped from Pounds 15.61m to Pounds 8.58m. Losses
per share were 0.04p (0.7p) and there is again no interim dividend.

<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Perloff, and companies acting in concert wuth him, have increased
their stake in Etonbrook Properties to 18.75 per cent, the largest single
holding in the former BES company which came to the market last year.
The increase involved Mr Perloff and Panther Securities, of which he is a
shareholder, purchasing 15,000 Etonbrook shares.
Last month Mr Perloff failed to secure a seat on the board for himself and
Mr Malcolm Bloch. At that time his concert party spoke for 15 per cent of
Etonbrook.
However the concert party was able to defeat a proposal by Etonbrook to
repay its preference shares which would have allowed the company to make a
25p per share capital repayment and pay a 2.75p dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fired Earth Tiles, the specialist tiles retailer, reported a sharp decline
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 136,000 to Pounds 6,000 for the six months to
July 2 1992, and has omitted its interim dividend.
Mr Nicholas Kneale, the chairman, stressed that the protection of the
balance sheet was of the utmost importance. Although he said gearing was a
modest 17 per cent, this was a deterioration from the previous year's 10 per
cent. Net assets per share were currently 40p.
The start of the year was particularly depressed with a combined loss of
around Pounds 150,000 in January and February, but since then there had been
steady, if unimpressive monthly profits, Mr Kneale said.
Trading on a monthly basis remained difficult, but the company intended to
review the level of final dividend when full year results were available.
Last year, a 1.625p interim was followed by a 2.4p final.
First-half turnover was static at Pounds 2.46m and there were nil earnings
per share (1.79p).

JAMES FISHER and Sons, the shipping and port operator, raised operating
profits from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 2.26m for the first half of 1992, but
warned that with a second half trading loss anticipated, the full year

With no sign of any improvement in trading conditions, the company said it
was no longer appropriate for the dividend level to be geared to its medium

Turnover rose to Pounds 17.53m (Pounds 14.89m). Shipping services
contributed Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 1.28m) to profits, but the shipping finance
side was lower at Pounds 443,210 (Pounds 670,318) and losses from port
operations increased to Pounds 108,731 (Pounds 43,563).
Earnings per share dropped from 6.4p to 4.95p.

WHARFEDALE, the loudspeaker manufacturer, yesterday announced an agreed
Pounds 4m takeover of Centralforce Holdings which owns the Mission and Cyrus
brand names for loudspeakers and electronics. The loss-making Leeds-based
company is raising Pounds 5m through a placing and open offer on a 12-for-11
basis at 10.5p per share. Its shares yesterday closed at 11p.
The name of the merged company is being changed to Verity Group.
Wharfedale separately announced that its pre-tax deficit had risen to Pounds
2.94m (Pounds 1.22m) for the year ended June 30. The outcome was struck
after an exceptional charge of Pounds 915,000 (Pounds 129,000) covering
reorganisation and rationalisation costs.
Centralforce is owned by Mr Farad Azima and his family. Mr Azima, who will
join the merged company's board, will receive Pounds 4m of which Pounds
3.08m will be cash and the balance in shares. He will also receive 10m
warrants to subscribe for one new share each at 16p, exercisable between
January 1 1994 and December 31 1996.
Turnover fell to Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 11.3m). Losses per share were 9.1p
(7.9p).
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 361,000 related to costs
incurred in closing its hi-fi electronics division and metal-working
factory.

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: P-E halves dividend after 72% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P-E INTERNATIONAL, the management and computer consultancy group, yesterday
halved its interim dividend to 1p 'in the light of trading conditions,' and
reported a 72 per cent decline in first-half pre-tax profits which fell from
Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 514,000.
Fee income in the six months to June 30 rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 35.5m
(Pounds 33.6m), but included a contribution from the Handley-Walker group
which was acquired in July last year. Trading profits dropped by 58 per cent
to Pounds 842,000 (Pounds 2.01m) while net interest costs increased to
Pounds 332,000 (Pounds 177,000).
Despite the falls Mr George Cox, who took over as chairman in May, said that
given the economic conditions 'our performance is not unsatisfactory'.
He said three factors put the performance in perspective. 'Firstly, it shows
an improvement on the second half last year. Secondly, this result comes
after increased expenditure in the development of the business. Thirdly, we
believe our overall performance compares favourably with most of our
competitors.'
The group restructured its operations and made significant cuts in its cost
base towards the end of 1991 taking a Pounds 541,000 exceptional charge
which contributed to an overall loss in last year's second half.
Mr Cox said that although the group had returned to profitability this year,
and improved its gross margins over that second half period, 'we have not
yet seen the significant improvement in trading performance which would
undoubtedly result from an increase in demand'.
He expressed confidence that 'the considerable effort and cost' already
expended this year to reshape the group would allow P-E to perform better in
a continued depressed economy, and take advantage of any upturn.
However, he warned that expenditure on reshaping the business, including
investing in new products and services and widening the geographic spread of
operations, would increase during the second half. 'We expect to see
significant benefits from these investments in 1993, with some of these
benefits possibly arising earlier.'
Earnings per share dropped to 1.5p (6.7p).

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: City Site passes pref dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City Site Estates, the Glagow-based property investment company, yesterday
announced that it would pass its preference dividends because of
insufficient distributable reserves. Its share price dropped from 24p to
close at 9p.
The company said it was planning to transfer some of its share premium to
distributable reserves to allow dividend payments to start again as soon as
possible.
The dividend on its 10 per cent preference shares and 5.2 per cent
preference shares was due to be paid on September 30.
In July, the company announced it had returned to pre-tax profit of Pounds
190,000 in the half year ended March 31 1992, compared with a loss of Pounds
1.99m for the same period the year before. It passed the interim dividend on
its ordinary shares.

FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance sells most of 14.2% CU stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the UK composite insurer, finally disposed for Pounds 280m
most of its 14.24 per cent stake in its rival Commercial Union yesterday
after several days of speculation that it was trying to sell the shares.
The company was able to take advantage of the rise in equities following
sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism on Wednesday to sell the
13.5 per cent holding for more than the purchase price of 465p three years
ago.
Sun Alliance sold 60m shares in Commercial Union to Smith New Court, which
in conjunction with Cazenove, placed the shares with a number of
institutions.
The shares were sold at 470p and placed at 475p, generating a profit of
Pounds 3m believed to have been equally split between the two securities
concerns.
Sun Alliance was rumoured to have put in train an attempted bought deal last
Tuesday but it was subsequently abandoned when word of the deal, rumoured to
be at 470p a share, leaked.
A bought deal is a bid by a securities house for a block of shares in a
company which it takes onto its book on risk and then attempts to place at a
profit.
Smith New Court, which has gained a reputation for executing most of the
bought deals in the market in recent years, lined up the deal. It had been
targetting the CU stake, one of the largest 'loose' holdings in the market,
for some time. Cazenove and SG Warburg are joint brokers to Sun Alliance.
The bulk of the Sun stake in Commercial Union, a holding of 13%, was
acquired in August 1989 from Adelaide Steamship, the investment group then
run by Mr John Spalvins, who had built up the holding over 12 months.
The purchase happened when the UK composite insurers feared the prospect of
hostile bids from European competitors and built up stakes in each other's
companies.
The deal leaves Sun Alliance with 3.45m CU shares, or 0.77 per cent.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Property: Prudent Welsh look to recovery - David Hoppitt
discovers that confidence is coming back despite the death of the mining
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALES is a blest country. Anyone depressed by urban sprawl and dwindling
wildlife needs only to stride along Offa's Dyke and over the Black Mountains
to restore their spirits. The dyke, built at the end of the 8th century, was
intended to contain troublesome Welsh princes rather than stop the English
drifting across the border.
Wales (and Anglesey, in particular) is as old as the world itself, the
pre-Cambrian rocks there having formed as the molten earth began to cool
some 3,000m years ago. In the south, inland from the rugged Pembrokeshire
coast at Mynydd Prescelly, the great blocks of granite that form Stonehenge
were quarried.
Small wonder that Wales is a country of strange legends and tradition,
folklore mingled with fact. Castles and strange place names abound.
Only a few years ago, when coal mining was in its terminal stages, property
was among the cheapest in Europe. In 1984, I found Britain's cheapest house
in a village named Cwmbach (bach meaning small and cwm meaning valley). The
mid-terrace Victorian cottage, with a new roof, was offered for just Pounds
800 (no, I haven't left off a nought). After I wrote about it, hundreds of
people headed for the village clutching chequebooks. Five years later, the
same house would have cost at least Pounds 8,000.
Cheap property can be found again now, but only where changing fortunes have
caused repossessions. 'The situation in other parts of the United Kingdom is
terrible. We are vastly better off here, largely because Welsh lenders have
been very much more prudent than most of their English counterparts,' says
John Mitchell, chief executive of the Principality building society.
Although house prices fell after 1989, the drop was not so great as in other
areas, largely because Wales avoids the peaks and troughs of the Home
Counties' market. Mitchell actually sees the beginning of a recovery in the
Welsh market; indeed, sales through the society's estate agency arm have
increased both in 1991 and this year.
'Falling house prices have damaged confidence; affordability is not the
problem here,' he says. But he adds: 'As long as the stock of unsold
properties decreases, the prospect of a housing market recovery in Wales
looks more optimistic than for many other areas.'
People seem to have come to terms with the death of coal mining; Sony, the
Japanese electronics giant, now employs some 3,000 people at Bridgend, which
is more than work in the remaining four pits. Soon, there will be just one
working mine in the entire principality.
There is a feeling of growing confidence in Wales, exemplified by the
national garden festival near Ebbw Vale that ends early next month. 'The
festival has been a triumph - local people have petitioned for the park to
remain,' says Alan Nicol, project director of the Welsh Development Agency.
In fact, 70 acres of the park will be retained; some 500 homes and 3,500 sq
ft of business and industrial space will be built alongside. The three
energy-efficient houses constructed specially for the festival will soon be
sold, and a number of sites have been reserved to encourage self-build
projects.
Christopher Heath, of Custom Homes, the Redhill (Surrey) company that built
the largest of the three houses, says: 'There has been tremendous interest
in the self-build plots; already, 12 have been reserved at prices starting
at Pounds 25,000.' He talks of 'lifting this former blighted area into a
place that will provide perfect living and working conditions.'
In addition, the Welsh Development Agency has a Pounds 25m annual programme
to promote large-scale regeneration projects, working with local
authorities. Present schemes, creating and safeguarding thousands of jobs,
are at Llanelli, Merthyr Tydfil, Barry, Holyhead and Cynon Valley.
Mitchell says new homes in the valleys always sell well because the housing
stock in Wales is predominantly old. But F. Carey Jones, of Crown, part of
the Royal Life group, adds that while there was a noticeable rush for
exchanges and completions to beat the August deadline on stamp duty,
especially among first-time buyers, the market for more expensive houses in
the Pounds 180,000-plus bracket is very slow.
Graham Adnitt, of Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff, says: 'Understandably, vendors are
reluctant to bring their houses on to the market until conditions improve;
consequently, when a house of genuine quality is offered, there is still a
real response, proving that there are buyers about.'
The firm is selling the listed Old Rectory at Cerrigydrudion, near Corwen, a
Grade II Georgian house with a guide price of Pounds 195,000; already, there
has been a flurry of inquiries.
Swetenhams, which has some mouth-watering country and seaside property on
the books, is offering some cheaper properties as well. An end of terrace
one-bedroom cottage in Llandudno, with views of the estuary and castle, can
be bought for Pounds 37,500.
If a holiday foothold is all that is required, the Holiday Property Bond -
approaching its 10th birthday - has added to its wide portfolio of
properties with St Bride's Castle, on the Pembrokeshire coast not far from
the delightful St David's. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000, but most
families put around Pounds 4,000 into the fund. Of all the HPB's 500-plus
holiday homes, however, flats in this dramatic castle are proving to be
among the most popular. Elsewhere in Wales, the second-home market has gone
very quiet; Humberts says the only homes selling for holiday occupation are
those that need major restoration.
Prices around Wales vary enormously but Peter Alan, of Principality's estate
agency arm, gives guide prices in two key areas - although he stresses that
the figures given are 'minima.' In Cardiff, a two-bedroomed terrace is
Pounds 20,950; a three-bed semi Pounds 31,950; a four-bed detached Pounds
69,950; and a country house with paddock Pounds 185,000. Comparative figures
for Swansea are Pounds 19,950, Pounds 24,000, Pounds 55,000 and Pounds
145,000.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Trapeze guru Jean Palacy describes the pleasures of a life of flight
THE CHANCELLOR performs a double backward somersault, currencies plunge
through the safety net, the Big Top shudders, the president's prostate is
paraded around the ring and the future of Europe hangs in the balance.
It has been a spectacular week and its climax is tomorrow's French
referendum.
But here is one Frenchman who won't be voting.
Jean Palacy is unmoved. 'I suppose it's my duty,' he said, 'because if the
result's not good then I am responsible. Mais . . .' He shrugged. 'In any
case I think politics is . . . I don't know how to explain . . . The outcome
is always much the same.'
The doyen of the flying trapeze has a longer perspective and larger
preoccupations - not least the fate of his Ecole Trapeze Volant in Paris
which next month will have to quit its present site because the developers
are moving in.
I found him, a broad-shouldered man hunched in a chair, giving
master-classes in a leafy square in Bristol. His big hands worked the ropes
of the safety harness while neophyte fliers swung to and fro, silhouetted in
the rig above him before dropping exhausted into his net like ripe fruit
into a basket.
His English wife Pauline was on the platform shouting instructions:
'Shoulders up] Now bend] Keep your bum in]'
After 27 years aloft as one of the most famous catchers in the world, the
Professor of Trapeze, now 62, is grounded. One leg is twisted and he walks
with a stick. He resembles an amiable troll with his big chest and strong
arms, tanned face and gentle eyes.
I asked him to describe the fascination of his trade.
'It's like flying, like being a bird. That sensation of flying then falling
gently into the net is very pleasant.'
When you're up there, what do you think about? The danger?
'No. One thinks about the job one has to do. To be a good trapeze artist you
must above all think hard. It's not suppleness, or strength so much as
mental lucidity.'
But there is the element of danger, too.
'There is a bit, but not much on the trapeze. It's much more dangerous to go
riding because if the horse shies you can fall on your head. When you know
how to do it you can take off the safety harness and you have the net.
There's no danger.'
But you know people who've been killed doing it?
'Yes. Lots have. But not always because of the act - because of the gear.'
Palacy's only serious accident occurred in the Christmas of 1950 when he was
20 and working with his first flying troupe, the Meteors, for Bertram Mills'
circus at Olympia in London.
'It was the first day and the net was 25 metres off the ground. When the act
was over I went like this (he spread his arms wide) to fall into the net. I
went right through the net and fell 25 metres to the ground. I was six
months in hospital in London, the West London in Hammersmith.' He smiled.
The broken leg was re-set but he has been plagued with osteoarthritis ever
since and will have to be operated on again soon.
After a year's recuperation the widow of another catcher, Stephan Clerans,
asked him to reform her husband's troupe. Clerans had plunged 18 metres to
his death in Chicago when the rope he was descending after the act just
snapped.
Palacy, whose real name is Quentin ('Palacy' is an abbreviation of Pauline
Lacy, the name of his second wife) was born in Paris, the son of a plumber
and roofer - trades the son has himself pursued when down on his luck. It
was seeing Tarzan in the cinema that decided his life for him.
'I wanted to play Tarzan and I did it. There was a place in Paris where they
had trapezes, large and small, and you could go in and spend all day there
for 50 centimes. There was no safety harness, no teachers. You did it by
yourself. Sometimes trapezistes looked in and gave you tips.
'After four or five years you got to learn something. Then I was asked to
join a troupe. I never thought of doing anything else.'
What did your parents say?
'They didn't say anything. They were quite happy.'
Is it a vocation, then, like the priesthood?
'Perhaps. For example at the school I train some doctors. Every year I have
ten or 12 of them who train two times a week for three months. Then they put
on a show for a week to raise money for humanitarian causes. And now I have
some doctors who are no longer doctors. They've given up: they're trapeze
artists. Its unbelievable.'
So it's a sort of illness, then?
'Yes, it's like a drug. Once you've done it, you have to go on doing it.'
Another of Palacy's former pupils was a dentist specialising in false teeth.
At the age of 40 he decided to give it all up and teach trapeze: his school,
which bears Palacy's name, is in Brussels.
The two schools organise troupes to appear in festivals. 'They nearly always
win gold and silver medals. After that, they want to work in big circuses.
Everyone wants to be a flyer. But if you are big, if you are strong you have
to be a catcher. Not many want to be the catcher because people aren't
looking at him: they're looking at the flyer. But it's very important and
much more difficult to do, and it takes longer to learn.'
I asked Palacy whether the trapeze changed people and his wife answered for
him in English: 'I don't think anyone could tell you. You have to go up
there and feel it yourself.'
I mean, does it change people's character?
Jean replied: 'Yes. Very much so with children. It gives them much more
self-confidence, much more balance. Schoolteachers have told me that they
have pupils who are not good at school but after doing trapeze they start
doing well at their books. The trapeze is very special, even in the circus.'
The film director Carol Reed captured it in his 1956 film Trapeze, a flying
love-triangle composed of Burt Lancaster, Gina Lollobrigida and Tony Curtis.
The point of suspense, I seem to remember, involved an attempted triple
somersault: would the jealous catcher (Lancaster) drop his young rival, or
the beautiful girl, to their deaths? Lancaster had himself once worked as a
circus acrobat but in the film it was Jean Palacy, then Jean Quentin, who
doubled for him on the bar.
I mentioned the triple and the professor said: 'Now they do four. When I was
in the US to prepare a troupe for the Big Apple Circus, they took me to see
the Ringling show and there the Vazquez did four and a half. I've heard, but
not seen, that there's a Russian who does five.'
Jean Quentin was married first, at the age of 19, to Josianne his flying
partner and they had a son, Patric, who works as a decorator. The marriage
broke up and Jean met Pauline, a dancer who was performing aerial routines
with a troupe of acrobats, in Spain. They formed a famous double act.
Married in 1972, they had left it too late to have children of their own so
adopted a little girl of three, Josie, who has grown up to be a model and
beauty queen.
I wondered whether so single-minded and strange a career left room for other
interests.
'Oh, yes', said Palacy, 'there are plenty of things. Music, for example. I
listen a lot to South American music. I like to do odd jobs.' (Bricoler was
the word he used.) Then he pointed to the silver rig above. 'I made all the
gear, all the trapezes myself.
'Space travel interests me; people floating in space, free-fall parachuting,
those sorts of things. I dont' read much. I do a lot of cross-words. When I
do read it's Frederic Dard's 'Saint Antonio'. He's a comic crimewriter - il
est tres drole.
'I knit as well. I make very nice pullovers. Anything to do with the hands I
like.'
He shouted to Pauline to fetch one of his sweaters from the van. She came
back with a garment of purple, grey and white stitches; it looked very
professional. 'I make them for my pupils. When I was in hospital I made
jumpers for the nurses.' He laughed.
You've devoted your whole life to this business. Don't you sometimes think
you should have done something else?
'No, I don't think so. If I had to start again I'd do the same. But I'd do
it better this time - quicker and better.'
I left Jean Palacy in his caravan, wondering whether some of our leaders
might not profit from a few lessons with Europe's leading aerobatics
professor.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Little rays of light
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS TIME for Hawks &amp; Handsaws to toss its hat into the ring and launch one
or two campaigns aimed at brightening our lives on this weary, wracked
planet. I am not talking about big things - the ozone layer, fox hunting or
pre-millennial tension. I am talking about small things, such as the
barbaric decision by England's cricket selectors not to include David Gower,
a foppish but inspired batsman, in the England team to tour India this
winter.
I have no interest in cricket. It strikes me as basically silly. But it
gives pleasure to many, and that is good. Much to its credit, The Observer
last weekend launched its RGC - Restore Gower Campaign. What caught my eye
was the quote from a Gower supporter who said: 'Gower is the gifted
non-conformist being rejected by the puritans out of a mixture of animosity
and jealousy. They don't like his casual approach and especially the fact
that he can appear casual and still perform at the highest level.'
That won my vote at once. Indeed, so impressed was I by the RGC that I am
keen to organise something of my own. All week I have been locked in policy
talks with the advisers who shape and mould this column. Some of them you
know: Miss Lee, my executive assistant; my agent, Harriet Halfshare; Juliet
Fetherbrayne, who handles my PR; and Sheikh Walli Al-kaljabi, who advises me
on asset management and what the rich are thinking.
The first idea we pondered was also the most obvious, an NLHNLC - Numerous
Long Holidays for Norman Lamont Campaign. Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer would be a suitable candidate for our largesse, for Hawks &amp;
Handsaws was the first column to suggest that his tenure might not be
long-lived. We have since realised that Norman's grip on office is
indissolubly linked to the prime minister's fate. They will hang together,
or prosper and survive. In the meantime, numerous long holidays for Norman
Lamont could cause as much rejoicing as the reinstatement of David Gower.
The next idea we considered was the FSRNSWNASASETIPCUTC - Find Something
Really Nice to Say When Nasa's Seti Programme Comes Up Trumps Campaign. On
October 12, Columbus Day, at 3pm Atlantic Standard Time, Nasa astronomers
will launch their 10-year Seti programme, or Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence. The project has full Nasa mission status.
Astronomers like Jill Tarter, Seti's top scientist, envisage a galactic
community of intelligent civilisations that are too far apart to 'socialise,
colonise or cannibalise one another,' as Life put it this month, but which
communicate via radio messages. The key question is this: once we detect a
message, what will we say in reply? We cannot let the rest of the galaxy
know what pigs we are; I suppose we will have to lie.
Another idea my advisors are toying with is a GNKIEC - Get Neil Kinnock Into
Europe Campaign. We like Neil Kinnock, and support his proposed appointment
as a European Commissioner. What lends weight to this idea is the remark of
Sir Teddy Taylor MP, a leading Tory Euro-sceptic, that Kinnock 'could
actually do a great deal more for the EC than some of the Euro-twits
regularly seen in Brussels.'
A fourth idea was the COJGCPPM - Campaign to Organise a Jolly Good Christmas
Party for Princess Margaret - on the grounds that the old duck must be sick
of being portrayed as a faded appendage of the House of Windsor; must be
worried by the growing cross-party clamour for royal pay cuts, and anyway
likes nothing so much as a knees-up.
Other potential crusades we are contemplating include the NMJANMC - No More
Jokes About Nigel Mansell Campaign; and the CEMBPBPAWPWLNH - Campaign to
Ensure that More Big Premium Bond Prizes Are Won by People Who Live in
Notting Hill.
Once you get going, all manner of opportunities for casting little rays of
light across the planet's doomed and pitted surface spring to mind. So here
is a competition: readers have until Friday October 2 to send me two
proposals, plus short explanations, for LRLAPDPS's - Little Rays of Light
Across the Planet's Doomed and Pitted Surface.
Send them to Hawks &amp; Handsaws, Weekend FT, Number One Southwark Bridge,
London SE1 9HL. The judges will be gifted individuals, and a prize will be
awarded.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Aux armes, citoyens: Andrew Adonis wants a British
referendum on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM convinced there is something in the British psyche that despises
democracy. It is not just cynicism about politics: we want to be led and
governed, and short of a poll tax will submit to the most harebrained
nonsense coming from a minister.
Yet watching the citoyens prepare to exercise their sovereignty, even I am
amazed that the British public should be so blase at the democratic enormity
of enacting the Maastricht treaty without even a semblance of popular
consent.
To John Major, it is a special British quality. 'Uniquely in the Community,'
he boasted to an assemblage of Eurocrats in London last week, 'we in Britain
will scrutinise the (Maastricht) Bill line by line, clause by clause and
vote on it in the same way.'
But 'We in Britain' are the 651 MPs. In case any of the applauding throng
missed a heartbeat by thinking that we might include us - you and me - the
prime minister spelt it out: 'I believe myself that this - Parliament's
unique scrutiny - is a more effective scrutiny than referenda where many
votes may be cast on matters wholly unrelated to the Treaty.'
Were the issue not so grave, we might be forgiven for thinking this another
of Major's elaborate jokes - you know, like 'there is going to be no
devaluation.' One can just picture the Community's leaders wise-cracking
over a jolly week-end of treaty making. ('Submit it to the people? Ha ha]
Who knows what might they might be thinking about in the polling booth] Come
to think of it, isn't that true of elections too, Helmut?')
Other jokes in the same speech give credence to the charitable view. Such
as: 'The Maastricht Treaty is a product of compromises by 12 nations.' Silly
us, who thought it was 12 governments who negotiated the treaty, subject to
the consent of their nations afterwards.
To be fair, Major's slip was Freudian. For in Britain, the all too serious
truth is that the government is the nation so far as European Community
affairs are concerned.
However long they waffle on about the lines and clauses, MPs are not able to
change a dot or comma of Maastricht. It would fall if they did. They can
give only a straight vote for or against - which makes ratification an
ideally simple issue to put to a referendum.
If the French people give them the chance, it is a foregone conclusion that
Britain's MPs will vote 'yes'. Whisper it not, but many will cast their
votes on matters wholly unrelated to the Treaty. Three-line whips are not
the best incentives for objective scrutiny. Some Tories opposed to the
treaty will vote for it out of party loyalty; others in the hope of
promotion; a few so as not to endanger that constituency favour or foreign
trip.
True, we had a general election. But with all three parties agreed on
Maastricht, it offered precisely zero choice on a single European currency
and common Community foreign and security policy. The parties engaged in a
conspiracy of silence.
So British ratification of Maastricht will be no more than Major assenting
to his own treaty.
Only a referendum will prevent that democratic fraud. Maastricht is among
the most significant changes to the UK constitution this century. Parliament
should not agree to it without a positive expression of the electorate's
will. Since the election manifestly failed to provide one, a referendum is
imperative.
Forget the 'parliamentary sovereignty' wails. If we are indeed a democracy,
MPs have no moral right to reshape our constitution if they have good reason
to believe a majority of citizens may be opposed to them. Imagine the outcry
if, in response to the current titbits, the government next year tried to
abolish the monarchy.
Yet a currency union is of far more constitutional significance than the
survival of the monarchy - as this week's turmoil should have brought home
to the meanest mortgagee.
Moreover, the referendum is not foreign to Britain. Internationally, it is
increasingly employed as a democratic hurdle for major constitutional
change. There are only four democracies in the world which have never used
one for that purpose: India, Israel, Japan and - did you guess? - the
Netherlands.
I would vote 'yes' should we be asked our view. Britain is already part of a
federation, and Maastricht, for all its shortcomings, is necessary to
strengthen and codify it.
Nothing, though, is more calculated to generate bitter disillusion with the
Community, even to destroy it, than to impose it on the voters by royal
decree.

<TEXT>
IN GENERAL things get worse if a sensible policy is attempted. The week
started with a rush of brains to the head when the Bundesbank and others cut
interest rates and devalued the lira.
That seems a long time ago now, but the German move was overshadowed by
later events. It should have meant the end of the crazy myth foisted on us
by the markets. It runs thus: the D-Mark is supreme because of high German
interest rates. Those rates are high because of the huge expense involved in
financing the reconstruction of the old East Germany.
So the lesson is that if you want a truly powerful currency you have to take
over a totally bankrupt, broken down economy a tenth the size of your own.
Ireland does not match these demanding conditions but if Britain were to
attempt to re-absorb even that not wholly unsuccessful economy into the
Union one would not expect sterling to go through the roof.
It all comes down to the Bundesbank, we are told. Its role had been to
ensure that the experience of financing unification is as painful as
possible, not just for the government which had carried it out in defiance
of the Bank's wishes but for everybody. So an interest rate went to 75 per
cent and then 500 per cent in Sweden. The reason is that the Germans alone
were paying for unification  - had the rest of the Community stumped up a
few billion, German interest rates could have come down much earlier. So the
Bundesbank banged its friends' heads against the wall in a determined
attempt to let us all share in the German experience and bribe it to go
away. A small concession meant everything else has fallen apart while the
German problem is worse than ever.
But at least the British will now pay a quarter per cent less on their 10bn
Ecu loan to shore up the pound, even if it costs another billion or so in
pounds to pay it back. That loan is interesting for legal reasons: it will
be used to help cover the large the budget deficit. In the Maastricht
Treaty, Britain says it 'funds its borrowing requirement by the sale of debt
to the private sector' (see the Protocol on certain provisions relating to
the UK).
How that statement can be squared with borrowing from German state banks is
hard to see. It is fortunate that the Maastricht Treaty is not in force,
otherwise we would never be able to meet its demand for currency stability.
Tomorrow France votes on British public debt sales and even on Danish
legislation on second homes (yes, that appears in the treaty too). It is an
interesting thought, in view of the likely narrowness of the outcome, that
the referendum could be settled by a few hundred Frenchmen who are worried
about their holdings of British government stock and who are considering
buying a summer cottage in the lee of Elsinore castle.
But there is one item that should sway a few votes into the Yes camp:
Article 130 deals with 'maintaining competitive markets' and states that
regulations 'shall be aimed at encouraging an environment favourable to
co-operation between undertakings.' Which of course has always provided the
basis of French competition policy.
But in the end the French may vote No because they fear for the future of
Camembert or hate the government. It is hard on President Mitterrand,
because France has been the best run country in the Community since around
1983. Inflation is low, the balance of payments is in surplus. The awful
level of unemployment, come boom or slump, is the one blot on the landscape,
but the French are lucky to have only one blot when the rest of us have to
put up with half a dozen. None of last week's craziness can be blamed on
France. But if the French are sensible tomorrow, all of next week's will be.
European unity is dear to heart of the Frankfurter Allgemeine. It carried a
report of last Sunday's, as always nationalistic, Last Night of the Proms in
London which was seen live by German viewers. 'It is fine, in our Europe,
how far the bows stretch,' wrote Hans Scherer, 'from the unbounded happiness
of the British to the over-enthusiasm of the Sicilians, each jealously
guarding its national idiosyncracies. But on the other hand there is the
recognition that superficial observations about national character do not
work. Thus one cannot really imagine us Germans waving little flags . . .
and we are energetically working so that we never will.'

FT  19 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: In tune with musical history -
Nick Garnett meets a man who rebuilt Beethoven's piano and dreams that
Chopin is a client
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT

<TEXT>
FOR A man brought up in the freeway-riven urban sprawl of Los Angeles, the
view from David Winston's office still gives him some amusement. A straggle
of ducks aimlessly waddles past the front door. In the field alongside,
horses graze and rabbits gambol near the hedgerow. The remains of an ancient
wooden hop press protrude from a clump of grass and weeds.
In a converted oast house in the Kent countryside, Winston practises his
esoteric yet practical trade. Winston and his team of three restore old and
sometimes famous pianos and build reproductions of them, hand-crafting to
the finest detail components rooted in early 19th century technology.
On one floor of Winston's studio-workshop, a large central table is littered
with technical drawings. These are being used to recreate - for two
reproductions - the innards of a piano built in Vienna in 1823 by Joseph
Brodman, one of whose apprentices, Bosendorfer, gave his name to an Austrian
piano maker still in existence. In a corner stands an 1884 instrument made
by the English maker, Broadwood and used by Chopin on his last tour of
Britain. Part of it is in pieces.
Another English piano, a Stodart made in the 1830s when Britain boasted the
world's biggest pianoforte industry, is being restored at the far end of the
studio for its owner, the National Trust. It was once owned by Mendelssohn.
Downstairs, another 30 or 40 old instruments, most of them for sale prior to
restoration, are in various states of disrepair. They include a peculiar
looking cabinet piano - literally a grand standing on its head. There are no
uprights. 'I do not consider them real pianos,' Winston says.
'Pianos like these are treated as antiques here. Plenty of people can
install new components and the piano works, but it is wrecked as an
original, leaving it with little value. Sometimes I will even say to a
customer that if he wants an instrument's wood stripped and polished then I
am not prepared to do it.'
Winston took a degree in landscape architecture then trained in the US for
seven years with first a violin maker and then a harpsichord maker. He
married a British woman and set up his business in Britain in 1984 using
Pounds 300 capital and renting an old stable. He moved into the quite
sizeable oast house three years ago, paying Pounds 10,000 a year for the
lease. 'In this business, you cannot make a living unless your overheads are
low. If you have normal overheads you can forget it as a business. I would
not be able to get the lease at this cost in London.'
Winston says his venture, the Period Piano Company, has been growing at
about 15 per cent a year but this year's expected turnover of Pounds 130,000
is well up on last year's Pounds 80,000. This is because he has shortened
the waiting list, although it is still over six months, and increased
margins. The recession has hurt the company's direct piano sales, most of
which are instruments which Winston buys in various states of ill-health. He
sells these battered pianos on the basis that the price includes restoration
work. Restoring instruments is threequarters of his business, up from 50 per
cent in the late 1980s.
The company produces a pre-tax return of 15-20 per cent. This is after
Winston and his wife, Amanda, who also works in the business, take out
salaries allowing a 'modest' living. Winston drives a BMW estate.
Winston was selected to restore the piano Broadwood gave Beethoven in 1818
and which the composer played until it nearly fell apart. Restoration of the
instrument - insured for Pounds 5m and later owned by Liszt - was done in
situ in Budapest. The reputation this brings helps Winston sell
reproductions. His company is making two 'copies' of the Brodman, one
selling for Pounds 17,000, the other, started later, for Pounds 25,000.
Clients for such reproductions are usually professional musicians. Most of
the business seems to arrive by word of mouth.
'The price for a reproduction compares with perhaps Pounds 40,000 and
upwards for an original of this order in perfect condition. Some of the ones
I have downstairs might sell for perhaps Pounds 10,000 or so after
restoration. A brand new grand from Japan might cost Pounds 8,000 but that
depreciates like a Lada. I think modern pianos are over-priced and mine are
under-priced.'
He would say that, you might think. But purchasing a restored or
reproduction piano, apart from its retention value, also allows the buyer to
pay in stages with an up-front payment of usually no more than Pounds 3,500.
Reproductions are only made on commission. Winston travels to continental
Europe to buy old instruments, sometimes paying no more than a few thousand
pounds.
Restoration and the making of reproductions bring Winston and his team into
a micro-world of specialist component suppliers. Nineteenth century pianos
use iron strings with a total pull of perhaps 4,000 kilos whereas modern
ones use cast steel with a tension of maybe 15 tonnes. The work can be
extraordinarily fiddly. Each of the scores of hammers and dampers in a piano
are made of several components which have to be glued, pinned and, in
places, covered with leather. The Period Piano Company uses a small number
of powered working tools.
Old pianos with their iron strings produce a clearer, more taut and less
homogeneous sound. 'Part of the reason is that the strings are almost at
breaking point.' But reproductions are often better, Winston argues. 'The
frames of orginals can be distorted and twisted and their insides can be
quite crude. There is often nothing fancy inside. The makers, after all,
were businessmen. They had to make a living.'
Winson says he too has learnt to be a businessman. 'Managing cash flow is
difficult. If someone is late in making a payment I cannot put a piano into
the bank account. The company is also labour intensive. I have learned to
insist on rigid contracts with customers. Learning how to estimate costs
takes time but I've now built up a book of jobs which I hold on computer.'
One bonus of restoring famous pianos is the chance to mix dreaming with
earning a living. 'I like to think Beethoven and Chopin and Liszt were
clients of mine.'

traditionally, where the first show of economic recovery is evident -
directors at four companies have been buying.
Sir Oswald Davies, a non-executive director of AMEC, purchased 50,000 shares
at 59.5p while the chairman, chief executive and finance director of Taylor
Woodrow all acquired shares at prices between 36.5p and 41p. The company had
announced interim results earlier this week.
Newman Tonks, the building materials group, has seen its share price fall
from over 160p at the beginning of the year to about 90p. Both the chief
executive and finance director bought a total of 25,008 shares at 94p.
At Norcros, another building materials and property group, the entire board
of eight purchased stock at prices between 73-74p, thus increasing their
holdings by a fairly sizeable proportion.
Fisons, in the health and household sector, reported interim results
affected by continuing problems of supply and regulation in the
pharmaceutical division. The chairman bought 26,500 shares at 151p, which
now accounts for the majority of his holding.
Shandwick, a public relations company, saw sizeable buying by three
directors at prices between 2.75-3.25p. Since the end of last year, the
share price has collapsed from around 140p. But following the announcement
of director dealing, the price rallied to 5p and director activity has
continued.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE BUSH,the US president, is not the only one to promote family values
this year. TSB Group, the UK bank, is offering a 'family bonus' to encourage
several members of the same family to open savings accounts.
However, the TSB is taking a rather more liberal view of the term 'family'
than would be popular in the Republican party. Unmarried couples are as
entitled to benefit from the bonus as lawfully wedded ones. Terry and Julian
can join as well as Terry and June. Indeed, TSB will welcome any group of
eight or fewer who want to register as a family - there will be no checking
into their antecedents.
The bonus will work by treating, for interest rate purposes only, the
several accounts of separate family members as one big deposit. Because
savings accounts have a 'banded' structure, with higher rates for higher
deposits, this should mean increased returns for all family members.
Say Mr and Mrs Smith, and their children John and Jane, each have Pounds
1,500 in TSB's 60 day notice account. Each deposit would normally earn 8.2
per cent in gross annual interest, the rate TSB pays on amounts between
Pounds 500 and Pounds 4,999.
Under the new scheme, the accounts are treated as if they were each one big
deposit of Pounds 6,000. Each family member would thus earn 8.5 per cent
gross, the rate TSB pays for deposits between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 9,999.
TSB insists there will be no loss of privacy. Each account will be kept
separate, and family members will only be made aware of the total account
balance, not the individual components.
There are some limits. The maximum band into which family accounts can move
is the Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 49,999 range; so any individual with a
balance of more than Pounds 25,000 will not benefit from the scheme,
although other members of their family might. The products which qualify for
the scheme are the 60 day notice account, the flexible savings account and
FirstSave.
The aim for TSB is to attract additional retail deposits and to establish
brand loyalty among their existing accountholders. The bank says it is only
aware of one other scheme (in Canada) which is run on the same lines.
The scheme will be launched in October, with an advertising slogan 'Now
Everyone in the Family Counts for More'. It cannot be long before some
politician pinches the line.
                         *       *       *
THE INLAND Revenue has issued Form 18 for married couples who wish to apply
to transfer all or half of the basic allowance of Pounds 1,720 to the wife.
It should be returned before April 6 next year.
Full details are available in leaflet IR80.
                         *       *       *
UNIT-LINKED life assurance products show a worrying variance in performance,
according to a survey for Money Marketing by the actuaries Clay &amp; Partners.
It also provides further evidence that with-profits bonuses are likely to
fall, and casts doubts on the rules for disclosure of costs currently being
used by Lautro, the life assurance regulator.
The survey includes details of the full range of unit-linked life assurance
investment products - maximum investment plans, personal pensions, and the
old Section 226 policies.
Performance varies widely within and between companies, suggesting that
switching between funds needs to be done very carefully.
On maximum investment plans, on a monthly premium of Pounds 70 over a
10-year period, Standard Life has the highest maturity value for a managed
fund with Pounds 13,479, while Target Life comes last with Pounds 9,563.
For single premium bonds, the best performer over five years is London &amp;
Manchester's property fund with an increase of 63.97 per cent.
Cash and - perhaps surprisingly - property funds dominate the list of best
funds over this time period, while Far East and Japanese funds have been
worst.
With-profits pay-outs are much higher than equivalent unit-linked contracts,
suggesting that with-profits bonuses have not yet come down by enough
accurately to reflect market performance over the last five years.
The average Pounds 35 per month 10-year with-profits endowment had, at March
1 this year, paid out Pounds 8,290. The average UK managed unit-linked MIP
made Pounds 6,009, while the total variation in all unit-linked MIPs was
from Pounds 8,636 - still barely above the average with-profits - to Pounds
3,001.
Clay &amp; Partners also sounded a warning on pension charges. The survey says
that the reduction in yield on an average single premium personal pension
for someone aged 59 would be 7.5 percentage points. According to Lautro,
this figure is only 6.21 per cent. This sounds unimportant, but these
figures show how much charges would deduct from an annual yield of 10.75 per
cent. If Clay &amp; Partners are right, charges would gobble this down to 3.25
per cent - below the rate of inflation. Beware the small print.
                         *       *       *
STOCK MARKET analysts take many factors into account when assessing shares,
but rarely mention one of the factors most useful to private investors - the
perks made available to shareholders.
The Savers Organisation, administered by Hargreaves Lansdown, Bristol BS8
(0272-767767), has now published a booklet, Attractive Perks for UK
Shareholders. Some of the advantages which can come with share-ownership
make the current market look very good value.
For example, all shareholders in The Savoy Hotels have a 10 per cent
discount on accommodation at a range of hotels, including The Savoy and
Claridge's. Whitbread last year offered all its shareholders a discount
equivalent to Pounds 45 on purchases of Pounds 300. If you believe in the
product . . .
                         *       *       *
SMALL COMPANY shares have finally escaped from their downward spiral. The
prospect of lower interest rates, which pushed up the FT-SE 100 by over 250
points in 2 1/2 days this week, allowed smaller stocks to rally. The Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies Index rose 1.4 per cent to 1009.02 over the week to
September 17; the County Small Companies Index increased by a more modest
0.1 per cent to 790.0 over the same period.

STIMULATED BY the archaizing Cobbett Prize for English chamber music, the
student Britten wrote two short single-movement Phantasies, the second of
which, his Op. 2, for oboe and string trio (1932), was the opening item of
Nash Ensemble's 20th century concert (second in a series of four sponsored
by IBM) at the Purcell Room on Thursday. Oboe soloist (but the part does not
steal the limelight) Gareth Hulse, violinist Marcia Crayford, violist Roger
Chase and cellist Christopher van Kampen revealed the work as a taut and
flagrantly impassioned sonata argument, an achievement of extraordinary
precocity. Their performance was notable alike for warmth and biting
immediacy; and they found a great deal of colour in the music's frugal
textures.
The other works on the programme (apart from Britten's Op. 93 cantata,
Phaedra, for mezzo and small orchestra, with which the concert ended) had a
Cobbettish character, two of them taking the string trio and adding a
contrasting instrument, the other, Ravel's severe, searching but very
felicitously devised Sonata for violin and cello of 1920, subtracting an
instrument. The latter piece was realised by Crayford and van Kampen with
compelling brilliance.
The nine-minute single movement of Colin Matthews's Three-Part Chaconne for
the three strings and left hand piano was ideally Cobbettish in its declared
use of the 17th century form; but gaily splashed with bass notes from the
improvisatory piano (Ian Brown) this chaconne sounded nicely offbeat and
modern: the piano takes off into a typical Matthews toccata towards the end.
Jonathan Harvey's new and specially commissioned Lotuses puts a flautist
(Philippa Davies) with a string trio that often plays in flautando mode (ie.
in harmonics), and indeed sports a variety of unorthodox performance
techniques, to create a 20-minute ethereal dance of a piece, very free and
bright and spiritual. Perhaps Harvey's vigour of invention here was
unequally matched to his New Ageism; but there were delectable moments,
particularly as afforded by that most breathily seductive of instruments,
the bass flute.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Cultures before Columbus - An ancient art with a
modern feel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE quincentenary of Columbus's landfall in America has been the source of
considerable soul searching in the US. While mainstream Mr and Ms America
may be happy to celebrate Europe's Transatlantic leap, the original new
worlders (not to mention the watchdogs of political correctness) are
demanding apologies and penance for the devastation which the 'white gods'
from the east wrought on the indigeous peoples they encountered.
There is then a timeliness in The Art of Ancient Mexico, a fascinating and
worthy celebration of the arts of the Olmecs, Mayas, Aztecs and other
cultures which dominated Mesoamerica for some 3,000 years before the arrival
of the Spanish. The works have been assembled from the major public
collections of Mexico, judiciously supplemented by the British Museum
(Museum of Mankind).
It has been over 20 years since the last major exhibition of ancient Mexican
art in London, and an innocent eye is in this case not a bad way to confront
cultures at once so alien and yet visually accessible. By eliciting
reactions we normally expect only from modern western art, Precolumbian art
stoutly refuses to be approached in a narrowly archaeological or even
historical mindset.
A palma of Brancusi-like simplicity and elegance demands to be admired as
pure form, despite its presumed religious or practical function. A Totonac
sculptor carves a head in which only one half of the face is shown, the
other half left undefined and emerging from its stone casing. It is all one
can do to resist images of Michelangelo's bound figures in the Louvre. The
Chac Mool reclining on his elbows, was so thoroughly imbibed by Moore that
it seems here strangely familiar and modern. So too the Huastec sculptures
and a Veracruz jaguar mask which have a futuristic primitivism that is pure
Star Wars. Mexico can surely boast some of the most alien of all human art
and it is no accident that Eric von Daniken found here so much fodder for
his extra terrestrial dreamings.
Mayan art, widely regarded as the high-point of the Precolumbian
achievement, took the decorative and iconographic principles established by
the Olmecs in the centuries before Christ to a new level of delicacy and
refinement. Jaina ceramic figurines of a women, priests and warriors are
exquisite genre studies whose faces are to be seen all over the Yucatan to
this day. Jade was exploited to lavish effect in relief carvings and, most
spectacularly, in human masks. The so-called 'eccentric flints', fashioned
by knapping the brittle stone with extraordinary skill into bizarre forms,
remain something of an enigma. Disappointingly, there is not a single piece
of 'narrative style' Mayan pottery, in which the native American's show a
remarkable facility for two-dimensional naturalism - an unexpected foil to
the mainstream spirit of strict iconographical formalism.
One surprise is the virtual silence in which the exhibition passes over the
revolution currently taking place in Mayan studies from the decipherment of
the Mayan hieroglyphic script. Since the script is itself a pictorial code
whose understanding is intimately linked to the symbolism of Mayan art, this
new insight lifts a veil from Mayan iconography too. As in Egypt, much
ancient Mexican art needs to be deciphered in as precise and literal a way
as writing. The more official and ceremonial pieces are interspersed with
pottery and other items of everyday use, including rare wood-carvings. These
are much more spontaneous and imaginative, showing the exuberance of the
household or village craft tradition. In the human- and animal-shaped
vessels of the Colima potters lies a virtual menagerie of local wildlife and
domestic scenes - a baby, an emaciated hunchback, an acrobat - keenly
observed with real sympathy and inventively adapted to shapes that can also
function as vessels.
The show has been laid out with a keen eye for design and lighting, with
adequate wall tests including evocative quotations from ancient Mexican
texts. The designers have made the most of an awkward ramp at the entrance
by arranging a series of intimidating Huastec statues in sentry-like rows.
The layout of material is by regions, which only partly correspond to the
major cultural entities (Olmec, Maya, Aztec etc.) and cuts across both media
and periods. No system is perfect but this is a half-way measure which fully
serves neither an archaeological nor an artistic end.
The handsome catalogue is itself no small design achievement whose superb
illustrations provide much food for further thought and admiration. Alas the
text - a direct translation of the Spanish version - is rather idiosyncratic
in its selection of themes and suffers from the user-unfriendly focus of
academics. The short bibliography ignores most of the major English-language
studies.
The gold which fuelled the Conquistadores ravages is conspicuoulsy absent
from The Art of Mexico. This is only partly the result of the mindless orgy
in which the finest handiwork of the American goldsmiths was consigned
wholesale to the melting pot by the Spanish invaders. Unlike their South
American contemporaries, the Classic and earlier cultures of Mesoamerica did
not much value the yellow metal, importing it from the south only sparingly.
The Hayward show rightly avoids any hint of gold lust, focusing instead on
the myriad other artictic achievements of these most ill-fated of peoples.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Grown-up zarzuela - David Murray on Opera North's
production of 'The Duenna'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERTO Gerhard's comic opera The Duenna was staged for the first time at
the beginning of this year, 22 years after his death. The audiences in
Madrid and Barcelona were delighted (as was Max Loppert, who wrote about it
here); now Opera North has mounted a second production of it, which should
enjoy a similar success.
Substantial support has come from the European Arts Festival, quite rightly.
Gerhard was Catalan-born of Alsatian and Swiss parents, studied composition
under both the great Spanish nationalist Pedrell and Arnold Schoenberg,
exiled himself to England at the start of the Franco regime, and in 1947
completed his only opera - to a 1775 English text by the playwright
Sheridan, author of The Rivals.
The Duenna had originally been produced at Covent Garden as an 'opera', ie a
prose play with songs in verse. What Gerhard made of it amounted to a
'Zarzuela Grande': a larger, through-composed version of the popular Spanish
zarzuela, something between folk-operetta and musical comedy. Gerhard set
the original verses as engaging ditties, expanded a number of speeches into
serious arias and ensembles, left some minor dialogue to be spoken, and
dressed the whole in richly sensuous music, seemingly 'eclectic' -
folk-Spanish, candid touches of Falla, Meistersinger-ish meditations,
Schoenbergian chromatics, a Ravellian glitter.
Precisely because of that compendious eclecticism, the score found no favour
when the BBC broadcast it in 1949, nor at a 1951 performance in Germany. But
we are wiser now: with post-modernist ears, we can hear a composer's veering
between different idioms as no more opportunist or insincere than following
an Allegro in G with an Adagio in E-flat. Furthermore, as we know now, in
the late works that were to establish Gerhard's international reputation -
the Concerto for orchestra, and the dazzling ensemble-pieces Libra and Leo -
all those strands would be woven into a unique, utterly personal vocabulary.
In The Duenna, they were just a bit more separated. The Schoenbergian
passages lend emotional depth to Sheridan's comedy of elopements and
disguises; the open-hearted show-numbers vie with the best Bernstein; the
dancing Spanishry is instantly infectious. Antoni Ros-Marba, who conducted
the Spanish premiere, draws the best from the Opera North band here.
An eager, mostly young cast put their music across to excellent effect,
though only a couple of them can speak Sheridan's sophisticated words in
convincing style. As a fully rounded character, Andrew Shore's Don Jerome,
the heavy father, is head and shoulders above the rest (as is his wont); but
the baritone Adrian Clarke makes Don Ferdinand a colourable Regency blade,
and the two flighty heroines are fervently sung by Pamela Helen Stephen and
Susan Chilcott.
As lovelorn Don Antonio the tenor Gordon Wilson looked a dull stick (even in
the first scene, a straight lift from Barbier de Seville) but warmed
steadily to his musical role. Gillian Knight lent her seasoned wiles to the
scheming Duenna, like Eric Roberts as the risible Portuguese Jew. A hint of
Political Incorrectness there] - the production tried to pretend that being
Portuguese was worse than being Jewish, but some discomfort remained.
With spectacular help from Sue Blane's unbridledly fanciful designs, and the
more equivocal asset of a troupe of dancing mimes, the show wears a bright
face. One could still wish that the director Helena Kaut-Howson had found
more gestural detail for her principals: in the orchestral interstices of
their numbers they often looked stranded and blank, reminding us too plainly
that period-comedy needs professional actors. Still, those numb moments were
only flecks on the action; Gerhard's effervescent score was more than enough
to carry the evening.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Camp and corn rule - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE EMPEROR Hadrian
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
you remember - liked boys. No wonder, then, that he is the subject of a new
show by the all-camp almost-all-drag company Bloolips. In he comes; throws
down his sword, shield, helmet and breastplate; heaves a sigh; 'Can't stand
wars.' Now he dons the gilded laurel crown; fluffs out his long hair; preens
himself; 'Much more me.' From then on, Hadrian keepes changing from one glam
frock into another. In one soignee appearance, he wears ostrich feathers and
high heels. Now you see why the show is called Get Hur.
The Bloolips troupe loves not only camp but also corn. A servant goes to the
oracle, to fetch the priestess - 'She who sees and knows everything.' He
knocks on her door. From offstage, she calls: 'Who is it?' He gives us a
weary look and remarks: 'Not very good, is she?' Hard would he be of heart
who did not giggle at some of this tosh. Often it's as if Up Pompeii had
been carted out of the closet, as when two slaves prod a drunken corpse in a
frock: 'He's like a left over from the Praetorian Guards'
scratch-your-eyes-out Drag ball.'
From time to time, this absurd affair is a hoot - but only from time to
time. On this point, mind you, I differ from the Bloolips audience, which is
loyally pro-camp, pro-gay, happily indulgent to the whole show and doting on
lines that in 'straight' theatre would earn only a quick titter. Here's an
example. 'We've got a secret weapon.?' 'What is it?' 'It's a secret.' On
press night, this exchange - far from original - stopped the show for 10
seconds.
The Bloolips performers are happy to let the show stop as often as possible.
This is nudge-nudge theatre, far from brisk, low on energy, but full of
nods, becks, winks. It keeps sagging in between the gags. Still, some of the
gags are good. Hadrian tells the Sibyl about the way his love for the boy
Antinus grew: 'Then I began to pine and suffer - Oh, it was glorious.'
I also liked Rim and Fammy Tay Baker, the two new believers from Jerusalem,
who chant in unison: 'We believe that there is one God and his name is
Sandy.' I even joined in Fammy's song: 'Sandy, Sandy, You are so handy . . .
Give us each day our daily candy . . . Send us restraint when we're randy.'
Fammy has Dame Edna glasses and a Bronx accent. She tells Hadrian about her
god: 'Sandy will have no homosexuals with trucks - I mean, no truck with
homosexuals.' Hadrian is not amused.
Get Hur continues at the Drill Hall Arts Centre, London N1

FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Drama from Balzac to Sophocles - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLASSIC Serial this month on Radio 4 is Balzac's Pere Goriot, with
Stephen Fry as a handy Balzac and Douglas Hodge as the socially ambitious
Eugene. The eponymous Goriot is scorned by Eugene and the other lodgers chez
Vauquer, especially the cynical Vautrin (David Ross); they do not know that
his girl friends are not his mistresses but his daughters. The tale,
dramatised by David Hopkins, has not yet blossomed, despite the author's
commentary, but is doing well under Kate Rowland's direction, with a helpful
Goriot by Geoffrey Banks.
The Monday Play was Murray Watts's The Fatherland, about life in Soweto,
only it wasn't broadcast. Instead, Keith Waterhouse presented sundry
readings from comic English writing.
Still, drama-addicts like me had all the half-hours - The Food of Love by
Joanne Maguire on Tuesday, about love and diet; part three of Christopher
Lee's The House, later in the day, about Members of Parliament; the first of
six parts of Eric Williams's The Wooden Horse on Wednesday, about escaping
from a German prisoner-of-war camp; the second half of Wilde's Lord Arthur
Savile's Crime on Thursday, about predicted murder; and the last part of
Nigel Baldwin's Cordoba that evening, also about predicted murder. We can't
complain.
And Radio 3 gave Sophocles's King Oedipus on Sunday, in WB Yeats's
translation. John Theocharis directed it in his last production before
retirement (though he had directed Thursday's A Harlot and a Nun, sbout Edna
St. Vincent Millay), and he had a fine company. Robert Lindsay was Oedipus;
Dorothy Tutin, Jocasta; Paul Daneman, Creon; beside these, I admired the
Corinthian and Theban shepherds of David Ryall and Cyril Shaps, their speech
so ably contrasted with the magisterial delivery of the higher-ups. However
often you hear the legend, it never palls.
Last week Radio 4 took us for a buggy-ride round the French quarter of New
Orleans. Last night the same director, Piers Plowright, gave us a bus-ride
on Radio 3, in A Bus named Desire, which naturally was centred on Tennessee
Williams. Local comment on him varied from 'Who's he?', via 'I thought he
was really dull', 'A nice man, very quiet', 'All too decadent' to 'I loved
Tennessee Williams'. There is no tramcar named Desire, or anything else, for
the streetcars have been dismantled. In any case, the Desire Housing Project
is a tricky area, where bus passengers may be robbed at gunpoint at the
terminus. A fascinating programme.
If you still long for New Orleans, Nancy Lemann, in Radio 3's Young
Americans series, called it 'very beautiful and very painful'. I was not
quite at home with this series, where young American writers talk with the
Irish novelist Timothy O'Grady and read from their work. There is too little
real intimacy, despite the personal quality of the talk. Moreover it is not
always easy to separate reading from interview.
More intimate was Tudor Parfitt's view, in Radio 4's King Solomon's Tribe on
Thursday, of the Lemba in Zimbabwe and South Africa, who claim to be Jews,
stemming from 'Sena'. The prophet Nehemiah, who gave much space to nominal
rolls when he was not building walls, wrote in his Chapter 7, verse 38, 'the
children of Senaah, three thousand, nine hundred and thirty,' but did not
record their having emigrated southward.
The Lemba are based in Soweto. They wear black skull-caps, circumcise babies
rather than youths, even use a six-point star flag. They claim no close
relationship with Ethiopia's Jewish Falasha, though both tribes observe
Jewish kosher laws. Some of the Boers thought the land they gained after the
Great Trek was the Promised Land, so the Lemba must watch out for ethnic
cleansing.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc edges close to floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK OF FRANCE intervened heavily to support the franc yesterday after
continuing tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism forced the
currency close to its floor against the D-Mark, writes James Blitz.
On Thursday, the franc touched its ERM floor of FFr3.4305, as the market
continued to assume that Sunday's Maastricht referendum in France could
produce a No vote, bringing European Monetary union to an end. Yesterday the
Bank of France intervened in the foreign exchange markets for the second day
running in an operation which dealers described as 'substantial.'
The Bank also briefly suspended its 5-10 day lending facility, a move which
pushed short term lending rates up to 20 per cent - although some dealers
said that rates were as high as 80 per cent at one stage. The facility was
later re-introduced.
Analysts said that the French operation had been extremely successful. 'The
French managed to hold the franc without pushing up bank lending rates, a
move which would have produced more No votes in the referendum,' said Mr Jim
Hall, an economist at Swiss Banking Corporation in London. The franc closed
at FFr3.4230 to the D-Mark, 0.75 centimes above its floor.
The Irish punt was also under pressure, trading close to its floor of
DM2.6190 to the punt. As in France, market interest rates went up as
pressure on the currency continued, with some dealers suggesting that
overnight rates were being measured in 'thousands of percent.' In London, it
closed at DM2.6525 to the punt.
The fate of the mechanism probably depends on the result of the Maastricht
referendum in France tomorrow. 'If there is a Yes, the French, the Germans
and the Benelux countries will probably do their best to hold the ERM
together,' said Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai
Banking Corp in London. But the market has seen how fragile the EMS is and
it will be hard to restore credibility.
Pressure on sterling was intense following an interview with Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK Chancellor, in which he cast doubt about the prospects of an
early return by sterling to the ERM. The pound is probably no longer
overvalued against the D-Mark when trading competitiveness is taken into
account. But there was heavy selling of sterling by big investment funds
yesterday, and the trend could still be downward. 'If we get a total about
turn in UK economic strategy, the pound will come under pressure, going
perhaps as low as DM2.50,' said Mark Austin. Sterling closed 3.75 pfennigs
down against the D-Mark at DM2.6125.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut discounted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER Thursday's concern about the liquidity shortage in the sterling cash
market, rates eased sharply yesterday, as expectations rose about an early
cut in UK borrowing costs.
The Bank of England provided a temporary facility of between Pounds 3bn and
Pounds 5bn to a group of banks, gilt-edged market makers and the five
biggest building societies to help remove the massive shortage that was
created by the Bank of England's intervention in the foreign exchange
markets on Wednesday.
Despite the facility, a shortage of Pounds 3bn was forecast by the Bank of
England yesterday . Most of this was removed by the buying of repurchase
agreements and short dated bills at rates compatible with 10 per cent base
rate.
In the interbank market, 3 month money closed at 9 5/8 per cent and the 1
year rate at 9 per cent. 1 month money still closed as high as 10 1/4 per
cent on the offered side, but the nearer maturities cannot move far because
tight credit conditions will probably continue.
Trading in the cash market was thin because few dealers want to take
positions in a climate where rates could be cut sharply at any moment. 'Now
that the UK is out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, it will be far easier to
cut rates,' said a trader at a UK clearing bank. 'But the government may cut
rates by less than people want, to keep inflation down.' However, many
traders now believe that the Maastricht referendum will have no impact on
rates next week.
Trading in sterling futures reflected the expectation of a cut in base rates
next week. At one stage the December contract was 67 basis points up from
its previous close at 91.95, but later subsided to close at 91.60. On a
strict interpretation, this assumes that 3 month money at the end of the
year will be at 9.4 per cent, a full percentage point lower than it was at
the start of the week. Trading in the December contract was very high at
over 70,000 lots.
The Bank of England cancelled the regular weekly tender yesterday because it
would have compounded unprecedented pressures washing back from the
authorities' recent massive purchases of sterling in the currency markets.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The Long View: From Madrid to Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELDOM CAN a British government's economic policies have collapsed so
completely as happened this week. And seldom can the disaster have been so
richly deserved.
The approach was wrong from the beginning. Only if the British economy had
been aligned with its Continental counterparts before joining would there
have been any great hope of permanent integration. Margaret Thatcher
understood that with her 'Madrid conditions', which were ultimately ignored.
In the event the Treasury chose, in October 1990, a central exchange rate of
DM2.95 which was intended to help depress UK inflation (then an alarming
10.9 per cent).
As I put it that month in this column: 'We have entered the ERM as a refuge
from the renewed burst of inflation and devaluation which would otherwise be
inevitable.'
The exit from the ERM threatens to bring about the kind of shock for savers
which I warned about two weeks ago. Inflation over the next year could
easily be 6 or 7 per cent, wiping out High Street deposit returns net of tax
even if money market rates stay at 10 per cent. Gilts have become
substantially higher in risk, without the shelter of ERM membership.
The equity market predictably celebrated, and institutional fund managers
will be relieved that they stuck to their heavy weightings of equities
throughout the two years of ERM membership. During that period there was
substantial outperformance by bonds, in sharp contrast to strong equity
growth typical of much of the postwar period.
There were, of course, always doubts about John Major's timing and staying
power over ERM entry. Perhaps the government might have hoped for better
luck with German interest rates, although in late 1990 it ought to have
foreseen what might happen in the wake of unification.
But in the end the huge burden of personal and corporate indebtedness would
surely have brought sterling down. The economic impact of this debt mountain
is essentially what has triggered this week's U-turn, even more than the
French referendum on Maastricht. The markets finally decided that the high
interest rate strategy was impossible to sustain. In those circumstances to
try to defend sterling with 15 per cent rates showed extraordinary lack of
judgment.
Now we have to cope with the renewed burst of inflation and devaluation. It
will not be at all pleasant. But a recession is the best time for a
devaluation, and on balance we should be optimistic. A real disaster of
economic decline and financial collapse was threatened by the strategy which
Norman Lamont was pursuing until Wednesday this week. Now there is an
opportunity for a different chancellor to strike off in a new direction.
There is an obvious parallel with the 1930s, when after devaluing in 1931
the UK achieved quite reasonable economic growth (and the stock market
doubled between 1932 and 1936).
But the inflationary consequences will be significantly worse this time:
there is no sterling area to shelter us. Within the ERM we were still
running an underlying inflation rate of about 4 per cent. We can forget
about John Major's zero inflation, and about the 2 to 3 per cent to which we
might have aspired if the sterling-DM parity had held indefinitely. Will we
go back to the 6.9 per cent average of the 1980s or to the 10.3 per cent
which was the average over the whole period of floating from 1972 to 1990?
We cannot begin to guess until a new, independent monetary policy emerges.
There remains a danger that the debt burden that has forced the UK out of
the ERM will force sterling much lower still. The quickest way to eliminate
debt is by inflation. In 1975 nearly 20 per cent of the debt burden was got
rid of in this way.
As for 1992, the Americans have cut short-term interest rates to 3 per cent
and the UK is in much the same economic and financial plight. With
unemployment still racing ahead the political pressure to bring interest
rates down will intensify. We shall not, however, be given any honest
warning of an inflationary change of strategy: the official method of
presentation is always that devaluation should be blamed on speculators (and
possibly on malevolent foreign central bankers) but certainly not on the
inflationary policies that caused it.
Our problems date back to long before we entered the ERM. Between 1984 and
1988 the UK enjoyed a prodigious economic boom during which gross domestic
product rose by 18 per cent in four years to a level which will not be
reached in 1992. The boom was largely fuelled by a debt explosion which
continued into 1989 (when the annual increase in M4 lending reached Pounds
90bn) and 1990; personal indebtedness in relation to income is still nearly
twice as high as it was ten years ago.
The government has never had a credible policy for dealing with this
problem, although with more than 1m families now financially wiped out by
their mortgages it has at least begun to take notice. A rapid rise in
nominal personal incomes would be the most attractive solution to many
politicians.
However, although we have left the ERM this is not yet 1974 or 1980
revisited. The government has to sell a lot of gilt-edged to foreigners and
will worry about the yield premium it has to concede over dollar or D-Mark
debt. At home, depositors can easily switch into foreign currency accounts
which might start to become very popular if sterling short-term rates are
brought down a long way.
Ironically the Footsie Index jumped more than 100 points on the UK's ERM
entry, then did the same when we left. There is precious little logic in
that except that shareholders may think that the more often we move in and
out of the ERM the better.

FT  19 SEP 92 / The grim legacy of the 'witches' of Salem: Three hundred
years ago 20 innocent people were executed in a frenzy of demon-hunting.
Today, Salem's ghosts still haunt us
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BRIGGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE HUNDRED years ago on Tuesday an execution took place at Gallows Hill
near Salem Village, Massachusetts, which has since haunted America's
national consciousness. Seven women and a man were hanged for witchcraft,
mainly on the evidence of a group of village girls who were apparently
suffering fits and seizures after experimenting with the occult.
These victims turned down the chance to save their lives by confessing their
guilt. Three days earlier 80-year-old Giles Cory had been crushed to death,
with stones piled on his chest, for refusing even to plead before the
special court set up to try these innocent people. Up to this point, 20 men
and women, mostly humble people, had been executed at Salem.
This started an epidemic of denunciations and arrests in nearby towns,
during which more than 100 suspects languished in makeshift jails. The Devil
was abroad among God's people in New England, many of whom came to believe
that he might deceive judges as well as witches.
Tourists who watch reconstructions of Cory's death (complete with recorded
groans) at the Salem Witch Museum may see those events as belonging to a
remote and primitive culture. Yet now thousands of people openly choose to
be witches, attending covens and practising rituals. Thousands of books for
children are about witches, either benign or terrifying. Horror movies bare
their fangs at every other cinema and fill the video shops, while books and
magazines on the occult proliferate.
Although this explosion of interest in Satanism is mostly ersatz, recent
historical research is transforming our understanding of witchcraft in the
Western past and often suggests more disturbing parallels with modern
events.
It now seems that the most famous reincarnation of the witches of 1692, in
Arthur Miller's powerful play, The Crucible, may be a misleading view of the
true cause and significance of the witch hunt. For Miller, the victims of
Salem stand for the individual conscience against theocracy and 'the
repressions of order', with explicit reference to the odious Senator
McCarthy and his anti-communist crusade in the 1950s. Now, 40 years later,
even more sinister parallels spring to mind.
Witchcraft is back among us with a vengeance when families are torn apart on
charges of Satanic rituals supposedly attested by their own children. In the
UK, a series of ritual abuse cases were supposedly discovered by social
service investigators in the Orkney Islands and then in Rochdale, northern
England. These followed an epidemic of sexual abuse cases in Cleveland in
1987. In spite of obvious differences, these cases showed a strangely
similar pattern to that in Salem three centuries before: intense questioning
of children to produce the denunciation of adults; the inner certainty of
interrogators that evil practices were widespread; passionate denials of
guilt; and failures to obey the ordinary rules of evidence.
Miller focused on the principled defiance of theocracy by John Procter, a
man who, having fallen from grace through adultery with his maidservant,
finally tore up the confession that would have saved him, thus gaining a
moral victory over his persecutors. However, the true story of the hidden
evil in Salem Village is more subtle and has only been apparent since the
publication of a brilliant book by two young American historians, Paul Boyer
and Stephen Nissenbaum, called Salem Possessed, which finally fitted the
jigsaw together.
As Miller partly understood, the central issues were to do with the nature
of the community and the power struggle between individuals within it. Salem
Village (now Danvers) was the agricultural hinterland of the thriving port
of Salem, a dependent region lacking proper institutions and struggling even
to create its own church. The community was split between those linked to
the cosmopolitan, commercial world of the town and the poorer, less
sophisticated farmers further inland. There were two rival families from the
initial settlement: the Porters, who had grown rich from the town, and the
Putnams, whose land was being subdivided among too many children.
The epicentre of the witch hunt lay in the house of Thomas Putnam, eldest
son in the third generation. His wife and daughter were prominent among the
group of 'possessed' women. It was this group which gave the crucial
evidence of witchcraft, partly to protect themselves against suspicions of
satanic practices. They cried out in court that they had been tormented by
the accused and described visions which were held to prove that the accused
had made pacts with Devil to take possession of their souls. Putnam and his
family were the main supporters of Samuel Parris, minister of Salem Village,
another man on the economic downslope. Parris's insecurities did much to fan
the blaze of the witch hunt.
Thomas Putnam was a man with many grievances, much given to unsuccessful
lawsuits. One alleged he had been cheated over his wife's inheritance,
another - the vital one - was against his stepmother and his half-brother,
Joseph. His father had left his best land to this favoured child of his old
age, who had just married into the rival Porter family, and ostentatiously
sided with them in local politics.
Although they were never directly accused, these treacherous relatives and
the Porters were the real target for the family's anger. Almost every
accused person in the Salem trials can be connected with them in some way,
just as all the accusers were Putnams and their allies. It is highly
unlikely that there was a deliberate conspiracy. Since the weak were
attacking the strong, they could only do so in surrogate form - by imagining
a diabolical conspiracy.
Resistance began to mount when charges extended to people of real substance.
By the autumn of 1692, the leading Puritan ministers in the colony and the
Governor intervened to halt the trials; those in prison were freed.
Over the next 20 years various acts of public penance would try to atone for
what the Boston minister Cotton Mather, who was consulted about procedures
for the trials, called: 'Those errors whereby great hardships were brought
upon innocent persons, and (we fear) guilt incurred which we have all cause
to bewail with much confusion of face before the Lord.' Puritans knew how to
repent with a sincerity and force rarely shown by modern persecutors.
The persecution proved a disaster for its makers. Parris lost his position
as minister and any hopes of personal recovery. Within a generation the
surviving Putnams (other than the prosperous Joseph) had sold their
dwindling property and left.
Witchcraft prosecutions had rarely been much favoured by the churches, and
played little part in maintaining their authority, in either the old world
or the new. So the analogy conjured by the modern term 'witch hunt' - with
the show trials of Stalin or McCarthy is weak. Similarly, the traditional
witchcraft the colonists had brought from England bore little relation to
modern imitations. This 'old witchcraft' still exists in parts of rural
Europe, where a belief that one is bewitched has been known to cause death.
As recently as 1976 two brothers in Orne in France shot dead the male
'witch' they blamed for their misfortunes.
Then, as now, the basis of witchcraft had little to do with formal religion.
It is in a general sense pagan, with an immensely long history. By
comparison, the persecution of witchcraft was brief; after a scattering of
early trials in the 15th century, most executions in Europe took place
between 1580 and 1650. In all between 50,000 and 100,000 people were put to
death as witches.
Between a fifth and a quarter of these were men, while midwives, always said
to be especially vulnerable, were in fact rarely prosecuted. Educated
witch-hunters played only a marginal role; they were probably no more
representative of elite opinion than the zealous pursuers of ritual Satanism
are today. Most witches went on trial because their neighbours, who hated
and feared them, blamed them for specific misfortunes - usually the deaths
of spouses, children or animals - following a quarrel. Behind it all lay not
the clergy but their rivals, the local wizards and wise-women who functioned
as witch-doctors and were skilled in making clients articulate their
suspicions.
Population growth, economic change and harvest failures made the decades
around the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries some of the harshest ever
experienced by the ordinary people of Europe. It was natural that
accusations should multiply, and this would not have mattered so much if the
reaction had been confined to counter-magic and the occasional lynching.
Unfortunately, the pressure from below coincided with a temporary decline in
elite scepticism. The reasons for this are complex, but it should be
stressed that it was very relative. Critics of witchcraft prosecutions were
numerous and soon became more vocal, as happened in Massachusetts.
Accusations of diabolical possession was seen as particularly dangerous, for
fraud was readily suspected and quite often detected. Another famous case
was that of the Devils of Loudun in 1634, where a group of 'possessed' nuns
accused a local priest who was burned at the stake.
A sober look at witchcraft in history strips away almost all the
pseudo-historical clothing in which the modern witch cults have tried to
deck themselves. Some of their rituals and gods do have origins in pagan
culture, but the witches' 'sabbat', (a nocturnal Satanic meeting) existed
only in the imaginary world of folklore.
It is striking that many of the most lurid accounts in witchcraft trials
came from children and adolescents. This should be a reminder of the danger
of accepting their testimony in modern allegations of satanic practices. One
does not care to think too long on the nine-year-old girl from Lorraine who
told stories about going to the 'sabbat' in a cart with her whole family, as
a result of which her father, grandparents, uncle and aunt were all burned
in 1602. In later years she might have whispered to her confessor something
akin to the moving words of Ann Putnam Jr. when she was admitted to church
membership in 1706: 'I desire to lie in the dust and be humbled for it, in
that I was a cause with others of so sad a calamity to them and their
families.'
It is a poignant reminder that the real evil lies within ourselves, as much
in the age of child abuse as in that of 'demonic' possession.
