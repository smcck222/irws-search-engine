FT  19 SEP 92 / Beijing to test capital markets in the west
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for the first US sale of shares and New York stock exchange listing by
a Chinese government-owned company were announced yesterday, dramatically
underlining Beijing's economic reform policies.
Brilliance China Automotive, a Bermuda-based company with a majority stake
in minibus manufacturer Shenyang Automotive, intends to raise only Dollars
70m (Pounds 39m) to Dollars 80m through an initial public share offer. But
the move is an important test, designed to establish a precedent for equity
fund-raising by state-owned Chinese businesses in the leading western
capital markets.
The Chinese could have chosen easier equity-raising routes, for example, a
private placement with large US institutional investors, but sought a full
public offering as the best means to test the western market.
First Boston, the US investment bank lead managing the offering, is also
planning to offer part of the issue in London and Zurich.
The accounting firm of Arthur Andersen has restated the company's entire
Chinese accounts to conform with US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, in an effort to satisfy the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC demands that foreign companies state their accounts in a way which
allows US investors to compare readily their performance with similar US
businesses. This has involved it in a heated dispute with the New York Stock
Exchange, which is keen to attract new foreign listings and would prefer
less onerous regulations.
Brilliance still requires SEC approval for its share offering, but the NYSE
said yesterday that it had already approved the company for a listing.
The offering consists of 5m shares in Brilliance, expected to be priced
between Dollars 14 and Dollars 16 a share.
Brilliance is owned by a Chinese government agency and is incorporated in
Bermuda for tax, legal and other reasons. The offering represents a stake of
about 14.5 per cent in Shenyang Automotive, which has an extensive
relationship with Toyota.
Its US accounts show 1991 net income of Dollars 8.4m on sales of Dollars
114.4m. It will use the proceeds for new equipment and to increase the
domestic content of its vehicles.
After the offering, Brilliance intends to apply for a listing of its shares
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where other Chinese companies are already
quoted.

President George Bush yesterday officially notified the US Congress of his
intention to sign a North American Free Trade Agreement on or after December
17, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Under US law, he must give Congress 90 calendar days notice of his intention
to sign a trade pact. In this case, Congress will have adjourned by the end
of the period. When it returns, it will have 90 legislative days in which to
approve or turn down legislation which would implement the agreement.
'The choice before us is stark  - to retreat into protectionism or move
forward to new horizons of challenge and opportunity in an expanding global
economy,' said Mr Bush said in a statement accompanying the text.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: No cheers from the Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MR Norman Lamont had bought his lunchtime sandwiches at Five Ways,
Birmingham, yesterday he would have found the reception as grey as the
drizzle. No arm round the shoulders and 'Nice one, Norm.' Rather a mix of
anxiety, anger, bewilderment and indifference as worries about the future
surfaced.
'I'm just sitting and waiting to see if my husband's still got a job,' said
Mrs Yvonne Turk, a teacher. 'Interest rates are finishing the firm off. If
interest rates go down, that's okay.'
Concern among shoppers was not so much with the technical merits of the
European exchange rate mechanism  - which many confessed they knew little
about  - but with how the government handled the currency crisis and what it
means for the economy.
Miss Karen McAuley, who works for a finance house, argued that 'it's not
done us any good going into the exchange rate mechanism  - but I don't
understand a lot of it'  - but she was more concerned about the prospects of
buying a house.
'A lot of people are wondering whether they've done the right thing by
voting the Conservatives in,' she said.
Mr Neil Halliday, an accountant, considered that the events this week were
'a disaster from start to finish'. He added: 'It was a waste of time and
money to hold sterling's value.
'The decisions (to float the currency) should have been made far sooner. The
government has certainly not covered itself in glory.'
His view was widely shared. 'Total mismanagement. Absolute shambles,'
complained Mr Roger Baker, a Conservative-voting computer-services
executive. Mr Ken Cameron, a computer installation engineer, said: 'I'd felt
for some time the pound would get devalued. It was inevitable. The
government actions were very amateurish.'
There seemed to be little inclination to pin the responsibility for
sterling's plight on perfidious Europeans. 'This country needs to be in the
front line of Europe,' said Mr Osei Nana, an acoustic consultant. But there
were mistakes in the past, he said. 'We should have devalued the pound a
long time ago. If we had done there wouldn't have been a crisis.'
Mr Cameron said: 'I don't think the Germans can be blamed for it.' The UK
government is was 'stuck in a train of thought which is out of touch with
reality'.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Smith tells Major to apologise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH last night expressed astonishment that Mr John Major, the
prime minister, had offered no apology for the government's handling of this
week's sterling crisis during a series of TV interviews broadcast yesterday.
Claiming that the fault for the week's events lay in the government's
economic policies, the Labour leader said that a more convincing explanation
for Mr Major's actions was needed 'and certainly an apology for the
incompetence which we all observed this week'.
Attacking the government for its failure to implement 'strong domestic
policies' to back up membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, he
said 13 years of Tory rule had 'caught up with Mr Major'.
He added: 'It won't do to be blaming the nasty foreigners or blaming the
system or seeking to put the responsibility on to others, because the plain
fact is that Britain has been revealed as being in the second division of
the European Community.'
Earlier, in a letter to the prime minister, Mr Smith accused the government
of taking 'the inflationary option'.
Referring to Mr Major's statement last week that 'the devaluer's option'
would be 'a betrayal of our future', he said: 'Since then you have allowed
the pound to be devalued by 10 per cent.'
He added: 'For two years you have been telling the British people that all
of the pain they have suffered from the recession  - soaring unemployment,
bankruptcies and high interest rates  - was solely designed to achieve the
the 'great prize' of zero inflation.'
The letter follows Labour claims that the government squandered Pounds 500m
of public money as part of the failed attempt to prop up the pound.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that the
money could have created 50,000 Youth Training places, as well as 10,000
more offers of Enterprise Allowance and set up a temporary programme
creating 150,000 jobs.
Leftwingers called on Labour to drop its policy of opposition to a
referendum on the Maastricht treaty.

FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Home agents say more cuts
needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS, CHRIS TIGHE and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESTATE AGENTS, battered by the impact of the recession and stagnant house
sales, are praying that interest rates will come down in the near future to
boost the housing market.
Some were reporting an upsurge in telephone inquiries yesterday as potential
clients reacted with cautious optimism to the latest market developments.
Mr Richard a Brassard of south London agents Courtenay said he welcomed the
prospect of higher inflation as a result of a weakening pound. 'The house
market will not get going unless there is inflation. The idea that you can
go on having low inflation at the cost of stagnation is crazy.'
Estate agents fear that without still lower interest rates, potential buyers
will still be unwilling to complete a deal.
In the south-west, where property values are down by an average of 35 per
cent on their peak levels of four years ago, properties are selling, 'but
only if people accept it's 1992 and not 1988', said Mr Ian Fraser of
Fulfords, an estate chain with 22 offices throughout the region.
'As long as people are prepared to accept a reasonable price, there is every
chance a property can be sold reasonably quickly,' he said.
On Tyneside, noted for its resilience in the face of long-standing high
unemployment and restructuring of the local economy, the events of the week
had little impact.
Mr Stan Morville, managing partner of Dollery Waller, a north-east agency,
said there had been a '30-minute reaction' to Wednesday's turmoil. Within
half an hour of the proposed increase in the base rate to 15 per cent, a
couple of potential buyers had rung to say they would not proceed. The next
day they phoned back to say they had changed their minds again.
'Whatever mortgage rates are, they always reach a level of public
acceptability,' he said. 'There are always those who have a need to move and
they get out and get on with it. Until this week's cock-up, we were getting
back there.'
In the London area, which has seen the heaviest fall from peak prices, every
technique is being used by estate agents to try to get the market moving,
but it is lower interest rates that would be most effective.
Ms Annie Allan of a Folkard &amp; Hayward branch in south London, said: 'The
vendor has become worldly wise and is prepared to wait . . . people are
waiting to see how much further the market is going to fall.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (8): Expansionist plans reassure the
workers - Privatisation in action: Farhan Bokhari takes a look at National
Fibres of Karachi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDE variety of industries and services are being offered for sale under
the government's privatisation programme.
Among the smallest and least profitable disposals are plants that make roti,
a thin round traditional flour bread, and which had to be closed after
making enormous losses.
Larger candidates for disposal include plants whose products include cement,
ghee (traditional edible oil extract used for cooking), motor vehicles and
tractors.
The common motive for selling them is to improve output in the public sector
where the average industrial profitability has been only 1.5 to 2 per cent
per annum.
As the programme only began last year, it is too soon to compare the
performance of these privatised companies with their previous record.
Small units such as roti plants are to be broken up and sold only for their
real estate value. But some larger factories have been bought by investors
who are now preparing to expand them.
One example of a profit-making company with prospects of growth is the
Karachi-based National Fibres Ltd (NFL), 51 per cent of whose shares were
sold in February. It makes polyester fibre and polyester filament yarn used
for manufacturing cloth by local textile manufacturers.
Last year, NFL declared pre-tax profit of Rs177m (Pounds 3.9m) , on total
sales worth Rs888m. The pre-tax profit this year has not been announced but
sales have touched Rs900m, says Mr Mohammad Jawaid Anwar, NFL's general
manager.
The company was sold to the new Schon group for Rs760m (Pounds 16m) after
bids were received in an open competition. Schon group's other investments
include an oil refinery, an air charter company, yarn spinning and stock
trading. Under the terms of the sale, Schon paid 40 per cent of the dues up
front, and the remaining 60 per cent are due to be paid over three years.
More expansion is planned to meet demand. Over the next two years, the
company plans almost to triple its capacity of polyester fibre from 12,000
tonnes a year to about 34,500 tonnes and filament yarn from 3,000 tonnes a
year to 5,000 tonnes in the same time frame.
A striking feature of the whole privatisation programme has been the
unexpected lack of resistance from labour unions.
NFL employs 900 workers and officers, in keeping with the government's
condition that there should be no lay-offs in the first 12 months after
purchase. A labour package agreed last year allowed for *something in here
(HP) *
compensation if personnel were asked to go within that period. The
government also agreed to pay allowances to unemployed workers for up two
years after their dismissal.
As a result of NFL's expansion plans, however, the company would need to
raise its workforce to 1,050 within the next two years, leaving little room
for lay offs. Mr Anwar says: 'We will be able to absorb our workers in the
expansion. We have not laid off anyone so far.'
A new labour contract was signed in May, backdated to the beginning of the
year. Under it, the company agreed to a 20 per cent average wage increase.
However, Mr Anwar expects the expansion to push sales to between Rs2.5bn and
Rs3bn after the company's expanded production capacity. That would not only
raise profitability but finance a rise in wages.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (7): Tribulation on Tyne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE south Meadowell estate, amid boarded-up properties and graffiti,
stands an occupied house set in a cottage-style garden, with roses climbing
on a trellis arch and a pitched-roof bird box, painted white.
On the same estate, near a shopping parade which looks like a war zone,
Brian and Joyce Grant are sunning themselves beside their manicured front
lawn edged with bedding plants.
The Grants have brought up two sons on the Meadowell. Aged 21 and 24 and
unemployed, the young men spend their days fishing and dog-walking. 'They
aren't in trouble: I've been blessed,' says their mother.
Last September's riots made the Meadowell estate on the edge of North
Shields internationally notorious. Recently, Mrs Grant was travelling on
Tyneside's Metro as it approached the estate. 'There was this teacher on the
train, with his class, and he said to them: 'You are now entering Apache
territory.' I was fuming. I wanted to say, we aren't all like that.'
Stigma is just one of the problems facing Meadowell residents. Others
include poverty, unemployment, crime and vandalism. To these could be added
uncertainty: as the search for a solution to Meadowell's problems enters a
new phase, the Grants have been told they are to be decanted, and their
carefully tended home demolished as part of a proposed Pounds 30m Estate
Action 'remodelling'.
Like many such deprived estates, Meadowell is initiative-rich: City
Challenge is the latest in a long line of brave new worlds.
The difference this time is that residents are being officially placed
centre stage, and even challenged to show that their grassroots knowledge
can provide more realistic, enduring improvements to their estate than
officialdom has achieved.
'Of course, I don't want it to slip back again,' said the inner cities
minister, Mr John Redwood, during a recent visit to City Challenge winners
in Tyne and Wear. 'But that is in part up to the people who live there and
the local community surrounding.'
Meadowell residents, who have been painstakingly working on a feasibility
project for a 'community village' redevelopment on the site of the community
centre burned down in the riots, have to come up with firm proposals by next
month.
As part of the Pounds 37.5m City Challenge funding awarded to North Tyneside
council in July, Pounds 8m has been allocated to the Meadowell. Projects
include a child-care training centre and a community village, which would
consist of self-build housing, workshops, projects like the 'Bangers and
Smash' motor repair scheme, and premises for the estate's successful Credit
Union and bulk-buying food co-operative.
Among the residents involved, and their many public and private sector
partners in City Challenge, there is a strong commitment to working
together. 'It's working tremendously well,' says John Foster, North Tyneside
council's City Challenge co-ordinator.
For the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, responsible for regenerating
riverside land alongside some of north-east England's most deprived housing
areas, it is vitally important that the Meadowell and the TWDC's Pounds 280m
Royal Quays dockland redevelopment, where building work has just started, do
not become polarised extremes of jobless deprivation and employed affluence.
For the private sector, which has learned to shun places like the Meadowell,
there is everything to gain if the estate can be made more attractive for
investment, and its residents more skilled. This, too, would complement the
work of the police, who have set up their own Meadowell community policing
team since the riots.
North Tyneside's City Challenge programme covers the town centres of
Wallsend and North Shields and the Meadowell and Howdon estates each side of
the A19 trunk road corridor, where there are a number of substantial
industrial employers.
The inclusion of the partly-industrialised A19 corridor, running through the
middle of the Challenge area, emphasises that the reduction of unemployment
is a key objective. But the Challenge bid recognises that in areas like the
Meadowell, where male unemployment is over 40 per cent, other work is needed
before disaffected or demoralised residents can get jobs.
As well as the Pounds 8m community village, City Challenge will bring the
estate an innovative Pounds 5m childcare training centre, designed to help
women gain childcare qualifications and offer them a good environment in
which to leave their children while they take up training or work.
But even though there is wide acknowledgement that Meadowell's problems
cannot be solved simply by spending money, the estate still needs investment
beyond City Challenge's scope.
The council's Pounds 30m Estate Action programme, in which the Cheviot
Housing Association is heavily involved, is intended to diversify housing
tenure. The government last month gave the go-ahead for the first Pounds 8m
phase of Estate Action work in the Meadowell. As part of the scheme, every
domestic property on the estate, which currently has 1,776 council homes,
will be upgraded by better security on doors and windows, energy insulation
and external environmental improvements.
Residents involved in City Challenge have the support of many local people -
but not all. The nihilism of those who, in the riots, burned down their own
estate's meagre facilities and who are still wrecking property and
threatening those who 'grass' has yet to be vanquished.
'They should get a big shed and put them in there and make them work and
stop their benefits if they don't - that would solve it,' says grandmother
Mrs Caroline Atkinson, who is disgusted at the decline of the estate where
she has lived for 40 years.
It's the kind of approach that few respectable politicians have dared
publicly to suggest - yet.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (5): Lambeth walks a tightrope -
How three City Challenge winners will spend the money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE the 1981 city riots, which shook the British establishment,
Brixton, in south London, has been synonymous with urban blight, deprivation
and racial tension.
Since Lambeth, its parent borough, also happens to be one of the two 'red
Ls' which did so much to foster Tory hatred of local government in the 1980s
(Liverpool being the other), the central/south London borough's success in
winning Pounds 37.5m to redevelop central Brixton in this year's second
round of City Challenge merits a note of its own.
If City Challenge were a competition to find the 20 most run down areas in
the country, Lambeth would win every time. It has a higher number of
unemployed than any other London borough, and nearly a third of them live in
central Brixton. The borough has the second highest proportion of lone
parents in London, a quarter (5,000) of whom live in Brixton.
Unemployment in Brixton is around 30 per cent (against 12 per cent for
London as a whole). Barely one in eight of its residents are professional or
managerial, and only one in four of its properties is owner occupied
(against 58 per cent for England and Wales as a whole in 1981).
That litany may paint too bleak a picture. The Brixton of 1981 was a whole
lot more run-down than it is today. The area directly opposite Brixton
station has been redeveloped and now looks much like any other south London
high street, featuring a large Body Shop and an attractive shopping arcade.
Relations between the police and the ethnic communities are also improved.
As for Lambeth council, its glossy, pro-business, cross-party City Challenge
would have been inconceivable in the days of 'Red Ted' Knight. Rumour has it
that the borough's far left was waiting for the bid to fail to condemn its
very attempt as a sell out; if so, its success can only strengthen the
efforts of Mr Stephen Whaley, Lambeth's moderate leader, to bring Lambeth
back into the Labour mainstream. Mr Whaley chaired the City Challenge
steering group and made a persuasive presentation to Environment Department
ministers.
The area behind Brixton station is the focus of the City Challenge
programme. The project's flagship is a P &amp; O Developments scheme to
redevelop the 230,000sq ft zone into a mixed office, retail and market area,
in conjunction with Lambeth and London Transport.
Unlike so much so-called 'regeneration' in past decades, the plan builds on
the existing community, preserving the street market and Electric Avenue's
shopping arcade, and providing for a new retail centre, office space, a
leisure centre, and a facelift for the shabby buildings and streets in the
area.
The aim, says the blurb, is 'to lift Brixton to a level where it can once
again become a self-sustaining town centre which fully meets the needs of
local people'. Whether any integral part of London needs to be fully
'self-sustaining' is debatable, but if the development brings more vitality
and business, and a greater sense of safety, to the centre of Brixton it
will have achieved enough.
That one project accounts for half of the Pounds 80m budgeted to come from
the private sector as a result of City Challenge. To match P &amp; O's Pounds
40m, City Challenge will put up Pounds 8m - without which, say P &amp; O, they
could not have contemplated going ahead with the scheme for 'some time.'
City Challenge has not just brought funding: it concentrated the council's
mind on the planning aspect, and an outline planning consent has been
granted. Mr Basil Winham, P &amp; O's deputy chairman, was a member of the City
Challenge Steering Group, and closely involved in the submission.
'City Challenge has brought the council together with the private sector in
an entirely new way,' says Ms Bernadette Mardram, an assistant director of
Housing at Lambeth, seconded to manage the City Challenge bid. 'It's been a
holistic process - a genuine coming together of businesses, the council,
local schools, the police, traders and voluntary organisations.'
Ms Mardram's office in Brixton's 'Enterprise Centre' is provided by BAT, the
tobacco and insurance conglomerate, which has also seconded an employee
full-time to work on the project. Mr Brian Hutchinson, of BAT, was a member
of the steering group and went with Mr Whaley to press Lambeth's case before
ministers. The police seconded an officer to help prepare the bid, and will
give another for the implementation.
For the rest, the programme is a compilation of 65 projects - some of them
fairly definite development plans, others little more than pious
aspirations. There is a strong emphasis on education and training:
everything from an 'attendance improvement project' (City Challenge Pounds
215,000, council Pounds 50,000), under which teaching staff will be trained
in methods to reduce truancy, to a new Careers and Employment Guidance
Centre (City Challenge Pounds 200,000, council Pounds 2.3m, Training and
Enterprise Council Pounds 400,000, Employment Service Pounds 1.3m), which
will locate the local careers service and adult guidance project in single
premises, together with the Employment Department's one-stop advice and
benefits shop, and a TEC-funded Action Planning Service.
Now comes the nitty gritty of producing an action plan and turning 'bare
bones' schemes into formal contracts. The implementation of City Challenge
will be managed by Brixton Challenge Limited, a 'hands-off' company set up
for the purpose. Lambeth will appoint only three of the 14 directors of
Brixton Challenge and, given the cross-party nature of the programme, even
they will not simply be the voice of the ruling Labour group.
Lambeth's City Challenge programme is dressed up like a corporate plan. It
begins with a 'vision', specifies objectives, then outlines strategy with
maps and statistics galore. The 'vision' is 2,000 jobs, 8,000 training
places, and turning Brixton into 'the centre of multicultural entertainment
and shopping in south London.' Watch this space.

FT  18 SEP 92 / People: Clinton-Davis appointed to AMA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Clinton Davis's election as president of the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities will add some weight to the hoarse voice of local
authorities in London.
A former EC Commissioner and long-time Labour MP, Clinton-Davis is no
stranger to local government. After a long stint on Hackney council in the
1960s, he was mayor in 1968.
However, given the parlous state of local government, some of the wits at
the AMA were pointing out yesterday that his chief qualifications for the
job lie in his other public appointment: chairman of the Refugee Council.
Created a life peer in 1990, Clinton-Davis is Labour's transport spokesman
in the Lords. His bread and butter comes from the City solicitors S J Berwin
&amp; Co, whose environment law team he heads.
The AMA represents 36 metropolitan districts, 30 London boroughs and the
City of London Corporation. With Rodney Brooke, the dynamic former chief
executive of Westminster, as its secretary, its profile is fairly high; but
with a central/local government rapprochement in full swing, anything
Clinton-Davis can do to endear it to suspicious Tory ministers will be
warmly welcomed.

FT  18 SEP 92 / American Express to cancel O&amp;Y lease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN EXPRESS, the financial services group, has abandoned plans to move
to Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project built by Olympia &amp; York in
London's Docklands.
The company's lawyers are preparing a termination notice that will cancel
its lease for 20 Cabot Square. The action stems from O&amp;Y's failure to
provide incentives agreed under the lease.
'It is our definite intention to serve the notice because O&amp;Y cannot fulfil
its contractual obligations,' said American Express.
American Express warned the developer in June that it was owed Pounds 22m at
the time Canary Wharf went into administration on May 28. The debt was
related to the fitting-out costs of the Canary Wharf building and
indemnities against continuing liability on existing premises.
At the end of June, a Canadian judge temporarily blocked American Express's
move to pull out of the project. The judge considered that the entire Canary
Wharf project could be irreparably harmed if American Express was allowed to
pull out. But at the start of this month, a Canadian court freed American
Express to serve its termination notice.
The group has not decided on a revised plan for its premises. It had planned
to bring its 1,500 staff under one roof at Canary Wharf but may stay for a
period in its present premises, which mostly have unexpired leases. Its
decision to pull out of Canary Wharf may increase the likelihood of other
tenants cancelling their leases.
Although leases have been signed on 60 per cent of the first phases, only 14
per cent of the tenants are installed.
Texaco, another prominent tenant, say talks with the project's
administrators concerning its occupancy are going well.

FT  18 SEP 92 / EC puts 10% dumping duty on chips from South Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission said yesterday it was imposing a provisional
anti-dumping duty of 10.1 per cent on memory chips from manufacturers in
South Korea.
This follows a complaint from the European Electronic Component
Manufacturers' Association, acting on behalf of Motorola's UK subsidiary,
Siemens of Germany and SGS-Thomson of Italy.
Charges were brought against Samsung, Hyundai and Goldstar. The Commission
says its two-year-long investigations showed substantial dumping margins
varying between 18 per cent and 120 per cent of the EC border price.
The memory chip prices investigated were for DRAMs, volatile memories used
in most kinds of electronic equipment including computers and
telecommunications systems. DRAMs are an important technology driver and
have significant strategic importance for the European electronics industry.
According to the Commission, Korean imports of DRAMs into the EC rose 23
times between 1986 and 1990, reaching a 25 per cent market share - or 37m
megabytes of storage - by 1990. During the period, the Commission said,
Korean producers substantially undercut the prices of Community producers.
While European producers will be relieved by the Commission's decision,
there is concern that the Commission's guidelines on anti-dumping are out of
date and inappropriate.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (6): Ever more mouths to feed - Pakistan
has chronically failed to grow enough wheat for all its people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGRICULTURE remains the backbone of Pakistan's economy. But attempts to make
the country self-sufficient in food grains continue to fall behind national
needs, creating new requirements for wheat imports.
This year alone Pakistan will import 2m tonnes of wheat, adding to the
burden on budgetary resources.
Agriculture employs 51 per cent of the workforce, only 9 per cent down from
60 per cent in 1964. Agriculture-related products earn up to 70 per cent of
export revenues.
In spite of difficulties in raising food grain production, agricultural
output last year grew by 6.4 per cent and made a 26 per cent contribution to
GDP. Growth was up from 3 per cent during the 1989-90 fiscal year and 5.1
per cent in 1990-91.
Cotton, wheat and rice account for almost 70 per cent of overall crop output
value. The remainder is sugar-cane, fruits, vegetables and other products.
Cotton output grew by 35 per cent last year largely due to incentives for
farmers, while wheat and rice production were virtually unchanged.
Last month, the government announced new incentives for cotton growers by
removing export duty.
The government also plans to increase productivity in crops such as rice and
wheat, by raising government-controlled grain prices for farmers as well as
making arrangements to provide better quality seeds and efficient
technology.
Mr Majeed Malik, agriculture minister, says: 'The price of wheat as compared
to the inputs is such that it is becoming less and less a profitable crop
and therefore people are shifting to other areas.'
Mr Malik says the government plans to set up a new framework which would
allow technology to be taken to the doorsteps of the farmer, as one way to
encourage the use of better techniques for improving output. Agricultural
experts have argued that an important obstacle to making farmers use better
techniques is that many of them are located in inaccessible areas.
Mr Malik disagrees with critics who argue that low literacy rates would make
it impossible to introduce high-tech methods.
'Although the rate of literacy is low, even the most uneducated farmer is
very keen to absorb technology. He doesn't have to read a book, he has to be
told on radio by experts,' he says.
The government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif claims to have broken fresh
ground in resolving important long term problems. Last year, the country's
four provinces and the federal government resolved a 70 year long dispute
over the distribution of water from the Indus river, one of Pakistan's main
sources of water supply for agriculture.
Eventually, the provinces expect to save between 10 to 13 MAF (million acre
feet) of water, which was earlier flowing out to the sea in the absence of a
sharing formula. In December last year, the government also announced a new
package of incentives to improve crop yields.
However, improving the performance of agriculture remains difficult. A
continuing problem is a high population growth rate of almost 3.1 per cent.
In addition, the country is still faced with the difficult issue of taxation
for farm-lands. Agricultural incomes are exempt from direct taxation, partly
due to resistance from a strong lobby of politically influential landlords.
The resistance has received additional momentum from the argument that
taxation would be unfair unless the prices for crops are set according to
international market rates rather than remaining under government control.
Mr Malik says the farmers have a point because of low profitability in the
sector.
But he also leaves the door open for generating more resources, and says
that by the end of this decade new revenues may have to be generated from
agriculture which may 'not necessarily be income tax in the same sense'.
Privately, some senior officials concede that this is among the most
difficult issues for agricultural policy makers. While the land-owners'
lobby is influential, the government is also under increased pressure from
local industrialists and businessmen who have demanded taxation for
agriculture to give the same treatment to this sector as other areas of the
economy. Eventually, a decision on this may determine the profitability in
the agricultural sector.
Finally, problems related to the pattern of agriculture have also
constrained growth potential.
According to estimates by Western development experts, Pakistan's
agriculture sector has been operating close to its limits as far as quality
of land and water resources are concerned.
But the alternative of intensive farming to increase agricultural output
requires resources which are not readily available.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (7): Good designers and technicians
needed - Textile makers recognise their flaws, and how to mend them / Even
if the textile industry were to benefit from a recovery in world trading
conditions, it would still be essential to raise the quality of its products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MANY Pakistani businessmen believe their country is set to play a greater
role in the world textile market. But they are also concerned about dull
prospects, at a time of worldwide recession and the need for Pakistani
exports to become more competitive.
Pakistan's cotton production rose by 35 per cent last year, (from 9.6m bales
to nearly 13m) largely due to fresh incentives for farmers.
There has also been a significant rise in the spinning capacity. Pakistan
had 3.8m spindles five years ago. It now has 6.2m and could have 7m next
year.
Cotton related products are of increased significance for the economy,
accounting for almost 58 per cent of exports. The higher cotton output has
convinced many businessmen that there is a big potential to produce more
higher value items, including clothing. However, there is still concern at
falling profitability due to weak demand for yarn exports.
Many leading textile producers have become increasingly aware not only of
the need to move into higher value goods, but of the problems associated
with it.
Pakistan's leading representative body of textile manufacturers, the APTMA
(All Pakistan Textile Mills Association), has recently demanded fresh
measures to increase profitability, including the removal of a local excise
duty. Its members have also decided to cut back production by 14 per cent to
cut lower surplus stocks.
Mr Tariq Saigol, chairman of APTMA, voices long-term optimism but says that
'at the moment, we are faced with imbalance in supply and demand; we have
too many goods and not the domestic market which is big enough to absorb the
increase'.
According to the APTMA, Pakistan produces approximately 1.3bn kilos of yarn
annually, of which 600m kilos are consumed locally and the remainder
available for export. The association estimates that at present, there is a
surplus of between 15 to 25 per cent.
The industry's problems were recently highlighted in a study by the Japanese
international development agency, based on a year long examination of growth
prospects.
The study is reported to have found that in the eyes of many US importers
Pakistani garments are priced and of low quality with late delivery times.
The report warned that other countries such as Bangladesh, Mauritius,
Morocco and Sri Lanka are catching up quickly with Pakistan, thanks to their
own rapid expansion and growth. It suggested that Pakistan's government and
textile industry should try to satisfy the garments trade.
Apart from market conditions, the industry also suffers from a shortage of
technically trained manpower and lack of good design. Time and money for
training are needed to rectfiy both problems.
The domestic market has a limited exposure to imported fashion garments,
which would influence the designing of marketable export goods.
The future of Pakistan's textiles industry will depend partly on
international economic conditions.
But even if it benefited from improved world trading trends, it would have
to raise its own standards.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Crueller realities of life at the top / Assessing the
political damage caused by the week's events to John Major and Norman Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major is wounded, but not fatally. The same cannot yet be said of Mr
Norman Lamont. The chancellor is to stay for now at No 11. We should not
underestimate the prime minister's loyalty to his colleagues  - witness his
stubborn defence of the unfortunate Mr David Mellor. But Mr Lamont, like the
heritage secretary, has lost the authority to go with the job.
There is no justice in the assessment. It was the prime minister who staked
his government's reputation on DM2.95. It is he who must live with the
agonising echoes of a speech just a week ago in which he likened devaluation
to betrayal of the nation's future. Mr Lamont was never in his heart
convinced there was no alternative to the ERM. He did more than was asked of
him in defending the policy.
But those who argue that he cannot be the scapegoat for the failure of the
government's economic strategy miss the crueller political reality. The
awesome task facing the government is to rebuild something that resembles a
coherent policy on the economy and Europe. The judgment of his peers is that
Mr Lamont cannot recover the political authority such a task will demand of
the chancellor.
They may be proved wrong. Mr Lamont is a resilient politician. He is utterly
determined to stay. But as of now the consensus at Westminster runs as
follows: if Mr Douglas Hurd is discounted, there are only two members of the
cabinet equal to the present challenge - Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael
Heseltine. At a pinch Mr Michael Howard can be added to the list.
But what of Mr Major? He is devastated by the events of Wednesday. The
capitulation was not the U-turn of a cynical politician who saw a fixed rate
for the pound as a convenience and devaluation as no more than an awkward
moment. He believed in the policy. He gave in on Wednesday night only when
he was told that Bank of England's reserves were 'haemorraging'.
With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see when the strategy went
wrong. Mr Major was brave enough on Wednesday to raise interest rates to 15
per cent but by then it was too late. Well before the latest crises it was
clear that sterling would remain under pressure until after the French
referendum.
Senior officials were privately warning of that possibility in July.
Presumably they suggested a pre-emptive interest rate rise. Presumably Mr
Lamont - and/or Mr Major - rejected the idea for fear of a backlash on the
Tory backbenches.
But the government cannot afford to indulge in postmortems. The suspension
of sterling's membership of the ERM has left a gaping hole in its economic
strategy. It threatens to destroy Mr Major's painstaking attempts over the
past two years to persuade the Conservative party that it must come to terms
with Europe.
Yesterday's cabinet meeting was a holding operation. The carefully
orchestrated display of unity - and genuine commiseration with the
chancellor's predicament - was designed to allow the government to catch its
breath. The cabinet's Euro-sceptics, notably Mr Michael Portillo and Mr
Peter Lilley, by all accounts kept their counsel.
The subsequent statement that sterling would rejoin the ERM as soon as
conditions are favourable was an attempt to buy time. For all his anger at
the behaviour of the Bundesbank, Mr Major still sees the ERM as the only
available anchor for a credible anti-inflation strategy.
Beyond that nothing can be decided until ministers have had time to assess
the reaction of the markets to the French referendum. Nobody knows where
sterling will be next Tuesday morning - nor whether the ERM can survive in
its present form. Mr Lamont also wants firm evidence that German interest
rates are heading lower before he sets a new D-mark rate for the pound. He
does not rule out a small cut in British rates in the meantime.
But Mr Major does not have much time to map out a new course. He should not
underestimate the angst in his party. It is not only the irreconcilables who
are asking now what on earth was the point of all the pain of the past two
years.
There are the usual suspects - Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit among them. But
others such as Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, are also
preparing to step into the power vacuum. They are confident this week's
debacle will provide a fertile recruiting ground for their efforts to disown
permanently the ERM as a prelude to ditching Maastricht. The Euro-sceptics
have a spring in their step. Their ranks are being swelled by the
uncommitted on the Tory backbenches.
They are peddling an attractive potion. With the pound floating freely,
interest rates could be cut to a level which would get the economy moving
again. Small businesses, the bedrock of the government's support, would stop
going bust. The housing market would pick up. Unemployment might stop
rising. Monetary targets could be reintroduced to guide anti-inflation
policy. And if prices crept up a little faster, what harm?
Anti-Europeanism, and more particularly paranoia about Germany, has come
back into fashion on the Tory backbenches. It has been fed this week by
Downing Street's ill-judged public onslaught on the Bundesbank. The question
being asked by some colleagues is that if Mr Major blamed the Germans for
his humiliation this week, why on earth should he risk a repeat
performance?.
The answer is that he still thinks the defeat of inflation offers the only
real prospect of reversing Britain's long-term economic decline. He saw
enough of the sterling crises of the 1980s to understand that a
free-floating pound does not insulate the government from the foreign
exchange markets. He believes fervently that Britain's long-term future can
be secured only within the mainstream of Europe. How long will business be
able to cope with a gyrating exchange rate once the European single market
is in place?
So his strategy must be to start again from scratch: to rebuild confidence
in sterling as a prelude to its return to the ERM and, after a decent
interval, steer the Tory party back into the belief that Europe represents
an opportunity rather than a threat.
It will not be easy. Mr Lamont believes it will be weeks if not months
before the markets have settled sufficiently for sterling to be fixed with
confidence at a new D-mark parity. But the longer Britain is outside the ERM
the harder Mr Major will find it to persuade his party to rejoin. He can
expect angry rebellions if he keeps his word. There is though no
alternative. After all it was the failure of Lady Thatcher's approach to
Europe and the economy that put him in Downing Street.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Remember the Natural Law Party? That's the organisation preaching
transcendental meditation as a means to a better world, which however failed
to win a single seat in the April general election.
Even so, the party is still alive and kicking, or perhaps even bouncing  -
one of its party election broadcasts showed a team of meditators bumping
along the ground on their backsides.
Indeed, one of its executive committee members, David Lucas, took the
trouble of telephoning yesterday to explain why all the other politicians
are unable to get Britain out of its economic mess.
'There will be a continual decay in this country as politicians of the other
parties do not have the means to control the situation,' he said. 'The
bottom line is how people feel. We need to change the consciousness of the
country, give it some brightness.'
The way to do that, apparently, is to get a critical mass of people - a
minimum of the square root of 1 per cent of the population - permanently
engaged in the Sidhi programme of advanced transcendental meditation, which
'would neutralise the stress of the country'.
Alas, as that would mean about 750 full-time meditators for the UK, it would
cost a good deal of money. But perhaps public-spirited citizens might chip
in enough to send at least the Cabinet along.

Renault Vehicules Industriels, an arm of the French carmaker, has come up
with one of the less attractive examples of Franglais. Yesterday's interim
statement mentions the 1991 first half pre-tax losses of FFr128m 'apres
badwill'.
Badwill? Yes, says Renault cheerfully, it is the opposite of goodwill and,
rather than being a bad thing, is actually something of a windfall. It had
paid less than it expected to acquire full control (in 1990) of Mack Trucks
in the US, so le badwill is a pot of money that turned up because the
provisions made in advance of the acquisition were too generous.
Vive la difference.

The pressures now being felt by the Bank of England were not quite so acute
61 years ago this week, when - as Observer reported yesterday - the UK was
driven off the gold standard.
The Governor of the Bank of England, the formidable Montagu Norman - was
returning from a lengthy convalescence in the US when the Old Lady decided
it could hold on no longer.
Anxious to keep him informed, but fearful of security leaks, officials sent
an artfully worded cable to the Governor on his transatlantic liner. 'Sorry
we have to go off tomorrow and cannot wait to see you before doing so.'
Unfortunately, the great man completely misunderstood the message and -
according to the Bank's official history - it was only after landing at
Liverpool that he realised that the international monetary structure for
which he had striven for so long had collapsed.

Psst. Wanna sell a bank? Just when the City thought that the bottom had
fallen out of the second-hand merchant bank market, along come some cheery
customers from South Africa.
Over the years lots of firms - ranging from the Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation to the TSB - have been tempted to buy a prestigious City
merchant bank and have not always been pleased with the outcome. However, it
seems that even in the depths of a recession there are still people prepared
to pay good money for less than prestigious London merchant banks.
Barclays Bank, which rescued the loss-making Allied Trust Bank in 1990, has
just sold it for Pounds 25m to South Africa's Investec Bank, and Barclays'
old South African subsidiary, First National Bank, is said to be close to
paying Pounds 50m for Henry Ansbacher, which lost Pounds 8.2m last year.
Why are the South Africans so interested in these outfits? Most foreign
banks coming to London open branches. But not South Africa's banks, it
seems. This week, for example, Standard Bank has opened its new London
subsidiary with capital of Pounds 35m. If it had a branch it wouldn't have
had to invest this kind of money because it could have traded off the back
of its parent's large South African capital base.
Perhaps the Bank of England feels that it should only give new London
banking licences to South African entrants who are prepared properly to
capitalise their London business.
If so, buying Henry Ansbacher and Allied Trust Bank makes some sense if they
can be bought at a substantial discount to net asset value.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: Level of UK aid budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN P HEWITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So now we have it from no less an authority (and hard taskmaster) than
the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Michel
Camdessus: a doubling of the UK's foreign aid budget could easily be
afforded. He would give us 'until the end of the century' to reach 0.7 per
cent of gross national product (Monday Interview, September 14).
Currently, UK aid stands at Dollars 3.25bn and it has been stagnating at
around the current 0.32 per cent of GNP for a decade. To achieve a doubling
to 0.7 per cent in eight years, and incidentally to match the French, we
should need to increase the budget by just over a twelfth annually - that is
to add currently a mere Dollars 280m each year (if I rather mischievously
assume the economy does not grow; more, more affordably, if it does). I do
hope both Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, and Baroness
Chalker, overseas development minister, are readers of the Monday Interview
as they lock horns for the autumn public spending round, because Britain
needs to start now to meet the Camdessus target. Not since the days of Bob
Geldof has public support been so strong for increasing development aid and
sustained action to alleviate poverty.

Sir, I am the managing director of an engineering company producing
machinery for the plastic industry. We export about 80 per cent of our
output all over the world.
I feel the time has come for somebody in industry to speak up and stop the
meddling of politicians with exchange rates, interest rates etc.
To put UK manufacturing companies on an equal basis with our competition in
the European Community, the sensible thing to do is to establish one rate of
interest for all countries in the Community and one monetary unit (be it an
Ecu or any other denomination).
If this is achieved it will stop the foreign exchange speculators making
huge profits, as they do at the moment with the present system. It will also
stop a country in the Community devaluing its currency, which obviously
gives it an immediate advantage over its competitors in other countries.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ROSALIND ALTMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government's policy for fighting inflation is in tatters. European
monetary co-operation has failed due to the incompatibility of a German
post-unification boom with the slow-down in other economies. But the goal is
still important and the markets need to be convinced about Britain's
anti-inflation resolve. So how can credibility be restored?
The time has surely come to make the Bank of England fully independent,
handing over to it the conduct of monetary policy. This should now be made
an urgent priority and the intention to do so should be announced as soon as
possible. It could hardly do a worse job]
The Bank of England could reassure markets of its resolve by maintaining a
cautious monetary policy, but in the context of the protracted economic
weakness at home, rather than exceptional circumstances overseas. Britain's
interest rate policy would then be in the hands of a body which should
ensure that Britain's interest rates are determined by the inflation
pressures in our own country - but irrespective of political time-tabling.
After all, is this not what the most respected independent central bank of
all has been doing so successfully for itself these last two years?

FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: More jobs better than more 'poorer consumers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN G BRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So the World Development Movement believes that the interests of the
'poorer consumers' would be best served by making available more low cost
textiles from the Far East at the expense of the UK industry, thus creating
more 'poorer consumers' ('Textile trade rules are attacked', September 14).
How much more positive it would be to provide jobs for these people in
wealth-creating manufacturing industries, enabling them to spend their
incomes in the shops which could then offer UK goods alongside the imported
ones.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: Sound theory, but maybe impossible in practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NATHAN GELBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley's argument (The Long View, September 12) that pension fund
trustees and their portfolio managers should take into account changes in
investment fundamentals - ie, make major market timing decisions and asset
allocation shifts - deserves further scrutiny. Although in theory it seems
to be a sound argument, in practice, it appears to be extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to implement.
Based on our experience, gained through monitoring a large number of fund
managers, we have not yet had conclusive evidence that adding value on a
consistent basis through market timing - ie, making significant shifts
between asset classes in anticipation of extreme price movements - can be
achieved. Given this environment, it would require only a few poor decisions
to deflate longer results to the point where real rates of return would fail
to have been achieved and the trustees would be unable to meet their real
liabilities.
Pension fund trustees and their portfolio managers can afford the
longer-term perspective. So it would be more appropriate to gauge the risk
acceptable to their specific requirements, formulate an asset allocation
policy which is consistent with these criteria and adhere to it, even when
the stock market is at its ugliest. This does not mean pension fund trustees
or their managers should necessarily follow the crowd. Instead they should
devote more effort to addressing their specific liability structure. I would
be surprised if their individual characteristics would mirror the current
consensus and this is why the copy-cat mentality is so dangerous.

FT  18 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER record session yesterday rounded off the life of the September
contract on the FT-SE Index, which expires after 10 o'clock this morning,
writes Terry Byland.
Volume was driven by activity from marketmakers trying to keep ahead of a
wildly expanding equity market and by traders seeking to roll over positions
into the Dec-ember contract, which takes over market leadership today.
Overseas purchasers bought early into the London market's stock index
futures on the back of the effective 10 per cent devaluation of sterling.
The September contract moved above 2,510 twice during the session before
closing around 2,483, in line with the underlying index, as required for the
contract expiry.
The December contract closed at a premium of 56 over September, with fair
value, the calculation allowing for dividend flows and financing costs,
estimated at around 42; brokers regarded the level as acceptable.
In view of the excitement in the equity market yesterday, this morning's
expiry in stock index futures could prove lively, according to dealers.
Traded options were equally lively, recording turnover of 69,249 lots, and
volume in the FT-SE option reached 27,204.

FT  18 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities soar on interest rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON equity dealers sensed yesterday that sterling's effective devaluation
and suspension from the ERM may signal a shift in UK government policies in
the direction of lower interest rates, and the stock market soared in one of
the most heavily traded sessions on record.
The day's surge of 105.6 points on the FT-SE Index represented the largest
daily gain since the session which followed re-election of the Conservative
government in April this year. The closing level of 2,483.9 returns the
Footsie to its position of mid-July.
Overseas institutions, for which the effective 10 per cent sterling
devaluation presented golden purchasing opportunities among UK stocks, had
telexed their buying lists to London brokers overnight. Domes-tic
institutions soon took up the running as the government's cancellation of
Wednesday's two percentage-point rise in base rates turned attention to
interest-related stocks. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank,
predicted that base rates could fall to 8 per cent this year.
The final Footsie reading was only about four points below the day's high
and one point under the level recorded within seconds of the official
opening. Share prices fell back to show just a 25.8 gain on the Footsie in
the first hour of trading, but the advance was resumed when base rates were
returned to 10 per cent, whetting appetites for further reductions soon.
For most of the session the market jousted around a 100-point Footsie rise,
with brief periods of profit-taking soon replaced by further institutional
demand. At the close, Seaq trading volume totalled 1.4bn shares, exceeding
even that recorded on the day following the UK general election.
Amid the enthusiasm - one well-known dealer called for his famous
water-cooled fountain pen - there were a few notes of caution, especially
after government bonds began to reflect fears that inflation will be
rekindled by lower sterling and interest rates.
At Panmure Gordon, the London broker, Mr Robin Aspinall noted that the
Bundesbank, which disappointed some investors by leaving rates unchanged
yesterday, might not cut rates for some time.
At BZW, Mr Richard Kersley suggested caution towards some of the domestic
interest-related stocks, such as those in the building and contracting
sector, which have been unwilling to respond to reduc-tions in domestic
interest rates so far this year.
Gains in the overseas earning stocks, including some of the smaller oil
issues which have lagged the market, often outpaced the advance of 4.4 per
cent in the Footsie.
There were substantial rises in bank shares on expectation that lower UK
interest rates will ease some of the crippling burden of bad debts
overhanging from the domestic manufacturing, property and building sectors.
But there was a reaction from the defensive stocks, including utilities.
This morning brings the expiry, just after 10am, of the September contract
on the FT-SE Index, an event likely to inspire tumultuous activity in blue
chip stocks.

FT  18 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Investors abandon utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE apparent abandonment of the low-inflation economic environment brought
an abrupt about turn in sentiment in those sectors regarded as safe havens
and, in particular, among the utilities.
The electricity distribution stocks, the water sector, BT and to a lesser
extent British Gas, all came under substantial selling pressure from the
outset of trading as the market's action funds switched their allegiance to
the cyclical stocks.
Opening at 357p, BT shares quickly turned down, touching a low of 332p
before settling a net 4 off at 339 1/2 p. The partly-paid stock closed 3 1/2
down at 237p. Turnover in the two classes of shares was 19m and 7.1m
respectively.
British Gas, refecting the stock's underperformance against the other
utilities, was treated with kid gloves, the shares edging up 4 1/2 to 235p
on 17m traded.
The biggest casualties in the electricity stocks included Norweb, 10 lower
at 406p, Midland, 12 off at 390p, and Yorkshire, which declined 16 to 418p.
Footsie status sustained Thames Water, only 4 easier at 426p, and Severn
Trent, 6 down at 385p, but the smaller water issues such as South West (17
weaker at 396p) and Welsh Water (13 cheaper at 430p) were given a much
rougher ride.
Guinness volatile
In a session notable for demand for international stocks, drinks group
Guinness, the 'classic overseas earner', stood out for its underperformance
after reporting interim figures below market estimates and warning of
deteriorating markets. Analysts downgraded their forecasts for the full
year.
Half-time profits showed a one per cent improvement to Pounds 353m but the
figure fell short of market expectations of between Pounds 359m and Pounds
366m, and the company spoke of poor trading conditions in the UK, Japan and
Germany.
With the strong demand for internationals a particular feature of
yesterday's session, shares in Guinness, which derives around 85 per cent of
its earnings from overseas, still suffered an initial retreat of 38 to 491p
on the results as dealers moved to unload stock and analysts made their
downgrades. Smith New Court was among brokers to cut its forecast and is now
predicting profits of Pounds 975m for the year, down from its previous
estimate of Pounds 1.03bn.
The strong market trend, however, brought a rebound in the shares, which
reached 560p before profit-taking combined with switching into Grand
Metropolitan cut them back to 534p for a rise on the day of 5. Turnover came
to 17m shares, the highest daily total for 15 months.
The switching between Guinness and GrandMet, together with demand for
overseas earners, saw turnover in the latter rise to 14m as the shares
jumped 23 to close at 432p.
The oil and gas sector attracted exceptionally heavy trading. BP saw 31m
shares dealt as an initial burst of buying interest, mostly from overseas
according to dealers, was offset by a steady stream of big selling orders
from UK institutions. Pushed up to 226p within minutes of the opening, BP
shares were subsequently driven down and closed the session a mere 1 1/2 up
at 212p.
Shell, on the other hand, was the darling of the big international
institutions, with the shares running up 29 1/2 to 522p on 15m traded.
The latest upsurge in the exploration and production sub-sector saw Lasmo
climb 13 1/2 to 146p on very heavy turnover of 12m and Enterprise add 19 at
384p on 2.9m, reflecting the impact of currencies on crude oil prices which,
because of currency shifts, have risen from around Pounds 10 a barrel to
Pounds 12 a barrel in the past couple of weeks.
Burmah Castrol's exceptionally heavy overseas earnings stream - 30 per cent
comes directly from the US, to say nothing of substantial income from
Germany - saw the shares advance 22 to 613p.
Institutions piled back into the high street banks after the recent interest
rate rises were rescinded and the market began to trade on stories that
single-figure interest rates are not too far away.
National Westminster and Barclays, which bore the brunt of selling in the
sector earlier in the week, spiralled upwards in levels of turnover not seen
for many months. The latter shot up 45 to 336p on 28m traded, while NatWest
leapt 51 to 357p on 26m.
The expected return to profits underpinned Legal &amp; General, which settled 24
up at 323p. Prudential, where turnover was given a big push by a single
trade of 4.9m shares at 246p, closed 6 higher at 245p.
Steep gains in the equity market and hopes of an upturn in the property
market drove the composite sector higher. Sun Alliance added 24 at 263p,
Commercial Union 14 at 489P, General Accident 38 at 478p and Royal 16 at
142p.
There was no hard evidence to support the latest spurious market rumours
that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, had taken advantage of the
market upsurge to place the remainder of the big block of ICI shares it
acquired from Hanson via a bought deal earlier this year. ICI shares
finished 38 better at 1105p after turnover of 5.1m.
Reed International's proposed merger with Elsevier was given a warm welcome
by the market, which marked Reed shares up 45 to 531p. Volume was 8.8m.
With the focus mainly on internationals, several stocks viewed as
over-focused on the UK came under pressure. One such stock was Northern
Foods, which was among a handful of FT-SE stocks to buck the market trend.
The shares shed 3 to 224p.
Also relatively weak was Argyll Group, currently hosting a series of broker
visits. The shares improved only 3 to 307p.
Investors brushed aside the financial worries that have depressed Queens
Moat Houses of late and strong demand left the shares 7 1/2 ahead at 35p.
Hotels group Forte was seen as likely to benefit from a devaluation of
sterling and trade in the shares was particularly busy. They rose 21 to 139p
as turnover reached 21m.
British Steel was particularly busy and recorded the day's highest volume
among Footsie stocks at more than 47m. The shares rose 8 to 61p.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Brussels mounts solid defence of single currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday mounted a solid defence of the single
European currency, reflecting its growing belief that a French endorsement
of the Maastricht treaty in Sunday's referendum was vital to the future of
European union.
EC officials argued that the European exchange rate mechanism had proved its
efficacy but had also shown its limitations. They argued that this week's
events in the currency markets demonstrated the imperative need for a single
currency.
The pounding that speculators had given the ERM 'shows that if we don't move
forwards we are going to go backwards,' said Sir Leon Brittan, a Commission
vice-president and former British cabinet minister.
Sir Leon argued that this week's foretaste of the possible consequences of a
French No vote could strengthen the treaty cause. However, Mr Frans
Andriessen, the Dutch external relations commissioner, took the opposite
view. 'This is bad news for Sunday', he said.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president and inspirer of the Maastricht plan
for economic and monetary union, insisted the EMS was far from being 'a
miracle cure'.
'We cannot ask of it what it cannot provide. It will still provide, but it
is only through common disciplines and a single currency that we can avoid
the sort of events we have just witnessed,' Mr Delors said in Paris.
Mr Delors argued that currency union would enable the EC to negotiate as
equals with the US and Japan 'to guarantee greater monetary stability'. It
would also keep Europe's currencies out of the crossfire between an
appreciating D-Mark and sinking dollar.
British officials insisted that the suspension of Britain's membership of
the exchange rate mechanism was not regarded by other members as a sign of
weakening commitment to the Community, and it would not affect the
government's aims for its period in the presidency.
They added that Britain might call a special EC summit before the scheduled
meeting of heads of state in Edinburgh in December. The logic for such a
meeting would increase if the French electorate rejected the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Jean-Francois Pons, director of the EMS, said that 'if the EMS were going
to give us stability for ever and a day there would have been no point in
having Emu.'
He addded that Danish voters' rejection of Maastricht in June was 'the
turning point' in the markets suggesting that 'maybe (the markets) were
banking too much on the effects of the single currency' plan reached at
Maastricht.
However, Mr Giovanni Ravasio, head of the directorate general for economic
and financial affairs, said this week's carnage was sparked by the markets'
'exasperation' with the uncertainty over Maastricht.
In yesterday's debate on the crisis at the European Parliament in
Strasbourg, Mr Glyn Ford, leader of The British Labour party Euro-MPs, said
the money markets had 'mugged every man, woman and child (in the UK) each
for Pounds 140 pounds in the last 48 hours.' But he warned French voters
that a No vote on Sunday would mean 'you ain't seen nothing yet.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been mileage in Homer since 600BC when the 'Sons of Homer' formed
a guild for public readings of The Iliad and The Odyssey.
Alan Howard and Christopher Logue are continuing the tradition with Kings at
the Cottesloe Theatre, a reading from Logue's 1991 version of the first two
books of The Iliad.
This two-man, 90-minute performance shows how compelling epic can be when
well presented.
Aristotle was right to think that it should be read and not acted. Logue's
Kings follows his epic companion piece, War Music (1981), which comprised a
version of books 16-19 of The Iliad.
His story keeps close to Homer, recounts the growing dissent among the
Greeks, their reaction to the imperiousness of Agamemnon, the sulking of
Achilles at the loss of his captured woman, Briseis, and the fatal prayer he
offers to his mother Thetis, to make the Greeks suffer.
Homeric style combines seriousness and accessibility: armies are compared to
forest fires, or flies around a milk pail.
Logue has caught the scope and pitch of Homeric epic by using translations
from Chapman (1611) to Rieu (1950) and evolving a supple, muscular verse.
He has also preserved the wit in Homer. Besides the whining, jibing
Thersites, there is a malicious Athena ('We have arranged another death for
Agamemnon') and a skyful of ludic gods: 'How can a mortal make a god smile?
Tell him his plans.'
The Homeric lyricism has also been kept: retained: 'The dawn stepped
barefooted from her lover's bed and shared her beauty with the clouds.'
Logue has wisely kept his own speaking contributions relatively slight. The
evening is carried by Howard.
From the opening lines, 'Think of the East Aegean sea by night ..', Howard
is magnificent, delivering the speeches of Greeks and Gods seamlessly
intercut with passages of narration.
He crouches for the opening on a tall stool, fists clenched, conjuring
figures from the Greek camp out of the sea mist.
The famous speech from Odysseus, persuading the Greeks not to follow
Thersites home, is stunning.
Thersites has raised the cry of 'Home' like sudden gusts darkening a lake;
Odysseus calms the soldiers and beats him with a cane before handing the
situation back to Agamemnon.
Howard makes it come alive, and for a moment, you are standing on the shores
of history by the wine-dark sea.
Cottesloe Theatre (071 928 2033) until 19 September, and 27-29 October.
Christopher Logue's Kings is published by Faber.

<TEXT>
Bernard Shaw said that, in writing plays, his dramaturgical models were
Mozart's operas. Maybe that's why his plays are so often (against his will)
on the cusp of becoming musicals. But not every Shaw play turns into song as
well as Pygmalion (or My Fair Lady). There is plenty going for Valentine's
Day, which - first staged last year in Chichester - is a musical version of
Shaw's You Never Can Tell. (It has Shaw's dialogue, for one thing.) What it
chiefly lacks is music; music, that is, memorable enough to put Benny
Green's clever lyrics on wings. Everything the composer, Denis King, does is
accomplished, derivative and forgettable.
Still, there is Edward Petherbridge, as in Chichester, playing William (or
Walter) the white-haired waiter, and he is a wonder. He sings on the
frailest thread of voice, he dances in brief little spurts of low-key
energy, and yet he has the musicality and the wit to make his numbers
entrancing. William, a wistful observer of other people's acts, a model of
tact, is a perfect Petherbridge role. The new ingredient, which stops it
from being just another Petherbridge role, is a secret glee. Each of his
songs starts to turn into his own happy fantasy. What he gives you is not
wonderful song or dance but - more touching and funny - William's pleasure
in song and dance; the side of William that might have performed in
music-hall.
William, however, is just on the sidelines. Valentine's Day is about
male-female relations. The plot concerns two couples - the middle-aged
couple, Crampton and Mrs Clandon, who separated long ago; and the young
adult couple, Valentine and Gloria, who meet in the first scene and who fall
in love. Gloria, daughter to Crampton and Mrs Clandon, is the central
figure. She is the emancipated modern woman, poised ready to conquer the
forthcoming twentieth century - until love confuses her and stops her being
a heroine all the time. As she comes to terms with herself, so she comes to
terms with both her parents
It's a good plot, but King's music and Green's lyrics make it too diffuse.
Gloria, in particular, is given too little prominence. Only late in Act Two
 -and then because of Shaw's dialogue rather than song - do you feel the
charm of her dilemma, as this latterday Diana the huntress descends from her
pedestal and dwindles into a wife. Teresa Banham's performance has far more
spirit and animation than Fiona Fullerton's had in Chichester - though she
could carry herself with more perfect nobility. Her happy bewildermentis
truly moving. Too bad that the show doesn't make more of her role. Likewise
the role of her mother, Mrs Clandon, is better taken now by Elizabeth
Counsell (looking like Marcia Falkender) than it was by Judy Parfitt; but
the part itself seems less important now. For Alexander Hanson as Valentine
 -manly, energetic, engaging - every praise.
The director is Gillian Lynne, and she is responsible the best and worst
features of the show. It's she who gives William such good dance material;
and indeed almost all the choreography is good (echoes of Ashton's Facade
and A Wedding Bouquet). But it's also she who has the chorus of waitresses
and servants perform with such wretchedly bright-eyed cuteness. As
Petherbridge shows, less is more.

BOTH THE UK and Germany have experienced substantial growth in
self-employment but the increase has been most dynamic in the UK, according
to a report from the Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial
Society, a charitable group.
In its report, the group, which seeks to promote closer understanding
between the UK and Germany, compares the phenomenon of self-employment in
both countries and examines common characteristics and differences.
The report says the economic and policy climate in the UK promotes business
start-ups, while the climate in Germany favours maintaining those who are
already self-employed.
The authors conclude that the increasing importance of self-employment in
the labour market indicates a growing need for policymakers to understand
the implications of self-employment for the labour market.
The report says: 'These questions are particularly relevant within the
context of the newly emerging market economies of eastern Europe - not least
in the former German Democratic Republic - where the development of
self-employment and entrepreneurship is frequently seen as a mechanism for
stimulating the transition to a market economy and for absorbing some of the
unemployment involved in such a transition.'
The report says that before the 1980s, commentators on the labour market
typically ignored self-employment as a transitory stage at best for emerging
enterprises towards becoming fully fledged small businesses.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Complaint system in schools 'woeful'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARRANGEMENTS for parents to make complaints about their children's
schools are 'woefully inadequate', the National Consumer Council says in a
report published today.
The council says that the Parent's Charter has done little to help parents
who want to complain - and the government's new white paper on opting out
might make it even harder for some.
The government-funded council calls for the existing 'bewildering array' of
formal and informal complaints systems to be replaced by a simple,
well-publicised system for complaints in every school and local education
authority.
Lady Wilcox, who chairs the council, said: 'The government takes the view
that it should be the job of the school governors to deal with complaints.
Our research shows that few governors are yet trained to handle complaints
and, so far, they tend not to override the decisions of the headteacher.'
The council says any new system should cover schools that have opted out of
local education authority control. Parents of children at such schools must
take up complaints with the Department for Education, 'which has a poor
track record of dealing with parents' complaints'.
It says pupils aged 16 and over should be allowed to use such a system. It
urges the government to find ways of helping younger children to complain.
The remit of the local-government ombudsman should be extended to cover
complaints about maladministration of internal school matters.

FT  18 SEP 92 / The Property Market: A mild sense of relief - Vanessa
Houlder on whether history will repeat itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few sectors promised to benefit more from the UK's decision to enter the
exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in October 1990 than commercial property,
which held out hopes of interest rate cuts and more inward investment.
After a disappointing two years though, sterling's suspension this week from
the ERM has been greeted by the property sector with relief - tempered by
astonishment and concern at the wild gyrations in government economic
policy.
The reasons for this relief stem from the reversal of Wednesday's interest
rate rise to 15 per cent; tenants, investors and overborrowed companies
gratefully applauded the step-down. In some quarters, encouragement was also
drawn from the damage inflicted on the government's policy of taking
sterling into the ERM at an overvalued rate against the D-Mark and high real
interest rates. Any resulting boost to the economy will ultimately reduce
the oversupply of space, the property sector's most fundamental problem.
Perhaps the biggest question mark hangs over prospects for inflation; it was
inflation which helped to lift the indebted property sector out of the slump
of the early 1970s; this was because of lower real interest rates and the
role of property as a traditional hedge against inflation.
But not everyone believes that history will repeat itself. The deflation
gripping the economy is very different from the economic climate that
prevailed in 1967 - the time of the last devaluation - and 1976. Moreover,
even if retail price inflation takes off, it is not clear that asset values
will follow.
In the view of Mr Robert Fowlds of Kleinwort Benson Securities, property
values will only rise in response to a weight of money moving into the
sector. This, he thinks, is unlikely given that institutions are no longer
restricted by exchange controls. Falling interest and exchange rates in the
US have done little to halt asset deflation, he says.
Even the idea that inflation is good for property is challenged. 'If the
result of devaluation is to lift inflation, we are back to the stop-go
policies that are unhelpful to property,' says Mr Peter Evans of Debenham
Tewson Research. 'What the property market needs is steady economic growth.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / The Property Market: The crash - it can happen again / A
look behind recent boom-bust cycles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BARRAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When, in 1978, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors conducted a
post-mortem on the early-1970s property boom and collapse, it concluded that
even if a comparable property price rise were repeated, 'we do not believe
that such a sudden collapse could occur again, unless triggered by some
event as traumatic as the oil price explosion of 1974'.
With the benefit of hindsight their optimism has proved unfounded: they
attributed too great an importance to external events and too little to the
inherent instability of the property market.
What are the roots of this instability? Property development is rendered
uncertain by the long lead times involved: when a developer embarks on a
large scheme he has to anticipate demand three to five years ahead.
Buildings by their nature are an illiquid form of investment. It is
therefore inevitable that the property market tends to swing from shortage
to surplus and back again, as supply overshoots and is then cut. These
cyclical fluctuations are reinforced by the periodic speculative fevers
which grip all markets subject to such volatility.
For these reasons, property bubbles and crashes have occurred at every stage
in the evolution of capitalist economies. The crash of the mid-1970s,
however spectacular, was not unique; it was merely the first of the post-war
period. Furthermore, it is dwarfed by the scale of the crash which is now
under way.
Take as an example the City of London office market, one of the most
volatile markets of recent times. Between 1989 and 1991 some 15m square feet
of new office space was added to the City stock, compared with 5m sq ft in
the equivalent three-year period of buoyancy in the 1970s.
As a result there is now about 12m sq ft of vacant space available in the
City, compared with a peak of no more than 4m sq ft during the 1970s.
According to the latest forecasts by Property Market Analysis, a research
group, the combination of this severe over-supply and the recession will
produce a fall of more than 50 per cent in City rents between 1989 and
1993-94, compared with a drop of just over one third in the last crash.
Nevertheless, there are several parallels between the current cycle and that
of the 1970s.
First, in each case a strong increase in demand for property, leading to
rapid increases in rents and prices, was generated by a
politically-inspired, but unsustainable, burst of economic growth. In
1972-73 this surge in demand was fuelled by the 'Barber boom', while in
1987-88 it was the 'Lawson boom'; the result was a similar annual 3.5 per
cent average rise in gross domestic product in the four-year upswing of each
cycle.
Second, the wave of development triggered by rising rents was turned into a
speculative surge as a result of relaxed monetary policy and the
enthusiastic participation of the banks. Thus in each period there was an
explosion of bank lending for property development, which culminated in
property companies accounting for almost 10 per cent of all outstanding bank
debt in the aftermath of each buoyant period.
Third, the main bulk of new development reached the market just as the
economy, and therefore property demand, was tripping into a recession
induced by a tightening of monetary policy. The 1974 crash was precipitated
by a rise in interest rates from 4.5 per cent to 13 per cent and a
corresponding 1.5 per cent fall in GDP; in 1991 it was an increase in
interest rates from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and then a 2.5 per cent fall
in GDP.
All three conditions are necessary to create the classic property boom and
bust. Of course, special market factors will operate in each cycle, but
these tend to exacerbate the upswings and downswings, rather than provide
their primary cause.
In the early-1970s the imposition of a freeze on business rents, and a
Development Gains Tax, did nothing to improve confidence in the market, but
it was the transformation of economic circumstances reinforced by the oil
crisis which made the 1974 crash inevitable.
Similarly, while the incentives for development in Docklands encouraged the
Corporation of London, the City's governing body, to relax constraints on
development in the mid-1980s, the underlying cause of the subsequent central
London office explosion was the surge in demand created by economic
expansion in general and financial deregulation in particular.
Yet does the instability of the property market really matter? The answer
must be yes. The scale of the recent development activity was such that it
contributed significantly to the overheating of the economy as a whole.
And in retrospect, the Pounds 40bn of outstanding loans to the property
sector, much of which is now tied up in empty buildings, represents a
serious misallocation of resources in an economy which is investing far less
than its competitors in productive infrastructure or manufacturing industry.
If the instability of the property market does generate such serious
economic and social costs, can it be contained? The answer seems to be only
to a limited degree.
Ironically, in its post-mortem on the 1970s crash, one of the strongest
lessons for the future highlighted by the RICS was that 'it is highly
dangerous for any government to attempt to regulate the property market by
seeking to limit the supply of property coming onto the market in response
to demand'.
If the 1990s crash teaches us anything, it is the opposite dangers of
deregulation - both of the supply of credit and the control of planning
permissions. Indeed, the case for strategic planning has been reinforced by
the Canary Wharf saga, where offices were built before the transport
infrastructure necessary to bring in the workforce.
Even if these lessons are learned, property surges and crashes at least as
severe as that of the past five years will certainly happen again. The next
such cycle is unlikely to be until after 2000, and by then it could well be
that the policy context is being set at European rather than national level.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (8): 'Bristol trapped by catch
22' - How two of the losers have reacted to their disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS July 16: the day that Hartcliffe, the run-down, largely council,
estate on the southern edge of Bristol heard that for the second year
running it had lost its bid for City Challenge funding.
That evening the riots erupted, a large part of the Symes Avenue shopping
mall was vandalised or set on fire, and serious disturbances across the
estate lasted three nights. The riots were not, emphatically not, caused by
the government's refusal to give Bristol Pounds 37.5m for urban
regeneration. A tragic incident - two youths joy-riding a stolen police bike
which careered head-on into an unmarked police car - sparked off the
troubles, and the loitering youths who joined in had been congregating at
the same spots for months. By day three their numbers were swollen by
outsiders wanting to get in on the action.
But the fact that most evenings dozens of youths, mainly unemployed with few
qualifications or interests, have nothing better to do than to hang around
Symes Avenue drinking cheap cider and waiting for something to turn up, is a
grim reminder of life in Britain's urban blackspots.
More depressing still is the thought that the likes of Hartcliffe could lose
in a competition for regeneration funding.
Hartcliffe highlights the 'downside' of City Challenge in graphic form. The
very community involvement which, with 'winning' bids, has given a local
dynamism to regeneration, in the case of failure produces real gloom and
depression. It is not just the prospective beneficiaries with hopes dashed:
it is the teachers, community and voluntary workers, striving to increase
opportunities and often feeling isolated and embattled at the best of times,
who feel deserted.
In Hartcliffe's case the impact of losing was worsened, because failure came
not once but twice, because Hartcliffe was also Bristol's bid for the first,
pacemaker round of City Challenge. For Bristol council it was a heavy blow:
the city gets Pounds 1.6m a year in urban programme funding, and even that
could be reduced sharply next year if public spending reductions cut into a
budget already top-sliced by two rounds of City Challenge.
'You cannot keep blowing up then bursting a community's hopes like this  -
it just breeds desperate cynicism and despair,' says Ms Pat Mundy, manager
of Hartcliffe Wythywood Ventures (HWV), a local enterprise and training
agency. Ms Mundy is also secretary of the local neighbourhood council which,
she recalls, was 'deeply shocked' that they had been turned down again.
'The main casualties are the young people: only two of the 100 leaving the
local secondary school this year have jobs to go to: and we don't have any
spare training places this year,' she says. Even existing facilities have
had to be cut back: HWV had a construction workshop for its British
Technology Education Council engineering course, but closed it earlier in
the year because of cutbacks in funding from the local training and
enterprise council.
Why did Bristol lose? Bristol city council is nonplussed. The only
explanation it can offer is a seven-paragraph letter from Mr John Redwood,
the local government minister, saying that the Environment department had
'very difficult choices' to make but had 'concerns about the development of
the Wills site, given its strategic role in providing jobs locally.'
The Wills site is a cigarette factory on the edge of Hartcliffe/Wythywood
which employed 4,000 until its closure two years ago. It is owned by the
Hanson conglomerate, which has no immediate development plans for the
factory, but nor as yet is it prepared to sell the site - thought to have a
book value about twice its current market value - for a price attractive to
would-be developers.
Mr Michael Robinson, Bristol city council's chief executive, believes the
council was in a 'classic catch 22'. 'The plight of Hartcliffe/Wythywood is
largely caused by the closure of the Wills factory and our inability to
persuade Hanson to do anything productive with it; yet that is given as the
reason for not helping us deal with the effects of the closure.' Worse
still, according to Mr Robinson, Bristol was encouraged by ministers to put
Hartcliffe forward a second time, even though the Wills factory problems had
been cited as a reason for rejection in the first round.
To sweeten the pill, Mr Redwood told Bristol that 'the process of preparing
the bids has in itself established a range of partnerships that can be built
on.' Few of them, alas, will lead to concrete opportunities for the locals.
The City Challenge steering group has been kept in operation and is
currently producing an 'action plan' to try and bring some of the projects -
notably a new leisure centre - to fruition.
Surprisingly, Ms Mundy does not see the City Challenge failure as the worst
of Hartcliffe's recent 'external' shocks. She awards that prize to Barclays
Bank, whose decision to close its Symes Avenue branch, in the teeth of
vociferous local opposition, dealt the local trading community a blow from
which it may not recover.
'Barclays said they weren't making enough - enough - profit', she says
scornfully.
Ironically, the City Challenge project office is based in the empty bank.
'People kept coming in wanting to cash cheques,' she adds, with a smile.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (9): Coventry infers political
bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON how to keep together the partnerships forged to support Coventry's
City Challenge bid started within days of the government's notifying the
city council in July that the bid had failed.
Failure left council and community leaders angry. Mr Brian Clack, the
council leader, wrote to Mr Robin Squire, a junior environment minister:
'Coventry is left to pull itself up by its bootstraps. It's done this before
in a climate of hostility, now equalled by your government's attitude
towards this city.'
The bid had concentrated on the Foleshill and Hillfields districts on the
northern side of the city centre, where male unemployment is over 30 per
cent and the industrial base has steadily eroded. Housing conditions are the
worst in Coventry, although most is in private hands. Over 40 per cent of
the population is black, with Afro-Caribbeans concentrated in Hillfields and
Asians in Foleshill.
In addition to environmental and social improvements, the City Challenge
plan explained how inward investment could be drawn in by the creation of
new premises and rehabilitation of old, while training programmes would be
mounted so that residents would be able to obtain the new jobs created. Four
flagship developments would, as the City Challenge document put it,
'spearhead the regeneration strategy'.
While the government liked the linking of inward investment to job
opportunities, it felt, Mr Squire told the council, that 'some other aspects
fell short of the very high standards of the winning bids'. In particular,
his letter went on, 'there were still uncertainties over one of the flagship
projects; and the management and delivery system needed further work.'
The city council dismissed those criticisms as 'spurious', and claimed that
the government was 'seeking to justify what is clearly a decision to favour
other authorities on party political grounds to Coventry's detriment'. This
was a reference to Walsall's success in City Challenge  - Walsall had turned
Conservative at the last local government elections.
Coventry council members fear that the funding options for urban
regeneration are becoming more limited. Community leaders fear that the
impetus towards a collective approach to, for example, improvement of poor
housing areas may peter out.
The first financial concern is the continued squeeze on local authority
spending. For fiscal 1992-93, the city council cut Pounds 6.9m from its
budget, to avoid poll-tax capping. It expects to cut probably a further
Pounds 3m from the 1993-94 budget. Its capital spending is cash-limited by
government restraint measures.
During the current year, Coventry is receiving Pounds 4.65m from the
government's urban programme. But next year it expects less, though it is
not certain how much less. There are two points here. First: the overall
size of the urban programme will not increase. Second: because the funds
allotted to City Challenge come out of the urban programme budget, the more
that is spent on City Challenge, the less there is for the authorities whose
bids fail.
The city council is also troubled by the fact that the task-force which has
been operating in Foleshill and Hillfields is being withdrawn, and with it
the funds which it has brought in: Pounds 6.4m since 1987. This money has
levered in a further Pounds 6.7m from the private sector in a variety of
schemes, ranging from training to the encouragement of new businesses.
Yet Coventry is not without hope of government funding from outside the City
Challenge scheme. At least two of the flagship projects would, in any case,
have required City Grant and this may still be forthcoming.

WHEN Birmingham succeeded in winning a slice of the 1992 City Challenge
funds, the UK's largest metropolitan authority had clearly learned from its
1991 failure.
The rejection of its earlier claim had been quite unexpected, and the city
had wasted bid-preparation time by arguing with the government over the
terms of its claim.
Having assumed that it would be granted funds, because Birmingham is always
granted funds, it came as a shock to be told by the government that it
should be co-operating more with other organisations to secure regeneration.
The 1992 City Challenge bid, however, showed that the city council had
backed away from a century of paternal tradition, and has perhaps finally
shed the notion that it always knows best.
Not only does the bid contain policies which, in Birmingham terms, are
radical indeed, for a devolution of its authority down to the local level as
far as the provision of its own services are concerned, but it was also
based on a massive consultation with local residents.
Newtown-South Aston, the focus of the 1992 bid, is on the north side of the
city centre. Forty-five per cent of the population is Afro-Caribbean or
Asian. Unemployment rates are double the city average, 91 per cent of the
dwellings are council-owned, and 60 per cent of employment is tied to
recession-ridden manufacturing.
The area exemplifies in the most striking fashion that increasingly serious
British urban problem: a district becoming separated from the economic
cycle.
The main spending elements of the plan for Newtown-South Aston are linked,
on one hand, to business development and training, and, on the other, to
housing. A training and education zone will be established, to harness in
partnership all the bodies involved in the sector. Business will be
stimulated, it is hoped, by the provision of new premises on the site of the
old Lucas industrial complex, on land owned by King Edward's Trust and at
the presently woe-begone Newtown shopping centre.
The city council will release its hold on the housing stock to create a
diversity of tenure, while the private sector and housing associations will
be financially primed to build new, and refurbish existing, homes with the
aim of creating a housing market.
This concentration of effort goes beyond the improvement of the physical
fabric of the area, and manifests another new approach by the city council -
an approach linked to its withdrawal from paternalism.
Much city council effort over the past decade has been devoted to the
constructional environment of Birmingham, to the provision of facilities
like the International Convention Centre, which will draw visitors to the
city. Critics, pointing to the under-spending of the education budget,
suggest that too little attention has been paid to the creation of an
educated and well-trained workforce.
In turning to social problems, the city council has become more dependent on
co-operation with other bodies such as the chamber of commerce and the
training and enterprise council.
Such devolution of power and willingness to co-operate has reached its
highest expression in Newtown-South Aston.
But this is just one part of the urban regeneration patchwork. The
establishment of the Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation, to the
east of Newtown-South Aston, puts the city council, with half the members of
the board, into a new financial relationship with central government. The
negotiations for a Housing Action Trust, at the Castle Vale estate, force it
into a new relationship with both tenants and the private sector.
These two developments, with City Challenge, give Birmingham a trio of new
urban revival instruments, carrying total government funds in the order of
Pounds 200m over the next five years. The price for the city council has
been to drop its posturing as an independent fiefdom - though this might
have happened anyway, because the council is looking for friends after the
shock delivered to the controlling Labour group by the latest local election
results.
Birmingham's success in City Challenge brings to four the number of
successful bids, in 1991-92, from the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation.
Wolverhampton won in 1991. Sandwell and Walsall also won this year. The
conurbation is beginning to look like an urban regeneration laboratory.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (9): To new horizons - Transport master
plan / The future of Pakistan's roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS an inspiring goal. Raw materials from the Central Asian republics
would be transported south through Pakistan's newly-modernised road system
to industrial processing zones and onwards to efficient privately-owned
container terminals in Karachi and Port Qasim.
The political and geographical impediments to this strategy are enormous.
Central Asia is separated from Pakistan by three of the world's highest
mountain ranges, while Afghanistan's political maelstrom and Pakistan's own
law and order problems spell difficulty in the fulfilment of this role.
But it is a vision which is driving a vital overhaul of Pakistan's
antiquated transportation system, after decades of neglect.
'There is a dire need of an effective communications system in Pakistan,
especially now. We are anxiously looking forward to connecting the Central
Asian republics with our roads. They are also in need of our seaports', said
federal communications minister Mr Azam Khan Hoti.
One of the major problems affecting transportation in Pakistan is the link
between the southern port city of Karachi and the growing industrial centre
of Lahore. Express trains have been held up by dacoits (local bandits) with
rocket launchers, and vehicles now wait until they can form a convoy with
military escort, before they undertake the treacherous journey. The impact
was demonstrated in a 54 per cent fall in the number of railway passengers
and a 52 per cent drop in freight, in the year to March 1992.
The government has decided to focus its efforts on the road system, coming
up with a five year programme which will cost Rs73bn. The main north-south
highway is to double its existing two lanes. An alternative north-south
route, the Indus Highway, is being improved, but, most significantly, work
has started on a motorway connecting the Frontier capital of Peshawar with
Karachi, via Islamabad and Lahore.
Given its existing debt of Dollars 25bn, Pakistan has tried to entice
foreign capital to build the roads on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis.
Under the new deregulative regime of prime minister Nawaz Sharif, foreigners
had been encouraged to take over the entire project.
Korean construction company Daewoo is to build a 340 kilometre six-lane
highway, running from Islamabad to Lahore. Progress has been made, amidst an
uproar over the Rs23bn cost, the government's debt burden (Daewoo will
contribute only 40 per cent of financing), and accusations of corruption.
It will be a toll road and the Government hopes this will cover the debt
financing. If successful, it would help provide a framework for other
infra-structural projects. Meanwhile, corporations remain concerned over
political stability and the murky issue of Islamic banking regulations - it
is clearly of concern for a company to lend money to a government which may
prohibit interest payments.
The motorway will create an infra-structural corridor through the economic
heartland of Pakistan and should give a boost to industrial investment in
the north. It is due for completion in December 1994.
The rail system has caused more difficulty for the government. It is
over-staffed, inefficient and draining Government funds, making its
attractions for the private sector somewhat limited.
The Government hopes to create rail links with Afghanistan, but is unlikely
to foot the bill. At present, it is looking at selling land and privatising
sections of the organisation to pay for its revival. But it will take a long
time before this network becomes a key link for containers moving south to
Karachi.
Karachi is the largest port city in the Indian Ocean. It has been
government-run and industrialists complain of the cost and inefficiency. The
Government has reacted by privatising many of the operations. It is to set
up a new container terminal on a BOT basis, while the two other ports, Port
Qasim and the country's new deep water port project at Gwadur, will be
primarily controlled by the private sector.
Local newspapers suggest Karachi could become the Rotterdam of Asia. The
presence of an unruly Afghanistan blocking easy access to Central Asia is a
problem. But there is no doubt that the heavy expenditure on the transport
system will finally make viable the government's hopes of introducing export
industries into Pakistan.
Under the present system, one industrialist complained that it cost more to
process cargo through Karachi port and then freight it to Lahore than to
ship it to Pakistan from the Gulf of Mexico.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (10): Frustrations of a land without
telephones - Private money is being mobilised to build up a modern
telecommunications system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH one of the lowest ratios of phones among developing nations, combined
with a burgeoning national debt, the Pakistan government plans to get
somebody else to fund an aggressive expansion programme.
In June 1990, there were only 843,000 lines for a population of 117m. The
government now hopes to have more than 2.3m lines in operation by March
1993.
But it is highly critical of the telecommunications management: by 1991 it
had built up a 70,000 connection back-log, with individuals waiting up to
five years for a phone.
Part of the solution is to encourage private operators to broaden the
service. But the entire Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) is
also to be auctioned to the highest bidder, with no restrictions on
nationality.
Outside capital is being attracted under a scheme called Build Lease and
Transfer (BLT), whereby an outside party installs a set number of lines at a
fixed price.
Once the revenue from the lines pays off their cost, the system is returned
to PTC. It expects an eight-year pay-back, against a 20 year life for the
system. Alcatel, Ericsson and Siemens are to install 500,000 lines by the
end of 1993 under this BLT scheme, and other contracts are being negotiated.
Mobile telecommunications are also being offered to the private sector.
Cable &amp; Wireless and Millicom have both set up systems in a market they
believe should accommodate 35,000 subscribers, within five years of the 1991
launch.
The operators have had strong initial response, aided by the inadequacy of
the existing fixed line system - it could take three years to get a fixed
phone and only 24 hours to get a mobile unit.
But mobile communications is to become more competitive following the issue
of a third licence to a local group, which is holding discussions with
British Telecom and Hutchison Whampoa. It was issued despite an apparent
understanding that, to avoid excess competition, there only be two licences.
There have also been complaints over facilities to link the mobile system
with the fixed line network, with operators objecting to the level of rigid
bureaucracy at PTC.
However, even at PTC the pace of reform has been rapid. Bear Stearns have
been appointed to advise on its privatisation and the government is adamant
it will sell its entire stake in early 1993.
It seems likely to prove one of the more attractive Government offerings,
given the potential returns on assets achievable by phone companies. It has
already been launched as a government-owned corporate entity, to help speed
up the decision-making processes within the group.
There were initial doubts about the sell-off, due to concerns by the army at
possible bugging by a foreign operator, but these have been allayed and the
tendering procedure should start this month.
There is no argument about the inadequacy of the existing operation, which
has suffered from over-staffing and an excessively bureaucratic management.
It currently employs 54,000 people. Under the privatisation scheme,
employees will have a one year guaranteed contract with the new company, and
will then receive a golden hand-shake if forced into retirement.
Because of over-staffing in the public sector this could prove costly. But
the pace of expansion of PTC should limit the impact of lay-offs.
Privatisation has been a useful method of sucking capital from the
underground economy and a number of international telecommunications groups
could link up with Pakistani partners to bid for the system. AT&amp;T, British
Telecom, Cable and Wireless and Singapore Telecom are said to have shown
interest.
But the government will first have to still concerns that any future regime
might scrap foreign ownership of the phone network.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (4): A changing world - Foreign policy is
in flux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN, created to form a home for the Moslems of British India, has spent
the following 45 years focused on preserving the integrity of its borders.
Preoccupation with India to the east and Afghanistan to the north-west has
been the driving force behind foreign policy.
It has contributed to the sway held by the military in Pakistani politics.
But it has also led Pakistan to bolster its security by seeking friends
further afield.
However, the collapse of the Soviet Union has opened up uncertainties for
Pakistan as for many other countries.
The struggle in Afghanistan helped Islamabad to forge close cooperation with
the US to counter the Soviet presence. Washington is now much less
interested in Afghanistan. It had also perceived Ms Benazir Bhutto, who
cultivated close ties with the US, as a friend.
Since her dismissal as prime minister in 1990, the US has been suspicious of
Pakistan's tendencies towards Islamisation and has cut off new military and
economic aid because of Pakistan's nuclear programme. Even more ominously
for Islamabad, the US has recently been improving its relations with India,
Pakistan's arch enemy.
The reduced polarisation of world politics has also reduced the importance
of bodies such as the Non-Aligned Movement, in which Pakistan has played a
prominent role. But it has made no difference to its long friendship with
China, with which it shares a mountainous border. As a sign of the
continuing closeness, Pakistan's state airline is considering opening a new
direct route to Shenzhen, the southern Chinese special economic zone.
As a nation originally defined by Islam, Pakistan has developed quite close
political and economic relationships in the Middle East - it has a western
border with Iran.
However, it has had to pursue a careful line in Middle East conflicts and
also has to be conscious of tensions with its own Shiite minority. During
the Gulf crisis, the interim government between those of Ms Bhutto and Mr
Nawaz Sharif condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and swiftly sent troops to
Saudi Arabia.
As it embarks on a drive to modernise and open its economy, Pakistan is
seeking a new identity and new friends.
Mr Sharif, the prime minister, has seized upon the Soviet break-up as
providing Pakistan with the opportunity for a new foreign policy thrust. He
is aggressively seeking to boost trade and political relations with the new
central Asian republics, with which it shares proximity though no borders.
The new vision is of Pakistan providing the transport links and entrepots
for the developing nations of central Asia, which have plenty of raw
materials but poorly-developed industry and infrastructure. Mr Sharif has
already visited several of the five republics, and also played host: the
Uzbek president was his guest at Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations
last month.
It is an ambitious move, which might bring benefits to Pakistan. However,
the new republics have plenty of competing suitors. A recent visitor to
Uzbekistan found it full of Turkish businessmen. Some observers feel that
the republics will prefer to throw in their lot with more European, secular
states rather than one which is tending towards Islamisation.
Meanwhile, China is also busy developing economic relations with the
emerging republics, opening up its Xinjiang region along the lines of its
southern coastal areas. And the republics still have important practical
ties with Moscow. Moreover, Pakistan's success in forging central Asian
links will largely depend on peace in Afghanistan, through which new roads
north must pass.
Pakistan viewed with dismay the violence in Kabul during August, in which at
least 2,000 people died. Many in the government blamed the violence on the
mujahedin leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whom Pakistan had principally backed
in the 13-year civil war.
Some in Pakistan, however, sympathised with Mr Hekmatyar's wish to expel
from the Afghan capital the Uzbek militia force, led by Gen Rashid Dostum,
which has been supporting the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
They felt that the government had not stood by its commitments to Mr
Hekmatyar.
Pakistan had helped to broker the April Peshawar accord between rival
guerrilla groups and since violence erupted has been seeking to patch a new
agreement between them.
Though the Soviet threat has gone, Pakistan has several interests in a
peaceful resolution in Afghanistan. It has been playing host to the
guerrilla groups as well as to millions of Afghan refugees. It wants to stop
rampant smuggling, including arms and drugs, over the border. It wants to
establish the still unresolved line of the border. It wants above all to
avoid a break-up of Afghanistan which could foment ethnic instability within
Pakistan. And it wants a growth of trade.
Pakistan's most obsessive foreign policy problem, however, remains India,
with whom it is in a permanent state of near-war, with the risk of nuclear
arms being deployed if hostilities broke out.
As recently as 1990, movement of troops on both sides prompted the US to
send an emissary urging restraint. Mr Shahid Javed Burki, a Pakistani who
heads the World Bank's China desk, commented in a recent book*: 'India and
Pakistan continued to coexist in an unstable environment in South Asia, with
their leaders not beyond risking war for short-term political gains.'
The biggest cause of dispute is Kashmir, the predominantly Moslem area
claimed by both countries but mostly controlled by India, which has 400,000
troops deployed there to keep insurrection under control. It says Kashmir is
a domestic Indian problem. Indian and Pakistani troops daily watch each
other nervously across the 'line of control' which runs through Kashmir and
there is frequent shooting.
The most positive sign for some time came in August, when senior officials
met in New Delhi and agreed that India and Pakistan should hold further
talks on Kashmir - though there was no sign of either softening its
entrenched position.
Kashmiris appear unenthusiastic about being part of either India or
Pakistan, and want a UN-sponsored plebiscite. Earlier this year, Kashmiri
militants attempted to march across the line of control from the Pakistani
side, but were turned back by Pakistani troops.
Mr Amanullah Khan, leader of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, comments
bitterly: 'The only thing India and Pakistan agree on is opposition to the
independence of the state of Kashmir.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (5): Soft-sell becomes harder / A look at
prospects for winning foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN now offers a more liberal package for foreign investment than any
other country in Asia, according to finance minister Mr Sartaj Aziz.
With tax holidays and no restrictions on foreign ownership or foreign
currency repatriation, the gauntlet has been thrown down to overseas
corporations to ignore the exotic allure of the South East Asian export
processing zones and come to Pakistan; so far they have shown little
interest.
The country offers a buoyant economy, cheap labour force and a government
commitment to privatisation, deregulation and development. But there are
still numerous obstacles to be overcome before it can beat the aggressive
competition for limited capital flows.
One impediment appears to be its desire to copy the blueprint for foreign
investment set down by Thailand and China, instead of concentrating on its
own individual strengths and admitting its not insubstantial weaknesses.
A local economist claims there are four major keys to bringing in foreign
capital: the government's big initiative on privatisation and deregulation
has to be seen to work; the government must develop a coherent strategy on
how to facilitate inward investment; it has to be able to delineate and sell
its strengths; and there has to be a nationwide commitment towards wanting
foreign interest.
'The Pakistanis aren't very good at selling themselves', he argued. These
are not insuperable problems, but they are not helped by the unrewarding
complexity of doing business in Pakistan.
Japanese posted there complain of working in an alcohol-free and
entertainment-free environment. While almost all overseas investors
encounter an alien business culture, where the threat of Islamisation may
have little real impact, it certainly serves as another psychological
barrier.
But prime minister Nawaz Sharif's attack on so-called 'red-tapeism',
combined with the most aggressive privatisation programme to hit Asia, is
undoubtedly the right way forward and it is already having some positive
repercussions.
Mr Naseem Mirza, chairman of ICI Pakistan, says that under the previous
regime he spent much of his time commuting to the capital Islamabad, because
committee approval was required for everything. This has already changed.
ICI is making the most of the current deregulative environment. It is to
spend Rs1bn on the expansion of its soda ash plant, which supplies material
to the glass industry, and on its own power station, to protect itself from
local electricity shortages.
Pak Suzuki, a joint venture between Suzuki and the government, controls more
than 70 per cent of the local market and has recently expanded capacity,
despite complaints over the government control of pricing. Suzuki is
interested in buying out the government's stake and Toyota is setting up an
assembly plant.
Foreign companies are also involved in developing the country's backward
infrastructure. But these are all small gestures and go little way towards
absorbing the 13 per cent of Pakistan's workforce that is officially
unemployed, and providing a much-needed source of foreign income, to offset
reliance on foreign loans.
At present, Pakistan has only one sizeable industry, textiles; but it is an
industry where it has major advantages which could be further exploited
through the use of foreign capital and technology.
Pakistan has the world's third largest cotton crop and a large and skilled
workforce. This is mainly employed in spinning yarn, but the Government is
providing incentives to encourage higher value added weaving and garment
manufacturing, with reductions on export duties and indirect tax.
Foreign business could play an important and profitable role in this
transformation. Agri-business is another potential target. It has been the
major engine of economic growth, but could benefit from further western
expertise.
So far, there has been a muted reaction to the new Special Industrial Zones.
Seven more zones are to built along the new Lahore-Islamabad motorway;
electricity, water, workers and efficient roads in these zones help to
shelter foreign investments from Pakistan's infrastructural problems and
instability.
But export-oriented businesses' only concerns are the cost of production,
efficiency of transportation and political and economic stability of the
production base; Pakistan has yet to prove itself a viable option under
these criteria.
It has an average wage of around Dollars 100 a month and although in basic
manufacturing industry, workers are paid as little as Dollars 70, this is
still higher than other Asian export processing centres such as China and
Indonesia.
Industrialists argue that Pakistan's attraction must be for higher value
added production, aimed primarily at the local rather than export market
place. The country's official GDP per head is only Dollars 415, but the true
figure could be double that, once the cash generated by drugs, arms and
unregistered cottage industries has been factored in.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Spurs back in black with Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, the football club controlled by Mr Alan Sugar and Mr
Terry Venables, turned round from a Pounds 1.78m pre-tax loss to a profit of
Pounds 2.66m in the year to May 31.
Mr Sugar, chairman, whose other company Amstrad sells satellite dishes,
commented on the opportunities offered to Tottenham from the deal between
the Premier League and BSkyB.
Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said the club could earn anything from
Pounds 1m to over Pounds 2m, compared with hundreds of thousands from the
previous deal for league games.
Borrowings were reduced from nearly Pounds 11m to Pounds 4.3m, with the help
of a Pounds 7m rights issue, and net assets improved to Pounds 22m (Pounds
12.1m). The interest bill declined to Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 2.29m).
Turnover rose to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 18.2m) and operating profit amounted
to Pounds 3.84m (Pounds 512,000). Earnings per share emerged at 20.2p
(losses of 17.3p).
No dividend could be paid because of a lack of distributable reserves on May
31. A transfer from the share premium account has since righted this and Mr
Sugar said there would be a special interim dividend.
The figures did not include the Pounds 5.4m received from Lazio of Italy for
Paul Gascoigne. Mr Sandy said that since the year-end a total of Pounds
8.15m had come in from player sales while Pounds 6.25m had been spent on
seven players.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Margins come under pressure at Campari
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong pressure on margins led Campari International, the sporting
leisurewear group, to report a one third fall in profits in its seasonally
unfavourable first half.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 dipped to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 19.5m)
reflecting the dull men's wear market in the UK. Interest received fell from
Pounds 338,000 to Pounds 263,000, leaving profits before tax at Pounds 1.03m
(Pounds 1.53m).
However, Mr Christopher Cheng, chairman, said the group's autumn ranges had
been 'well-received'. Sales so far in the second half and forward orders
were 'comfortably ahead' of last year.
The interim dividend is lifted to 3.25p (3p), payable from earnings of 7.27p
(11.15p) per share.

Gabicci, the USM-quoted casual clothing group, reported a sharp contraction
in annual profits, reflecting falling consumer demand for its core men's
wear brand.
On turnover down 18 per cent to Pounds 20m, pre-tax profits for the year to
June 19 fell 63 per cent to Pounds 524,000 (Pounds 1.43m) after exceptional
costs of Pounds 250,000.
However, Mr Jack Sofier, chairman, said indications for the spring were
'looking positive' and exports, particularly to the US, were 'quite
buoyant.'
Earnings per share dropped from 8.8p to 2.9p. The final dividend is cut to
0.6p (2.85p) reducing the total to 2p (4.25p).
Losses and the cost of closing the Gransden Casualwear offshoot were taken
as a Pounds 314,000 extraordinary charge.

On turnover of Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 26.8m), the pre-tax balance emerged at
Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 2.16m).
Mr Charles Dobson, chairman, said that sales of signmaking computers were

first half of 1992, against losses of Pounds 354,000, which included an

Turnover was lower at Pounds 9.22m (Pounds 9.64m) and trading profits

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Polypipe advances to Pounds 15.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYPIPE, the fast growing Doncaster-based manufacturer of plastic pipes and
fittings, raised annual pre-tax profits by 11 per cent, from Pounds 13.9m to
Pounds 15.4m.
Turnover in the 12 months to June 30 increased by 33 per cent to Pounds 108m
(Pounds 81.2m), buoyed by a full-year contribution from activities bought
during 1990-91. The three businesses acquired earlier this year contributed
Pounds 10m.
Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman and managing director, said the disproportionate
rise in turnover disguised 'a strong performance by our core plastic pipe
and fittings interests.'
He added that the inclusion of the newly acquired businesses, including some
acquired from receivers which historically operated on lower margins, helped
explain the apparent decline in overall margins.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 13.7m) and included a
Pounds 200,000 loss incurred by GCA Windows and Aquapipes, two businesses
acquired in October last year which contributed Pounds 6m to turnover.
The core plastic pipes and fittings business increased its market share and
posted operating profits of Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 11.2m), while other plastic
products, including the Oasis Leisure garden furniture business acquired in
early 1991, recorded operating profits of Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 2.51m).
Since the end of June, Aquapipes, which makes single and twin-wall drainage
and ducting systems for civil engineering, construction and land reclamation
projects, had achieved 'acceptable margins.'
GCA Windows, which makes PVCu double glazed window units for industrial and
local authority applications, is expected to produce acceptable margins
shortly.
The Fordam cistern business, which was acquired from Spring Ram in August
last year, had been transferred from Wolverhampton to Doncaster and
'successfully merged' with Polypipe's subsidiary, Derwent MacDee.
Interest charges of Pounds 54,000 in the 12 months compared to Pounds
205,000 in receipts previously. Despite increasing capital expenditure to
Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 8.1m) and assuming Pounds 4m of debt through
acquisitions, Polypipe had net cash of Pounds 800,000 at the year end.
Earnings per share were 6.69p (6.63p), on capital increased by the Pounds
13.6m share placing earlier this year to fund the acquisitions.
The proposed final dividend of 1.34p (1.275p) lifts the total for the year
to 1.97p (1.875p).
COMMENT
Polypipe has managed to shrug off the recession so far, and pick up some
cheap acquisitions with good growth prospects on the way. One reason why it
has been able to buck the trend is that only 12 per cent of its business
comes from new buildings. Among its recent acquisitions the purchase of
Aquapipes should help extend its business in the water industry where
plastic is slowly replacing clay and concrete, particularly as new
investment in equipment to produce large diameter twin-wall pipes comes on
stream. The management is confident that it can improve efficiency further
and plans another Pounds 12m in capital expenditure this year. Together with
the restructuring of its recently acquired businesses this should help
improve margins. The full year pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 17m looks
reasonable. On yesterday's close of 100p, the prospective multiple is about
13.5 and the stock still looks attractive.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Halls Homes &amp; Gardens taken over by

   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALLS Homes &amp; Gardens, the USM-quoted manufacturer of conservatories, garden
buildings and home improvement products, yesterday had its shares suspended
and passed into the hands of receivers.
The action jeopardises a Pounds 1.5m debt-into-equity swap agreed by
National Westminster, its bankers, in February last year, which reduced
borrowings to about Pounds 6.3m.
NatWest subscribed in full to a 1.5m issue of 7 per cent preference shares
of Pounds 1 par redeemable in 1993-95. The company launched a Pounds 3.2m
rights issue at the same time without which it said it would 'almost
certainly be unable to continue trading'.
Mr Tony Houghton and Mr John Richards, partners in accountants Touche Ross,
were appointed receivers.
Mr Houghton said the company had suffered from the effects of the recession,
which reduced demand for its products, cut margins and put pressure on
liquidity.
But he added a note of optimism for the employees and creditors. He said
that receivership allowed him to 'run the business as a going concern with a
view to selling it on as such'.
'We will be looking to do so once we have had time to fully investigate,' he
added.
Mr Neil Curtin, the managing director who was appointed last November, was
last night unavailable for comment.
Halls Homes &amp; Gardens was established in 1934 and came to the USM in 1986.
It currently employs 175 people, primarily at two sites in Kent. It also has
a long lease on a paint factory in the region.
In the latest full accounts for the 12 months to December 31 last year, the
company showed a loss of Pounds 7.2m on a turnover of Pounds 20.8m. It had
net current liabilities of Pounds 3.5m.
In the first half of this year it returned into the black with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 529,000 on turnover of Pounds 12.7m. It declared no
dividend.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Logica almost doubled at Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOGICA, the computing services company, saw pre-tax profits almost double
last year as its troubled North American subsidiary returned to the black.
The shares rose 10p to close at 140p.
Profits before tax were Pounds 7.06m. Last time's Pounds 3.7m was struck
after restructuring costs of Pounds 6.4m. Sales were slightly higher at
Pounds 200.4m (Pounds 197.8).
Earnings per share were 7p, against losses of 1.6p after a higher tax charge
of Pounds 4.64m resulting from overseas losses. The proposed final dividend
is 2.5p making a total of 3.65p (3.5p) for the year.
Year-end cash balances stood at Pounds 13.7m, against Pounds 15m at the
beginning of the year.
The results have been depressed for the past two years by a combination of
the recession in the UK and steep losses in North America.
This year sales in the UK grew from Pounds 114m to Pounds 122m with profits
slipping from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 7.1m. North American revenues slipped
from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 23.8m, but the subsidiary ended up Pounds
550,000 in the black, compared with a loss of Pounds 2.7m.
The main reversal was in mainland Europe where profits of Pounds 2m last
year became a Pounds 1.7m loss as the German economy deteriorated.
Mr David Mann, Logica managing director, said he did not expect to see much
of a contribution to profits from mainland Europe or elsewhere outside the
UK in the coming year. Priority in North America was being given to
investment in marketing and sales. Exchange rate movements had contributed
nothing to the results.
COMMENT
Logica has put up a strong performance in its key market, the UK, in
atrocious conditions. The computing services sector is suffering unrelieved
gloom at present so analysts are taking a cautious view of Logica's
improvement. Nevertheless, the management's decision to cut hard and deep
last year has been vindicated and the North American black hole has been
plugged. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 10m next year, giving a prospective p/e
of 13.8, would not seem ambitious.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Christies deems dividend cut wise 'in
uncharted territory'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIES International, the auction house, cut its interim dividend from
2.3p to 0.5p yesterday.
The move followed the reduction in the 1991 dividend from 8.3p to 3.3p
through a 5p cut in the final payment.
Christies had said in March that the lower level of dividends should be seen
as a base for the future.
Yesterday Mr Christopher Davidge, managing director, said that the group had
been expecting an upturn towards the end of the current year, but that had
not happened.
Now, he said, 'we are living in uncharted territory.' The interim payment
was prudent and a judgment would be made at the year end.
If the board had declared an uncovered dividend, he said, it would have
implied that it knew what the future held.
Earnings per share fell from 0.98p to 0.7p. Christies' shares fell 3p to
105p.
The group's interim pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.04m to Pounds 2.11m
due to lower interest receivable of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.4m).
Operating profits rose from Pounds 608,000 to Pounds 718,000 on increased
turnover of Pounds 51.4m (Pounds 50.6m).
Lord Carrington, chairman, said: 'We recognise that we have much to do to
provide our shareholders with an acceptable return.' He is stepping down
next May in favour of Sir Anthony Tennant, although he will remain a
non-executive director.
He said 'conditions in the art market were little changed in the six months
ended June 30.' The balance sheet still had net cash of Pounds 16m at June
30, which gave the group flexibility and security.
Mr Davidge said auction sales of Pounds 290m (Pounds 286m) had been at about
that level for three halves now.
Private treaty sales rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 17m, however, including
the sale to the National Gallery for Pounds 10m of Hans Holbein's portrait
of A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling.
During the half year Christies also handled the sale of a Canaletto for
Pounds 10.1m.
Mr Davidge said that although there was a good mixture of works for sale in
the second half, there was 'nothing headline fetching.'
Christies had 23 items to sell, which would raise more than Dollars 1m
(Pounds 500,000). In addition a Dollars 50m Impressionist sale and a Dollars
30m contemporary art sale were coming up.

FT  18 SEP 92 / People: Aegis reforms its board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aegis, the group which specialises in buying and planning advertising space,
has had a turbulent year.
It forced out its highly-paid chairman and chief executive, Peter Scott, in
July, and its share price has slid from a peak of 215p in October 1991 to
under 30p now. At the time, Scott's departure and the greater influence over
the company of its largest shareholder, SFEC, were seen by some analysts as
a a 'French coup'.
Yesterday, in the aftermath of the Scott upheaval, four new Aegis directors
have been appointed.
Two relative youngsters joining the board as executives are Bruno Kemoun,
35, and Eryck Rebbouh, 36, both French. Their careers have moved along very
similar lines and in the French advertising world they are widely known as
'the twins'; they have been joint managing directors of Carat France since
1990.
They are joined by the positively youthful Dominic Shorthouse, who at 30 is
a vice-president of Warburg Pincus, the US investment bank and other major
shareholder. Shorthouse becomes a non executive director, adding to his
London Weekend Television directorship.
Ray Kelly, the Richard Branson look-alike chairman and chief executive of
Carat UK, one of Aegis' operating companies, has also been appointed an
Aegis director.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (3): Battling with market forces
 -Merseyside needs the kind of aid that City Challenge offers / Ian Hamilton
Fazey depicts a winning conurbation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE government put urban funding up for competition in 1991, it changed
the rules governing City Challenge after the first 16 local authorities had
been allowed into the fray.
They had been picked by civil servants to fight each other for 10 prizes of
Pounds 7.5m each for five years; but when the winners were announced, there
were 11 - and one extra competitor had been let in, bringing the field up to
17.
Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, said two local authorities
had made bids of such equal merit that it would have been unfair to choose
between them.
He would not say which they were, but the evidence now suggests that they
were Liverpool and Wirral, giving Merseyside two winners in one year, a
politically surprising result.
As in many a contest, coincidence and luck played an unfair part. Mr
Heseltine was scheduled for a routine ministerial visit to Wirral the day
after last year's local government elections, but Ms Yvonne Nolan, Labour
leader of the council who supported non-payment of the poll tax, lost her
seat, throwing the arranged programme into disarray.
In stepped Mr Alan White, the council's thrusting chief executive, to fill
the gap. He and his economic development team had been stung at being
excluded from the City Challenge race so as to allow Liverpool a clear run
as Merseyside's sole representative.
He made the most of having a captive audience, won his argument and Wirral
won the extra prize.
This year, Merseyside's other dockland borough - Sefton - was also among the
winners, which means the county now has three dollops of Pounds 7.5m-a-year
of City Challenge money.
This is on top of the annual Pounds 20m-plus that Merseyside Development
Corporation has been getting since 1981 and extensive disbursement
throughout the county of derelict land grants, urban development grants and
city action grants for private sector projects.
Merseyside needs this sort of aid, because market forces have been running
against it for most of this century. The pattern of world trade changed. So
did shipping technology. The resultant problems took generations to reach
crisis point, but may also take generations to solve. Local political
extremism is easier to understand when set against the frustrations
involved.
Economic structure is central to any analysis. There is too narrow a base of
industries, a poor mix of big and small employers, and a tradition of low
skilled labouring among too many male workers. Add social and housing
distress, and the most sustained depopulation in Britain is explained:
Liverpool is about two-thirds the size it was in the 1950s.
The pattern and effect of targeting spending since 1979 is now emerging.
Government urban policy initially concentrated on restoring the Liverpool
waterfront, control of which was removed from the city council, and on
several large projects in the conurbation.
The Albert Dock, which now attracts more than 6m visitors a year, is one
example of outstanding success. So is Wavertree Technology Park, which has
brought hundreds of high-technology jobs into Liverpool; so too is Ravenhead
Renaissance, which is reclaiming acres of land poisoned by 18th and 19th
century glass and chemicals works in the middle of St Helens.
The three City Challenge schemes will fill important gaps. All derive from
the changing nature of Merseyside as a port. The port is actually thriving
again now, thanks to demanning, modern technology, and Britain's most
successful freeport - an area within the docks with a VAT-free internal
taxation regime.
But it is Merseyside's redundant dockland, designed for an age of small
general cargo ships and manual handling of cargoes, that has been the root
cause of physical and infrastructural problems.
In Liverpool, this centred on the waterfront and several miles of small,
disused general cargo docks. In Wirral, it was a half-redundant, but still
active docklands area between Wallasey and Birkenhead. In Sefton, it was in
Bootle - where most of the docks are still use, but their hinterland is
shabby, and looks as though it has never quite got over the May blitz of
1941.
Indeed, whenever the Luftwaffe bombed the port, they usually hit Bootle. The
devastation was so bad that it was an official secret until public records
were opened in 1971.
This will even affect what happens now. Mr Chris Oldershaw, who has led most
of the work on Sefton's City Challenge, says some areas may have to remain
undeveloped: several large public shelters were hit by bombs and sealed with
bodies unrecovered. They are unmarked war graves, but Mr Oldershaw says
local people know where they are and do not want them touched.
However, this will not stand in the way of council tenants being relocated
away from the docks, where their lives have been blighted by dust from
imported coal. A buffer zone of industry will separate docks and housing, a
large business park will be built within the freeport, better roads will
improve links to Liverpool and the motorway network, and Bootle town centre
will get new offices and shops.
The resurgent Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC) will be one of
Sefton's main partners, along with P&amp;O Properties and Neptune, a Merseyside
property development company.
The MDHC will also be prominent in Wirral's City Challenge area, which
straddles Birkenhead docks. The freeport is being extended to these
docklands, where dockside land is being cleared for factories.
Park Food Group will also be active, expanding on to derelict land it has
bought next to its premises. A sports centre will be built nearby, next to
the training ground of Tranmere Rovers, the football club which Mr Peter
Johnson, Park's chairman, also owns.
The council has already built a strong partnership with the private sector
called the Wirral Investment Network (WIN). Mr Peter Coffey, the City
Challenge director, says this will play a full role, along with a Community
Action Network (CAN) formed by the 29,000 people living in the area -
CAN-WIN, in combination.
While Sefton's challenge area also has 29,000 people in it, Liverpool's is
very different, with only 4,000. Its problems are, however, just as much a
legacy of changed economic structure, for the area is in the city centre.
As if to underline the legacy of bygone days of frenetic Atlantic trading
and emigrations to the US, there are 890 listed buildings. Keynote projects
include the refurbishment of the Philharmonic concert hall, and the creation
of a 'fame' school - the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts - out of a
listed, disused school.
Littlewoods, Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo, and Royal Insurance are all
actively involved with the city council. So are the city's two universities
 -Liverpool and John Moores - and the government's Merseyside task-force of
civil servants. Neptune Developments and Amey Hynd, a local construction
company, are other players.
In spite of this necessarily large network of concerned involvement, Mr
Peter Wilson, who has been seconded from the task-force to be deputy
director of the challenge team, says: 'We have made the structure as simple
and informal as possible. If we try to be too formal, things might become
more time-consuming for senior people in the private sector.'
The best news for Merseyside, however, is that in all three City Challenge
areas, private-sector commitment looks large and secure. To the world at
large, this is important in a community where partnership had no hope in the
divisive, politically sectarian days of the mid-1980s, when Militant pulled
Labour's strings.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (4): Even the unsuccessful value
the contacts made - In reviewing the achievements of City Challenge, Andrew
Adonis finds that it has not entirely silenced its critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY CHALLENGE is the government's flagship programme for urban
regeneration.
Launched by Mr Michael Heseltine, in his second stint at the Environment
Department between the end of 1990 and this year's general election, it has
now gone through two rounds, embraces 30 of England's 57 urban priority
areas (UPAs), and will consume more than Pounds 1bn of central government
urban programme funding over the next six years, around a sixth of the
total.
'City Challenge is about vision, quality, partnership and expecting local
authorities to lead their communities with flair and imagination,' declared
Mr Heseltine, announcing the first-round winners last year.
In more concrete terms, four principles underlie City Challenge. They are
that:
Local authorities should work with their local business and voluntary
sectors in forming and implementing regeneration plans;
Government funding for urban regeneration should be used as 'leverage' for
contributions from the private sector and other public bodies;
Councils should prioritise their aspirations and give real impetus to the
most urgent;
Long-term funding should be available to see projects through to completion,
freeing regeneration projects from the tyranny of the annual public spending
round.
Most City Challenge winners have chosen to manage implementation through an
arm's-length company broadly representative of the main development
partners. This is not a requirement of the scheme, but is looked upon
favourably by ministers.
To give an edge to the process, City Challenge was designed as a
competition, forcing councils to bid against each other for available funds.
The 'losers', it was hoped, would gain tips from the 'winners', so that they
could win on the next round. Since virtually all the 57 eligible authorities
are Labour-controlled, the room for political favouritism is limited - and
appears to have played little part in deciding the winners.
City Challenge was greeted with near universal cynicism by councillors in
the UPAs, but it now receives endorsements (albeit qualified) from
surprising quarters. Few council leaders deny the value of contacts and
efforts made in preparing City Challenge bids. Many of them also appreciate
the spin-offs, not least the regular bringing together of ministers and
Labour councillors to discuss objectives and problems, one aspect of the
steadily improving relationship between central and local government.
'Now I feel I can get on the phone to Redwood (the local government
minister) to talk things over,' says one London borough leader, not noted
for cordiality towards Tory politicians.
Labour objects to the competitive bidding element, 'losing' councils
protesting loudest. There is also concern at the inflexibility of the
scheme: all winners in the first two rounds got Pounds 37.5m over five
years, whether Barnsley or Birmingham, and they are were required to show a
'leverage ratio' of government to private and other public funding of at
least 3:1 to stand a chance of winning.
The greatest source of complaint, however, is the way City Challenge is
resourced - by 'top slicing' of funds, mainly from the four main existing
urban programmes. For losers in both rounds to date, notably cities like
Bristol, Leeds and Sheffield, the grant implications are alarming. They
could become more serious still if, as rumoured, urban funding suffers in
this autumn's public spending round, because existing City Challenge funding
is guaranteed to winners in the first two rounds regardless of future cuts
to the budgets from which they are drawn.
Such cuts could also put paid to the third round of City Challenge,
currently pencilled in for 1994.
'If there isn't enough cash for at least 15 winners, it won't be worth
doing,' says one insider. 'To offer five or six would look ridiculous.'
Projects funded in the first two rounds fall broadly into three categories:
those for run-down areas of cities, aiming to link them in to their local
economies (like Birmingham's Newtown project); those for redeveloping other
areas of cities, linking projects in to neighbouring areas of deprivation
(like Nottingham's plans to relocate the Sneiton wholesale market to release
the site for office, retail and workspace); and 'single town' bids, where
Pounds 37.5m plus leverage ought to enable a medium-sized town at least to
tackle most of its urban problems. The second-round awards to Kirklees (for
Keighley), Sunderland, Stockton and Hartlepool fall into this last category.
Taking the two rounds and all the bids together, how is the initiative
developing?
Mr Chris Griffin, of Victor Hausner Associates, which advises the
Environment Department on City Challenge, sees a 'significant advance in
understanding by councils as to what is wanted'. This is evidenced, he
argues, partly in their selection of development areas and partly in the
quality of their proposed partnerships with the voluntary and business
sectors.
'There is much more local analysis and prioritisation, and much heavier
involvement by the other partners,' he says. 'The second-round winners took
on board better than the first the need for an integrated strategy rather
than just a shopping list of worthwhile projects with 'hopefully' written by
the side.'
Nonetheless, Mr Griffin believes that greater effort is needed to develop
indigenous industries, and he describes many of the estimates of income to
be 'leveraged' from the private sector as 'little more than fingers in the
wind.' He is careful to add, though, that where there is no a single large
developer with the necessary land - as with the Derby and Nottingham schemes
 -it is difficult to be more precise.
Studies of the respective success of winners in realising their projected
'leverage' will make important reading in a few years' time. More
immediately pressing for the winners is establishing their executive teams
and local companies, and getting their projects and partners finalised and
signed up.
As for the losers, Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, claims
that the experience of applying alone will bear fruit. 'The map plan
unsuccessful authorities have drawn up will provide a focus for future
development of their area, and may be used as a basis to make progress
through private and public funding of some initiatives.'
'Weasel words: in reality, it's cuts all round,' says the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities.
Much depends on whether or not there is a round three. If there is, the main
losers in the second round will make herculean efforts not to lose out again
(as did Birmingham when it lost the first time); and ministers will be under
pressure not to award two pots of gold to the same authority. None of the
winners in round one won in round two.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (18): Take a mobile phone - Tips for the
business visitor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan offers significant opportunities for foreign companies seeking to
export, import, or invest. Here are a few tips for visitors.
Pakistan is a Moslem country, and visitors should dress and act
appropriately. Alcohol is banned, though drinking does take place illegally
in private homes. An exception is made for non-Moslem visitors, who are
allowed to order drink from room service in their hotels. They must sign
several forms - including one swearing that the alcohol is for medical
purposes - and must not offer it to Moslems.
If you are arriving or travelling by air in Pakistan, try not to do so when
a very very important person is doing the same thing. 'VVIP Movement' closes
airports and delays all flights for the rest of the day.
Reservations on all flights need to be confirmed and re-confirmed. Take
nothing for granted and be at the airport by the required check-in time, as
flights are crowded and there is constant jockeying for places. This is
partly because Pakistan has a Brazil-like triangle of cities. Karachi in the
south is the business and industrial centre, Lahore is the largest city and
capital of Punjab province, and Islamabad in the north is the federal
capital, built in the 1960s in the suburbs of nearby Rawalpindi.
Most business travellers will want to fly rather than take trains which are
slow and, in the south, may not be safe. Avoid road travel in Sindh province
away from Karachi - though the recent army crackdown has, at least for the
time being, considerably reduced the risk from dacoits, or highway robbers,
who go in, among other things, for kidnapping and extortion.
Telephone lines are unreliable and of poor quality. In Karachi, it can take
hours to make a successful connection on a local call. Numbers are
frequently changed without notice. This creates problems in setting up
appointments and underlines the need for reliable local help in fixing up
meetings before you arrive in Pakistan.
A relatively cheap aid is a cellular phone, which can be rented for
Rs1,500-1,800 a week, with a charge of Rs4 per minute for airtime plus the
regular phone bill. Though this does not bypass the telephone network, it
does enable you to make calls between appointments.
However, the waiting time for installing new telephone lines has dropped
sharply - it used to be three to five years - and contracts with foreign
suppliers are likely to hasten the process.
Economic reform has already made doing business much easier. At least in
theory, investments and most other business decisions no longer need
official sanction. However, it is still useful to do homework on which
bureaucrats you need to see in which ministry. It is also advisable, if
considering an investment, to make a full check on the relevant
infrastructure, such as power, water and roads.
Health hazards are those common to most Asian countries. Avoid tap water,
ice and salads. Before ordering seafood in the north, consider the distance
it must travel to get there. Consult your doctor about inoculations. If you
plan to travel in the far north, remember the altitude.
Pakistan offers beautiful scenery, especially in the north, and tremendous
opportunities for trekking, climbing, or just plain walking. Flights are
available from Islamabad to Gilgit, or you can try the Karakoram Highway. A
short, easy car trip from Islamabad into the hills would take in the former
hill station of Murree, and Bhurban, where a new luxury Pearl Continental
hotel has just opened. From there you can see mountains stretching away to
the horizon and be back in Islamabad by lunchtime. Taxila, an important
archaeological site dating back at least to the 6th century BC, is also
close by.
If you want a taste of the north-west frontier, go to Peshawar, a bustling
city where just about anything is traded. Before attempting more adventurous
travel, remember the unstable situation in Afghanistan and the high tension
in Kashmir - it is not possible to cross the line of control into
Indian-held Kashmir.
The main hotels are important centres of social life for the elite: the
Holiday Inn in Islamabad and Karachi (both soon to become the Marriott);
also in Karachi, the Sheraton, Pearl Continental and Awari Towers; the Awari
and Pearl Continental in Lahore.
Superb carpets, especially from Afghanistan, are by far the best items for
the acquisitive visitor to target. Leather and cotton goods are also of good
quality.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan 17): Slow march to full democracy -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN faces a clear political challenge: to move beyond the legacy of
military rule and firmly establish the acceptance of democracy.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, rules with a parliamentary majority in
Islamabad and his IDA (Islamic Democratic Alliance) coalition controls the
four provincial governments.
But in a country ruled by army generals for 24 of the 45 years years since
independence, Mr Sharif's government has yet to demonstrate clearly that it
has full control. Suspicions continue over the army's aspirations to
manipulate politics from behind the scenes.
The government at times appears constrained by a complex informal
decision-making structure, often called the 'troika', consisting of the army
chief, the president and the prime minister.
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, an ex-bureaucrat and formerly one of General
Zia-ul-Haq's most trusted ministers, has wide constitutional powers to
dissolve the parliament. Two years ago, he exercised them by dismissing the
government of Ms Benazir Bhutto, which itself had unexpectedly come to power
in elections after the death of Gen Zia in an air crash in 1988.
A government minister recently conceded that there is continuing nervousness
over the fact that 'national politics and economic affairs need one clear
decision making structure to go ahead rather than a divided one'.
In public, army leaders and politicians deny that there are rifts between
competing interests on important policy issues. But events such as a recent
army-backed crackdown in the southern province of Sindh early this summer
caused divisions between civilian and military leaders over the conduct of
the operation.
Mr Sharif's ruling alliance has been faced with rumours of an imminent
change of government, prompted by splits, first with the conservative
Jamaat-I-Islami party and subsequently with a Karachi-based powerful
regional party, the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement).
The opposition PDA (People's Democratic Alliance), led by Ms Bhutto,
recently announced that it would submit en-masse resignations of its members
from national and provincial assemblies to force a crisis which would lead
to national elections. However, the opposition has yet to announce a date
for such action.
PDA politicians concede that the decision is difficult because, if it failed
to induce a crisis, their withdrawal could simply lead to by-elections for
the vacant seats. Moreover, the opposition has still to generate enough
public support.
The result is that, to the extent that it is possibly to judge the outcome
of political skirmishes, Mr Sharif's government seems set to carry on.
Government officials say there are no clear-cut alternatives acceptable to
the president, and the army is not likely to intervene directly.
'They cannot go back to Benazir Bhutto because they've already tried her.
Changing governments every couple of years also makes it difficult to
justify continuing this democracy,' said a senior official.
However, Mr Sharif still faces difficult problems. Successive governments
have been faced with rampant lawlessness in the southern province of Sindh.
Highway robbers, professional kidnappers and militant political activists
have been involved in crimes, fuelling fear among the local population and
business community.
Instability in Sindh risks weakening the position of the provincial
government which is backed by Mr Sharif. At the same time, the fall-out
could benefit Ms Bhutto, given that it is her home province.
Islamisation of the country's legal, political and economic system is a
further important test for the government.
Last year, a 'Shariat bill' was passed in the parliament, to provide the
basis for introducing Islamic laws in the country. Businessmen and
international lenders and investors are concerned about the implications. Mr
Sharif is attempting a middle line, calling for laws which make sense for
businessmen but maintaining the government's public commitment to
Islamisation and avoiding alienation of fundamentalist elements.
The government is seeking to win popular support through a three-year Social
Action Programme designed to improve health, drinking water and literacy.
But with few opportunities for drastic cuts in defence spending and the
government's debt service payments, there is limited ability to speed up
development.
Finally, there is little evidence of a thaw in bitter relations with Ms
Bhutto's opposition PDA. From the government's side, there are few signs of
any significant moves by Mr Sharif to discuss concerns such as the alleged
large scale arrest and victimisation of Ms Bhutto's supporters.
The PDA, which was itself unseated because of allegations of corruption, has
meanwhile intensified charges of corruption and mismanagement against
government leaders.
With elections for the presidency due by the end of next year, the divide
may widen further in coming months, as opposing camps prepare for the
campaign.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Going Dutch in marriage: Matchmakers behind Reed Elsevier
say it will be in top five of world's publishing groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elsevier, the Dutch publisher which is to merge with Reed International, the
UK publisher, has been looking for an English-speaking partner for years.
The company, the most profitable Dutch publisher and the world's leading
publisher of scientific journals, was as big as it was going to get in
Holland. The only way forward was through acquisition or marriage.
'Stringing little pearls into a necklace with Pounds 10m to Pounds 30m
acquisitions can take years,' said Mr Pierre Vinken, Elsevier chairman who
will, if all goes well, become chairman of the new UK-registered holding
company Reed Elsevier on January 1, 1993.
It will be a company with a combined market capitalisation of Pounds 5.2bn
or Fl 16.3bn. Mr Vinken and Mr Peter Davis, the Reed chairman who will be
chief executive and deputy chairman of Reed Elsevier, believe the new
company will be in the top five of the world's publishing and information
companies: third behind Time Warner and Dun &amp; Bradstreet on market
capitalisation; but number one on pre-tax profits.
Talks with Reed go back to the early 1980s, but Mr Davis said 'somehow we
couldn't make it fly'. Then the late Robert Maxwell bought 10 per cent of
Elsevier shares before realising that they did not come with voting rights.
In September 1988 Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, announced an
'engagement leading to marriage'. Both companies took stakes in each other
but in less than three years it was all off mainly because the two companies
had grown incompatible as the pound fell against the guilder and the
Elsevier share price grew faster than Pearson.
Yesterday Mr Vinken said: 'Anyone would go for a marriage of two rich
families and let them sort it out.'
The practical sorting out should not be difficult. 'No cash, no premium, no
dilution,' said Mr Davis, who will take over as chairman of Reed Elsevier in
1995 when Mr Vinken retires.
Reed and Elsevier will each have 50 per cent of a new holding company while
each operating business will retain separate stock market listings. But
because Reed has a larger capitalisation than Elsevier, it will receive a
significant minority stake in the Dutch company.
The companies will enter into an equalisation arrangement so one Elsevier
share has the same economic benefit as 6.86 Reed shares. From the 1993
financial year, the companies will pay equivalent gross dividends,
representing a doubling over Elsevier's current level.
For Reed the merger achieves two aims - a stronger presence in Europe, and
in high-value subscription-based publishing such as scientific journals. For
Elsevier, it is a chance to enter areas where Reed is strong - business and
consumer publishing.
Mr Eric de Bellaigue, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon,
thought the merger held 'reasonable promise' for Reed as they were buying
into higher value publishing, but 'it looks less advantageous for Elsevier'.
Elsevier may be moving into areas which are dependent on volatile
advertising revenues, but the Dutch company is making its deal at the low
point of the cycle. A more important factor in the longer term is the
financial clout the combined group could bring to the rapidly developing
technologies of electronic publishing.
The combined company will also carry clout as a predator. Official Airline
Guides, one Robert Maxwell's US businesses, could be an early target because
Reed is already in travel information. 'We are the logical buyer but not the
logical people to pay a premium,' Mr Davis said.
Although Reed and Elsevier will continue to operate as separate companies
two businesses will be combined: the business-to-business magazine
publishing activities of Elsevier and Reed in the US; and the scientific
publishing business of Butterworth Heinemann will be combined with the much
larger Elsevier Science Publishers.
Elsevier's shares fell nearly 10 per cent to Fl 105.20 on the news of the
merger, as investors acted on worries that the combined group would be more
vulnerable to the vagaries of the business cycle than Elsevier has been on
its own.
Concern about future profits at Elsevier is acute because of the company's
good record over the past 10 years, when earnings have shown compound growth
of more than 15 per cent per year. 'In a 'bad' year Elsevier posts growth of
only 10 per cent and in a 'good' year it exceeds 20 per cent,' a Dutch
analyst said. Reed has been producing operating margins of more than 16 per
cent in spite of the recession.
At Reed's London headquarters yesterday all was harmony over the prospects
for the latest Anglo-Dutch multi-national.
Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson, even sent his good wishes. 'I wish them
well,' he said. Asked if there was not any regret that it was Reed and not
Pearson consumating a merger, Lord Blakenham added: 'Size isn't everything.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Tough trading flattens profit at Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH conditions in important markets and higher interest costs made for
flat interim profits at Guinness, the international drinks group.
Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman, said: 'Recession remains obstinately present
in many major markets.' As a result, growth in the group, with 85 per cent
of sales outside the UK, would not match that of the recent past. Pre-tax
profit more than doubled between 1987 and 1991.
Pre-tax profit inched ahead to Pounds 353m, compared with Pounds 350m, on
sales up 5 per cent to Pounds 1.75bn.
Trading profit advances of 7 per cent in spirits and 16 per cent in brewing
were offset by Pounds 30m of extra interest payments related to
acquisitions.
Sir Anthony said profits of the companies purchased were biased towards the
second half. Profits would also be protected by cost-cutting.
As a show of confidence in the group's longer-term prospects, the interim
dividend was pushed up 10 per cent to 3.35p. This was covered 3.8 times by
diluted earnings per share of 12.6p, up from 12.3p.
The spirits division, United Distillers, increased trading profit from
Pounds 283m to Pounds 303m on sales of Pounds 981m, up 6 per cent. This
included Pounds 4m profit and Pounds 95m sales from acquisitions made in the
second half of last year, including Glenmore Distilleries in the US which
enabled rationalisation of US operations.
Mr Anthony Greener, chief executive and chairman designate, said there had
been a downturn in Japan 'in the high end of the bar trade' because of cuts
in corporate entertainment.
The UK spirits market fell 10 per cent. The recession's effects were 'made
worse by what the government has done on duty'. The total raised by the
Treasury was falling - 'diminishing returns' had set in, he said.
Brewing raised profits from Pounds 94m to Pounds 109m on a slower sales
increase to Pounds 761m. Margins were helped by cost-cutting and investment
in more efficient plant. Extensive reorganisation was taking place in Spain
after the acquisition of Cruzcampo and Union Cervecera.
Net debt of Pounds 1.73bn compared with Pounds 1.5bn in June 1991, but was
down from the year-end Pounds 1.8bn through cash generation.
The contribution from LVMH, the French luxury goods group in which Guinness
has a 24 per cent stake, fell from Pounds 44m to Pounds 40m because of
increased interest costs following the conversion of loan stock.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Legal &amp; General returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the life assurance group, called for the UK to stay outside
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System yesterday as it
reported a return to profits.
First-half pre-tax profits were Pounds 74m, compared with a loss of Pounds
56.1m a year earlier.
The turnround was due mainly to exceptional gains and sharply lower losses
from general insurance. However, its reserves against mortgage indemnity
insurance losses increased by Pounds 27m to Pounds 185m.
It is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 6.2p.
Mr David Prosser, chief executive, suggested 8 per cent base rates would be
more realistic. He said: 'Having moved down to 10 per cent we have the
benefit of lower sterling. I personally think this is an opportunity to take
sterling even lower.'
Mr David Rough, director of investments, was more forthright. He said: 'I
see no benefit in going back into the ERM. It's too constrained under the
current system. One man has 99 per cent of the votes, and that man resides
in Germany.'
Analysts, who were in general guarded in their response to the results, said
Legal &amp; General was strongly exposed to economic uncertainty, due both to
its mortgage guarantee and investment management business.
Mr Roger Harvey, of Kleinwort Benson, pointed to their exposure to the
housing market, and said: 'One of the problems for them is that the factors
which most influence their profits are out of their control.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Montedison and Shell propose plastics merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LARGEST restructuring of Europe's troubled petrochemicals chemicals
industry during this recession was proposed yesterday by Montecatini, the
chemicals subsidiary of Italy's Montedison, and Shell Chemicals, part of the
Anglo-Dutch oil group.
They announced a plan to merge their activities in polypropylene and
polyethylene, both plastics feedstocks.
The joint venture would link Europe's two largest polypropylene makers.
Montecatini, which also owns the Himont chemicals group in the US, will
integrate all its polyolefins activities into the new deal, while Shell,
which already has some existing joint ventures in the field, will put in the
majority of its businesses.
Full details of the transaction, which will create a unit with estimated
annual sales of Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn), have still to be settled.
The deal depends on approval from the European Commission. The commission is
likely to be more worried about the implications for the European
polypropylene sector than the polyethylene industry.
Shell has a European capacity of about 550,000 tonnes of polypropylene a
year, excluding a joint venture with Germany's BASF, according to Mr Jeremy
Chantry, a chemicals analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
In Europe, Montecatini can produce about 500,000 tonnes a year. Together
they would have about 20 per cent of the European capacity, which is about
5m tonnes this year.
The new venture is expected to have worldwide capacity of 3m tonnes of
polypropylene and 500,000 tonnes of polyethylene.
The move made strategic sense, chemicals consultants said, and Himont's
polypropylene technology was the best in the world. The Italian group is
short of propylene and Shell has excess propylene capacity.
The transaction should help both companies cut costs in a sector of the
petrochemicals business which has been suffering from growing over-capacity
and plunging product prices.
'This is only the first part of the restructuring of the European
petrochemicals sector,' said Mr David Glass of Chem Systems, the chemicals
consultants.
'Most of the industry is losing its shirt. The number of polypropylene
producers needs to fall from about 17 at present to 12.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / RMC decline held to 11% by German side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 26 PER cent rise in German profits during the first six months of this
year was not enough to offset an even greater fall in British profits, RMC
Group, the world's biggest concrete producer said yesterday.
Overall group pre-tax profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 62.1m in spite of a
9 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 1.4bn.
The group said the disparity between the strength of the German and British
businesses underlined the wide gap between the economic performance of the
two countries, particularly their construction markets.
German profits rose from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 40.5m accounting for half of
group operating profits of Pounds 80.6m, compared with Pounds 86.6m last
time. This was using an exchange rate of DM2.90. The contribution from
Germany would have been even higher if current exchange rates had been used,
said Mr Jim Owen, managing director.
British profits fell more than half to Pounds 8.8m accounting for slightly
more than a tenth of group operating profits.
The group is to pay a maintained interim dividend of 6.6p which was almost
twice covered by earnings of 12.1p, down from 15.5p. Its shares rose 34p to
close at 443p as UK stocks soared yesterday.
There was no sign of recovery in the UK construction market, said Mr Owen.
Sales of ready-mix concrete had fallen by up to 4 per cent during the first
half and were likely to be about 8 per cent down for the whole year.
Mr Owen expected British sales of ready-mix to fall 5 per cent next year
with UK construction output unlikely to recover until 1994 at the earliest.
German construction by comparison remained strong and earnings in the second
half of this year were expected to be every bit as good as the final six
months of last year.
Mr Owen said a fall in construction output in western Germany next year
would be more than compensated for by higher investment in infrastructure in
the former East Germany. Profits from other European countries in the first
half dipped from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 23.6m due mainly to lower sales in
France and Spain.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (1): Challenging perspective - Pakistan
aspires to be a robust export-oriented country and the main land-bridge to
the emerging republics of Central Asia. But its hopes are clouded by its
economic frailty and political uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE is one vision of Pakistan's future: a modern, deregulated, open
economy, export-driven and strongly oriented towards the private sector, and
the gateway to the emerging republics of Central Asia.
This is another: an inward-looking country with few true friends, beset by
uncertainty over the role of the military in politics and of Islam in
society, strangled by bureaucracy and poor infrastructure, and unable to
address chronic weaknesses in economic management.
The extraordinary thing about Pakistan is that people can simultaneously
entertain both views. The businessman who solemnly recounts the country's
woes will then reveal ambitious expansion plans with barely a pause for
breath. The visitor is tossed gaily between optimism and pessimism.
There is no dispute, however, about the need for action which existed when
the government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif was elected in October 1990.
The political system was in disarray. The economy was in dire need of
reform.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, Mr Sharif's predecessor, had begun to reverse the public
sector domination created by her father's nationalisation of big industry
and banks in 1972. But her attempt foundered as President Ghulam Ishaq Khan
removed her from office in 1990 after only 20 months in office, amid
allegations of corruption.
Mr Sharif, a private sector industrialist who had been chief minister of
Punjab province, immediately embarked on a headlong drive to open up the
economy, which he continues to pursue with vigour.
His finance minister, Mr Sartaj Aziz, explains: 'What we are doing is to
bring about a major structural change to contract the government in those
areas where it is not very good at doing things and shift it to those areas
where it is supposed to do things and which it can do better.'
Businessmen have seen the first results. Thanks to the elimination of
licensing, they no longer have to waste months or years in trips to
Islamabad, the capital, to seek approval (or the infamous No Objection
Certificate) from powerful bureaucrats for any investment decision.
The government's programme to extricate itself from running industries is
well advanced. It has sold 55 of 115 targeted industrial units, and two of
the big five banks, and has begun to open up utilities to the private
sector.
Most exchange controls have been lifted, as well as most barriers to foreign
investment. 'Our total package is now more liberal than almost anywhere in
Asia,' says Mr Aziz. The government has liberalised imports, started to cut
tariffs, and deregulated interest rates and loans.
Accompanying these measures are ambitious plans to improve infrastructure
with new highways, power plants and telecommunications networks and improved
railways and ports.
The final plank of reform is to improve social conditions. Though Pakistan
has enjoyed a healthy economic growth rate, levels of poverty and illiteracy
are typical of those in much poorer countries, and the population growth
rate is among the highest in the world. The government has announced a
programme to improve drinking water, literacy and health care.
By the expiry of the government's term in 1995, Mr Sharif says: 'We will
have visible achievements which will speak for themselves. We will not have
to launch an election campaign.'
The overall reform programme is radical and rapid even at a time when many
other countries are making similar attempts to slough off bureaucracies and
bloated, loss-making public sectors. 'It is a very bold step that Mr Sharif
has taken, doing away with all the norms that we were used to,' says Mr
Yusuf Shirazi, chairman of Atlas Group, an industrial and financial services
conglomerate.
Pakistan has a dynamic private sector, which ought to provide the basis for
strong export-led growth as privatisation and deregulation take hold.
Foreign investors, however, have proved slow to respond. Though the Karachi
Stock Exchange has seen portfolio buying, direct investment has been limited
mainly to foreign multinationals already familiar with Pakistan or smaller
companies linked with Pakistanis overseas.
Several political and economic concerns prompt this caution. Pakistan's
political institutions provide the basis for a stable democracy, but its
record still gives rise to lingering uncertainty about who really rules the
country. The elected government, itself a coalition of several parties,
co-exists uneasily with the other two members of the so-called 'troika' -
the president and the army.
Mr Sharif, mindful that the previous government was dismissed by President
Ishaq Khan, can never be totally sure of his authority, even though there is
little serious opposition to economic reform.
There is little sign of any impending presidential intervention and the
army, though playing an influential role behind the scenes, is thought
unlikely to take direct political steps as it has in the past.
Apart from precluding cuts in defence spending, which accounts for over a
third of the budget, the constraints upon the government create doubts about
how vigorously it can attack some chronic weaknesses and stand firm against
powerful vested interests.
For example, Pakistan has an astonishingly inefficient tax structure which
leaves significant parts of the economy, notably farmers, effectively free
of direct tax. The budget deficit is the most pressing economic problem, and
the government has failed by a wide margin to meet targets agreed with the
International Monetary Fund for its reduction.
Mr Aziz has begun a campaign to reduce tax rates but broaden the net and
improve collection, but some businessmen feel this has produced
inconsistencies without addressing the real problems. One economist asks:
'Is the government prepared to impose costs on the private sector at the
same time as giving them a lot of benefits?'
Other concerns are more obvious: bureaucrats, though their power is being
reduced, still take what opportunities they can to slow things down;
infrastructure will take years to build, though improvements have begun
with, for example, a big rise in new telephone lines; rampant lawlessness in
the southern province of Sindh, though reduced by a recent army crackdown,
could be a worry when the army withdraws.
A further cloud over investment prospects is a ruling of the Islamic Shariat
court outlawing 'riba', which essentially means interest payments.
Pakistan's banking system has already adapted domestically, developing
alternative accounts and payment mechanisms, but there is doubt about
whether this is sufficient to meet the court's ruling. International
borrowings, such as vital aid flows from donor countries, would also be
thrown into question.
Though the government's appeal against the ruling will be heard later in the
year, Mr Sharif has shown reluctance to take a clear stand for fear of
upsetting political support. He was elected on an Islamic platform and is
linked on streetside hoardings with General Zia ul-Haq, who led Pakistan on
an Islamic path during 11 years of rule until his death in an air crash in
1988.
The issue is the key test of the extent to which Pakistan wishes to follow a
fundamentalist Islamic road. It appears uncertain: there are few signs of
widespread popular support, but most politicians are unwilling to offend the
mullahs.
Behind uncertainties over the role of the military and of Islam lies a more
fundamental issue: what should be the thrust of foreign policy? One reason
for the influence of the military is that Pakistan remains in a state of
constant alert on its eastern border with India, and faces continuing
turmoil - in which it is seeking to act as intermediary - in Afghanistan
along its long north-western border.
Though Islamabad has at times had close relations with Washington, they are
currently cool, with the US Congress barring new direct aid because of
Pakistan's nuclear programme. Mr Sharif has begun a drive to open political
and trade links with the new states of central Asia, but this will depend on
an enduring peace in Afghanistan, through which trade routes must pass.
In the longer term, tensions with India are perhaps the greatest impediment
to progress.
Solution of the Kashmir problem would allow Pakistan and India to channel
large-scale resources away from defence, to target new export markets, and
to move ahead unfettered by the problem which has dogged them both since
birth. That is a massive challenge for Mr Sharif, his Indian counterpart PV
Narasimha Rao, and their successors.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Thames TV back in black with Pounds 15.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES TELEVISION's last year as an ITV contractor is proving to be a bumper
one. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 15.2m,
compared with losses last time of Pounds 4.04m.
Lord Brabourne, chairman of Thames, at present the largest ITV company, said
the results showed the progress made in achieving two main objectives:
maximising shareholder value from the last year of the London weekday
franchise and transforming the group's activities for the years ahead.
'I have every confidence in the future of Thames as a major force in
television.'
The group increased its share of ITV adverting revenue from 15.45 per cent
to 15.73 per cent, a total of Pounds 121.6m.
Earnings per share emerged at 17.5p compared with losses of 8.6p. The
interim dividend is unchanged at 2.5p.
Apart from the rise in advertising revenue and cost cutting, reductions in
Exchequer Levy also helped the group's position. Reeves, the US production
subsidiary, continued to incur an operating loss but positive signs included
Covington Cross, a 13-part drama series commissioned for ABC.

Pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992 dived to Pounds 535,000 (Pounds

Marwood Homes, the housing offshoot, again suffered substantial losses. With
the market unlikely to improve in the short term, Mr Cockroft warned of
further losses in the second half. Options for this operation were being
reviewed.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sanderson Murray falls 17%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO RECENT acquisitions took a sizeable bite out of profits at Sanderson
Murray &amp; Elder.
The motor dealer reported a 17 per cent pre-tax fall from Pounds 765,000 to
Pounds 633,000 for the first half of 1992.
Mr Tony Bramall, chairman, said neither of the two recent acquisitions -
dealerships in Gateshead and Manchester - had performed well.
The group handled 3,300 new vehicle sales in the half year - nearly 4 per
cent down on last year, while almost 2,000 used vehicles were retailed - a
3.5 per cent fall. Margins on used cars were in line with 1991, but new car
margins were under extreme competitive pressure.
The service, parts and body repair activities contributed more than 60 per
cent of total profits.
Turnover jumped from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 51.1m.
Earnings per share dropped to 2.87p (4.8p), while the interim dividend is in
effect maintained at 0.6p after adjusting for the share sub-division.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Premier Cons boosted by new developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREMIER Consolidated Oilfields, the independent oil company, raised pre-tax
profits by 29 per cent at the interim stage, as new developments began to
make a contribution.
The company earned Pounds 8m before tax, up from Pounds 6.2m, in the six
months to June 30 1992.
The figures reflected the full impact of Wytch Farm production and a
significant contribution from the North Sea.
Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said the result marked Premier's aim of generating
enough cash flow for a substantial exploration and production programme
without having to call on shareholders.
Goal Petroleum made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.94m, an increase of 7 per
cent, in the six months to June 30.
Gearing was reduced to 20.7 per cent of shareholders' funds.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Move into retail behind UniChem's 55% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESTABLISHMENT of a chain of chemists' shops helped UniChem,
traditionally a pharmaceuticals wholesaler, to increase pre-tax profits by
55 per cent in the first half of the year.
The group made Pounds 15m (Pounds 9.68m) before tax on sales of Pounds
500.4m (Pounds 452.2m).
Mr Jeff Harris, who moved up from finance director to chief executive
earlier this year, said that sales growth would have been nearly 20 per cent
without a change in the arrangement for selling Glaxo's drugs. UniChem now
receives an agent's fee rather than owning the drugs being traded.
The retail division, which hardly existed in the first half of last year,
contributed Pounds 33m to turnover and about Pounds 2m to profit.
The main building block was the Pounds 27m acquisition of the 92-shop E Moss
business in December. By the end of June the group had 132 shops and a
further 34 had been added since, through the Pounds 14.5m purchase of Scott
and another Scottish buy this week.
The Moss acquisition was accompanied by a Pounds 35.1m 1-for-4 rights issue.
As a result UniChem's earnings per share rose less quickly - by 20 per cent
to 7.2p fully diluted (6.5p to 7.6p undiluted).
The group is still dominated by wholesaling where operating profits rose by
34 per cent to Pounds 13m. The margin improved from 2.1 to 2.4 per cent.
While gearing was zero at the half-way stage, it would be between 15 and 20
per cent by the end of the year, with the Scott acquisition falling in the
second half.
The group sold its nappy manufacturing business incurring an extraordinary
loss of Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 1.03m for the abandoned bid for Macarthy).
The interim dividend goes up from 1.65p to 1.9p.
COMMENT
These results were ahead of expectations and the group's share price gained
5p to close at 210p, even though it will not benefit from the lower pound
and has limited recovery potential. Not that UniChem's virtues can be
ignored just yet. The UK drugs market seems to be growing at about 10 per
cent a year, fuelled by an older population and the increasing
sophistication of treatments. And UniChem can continue to improve margins,
through automation and the growing contribution of higher-margin activities.
One of these is the over-the-counter lines, cosmetics for instance, which
will be helped by more healthy consumer spending. A full-year profit of
Pounds 30m to Pounds 31m, compared with Pounds 21.4m, gives a prospective
multiple of about 14, in line with the market. As the recession deepened, it
deserved a premium, now it seems rightly to be at a cross-over point as
attention switches to cyclical recovery stocks. But with the air still thick
with reasons for caution, it is worth holding for its reliable qualities.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (11): Conflicting voices in the
corridor - Canary Wharf's failure casts a shadow over a bold planning vision
/ Appraising the idea of an east Thames development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no more powerful reminder of the hazards and challenges of urban
regeneration than Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project that dominates
the east London skyline.
The failure of the project, which went into receivership in May, reflects
its over-ambitious scale and its perceived isolation from the heart of
London. At the same time, the tower's spectacular views over east London
underline the daunting scale of the regeneration task that remains.
This eastern fringe of London encompasses a large expanse of industrial
dereliction and under-developed land, albeit interspersed by historic towns
and areas of open countryside. It has been badly affected by the decline of
manufacturing and port-related industries over the last 20 years.
The depressed image of the area, coupled with a long-standing neglect of its
infrastructure, has held back development. With the exception of the
Docklands, an area from Tower Bridge to the Royal Docks, which became the
focus of the government's urban renewal strategy in the 1980s, the area has
been largely untouched by successive property booms.
Its potential as a long-term growth opportunity was identified in 1985, by
the strategic planning body for the south-east (Serplan). It called the
area, which stretched from Tower Bridge to Southend in Essex and Sheerness
in Kent, the East Thames Corridor. It contains an estimated 10,000 acres of
uncontaminated land that can be developed without encroaching on the Green
Belt.
The political will to develop the area gathered strength last year, partly
as a result of the shortage of housing land to the west of London.
Attention was focused on the area a little under a year ago when the
government announced that the fast rail link from the Channel Tunnel to
London would go through east London, via Stratford. In the same week, Mr
Michael Heseltine, then secretary of state for the environment, announced
that there would be a study of development prospects in the East Thames
Corridor.
'Large as the Docklands project is, it now needs to be seen as just one part
of a much bigger strategy that focuses on Stratford and seeks to develop, on
that basis, a huge linear city on both sides of the Thames,' said Professor
Peter Hall, an urban geographer who acted as his adviser.
The potential for this kind of development is being assessed by planning
consultants. Llewelyn-Davies Planning will submit a report on the area's
development potential to the secretary of state for the environment at the
end of this month.
The scope for development is constrained by the nature of the sites. The
main development sites are the Royal Docks, Barking Reach, Rainham Marshes,
Stratford Railway lands, Greenwich Peninsula and Beckton Gasworks at
Gallions Reach. The last two belong to British Gas.
The barriers to development are awesome. The problems include the area's
poor image, the recession, constraints on public spending, developers'
disillusionment with urban regeneration projects and the likelihood that the
area's land will be include on a contaminated-land register.
There is also a glut of existing buildings. A study by the University of
East London for Glenny, chartered surveyor, found that: 'With the possible
exception of high-quality warehousing and distribution, there are
substantial surpluses of most types of commercial space and housing, which
will have to be reduced, perhaps by conversion to lower-value uses, before
confidence can return and new projects realised.'
But despite these formidable obstacles, the case for developing the East
Thames Corridor has some merits. For one thing, it offers the only
substantial expanse of developable land in the overcrowded south-east. For
another, its position between London and continental Europe will become
increasingly important with closer European integration. Already, it is a
funnel for around half the south-east's trade with the EC.
Another factor working in favour of the region's development is the
improving quality of its infrastructure.
'East London is in the middle of a historic phase in its development: the
installation, over a 20-30 year period of new transport infrastructure such
as it has not seen in a century,' said the study by the University of East
London.
Improvements that have been put, or are being put, into place include the
M25 motorway, the Dartford Bridge crossing, the Lower Lea crossing, the
North Circular road, the Docklands Light Railway, the Stansted passenger
terminal and the City airport. In addition, the A13/M25 links, the M11
extension, the East London river crossing and Crossrail are due to be
installed in the second half of the decade.
But even with the large sums being spent on the region's infrastructure,
further investment will have a critical impact on the viability of
development. According to the University of East London: 'All (the sites in
the East Thames Corridor) need road and rail improvements to realise their
potential.' The only exceptions are the Royal Docks and Chafford Hundred,
which are already well served with infrastructure.
The success of the London docklands will largely depend on whether the
government continues with the Jubilee Line extension, jeopardised by the
receivership of Canary Wharf, which had been due to contribute Pounds 400m
to its costs.
In addition, much hangs on the location of a passenger station for the
Channel Tunnel fast rail link. In the view of the University of London
report: 'A Stratford interchange is seen as vital to the future prosperity
of docklands.'
The importance of putting the right transport provisions in place are
palpably demonstrated by the half-deserted office developments of the Isle
of Dogs. Its failure to match the area's infrastructure with the pace of new
development did extensive damage to its reputation. So, too, did the
hands-off approach to planning, which resulted in the development of an
excessive number of office blocks in competition with surrounding boroughs.
Now that the 1980s property boom is a distant memory, investors are unlikely
to make the same mistakes twice. Unless the right infrastructure and
planning mechanisms are in place, the East Thames Corridor will get no
further than the drawing board.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (10): Invoking the human factor
 -The urban village, John Willman explores a princely concept
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I HAVE for many years been concerned about the harmful effect which a great
deal of urban redevelopment has on the human spirit,' wrote the Prince of
Wales in his introduction to the recently published report from the Urban
Villages Group.
The Prince was endorsing the group's advocacy of a new form of development,
which would enhance the quality and vitality of urban life by creating
living towns and cities.
But publication of the report* has rekindled the debate over the nature of
much of the UK's inner-city regeneration, and stimulated new interest in the
urban-villages concept of small, mixed-use redevelopment.
Certainly, concern over the nature of the 'one-dimensional, monocultural
cities', created in the period of post-war reconstruction, is not confined
to the Prince. His view that such development had created 'soulless inhuman
environments', partly responsible for 'the horrendous social problems which
have beset inner cities', is widely shared.
But it remains to be seen whether there will be equally widespread consensus
behind the Prince's alternative, sketched out in his 1989 book, A vision of
Britain:
'I am hoping that we can encourage the development of 'urban villages' in
order to reintroduce human scale intimacy and a vibrant street life. These
factors can help to restore to people their sense of belonging and pride in
their own surroundings.'
Both regenerated areas and new developments should, wherever possible,
include the basic ingredients of community life: places of employment,
entertainment and public assembly, as well as housing. Areas such as
London's Clerkenwell and Edinburgh New Town were identified by the Prince as
embodying such characteristics, with Montparnasse in Paris and Charleston in
the US as international exemplars.
The Prince's challenge was taken up by a group of developers, builders,
planners and architects who formed the Urban Villages Group under the aegis
of Business in the Community. Chaired by Trevor Osborne, chairman of
Speyhawk, it included such luminaries as David Goldstone of Regalian
Properties, Martin Laing of builders John Laing, Tim Melville-Ross of
Nationwide Building Society and Bob Williams of Grand Metropolitan Estates.
Leon Krier, the Luxembourg architect and masterplanner behind many European
public development projects, was a particularly influential member of the
group.
They spent two years visiting the urban areas commended by the Prince, and
also some of the development blackspots. The aim was to refine the elements
which created community spirit, pride of place and a sense of belonging, so
that they could be applied more widely.
At the heart of the urban-village project is the concept of 'mixity', an
antidote to single-use development which divides towns and cities into large
areas devoted solely to industry, commerce or housing. The ideal urban
village creates a 'whole district', with 3,000 to 5,000 inhabitants; ideally
it should include places to work, live and play over no more than 100 acres
(40 hectares) - all, therefore, within easy walking distance.
'Mixity needs to be accepted in planning terminology as a form of
sustainable development,' says Mr Osborne. He is urging the environment
secretary to issue a planning guidance note, which would encourage local
planning authorities to reflect the concept in their local plans.
The group advocates a new planning category of Structured Planned Urban
Development (or Spud for short), which would recognise the mixed-use
approach and offer developers protection against piecemeal tinkering with
the area. However, many planners are less sure about the practicality of
such mixed-use development, where the needs of commerce and industry may
conflict with the leisure and residential uses located cheek by jowl.
David Hall, director of the Town and Country Planning Association, has
reservations about how much of the housing that will be needed over the next
20 years can be provided through urban villages. 'It simply won't be
possible to provide the 2.8m homes needed between now and 2011 in urban
areas,' he says.
Mr Hall also worries that too much is being expected of the built
environment: 'There are other causes than the environment for riots on bleak
post-war housing estates in Newcastle and Coventry, such as unemployment
among young people or the lack of social support. Creating a good
environment simply won't solve such problems.'
Whatever the reservations, there is certainly support for a more humane
approach to redevelopment in the European Commission, whose green paper The
Urban Environment reflects much of the thinking of the Urban Villages
report. The Commission has also been supportive financially, contributing
Pounds 35,000 towards the cost of printing the group's glossy and lavishly
illustrated report.
In a glowing encomium, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment commissioner
when the report was launched, described it as 'an important contribution to
the ongoing debate on how our cities can be made liveable and
environmentally friendly'. Mr di Meana went on to commend the 'special group
of people who have come together to say it, (particularly) the construction
and development industries'.
That throws the ball neatly back into the court of those with the power to
change the nature of much modern redevelopment. The Prince of Wales himself
has already attempted to put his ideas into practice, with Poundbury, a new
settlement on Duchy of Cornwall land at Dorchester, in Dorset. The
experience has been salutary, he says, in demonstrating the 'complexity and
stubbornness of the issues'.
The Urban Villages Group has also tried to take the approach into the
development stage, with the creation of the Urban Villages Company. A
commercial joint venture between several builders and developers, it is
investigating four sites in England and Wales, to select one for the
location of an urban village.
The group's report also has a role to play in disseminating ideas through
conferences and training courses for architects and planners. Whether it can
succeed in persuading builders and developers to abandon their predilection
for the larger-scale projects, which are their bread and butter, remains to
be seen.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (15): When the bubble had to burst - The
change of mood at the Karachi stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BUBBLE UP' says the slogan on a hoarding outside the Karachi Stock
Exchange.
It advertises a popular soft drink but also captured the stock exchange's
mood at the start of this year.
Since then, however, political uncertainty has deflated of the market's
effervescence and the street outside is no longer thronged by speculators.
With a new political leader whose interests appear to lean solely towards
the business community, the crowds could have been forgiven for expecting
the stock market boom to continue.
The corporate sector is likely to see 20 per cent earnings growth this year,
and the number of foreign brokerages showing interest might have suggested
another ingredient for success in a largely illiquid market.
Instead, share prices have floundered and foreign institutions are having
second thoughts.
The latest crisis in the market resulted from an important part of the
government's privatisation programme, the Rs2.05bn public offer of Sui
Northern Gas, which was only 15 per cent subscribed and will create a
substantial overhang.
The causes for this slump in confidence which left the KSE100 index down 32
per cent in the first eight months of the year, were all apparent during its
boom in 1991.
Pakistan has long had a law and order problem, leanings towards fundamental
Islamicism, political instability and an inadequate infrastructure.
But the government appears to be at least making head-way in creating
solutions to these difficulties and there are few signs that prime minister
Nawaz Sharif's tenure is about to be rudely curtailed.
The one positive factor in the current down-turn is that it has enabled the
stock market to sort out the usual teething problems of an institution which
emerged from decades of apathy and attracted millions of foreign dollars in
1991.
The market capitalisation increased by 314 per cent between December 1990
and June 1992 to a total of Rs221.38bn and in the first six months there
were 46 new listings which raised a total of Rs3.8bn.
In spite of this barrage of new paper and investor interest, nothing had
been done to update the stock markets' registration and settlement system.
Initially, foreigners were obliged to register shares in a process which
involved the signing of thousands of certificates and a delay of up to 90
days, during which the scrip could not be traded.
The Corporate Law Authority (CLA), the stock market regulator, has reviewed
the rules, allowing stock to be registered in street names, so that it need
not be re-registered with each transaction; and the time-lag has now been
reduced to 45 days.
In addition, the IFC, Citibank and Pakistan's three exchanges, in Karachi,
Lahore and Islamabad, are working together on a central depositary system,
which should be introduced in early 1993.
Mr Mian Mumtaz Abdullah, chairman of the CLA, said his priorities for
developing the market were computerisation of trading, setting up the
central depository and ensuring greater transparency.
At present, the trading system is on an open-outcry basis, on the frenetic
floor of the stock exchange.
Trades are marked manually on a board, but most sizeable transactions are
negotiated outside the market, so transparency is lacking.
There is not even a computer link between the three exchanges, although
Karachi continues to dominate trading, accounting for around 90 per cent of
turnover.
Mr Abdullah said computer assisted trading would soon be introduced, but the
exchanges were a long way from introducing automated matching.
Foreign brokerages complain that since most local broking houses are also
stock jobbers, the lack of transparency in the marketplace provides ample
room for abuse on the quoting of prices. With a computer-assisted trading
system, the information flow would become more rapid.
There have already been scandals involving inaccurate statements from listed
companies, an area where the CLA is also focusing on changing the laws so
that disclosure and investor protection regulations correlate with those in
the US.
There remain numerous anomalies which are being changed - under current law
a registered stock exchange can be one person - but the chief problems are
with the trading and settlement systems, which are currently being altered.
There has only been one case of a brokerage defaulting, and its losses were
covered by the sale of its exchange seat.
There still remain the other barriers to foreign entry: the fears of
political instability, Islamisation and a textile sector suffering from the
worldwide recession but which forms one third of market capitalisation and
60 per cent of the country's export earnings.
But with an industrialist at the helm, business sense should prevail over
religious sensibilities.
The textile sector may be in pain, but it has a vocal political lobby which
tends to over-state the extent of its woes in order to extract greater
concessions from the government, as a result of its economic importance - it
has had some notable victories in this regard.
With a plentiful supply of cheap cotton, it is only the small and
highly-geared spinners that could be troubled, and the current low cost of
yarn should provide a welcome incentive for the industry to evolve towards
higher value added weaving and garment manufacturing.
The market has low p/e's and high earnings growth, in an economy with
falling inflation and rising GDP growth. 'If the political situation is not
a problem in Pakistan, then the market is very cheap', argued Mr John Chiu,
director of GT Management (Asia). Local brokers insist there is no problem.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (16): Safer for users - What the new
banking rules mean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THEORY, a combination of new Prudential Regulations, combined with the
government's aggressive push for deregulation, will produce a much safer but
more competitive banking sector in Pakistan.
In reality, says Mr Imtiaz Ahmed Hanafi, the State Bank of Pakistan
governor, Pakistan is now over-banked and bankers are over-protected.
But there is reason to believe that the system will be a significant
improvement for depositors and borrowers.
Pakistan's banking sector has had a tempestuous history. The arrival of a
flood of new and privatised banks might prove an unbearable strain to an
untried framework of regulations.
But bankers argue that, if anything, the new regulations are even more
stringent than those required by the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS).
The State Bank has made the protection of deposit holders its principal
requirement. The insistence that 40 per cent of banks' non-contingent
liabilities be held in government bonds or cash provides substantial backing
for depositors; it is also a useful way of constraining liquidity.
The depositors deserve some reward. In recent years, government restrictions
have made it unprofitable for banks to mobilise savings, while higher reward
alternatives, such as the Co-operatives, have exposed savers to unlimited
risk.
Pakistan has one of the lowest saving rates in Asia, at 12 per cent of Gross
Domestic Product. The figures are exaggerated by the existence of an active
underground banking system, but the latest reforms should help suck more
savings into the official economy.
On the other side of the coin, banks will be under pressure to provide
cheaper credit for a business sector in which the lack of competitive
financing is seen as one of the main disadvantages of operating in Pakistan.
The government is to start controlling bank lending through reserves rather
than credit ceilings. Before, banks could lend only set amounts to different
sectors, some of which was at enforced concessionary rates. Beyond those
limits, any excess capital would have to be invested in government bonds
paying a 6 per cent interest coupon, compared with lending rates of more
than 14 per cent.
The new Prudential Regulations restrict lending by reference to bank
reserves and the quality of the borrower; while government securities are
now sold by auction and have been issued at more than 13 per cent.
Bankers complain that these are not free auctions, since the government has
not always accepted the best bid, forcing a re-auction and thereby dictating
market rates. But the returns have been substantially improved.
These changes have been accompanied by increased competition, as part of the
government push to deregulate the economy and encourage private sector
expansion.
Two of the banks that were nationalised in the Bhutto era of the 1970s have
been re-privatised, while another two are due to follow shortly. A further
11 commercial banking licences have been issued, and the system is beefed up
by 23 foreign banks, numerous investment banks, leasing companies and
Modarabas, an Islamic hybrid between a leasing company and venture capital
fund.
The PRs should tighten the quality of loan portfolios and reduce the level
of bad debt, while the deregulation should create a more competitive
environment, aiding the process of private sector-driven economic
development. This is not necessarily good for the banks, but it will put
pressure on them to be more efficient.
Of more concern to many bankers is how to work within a system where
interest is against the edicts of Islam, and where it is impossible to
anticipate the extent to which the government will go to stamp it out.
Non-interest forms of banking in the local banking system were introduced in
1985. Under the current system, even foreign banks have to offer local
depositors a profit and loss scheme, whereby the depositor gets a return
based on the performance of the bank, like a preference shareholder.
Loans are handed out on a similar basis of lender participation, although
there is an alternative system of mark-up, whereby a bank buys a commodity
from the borrower and sells it back at a higher price, with deferred payment
arranged over a fixed period.
Foreign bankers have adapted 'happily' to the new system, but are concerned
about potential changes, following last November's Shariat Court decision
that all interest was repugnant to Islam and that 22 economic laws must be
invalidated.
The court, which was introduced to ensure that the nation's laws conformed
with the tenets of Islam, was also highly critical of the concept of
mark-up. This has put significant pressure on the Government which has just
made Islamic Law the supreme law of the land, but had diluted this by
stating that no changes should be made to economic laws until a satisfactory
alternative was found.
The mixing of business and religion makes for an explosive cocktail, but the
reaction among local bankers is relaxed. They say that privatisation and
deregulation is the focus of this businessman's government, and Islamisation
does not sit well on that agenda. Their conclusion is that everything will
eventually change, but it will all remain effectively the same.

day, with an allowance for additional production by Kuwait.
The final communique from the Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting in
Geneva made clear that the agreement was designed 'to attain the minimum
reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel' for the Opec basket of crudes.
The reference price stood at Dollars 19.46 as the meeting began on Wednesday
but has averaged just above Dollars 18 for 1992.
Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, welcomed the pledge, saying he
thought it would give a 'big impetus' to oil prices. However, Mr Gholamreza
Aghazadeh, Iranian oil minister, said he did not accept the communique which
'really does not effectively help prices'.
The substance of the communique was broadly in line with what some
Opec-watchers had predicted before the meeting, and effectively implies that
most members will continue to pump at present levels. With Kuwaiti
production likely to increase by between 200,000 and 300,000 b/d in the
fourth quarter, however, it means that total Opec output should reach about
24.5m b/d.
However, analysts noted that the communique referred rather vaguely to
'market share' and not to a production ceiling, and also gave no details of
how the 24.2m b/d figure was to be divided among member countries. They were
also worried by Iran's failure to embrace the communique, and that no formal
agreement was actually signed.
Mr Nazer said Saudi Arabia, responsible for more than a third of Opec's
output, would accept the 24.2m b/d figure. Asked about his expectations for
oil prices, he replied: 'I hope they will go up.' Mr Aghazadeh, however,
said an opportunity had been missed for Opec to 'adjust production and help
the revenue to our countries'. Iranian officials had earlier told reporters
the republic was pressing for total Opec production to be cut to no more
than 24m b/d. It threatened to increase its own production to compensate for
the loss of revenue resulting from the recent fall in the value of the
dollar.
The Iranian minister said after the meeting he believed the difference
between the 22.98m b/d production ceiling adopted by Opec's February meeting
 -and rolled over in May - and the 24.2m b/d in the new communique 'belongs
to those who have the additional production capacity to meet this'.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Prospect of free trade in
coffee between Mexico and Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of free trade in coffee between Mexico, the fourth largest
producer, and Canada, which imports around 2.3m bags a year, has further
muddied the waters of next week's ICO negotiations, writes David Blackwell.
The agreement between the two countries appears to be enshrined in an annex
to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mr Lawrence Eagles,
analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, pointed out yesterday that even
if consuming countries operated a penalty process for coffee outside a quota
system, Mexico would be able to export its full quota to any ICO consumer
and send the rest to Canada, which is not in the ICO.

for international pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S coffee producers are going all out to cement the foundation of a
new pact at the International Coffee Organisation meeting in London next
week.
They are confident that the first steps towards negotiating the pact - a
meeting of producers over this weekend - will ensure a united front. But
there have been so many obstacles to the establishment of a new pact that
even Colombia's coffee authorities are less buoyant than usual.
Since the Bogota meeting in late August, Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica
have been on a diplomatic offensive, particularly to EC countries. President
Cesar Gaviria will be in the US this weekend doing his best to push the
coffee pact along at the highest levels. Although the US president is
clearly more interested in re-election and other matters, producers are
encouraged by the political support of several EC heads of state.
But the most reassuring development in recent months from the producer point
of view has been Brazil's revived interest in a pact and its active role in
suggesting new formulae and options. Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica have
been exploring ways of resolving import controls, one of the main problems
created by the proposed universal quota system, which is based on exports by
all member countries to all consuming countries.
'The producers are prepared to accept that non-documented coffee enters a
country, but only if there are strong disincentive mechanisms,' said Mr
Diego Pizano of Federacafe, the Colombian coffee growers federation. 'The
producers will do the maximum to control exports and be very active in this,
but we need some collaboration from consumers or the universal quota won't
work. We need to discourage fraud.'
One possibility is a mechanism by which the importer puts up a substantial
guarantee if a coffee shipment arrives without documents of origin. Then
there would be a period for verification and the guarantee would be forfeit
if no satisfactory documents could be provided.
As far as the few non-member producers are concerned, a very low limit on
imports could be set - otherwise leaving the ICO could become a way of
escaping quota control.
Mr Gilberto Arango, former head of the private coffee exporters association
and a grower himself, is outspokenly sceptical: 'The possibility of reaching
an agreement is very remote and if that miracle should happen, I don't see
the possibility of having one that can operate successfully.' He believes
that there is not enough political backing for a pact and that world stocks
are too large to allow prices to react, even with an agreement.
The main producers are uncharacteristically relaxed about negotiating
quotas. 'There's agreement on using exports to all destinations over a
recent period as the basis for distribution. This reflects both the capacity
to supply and the demand, because in the free market, consumers have been
able to choose what coffee they buy. There is some fine tuning to do, to
define the recent period,' said Mr Pizano.
Colombia is the only country that can expect a quota increase regardless of
how the 'recent period' is defined. Its share of world exports rose rapidly
after the collapse of the pact and reached 18 per cent last year. Exports
for the 1991-92 coffee year will mark another record at about 15m bags (60
kilos each) and this year's production is forecast at more than 17m bags.
Now the concern of the coffee authorities is to bring production down to a
more manageable level of about 15.5m bags. A Colombian plan to eradicate
100,000 hectares of coffee will be extremely difficult and costly to
implement, said Mr Arango, who thinks that prices will have to do the work.
Colombian coffee growers continue to be sheltered from the full impact of
low international prices and the crisis is just beginning to bite deep, with
unemployment and violence affecting the coffee zones.

GOLD was fixed at Dollars 348.40 a troy ounce in London yesterday afternoon,
little changed from the overnight close, after easing back from five-week
highs. Dealers said producer selling, fund liquidation and profit-taking
prompted by recent gains emerged above the Dollars 350 level. But the market
was well supported on the dips, comfortably holding Dollars 348. Uncertainty
and volatility in Europe's currency markets ahead of this weekend's French
referendum continues to support gold, while there was talk of Middle East
buying in the morning. On the LME some base metals were beginning to respond
to factors other than the currency markets. COPPER staged a late rally as
Comex firmed, ZINC received a reminder of impending supply tightness when
the cash premium began to widen, while ALUMINIUM headed lower after its
ample supply situation was brought back into focus by Wednesday's higher
than expected CIS export estimates. London COCOA stabilised around the day's
lows after coming under pressure earlier from profit-taking and a sterling
rally. There was talk of a report forecasting a 25,000-tonne deficit for
1992-93.

the Faroe Islands

<TEXT>
THE Danish government has agreed to hand over all rights to exploit minerals
in the Faroe Islands and Faroese offshore waters to the Faroese government.
This resolves a dispute between the Danes and the Faroes, which has been one
of the main obstacles to exploring for hydrocarbons off the North Atlantic
islands, where geologists consider that the chances of finding oil and gas
are good.
But a new dispute, this time between Denmark and the UK, is threatening to
halt prospecting.
The Faroe Islands are a self-governing province of the Kingdom of Denmark,
but foreign and defence policy remain the preserve of the metropolitan
government in Copenhagen. The UK and Denmark are in dispute over the
territorial demarcation line in offshore areas west of the Shetland Islands
and south-east of the Faroe Islands.
According to the Danish foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the
proposed British line of demarcation is too close to the Faroe Islands and
is totally unacceptable to Denmark. Denmark claims that the demarcation line
should run about halfway between the Faroes and the Shetlands.
Negotiations are taking place between Denmark and the UK, with the next
meeting fixed for October 21 in London. If the dispute cannot be resolved by
negotiation, the Danes have indicated that they will take it to the
International Court at the Hague. Until the dispute is settled, it is
thought unlikely that contracts will be awarded to oil and gas companies to
begin exploration.
There is a separate dispute over the demarcation line in the north-west
Atlantic, where Britain's claim that Rockall should be the pivot of the line
is not accepted by either Denmark or Ireland.

A COLLAPSE of fruit prices in Europe due to a glut of supplies has forced
the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board to cancel further progress

The board is the sole exporter to markets outside New Zealand and Australia.
It said a 50 per cent increase in 'lower quality' Chilean kiwi-fruit and an

FT  18 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Non-oil prices 'set to rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NON-OIL COMMODITY prices will rise by 10 per cent over the next 12 months as
the world economy slowly improves, according to Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank.
At present supplies are restricted while demand is expected to increase, Mr
Ravi Bulchandani, the bank's senior international economist, told a
conference on commodities organised by the bank in London yesterday.
This would normally be an explosive mix - but the prospective economic
recovery was below par and would not therefore lead to the 20 or 30 per cent
price rises usually registered in such circumstances.
Commodity prices are cheap, Mr Bulchandani said. Goldman Sachs' production
cost benchmark, designed to identify a floor for commodity prices below
which there would be a tendency for supplies to contract, suggests most
non-oil commodities are being produced unprofitably, including cotton,
aluminium and grains.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Time to take stock of the
powers that be - World energy chiefs are preparing for their triennial
conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday evening, as Europe awaits the outcome of the French referendum,
King Carlos of Spain will be welcoming 4,000 representatives of the energy
business to Madrid for the World Energy Congress.
This triennial event provides the energy community with an occasion to take
stock. Piles of reports, examining every aspect from windmills to nuclear
power in the 22nd century have been prepared. For five days, the issues will
be debated, and recommendations put forward.
But it is already clear that the WEC will have a comforting message for much
of the rest of the world. The forecasts that have been prepared for
delegates show that energy will be in plentiful supply up to the year 2020 -
and beyond. Even the most conservative estimates suggest that there is
enough oil for over 40 years, enough gas for over 50, and enough coal and
lignite to last for centuries.
The WEC has three possible scenarios. The 'reference case' which assumes
continuation of present policies foresees world energy consumption going up
from 8.7bn tonnes of oil equivalent to 13.3bn in 2020. But if the Third
World countries accelerate their economic growth, this would go up to
17.2bn. On the other hand, if pressures to protect the environment
intensify, consumption may only rise to 11.2bn. One benign factor is the
large scope for increased energy efficiency in the former communist states
of east Europe.
These forecasts show that the decisive issue in the years ahead will not be
the rate of economic activity in the industrial countries (where expanding
demand will be offset by greater energy efficiency), but the pace of
development in the third world, and the extent to which ecological factors
become the dominant global concern.
In fact, the third world occupies a leading position in the WEC brief. The
report notes that there are still large parts of the world that do not have
access to adequate energy supplies.
This holds back their economic growth, and also leads to massive waste
because people use primitive fuel sources, such as trees. The WEC urges
third world countries to institute realistic energy policies, including
providing a secure investment environment to attract capital, and allowing
energy to trade at free market prices. But it also repeats a call made at
its previous meeting in Montreal in 1989 that the energy plight of the third
world should be examined by the United Nations.
The environment will make itself felt through pressures to reduce carbon
emissions and use energy more efficiently. This could have a profound
influence on the structure of the energy sector. Actions - such as taxation
 -may be taken to check consumption of fossil fuels, and encourage cleaner
forms of energy. Policies may be adopted to reduce the energy intensity of
production.
This should provide a stimulus to new technologies, and greater reliance on
renewable forms of energy.
However the WEC does not expect any radical shift in the pattern of energy
sources up to the year 2020. 'It would be unwise to plan for any dramatic
infrastructural change,' it says.
Fossil fuels will continue to dominate the picture, though their share will
fall a bit. Coal, for example, will go from a 26 per cent share in 1990 to
24 per cent in 2020 and oil from 32 per cent to 28 per cent. But gas will
increase its share from 19 per cent to 21 per cent. This means that other
forms of energy - nuclear, hydroelectric and renewables - will rise from 24
per cent to 28 per cent.
But underlying this slow-changing outlook, the WEC urges policies based on
the 'precautionary principle' - the view that actions need to be taken to
encourage diversity of supply in primary energy, and advance the
introduction of newer, cleaner technologies. The WEC does not rule out the
possibility of some future shock, for example the failure of technology to
keep global warmingin check, and the resulting need for a massive and urgent
switch away from fossil fuels.
In particular, the WEC espouses the cause of possibly the most controversial
form of energy - nuclear.
Its share will rise a bit, from 5 to 6 per cent, the WEC believes, adding:
'Nuclear should be supported through rational re-evaluation of public
attitudes, demonstrably safe technology and management, effective and truly
open international inspection, and new generations of plant which satisfy
these criteria.'
If energy is likely to be in plentiful supply in the years ahead, this
could, of course, be bad news for the energy industry which always hankers
after firmer prices. But there are other challenges facing the business, and
these are summed up in a six-point conclusion to the draft report. 'The need
to raise energy efficiency, to introduce new technology and fully exploit
existing technology, to broaden the primary energy resource base, to expand
R&amp;D in these fields, and to tackle environmental problems provide enormous
opportunities for the world's energy industry.'

DELTA Air Lines, one of the big US carriers which is strongly opposing
British Airways' plan to invest Dollars 750m for a large minority stake in
USAir, yesterday called on the US Department of Transportation to hold
public proceedings to consider the issues involved.
The DoT, which must approve the deal, has not said how it plans to proceed -
in particular, whether it will hold public hearings on the matter. Earlier
this week, Mr Andrew Card, the transportation secretary, acknowledged that
there was intense interest in the proposed transaction and its implications
for future aviation policy, with the department receiving thousands of
letters on the subject.
Although BA would only have a minority interest in USAir, the large US
airlines claim that the deal is structured to give the UK airline effective
control over key areas of USAir's business. They claim that BA is thus
gaining access to the US domestic market, while formal bilateral aviation
agreements between the US and the UK severely restrict their access to the
UK.
This week, Mr Card indicated that the bilateral arrangements would be
'relevant' to his department decision on whether to approve the BA-USAir
deal, although he denied any 'formal' linkage between the two issues.
America West Airlines has formally received the funding from its Dollars 53m
debtor-in-possession financing package, Reuters reports from New York.
The company announced a new 10-member board of directors which provides GPA,
one of the financing participants, with two seats.

<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Stock Exchange's market surveillance panel has criticised
interests associated with Sir Robert Jones, the executive chairman of Robt.
Jones Investments, the New Zealand property group, for reducing their
exposure to the company 'by a very substantial amount' without informing
other shareholders.
In an extensive report issued yesterday, the panel condemned what it said
was the failure of directors, and in particular Sir Robert and Mr David
Moriarty, managing director, to inform the market of share transactions and
arrangements, which should have been disclosed. The report follows a
protracted investigation into the placement and sale of shares, and
transactions involving the company and its employee unit trust between March
and September 1990.
Robt. Jones Investments is one of the biggest property groups in Australia
and New Zealand.
Sir Robert is expected to announce his resignation from the board of the
company he founded 10 years ago at today's annual meeting.
The report lists a number of breaches in the exchange's listing
requirements:
funding through an employee unit trust of share sales by interests
associated with Sir Robert Jones;
sales of properties to those interests 'on a non-arms length basis';
the 'material fact that the company's employee unit trust was substantially
involved in certain significant share transactions that were reported to the
market incorrectly'.
Mr Kevin O'Connor, panel chairman, said some of the breaches may have been
connected with efforts to ensure the group's survival.

The Oliver Group, footwear retailer, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds
5.2m to Pounds 4.87m in the half year to June 30.
Overall turnover rose marginally to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 36.8m), but margins
had been hit by rising occupancy and utility costs, and wide-spread retail
price discounting, Mr Ian Oliver, chairman, said.
The sale of the framing division had been followed by the disposal of a
number of uneconomic footwear branches and further disposals were planned,
he said.
Losses per share increased to 19.28p (18.08p) and there is no interim
dividend.
Mr Oliver said he was stepping down from the board with immediate effect for
'someone unfettered by recent history'. Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman of

The effects of recession failed to prevent Frank Usher Holdings, the
USM-traded women's clothing group, from achieving a sharp recovery in
full-year profits.
Despite a reduction of gross margins in the second half, pre-tax profits for
the 12 months to May 31 jumped some 38 per cent, from a depressed Pounds
775,000 to Pounds 1.07m.
Exports accounted for 44 per cent of turnover marginally ahead at Pounds
15.6m. There were record orders for the autumn/winter collections.
Mr Christopher Norland, chairman, said that bad debts increased reflecting
late deliveries from fabric and sub-contract manufacturing suppliers and
slower payments by customers. It was not a cause for concern, he added.
The proposed final dividend is 3p for a total of 5p (4p), payable on
earnings of 10.2p (7.2p).

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (12): The address is an asset
now - In Scotland, partnership is transforming a deprived area of Paisley /
James Buxton has seen the scowl leave the face of Ferguslie Park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT USED to be said in the west of Scotland that anyone who put an address in
Ferguslie Park on their job application form would instantly have it
rejected.
This housing estate in Paisley, 10 miles west of Glasgow, had until very
recently a reputation for being among the worst in Scotland. The
unemployment rate among its 6,000 population was around 40 per cent; many of
the people lived in poverty and squalor; and there were exceptionally high
levels of violence, housebreaking and assaults.
Two years ago, the most powerful impression a visitor to Ferguslie Park came
away with was of the wretched housing: even the best of the dark-grey harled
houses and flats looked damp and run-down, while many were derelict and
boarded up. Some of the open spaces were literally knee-deep in refuse.
The few shops were shuttered and daubed with graffiti. The wide roadways
with ample verges created an impression of emptiness and neglect, which was
reflected in the sullen faces of the inhabitants.
Suddenly, Ferguslie Park looks different. Hundreds of new houses built of
yellow brick have sprung up in one part of the estate. Some are owned by
housing associations and housing co-operatives; others have been bought by
owner occupiers from private developers, an astonishing development for this
area. The passers-by in Ferguslie Park are often friendly and helpful.
These physical changes are the most obvious fruits of a concerted attack on
the evils of Ferguslie Park. In 1988, the estate was chosen as one of four
very deprived urban areas for a new approach to urban renewal by the
Scottish Office entitled 'New Life for Urban Scotland'.
This programme, whose other projects are the Castle-milk estate in Glasgow,
the Wester Hailes area of Edinburgh and the Whitfield estate in Dundee, is
aimed at bringing new leadership to urban renewal in Scotland, which was
previously led by the Scottish Development Agency.
Its key features are: partnership between different agencies, an emphasis on
involving local people and the engagement as far as possible of the private
sector.
Ferguslie Park is the smallest of the four projects. Started in the 1920s,
it suffered almost at once from the decline of the Paisley spinning
industry. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the ill-fated Linwood car plant
lived and died on its doorstep.
The Ferguslie Park Partnership, headed by Mr David Dickson, a Scottish
Office official, is implementing a multi-faceted strategy, of which the
improvement of housing and the environment is only one part. It includes
policies aimed at getting the people of the estate into jobs, improving
education, making the area safer from crime and tackling ill health and
poverty.
About 45 people now work in the partnership offices in the centre of the
estate. It is a one-stop shop in which representatives of government and
local agencies offer their services, ranging from Scottish Homes (the
government's housing agency in Scotland, which funds housing associations)
to the Department of Employment which operates a job centre.
Seven of the 20 places on the board of the partnership are held by local
representatives. The emphasis, explains Mr Wylie Cunningham, of the
partnership, is on 'avoiding a top-down approach to urban regeneration, and
ensuring that the people of the community are consulted and involved all
along.'
In the past three years, about Pounds 40m has been spent. The biggest single
expenditure has been on the Glencoats area, where between Pounds 30m and
Pounds 35m has been spent, of which Pounds 12.5m came from the private
sector, much of it by a joint venture of Miller Homes and Bellway in
building private houses.
About 1,000 of the 2,500 houses or flats on the estate have been, or are
being, renovated, with the bulk of the work taking place in the past year.
Development will now move out to other areas in the 10-year project.
But away from Glencoats it becomes clear how much more there is to do. A
grim shopping parade at Top End is largely unchanged, and one sees a
burnt-out car and supermarket trolleys lying in the road. But much of the
refuse has gone.
Although the building work is the most obvious evidence of the project, much
of the work of the partnership has been on the 'software' side of training
and persuading employers, including the building contractors working on the
site, to employ people from the estate.
The partnership claims credit for finding full-time or temporary jobs for
almost 1,000 people in the past three years, although it is reluctant to put
forward a headline figure to compare with the original 40 per cent
unemployment, because of the difficulties of definition.
A number of projects have been launched with local schools to improve
education and, in the words of Mr Cunningham, to 'convince the youngsters of
the estate that being unemployed is not the norm and that there is work out
there.'
A new road has been pushed through to the Phoenix buiness park, which has
been built on the ruins of Linwood; and the estate benefits from being close
to Glasgow airport, expanding as international flights to North America
develop.
As Ferguslie Park's image begins to improve, its location increasingly
becomes an asset. The partnership denies that effecting a turnaround in the
estate's fortunes was in any way easy, but it does acknowledge that the
estate's small size has been an advantage.
The burden of criticism recently voiced about the New Life for Urban
Scotland projects, by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in
Scotland, is that the schemes are excellent as far as they go but that they
only involve 100,000 people and that there ought to be be more of them,
under a comprehensive funding and delivery mechanism. The Ferguslie Park
experience suggests that success is within reach there, and that the
experience should be repeated.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (13): It's management as much as
money - In Wales, the Swansea Valley typifies the way spoilt land is being
reclaimed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTY YEARS ago, the Lower Swansea Valley was the scene of probably the
worst industrial dereliction in Britain, the result of two and a half
centuries' despoliation that began with copper smelting and ended with steel
production.
Today the area may not be as green as the nearby Brecon Beacons, but a seal
gambols in the river Tawe that runs through the valley, a sports stadium
attracts large numbers of young people, one hotel has arrived and another is
coming, and some 500 companies in the enterprise zone have brought more than
7,000 jobs.
The transformation of this run-down sector of Wales's second city is just
one part of a larger scene, in which the problem of land reclamation in
Wales will soon have been solved, and the problem of urban regeneration will
be well on the way to being resolved.
It is a transformation in which the Welsh Development Agency has become one
of Europe's leading urban renewal agencies.
'When the agency was set up in 1976,' says Mr David Farns-worth, executive
director in charge of development projects, '30,000 acres of derelict land
needed attention. So far, 22,000 have been cleared.
'By 1996 we should have cleared all the derelict land in Wales. The old
steelworks in Ebbw Vale is now the site for this year's National Garden
Festival, and after the festival closes its doors in October an urban
village will be part of the further development of the site.
'In Merthyr, we have the largest coal recovery and land reclamation project
being undertaken in Europe. On Deeside, we helped clear the site when the
steelworks closed, a project that led to several thousand jobs being
created.'
Land reclamation, however, is only one aspect of the agency's work. There is
also the question of urban regeneration. For several years, Wales has had an
urban programme, and it is possible to see the setting up of the English
regeneration agency as having been stimulated by its success.
However, there are differences. In England, City Challenge is about
selectivity and targeting projects, whereas the Welsh programme - the Urban
Joint Venture Agreement - involves the agency joining forces with local
authorities, training and enterprise councils, the tourist board and others
to produce a programme.
'Integration of urban policy with land reclamation and assistance to
business is part of the whole plan,' Mr Farns-worth says. Urban projects are
chosen not just on the basis of the quality of local proposals, but
according to the potential for economic growth for the region as a whole.
'We endeavour to ensure that 'hands on' help from central sources to local
projects is designed not only to make public funds more cost effective, but
also to give Wales an extra dimension in the market-place of the 1990s.'
Some 20 towns, including Caernarfon, Holyhead, Merthyr Tydfil, Maesteg and
Tredegar, have had help or have schemes under consideration. 'There is a
real partnership about these schemes,' Mr Farnsworth says, 'this is the key
to our success.'
The Welsh approach is that town regeneration is as much to do with
management as with money. Lack of co-operation among the various bodies has
acted in the past as a brake on achieving desirable ends. The Welsh
Development Agency has seen a route through this lack of co-operation - a
route that the English agency may yet want to copy.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: UK and Italian markets lifted by ERM
departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian and UK government markets took heart from the departure of their
respective currencies from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The Irish and
Spanish bond markets fell on fears that their currencies might be the next
victims of devaluation, while Danish bonds showed more resilience.
THE sterling yield-curve flattened sharply yesterday in the wake of
Wednesday night's decision to suspend the currency's link to the ERM,
indicating that the UK could be heading for its first positive yield curve
for nearly a decade.
The mood at the shorter end of the market was set by the short sterling
futures contract on Liffe, which traded late in the day at 91.30 - up from
its close last night of 88.65. Its signal that interest rates were expected
to fall to below 8 3/4 per cent from their current 10 per cent level by the
end of the year was echoed in shorter-dated gilts, which rallied strongly.
For example, the 10 per cent gilts due 1996 gained nearly three points on
the day, to end with a yield of 9.21 per cent.
Longer-dated bonds fell only slightly, in spite of the potential
inflationary implications of taking sterling out of the ERM for any
prolonged period of time. The 9 per cent gilts due 2008 lost less than half
a point, closing at a yield of 9.07 per cent.
The extent of the levelling was 'very tame, relative to the fundamental
forces,' said Mr Stephen Lewis, an economist at London Bond Broking Company.
He estimated that if sterling were to fall to DM2.55, it could add half a
point to projected inflation, taking the yield on long gilts up to 9 3/4 per
cent to 10 per cent.
ITALIAN government bonds were the best performers of the day, with gains of
between  1/2 -1 1/2 points, as dealers greeted the government's plans for
budget deficit cuts of more than L90 trillion in the coming fiscal year.
There were also expectations of a cut in interest rates as pressure eased on
the lira after its early fall.
The Liffe December future was trading at 93.12 late in the day, after
Wednesday's close of 92.65, with 14,720 lots exchanged. The day's high was
93.45 and the low 91.20.
On the cash market, the May 2002 BTP ended at 91.93/2.05, up from 90.61/74.
GERMAN bonds ended a volatile day about 0.20 points lower after a volatile
day. The market had opened higher on rumours that the Bundesbank would lower
the Lombard rate by half a percentage point, but then fell back when the
Bundesbank failed to deliver.
News in the early afternoon that the German finance ministry was raising the
volume of July's 8.0 per cent 1992/2002 federal government bond by DM5bn to
DM15bn did not help the market.
The price of the Bund eased to 103.23/29, just below Wednesday's close, from
103.53/59 in mid-morning. The Liffe December Bund future fell to 90.71 from
Wednesday's close of 90.82 with 78,058 contracts traded, after a high of
91.08 and a low of 90.38.
THE Irish government bond market dropped in the morning on fears that the
Irish punt might be the next victim of devaluation. The Bundesbank and the
Irish central bank intervened to protect the punt which was fixed in
Frankfurt at its intervention floor of DM2.619.
A weaker French franc, fears of higher interest rates and the approach of
Sunday's referendum on the Maastricht treaty weighed on French government
bonds. Among French Treasuries, the 8 1/2 OATs of 2003 fell 0.70 to 99.04 to
yield 8.63 per cent compared with 8.53 per cent. At the long end, the 8 1/2
of 2023 dropped 1.14 to 98.68 to yield 8.62 per cent.
ACTIVITY in the Swedish government bond market ground to a halt yesterday as
investors waited for calm to return to the international financial markets
and for news of political agreement in Sweden on proposals to cut government
spending.
The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, kept its marginal lending rate at 500
per cent yesterday in order to crush speculation against the krona.
Short-term interest rates rose at the start of trading, but fell back later
in the day.
Three-month treasury bills were quoted with a spread of 35 per cent to 25
per cent at the opening, falling to 29 per cent to 24 per cent by the close.
US treasury prices barely moved yesterday as players cautiously waited for
developments in European markets to unfold.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged at 98
31/32 , yielding 7.330 per cent.
With events in Europe continuing to dominate US markets, there was little
reaction to domestic economic news. Jobless claims for the week ended
September 5 advanced 6,000 to 400,000.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Swiss safe haven draws another issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE safe haven attraction of the Swiss currency during the current
turbulence in the European Monetary System prompted another borrower to tap
the Euro-Swiss franc bond market yesterday.
Bankers said the Electricite de France SFr100m offering was aggressively
priced for an issue with a 6 5/8 per cent coupon at 102, to yield 6.413 per
cent, but that this was not surprising since the French utility is a
top-quality borrower. What was more unusual was the 15-year duration of the
bond.
The issue was being quoted at about 2 1/2 points below its issue price,
yielding 6.65 per cent in late afternoon trading, just inside the lead
manager's fees. Some bankers also thought that the coupon was very low at 6
5/8 per cent, even though coupons have fallen from the 7 1/4 per cent on
Swiss Franc bond issues earlier in the week.
Lead managers UBS said switching by investors from the short end to the long
end of the Euro-Swiss franc bond market made this the ideal time to launch a
bond with a long maturity. The bank added that it was having no problems in
placing the bond.
Elsewhere, joint lead manager JP Morgan Securities announced that the
pricing of Kingdom of Spain's Dollars 1.5bn seven-year Eurobond, launched on
Wednesday, had been deferred until next Tuesday. The market was not unduly
surprised by the decision, following the failure to attract investor
interest in the light of upheaval in European financial markets.
The credit rating of Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK group, was cut by
two notches by Moody's Investor Service yesterday in reaction to its planned
demerger.
ICI's rating tumbled from Aa3 to A2, affecting around Dollars 3bn of debt
outstanding. The decision reflected Moody's belief that the planned demerger
of the group's biosciences business would proceed, leading to a significant
shift in the group's risk profile at a difficult time for the basic chemical
industry.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Debt convergence theory comes
under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE convergence theory, which has provided the intellectual backbone to most
investors' trading strategies in the European bond markets in recent times,
was looking distinctly shaky yesterday.
'It is largely, if not completely, blown out of the water,' was the
conclusion of one large UK fixed income investor.
Like others, he had expected pressures to build up in the ERM, diverting EC
member states from their march towards monetary and economic union - though
not with the speed shown by the sudden swing of sentiment in the foreign
exchanges on Wednesday.
'We certainly didn't expect it to happen as quickly or as violently as it
did,' he said.
The virtual ejection of sterling and the Italian lira from the ERM, and the
devaluation of the peseta, left investors yesterday casting around for the
next theory on which to hang their investment plans. Whether to sell bonds
and buy gilts, and which European currencies now offer the best profit
potential, were just two of the questions over which investors were
scratching their heads.
Some fundamental investment strategies are likely to be altered in the days
and weeks ahead.
'We haven't convened the asset allocation committee yet,' said Mr David
Shaw, head of fixed income investment at Legal &amp; General, the UK insurer.
That will only happen after the French referendum this weekend, which
investors hope will give a clearer indication of where the ERM goes from
here.
L&amp;G has been one of the standard-bearers of the move by some UK insurers
away from equities and into gilts, prompted by a belief that the discipline
of the ERM made the outperformance of equities a thing of the past.
Mr Shaw said yesterday: 'That was based on the assumption that we were a
fully paid-up member of the ERM. That is now subject to almost daily review.
We haven't reached any conclusion here yet - we are waiting for an economic
statement from the government.'
While investors wait for the political fog in the UK to part and a clearer
indication to emerge of the way forward for UK economic policy, the markets
were busy yesterday making up the government's mind for it: short-dated gilt
prices tumbled in anticipation of UK base rates falling smartly, while
sterling remained well below its former floor in the ERM. Longer-dated
gilts, though, reflected only a hint of the possible implications of a
devaluation and return to the UK's old inflationary ways.
'People have factored-in continental European-type inflation for the UK of 3
per cent,' one investor said. 'Now, people will have to put it closer to 5
per cent. On that basis, gilts are not very good value.'
Much depends on whether an attempt is made in the coming days to weld
sterling and the lira back on to the ERM - and whether the peseta can stay
tied.
If so, then some investors were arguing yesterday that the convergence
process could restart - and could actually be stronger than before. If a
lower parity for currencies such as sterling allowed interest rates to fall,
then economic recovery would come faster. That would lead to tax revenues
climbing, helping European states to get a firmer grip on their fiscal
deficits. That, in turn, would make it easier for countries to hit the
Maastricht convergence criteria, making monetary union more rather than less
likely.
There were few believers in this theory yesterday, however.
'As and when the ERM finally blows itself apart, the market will come back
to valuing markets on fundamentals,' one investor said. And then convergence
really would be a thing of the past.

MALAYSIA'S Ministry of Finance has given the go-ahead for the establishment
of a Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Kloffe).
A consortium of private firms will run the new exchange. Those involved are
believed to have strong political connections. They are the New Straits
Times newspaper group; Renong, an industrial conglomerate; and two
securities firms, Rashid Hussain Bhd and Zalik Securities.
The consortium had been involved in a tussle with the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) and the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange (KLCE) for operation
of the new exchange. The KLSE and KLCE were each offered a 20 per cent
equity participation in Kloffe by its future operators, but both bodies
declined.

JAPAN'S Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) plans to establish a committee

business should join the JSDA, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'We plan to establish a committee to cope with the possibility that
financial institutions will want to join the association,' said Mr Sakae
Kudo, chairman. At the moment, only securities houses can join the JSDA.
Under the revised Securities and Exchange Act, financial institutions which
engage in the securities business on their own account or sell Japanese
government bonds over the counter can set up their own regulatory body or
join the JSDA. The revised act is expected to take effect in April and the
JSDA should work out conditions allowing new members into the association
next year, officials said.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: 'Contrasts' on the South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For this week, the pianist Andras Schiff and the oboist Heinz Holliger
devised a chamber music series - not, for once, billed as a 'festival' which
is enjoying a brave success. Brave, because as the title 'Contrasts'
delicately suggests, each programme offered a very mixed bag: not only a
variety of pieces for different players, but ranging from slight (piano-duet
marches by Beethoven) to substantial (Mozart's piano-and-wind quintet), and
from Bach to brand-new music that would normally attract far smaller
audiences.
For the second concert, the premiere of a new wind quintet by Harrison
Birtwistle was cancelled, in circumstances which remain obscure; but the
first boasted two recent works by Elliott Carter. Inner Song, an oboe monody
in memory of the composer Stefan Wolpe, was exquisitely played by Holliger.
Meditative, lyrical and limpid, it sounded almost diatonic (a 'white-note'
piece, so to speak), and served as a deceptive appetiser for the much
tougher 1991 Quintet which ended the concert.
This latter employs the same instruments as Mozart's transparent
masterpiece, to which Carter professes a certain debt. That might go
unremarked, for Carter's single, unbroken movement (some 24 minutes long) is
darkly dramatic. Like other recent Carter, it explores a highly individual
harmonic palette, more striking than the promised 'dialectic interplay' -
until a late section in its sequence of high-profile contrasts, when the
dialogue becomes furious and the clarinettist takes his E-flat instrument up
to a shrieking climax.
At the start, over sustained wind-chords, Schiff delivered the
piano-rhetoric with stinging force. He stayed in that mode for most of the
piece; I suspect that there is more to be discovered in his part, gentler
tones and intimations. Still, the fierce lucidity of the Quintet was
gripping. It will repay acquaintance, with dividends.
The winds' contribution, here and everywhere, was exemplary. It was a
particular pleasure to hear more of Radovan Vlatkovic, a rare visitor but
one of the most musical horn players in the world. They all shone in Gyorgy
Kurtag's early Wind Quintet, brilliantly economical, witty and passionate;
and in a less remarkable but appealing Diptych by the late Sandor Veress.
An unexpectedly fascinating piece came from Isang Yun, an ex-Korean composer
who has found safe haven in Germany, where his music is more often heard
than here. It was his trio Rondell (Holliger, Elmar Schmid's suave clarinet
and Klaus Thunemann's ripe bassoon): seven coolly intense sections, only a
couple of them quick, which develop inexorably and at last, with portamento
slides, go into ritual Oriental keening. Quite haunting: I long to hear it
again.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: The Force of Destiny - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited new Force of Destiny at the English National Opera is
serious, decisive, absorbing, ultimately unsatisfying. It reveals a
thorough-going attempt to contain all the elements of Verdi's tremendous
operatic canvas without resort to either 'editorial' intervention or
simple-minded naturalistic spectacle. It lays a clean, lucidly argued grasp
on the theme - the pitilessly unchanging nature of human passions and
obsessions - that runs like a blood-red thread through all the variegated
episodes of peace and war, inn and monastery, town and country.
Alike by the conductor, Mark Elder, and the producer, Nicholas Hytner, it is
worked with considerable theatrical acumen. The scene-changes are fast, the
visual strokes arresting (semi-abstract, semi-symbolic props balanced
against bright-coloured 19th-century costumes); there is practical
encouragement of some impressively concentrated, musically and dramatically
authoritative leading performances. In Josephine Barstow, a long-celebrated
ENO Leonora, the staging possesses a leading lady whose immense powers of
physical and vocal theatricality have been distilled to a new and sublimely
potent essence: she seems to have re-charged the character's whole being, so
that every phrase, every detail become suffused with a dark, tragic radiance
unmatched in my experience of this opera. There is an ambitious new
translation by Jeremy Sams, surer of tone in comic and demi-caractere mode
than in dramatic.
And yet, on the evidence of Wednesday's opening performance, the show fails
to click. The problem is partly of Verdi's making: the familiar 1869 Scala
revision, preferred by ENO, may smooth down the rough edges of the 1862 St
Petersburg original (which both the Welsh and Scottish companies and the
Proms have with profit explored in recent years), but Act 3 in its expanded
and re-ordered form sprawls uncomfortably. It is a problem compounded by the
recourse of the ENO designer, Richard Hudson, to the stage revolve, which
whirls the basic set (a strikingly shaped half-cone bounded by a rising
stairway) round and round to provide each new scene-change.
As so often in a production based on the activities of a dominant stage
machine, what starts off as a boon-bestowing technical solution ends by
disgorging difficulties of its own - in this case, a noisy whoosh and hum
and an overly forceful tucking of every loose end into the design pattern.
Hytner drills his soldiers, orderlies, camp-followers, whores, recruits and
beggars (all distinctly well-scrubbed and smartly dressed) round the
perimeter and into the central cavity in a manner that seems oddly 'showbiz'
for this most intellectually stringent of the younger British
opera-producers. (Preziosilla's 'Rataplan', which Verdi re-sited to form a
splashy but narratively distracting curtain to the 1869 third act revision,
is here a Big Number surprisingly coarsely executed.)
In some successful Forza productions of recent times the opera's disjunctive
dramaturgy has been transformed into a virtue (of an extraordinarily modern
kind). In this one the hanging-together comes to seem a feat of physical
imposition rather than of textual re-imagining.
In the foreground, though, the characters are placed and confronted with the
clarity (which means, among other things, stillness in moments of
reflection) and intelligence that are the more familiar Hytner fingerprints.
Jonathan Summers's Carlos, ravaged by the end into a figure of terrifying
madness, is an astonishing creation, embodied and enacted with fierce
discipline - of all on stage he makes consistently most of the words. John
Connell, whose unforced bass seems to be developing new resources of power
and emotional range, proves a very strong Father Superior, ruggedly human,
sympathetically placed alongside Alan Opie's brilliantly vivid Melitone.
And Edmund Barham, using his ringing tenor with greater malleability of tone
and line than previously on this stage, rises to the tragic pessimism of
Alvaro's role with genuine largeness of stature. He, and all the others,
owed much to the Verdian steadiness and 'long line' of Elder's conducting,
even if it lacked much of the forward-moving excitement that also needs to
inform a Forza performance.

The blurring of the line between factual and fictional crime, pursued by the
BBC in 'Crimewatch UK' with dramatised versions of real crimes, is taken a
stage further by ITV's series Crime Story (9.00). The tales here are 'based
on' true crimes but they are 'not so much about crime and detection', more
about 'passion, jealousy, greed or irrational love'. Writers have
'elaborated' upon what really happened to create 'high quality original
drama'. In the first of three programmes about tribal passions, Under The
Sun (9.00 BBC2) goes to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, ruled by Serbs, who
regard it as the birthplace of their civilisation, but inhabited by a
population which is 80 per cent ethnic Albanian. BBC1's excellent police
series Between The Lines (9.30), about an internal investigation unit,
features a complaint about sexual harrassment against a black sergeant. His
feelings about the woman police officer are awfully like those of
investigator Tony Clark towards his Wpc mistress. Terry And Julian (10.30
C4) is the closest that television has come to its own 'Carry On' series -
'Carry On Limp Wristedly'.

Britain, according to Dr Nasser D. Khalili, could become 'the Mecca for
Islamic art'. Whether Britain does will depend on the government's response
to Khalili's offer to present his superb collection of Islamic art to the
nation. The terms of the offer, as he explained to the Financial Times, are
not only conditional but highly specific: a museum in central London, to be
named after himself.
Khalili puts the value of his collection at over Pounds 1 billion. It
consists of some 20,000 pieces chosen to span all Islamic cultural
artifacts, from Korans, coins and astrolabes to armour, seals, and precious
scraps of letters written on papyrus in the first century of Islam. It is a
collection, Khalili claims, which has no gaps.
This hoard, stored in warehouses around the world, is described by experts
as the finest privately owned collection of Islamic art. In the 1980s,
Khalili wrote a doctoral thesis at London University on Islamic lacquerware.
Two years ago, he endowed a chair in Islamic art and archaeology at the
University. Its holder, Michael Rogers, emphasises the scholarly importance
of a collection which is 'the product of an informed and inquiring mind
anxious to show the close relations of the arts in different media.'
Despite his name Khalili, 46, is Jewish. He was born in Iran where the
Jewish community traditionally use both Jewish and Arab names - his second
name is David. He left Iran in 1967 and has lived in London since 1980. Over
20 years and in great secrecy, Khalili has built up his collection out of a
fortune from dealing in art, property and commodities.
A notable coup was in 1980 when he bought at Sotheby's the World History by
Rashid al-Din, part of an extraordinarily important manuscript written at
Tabriz in 1314. At Pounds 935,000 it was the most expensive medieval
manuscript ever sold, and remains the most costly Oriental manuscript. He
points out that the opportunity is there for the Persian vizier's
masterpiece to return to Britain - and for him to achieve what he
deprecatingly calls 'my stupid vision.'
This vision has been of a great art-collection to represent the achievement
of Islam, a religion and culture he sees as grievously misjudged. After the
years of secrecy, Khalili is now seeking maximum publicity for his
collection.
An expensive and unique publishing venture is part of the campaign. On
October 22, a party at the Foreign Office will mark the launch of four
beautiful volumes cataloguing the Korans in the collection. The next few
years will see the publication of a further 22 volumes. Through this massive
publishing venture many of the world's leading Islamic scholars have been
brought into contact with the Nour Foundation, set up under the chairmanship
of Lord Young of Graffham to publicise the Khalili Collection.
To achieve his vision, Khalili intends to install his collection in a museum
which will bear his name. As his adopted home and a centre of Islamic
scholarship, the UK governments is being given the first offer. For 15
years, the Khalili collection should be housed in a separate museum in
central London. It must be a building of between 3,500 and 5000 square
metres and would be fully staffed with curators and conservators. As well as
giving public access to the collection, the museum must function as a centre
for teaching and research.
During that period, loan exhibitions would take the collection around the
world, the cost to be born by the host nations. The Museum would be a
growing collection, objects being added and also sold. Khalili is determined
it should not suffer the fate of the Chester Beatty bequest, turned down by
the British government and now fossilised and unvisited in a Dublin suburb.
But what about the expense of a new museum, to be created for 15 years in
the first instance and at a time when flagship national collections such as
the British Museum and the National Gallery vociferously bemoan their
financial plight? What, too, of the objection that London already has enough
museums already?
Khalili's answer is that the UK can ill afford to pass up his offer. With a
population of 2 1/2 million Moslems, it is time the country made a big
gesture to acknowledge their role. Yet the museum needs to be in London, not
in Bradford or other major areas of Moslem population, so that it will be
easily accessible to international tourism.
The museum's cost would be 'peanuts' compared with the benefits it would
bring, not only in of tourist revenue but also in terms of good will from
the Islamic world and giving Britain the lead within Europe in cultural
relations with the Middle East.
Other countries have expressed a keen interest in the collection. Spain is
said to have already agreed to meet Khalili's conditions. However, Khalili
is prepared to wait while the negotiations with the British government run
their no doubt tortuous course. 'I am offering the horse, its just a case of
providing the saddle', he says. But his clearly stated preference is for a
British saddle for his extraordinary gift-horse.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: Medea - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What with Hecuba at the Gate, The Thebans at the Barbican and now Medea at
the Almeida, London has begun to sprout a Greek festival. Unless there is to
be a touch of Aristophanes to lighten it up, perhaps the time has come to
say that enough is enough. Medea, in particular, is heavy going. The Almeida
production repeatedly brings to mind the remark by the philosopher,
Wittgenstein: 'Of one thing I am certain. We are not here in order to have a
good time.'
I should also admit to a growing prejudice. After exposure to The Thebans
last week (a production with many virtues) I find it increasingly difficult
to take seriously people who, however otherwise intelligent, persisted in
believing in the oracle at Delphi, the Furies and the inevitability of doom.
Medea is Euripides' first surviving tragedy. The story is gruesome. It was
Medea who, with her magic arts, enabled Jason to pick up the golden fleece
from Colchis and returned with him to Greece. She married him; they had
children. The play begins when he is preparing to ditch her in order to
marry into the ruling family. Medea has the future wife murdered, then kills
her own children. That is about it.
The piece has some pathos. Medea is an immigrant in a foreign land who
perhaps does not fully appreciate the benefits that Greek civilisation is
supposed to bestow. She is a strong character and does not take kindly to
Jason's proposal to move up in the social hierarchy. The underlying theme of
the Almeida production, and presumably the reason why it has been put on, is
that there have always been Jasons: women should stand up to them. As Medea
puts is in a new translation by Alistair Elliot: 'It's natural for a woman
to be angry with a husband embarking on a second marriage.'
Medea is played by Diana Rigg, a fine actress, full of passion, intelligence
and looks that kill. But one wonders if she sat in the audience and watched
this production whether it would occur to her how relentlessly, hellenically
monotonous it is.
There are one or two redeeming features. The chorus, played by three women
in a mixture of speech and song, is much more effective than the far bigger
chorus in The Thebans. The music by Jonathan Dove is very good. There is an
excellent performance by Dan Mullane as the messenger who describes the
horrors of the murder perpetrated by Medea on her rival.
Tim Woodward has an embarrassing time as Jason, since the production is
rigged against him and - to be fair to the women's movement - he has no
plausible excuses for his action. Direction is by Jonathan Kent.
Almeida Theatre until October 24 (071) 359 4404

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (2): New agency will revive
tired land - John Willman talks to the new minister responsible for the
inner cities about the next step in the reclamation of the UK's wasted acres
/ Interview with John Redwood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THIS time next year, there should be a new force in urban regeneration in
England. Provided parliament approves, the Urban Regeneration Agency (URA)
will be up and running, armed with powers to reclaim and develop derelict
and under-used land in England - and up to Pounds 300m a year to spend.
For Mr John Redwood, the new inner cities minister, the URA offers an
opportunity to extend nationwide the approach which has been so successful
for the urban development corporations (UDCs).
'Development corporations were the right way forward for large blocks of
land in one place, which needed a big budget to revive,' he says. 'The URA
will tackle smaller areas, as a sort of roving UDC.
'There remains over 150,000 acres of land in our towns and cities which
could be better used. The URA will have funds which can be used to trigger
private-sector investment, and compulsory purchase powers where needed to
assemble land for development.'
The URA will take over responsibility for two parts of the urban programme:
Derelict land grant, which over the past four years has funded the treatment
of 10,000 acres of derelict land, mainly by local authorities; and
City grant, introduced to help the private sector develop inner-city sites
which would not otherwise have been viable - it has levered in Pounds 1bn of
private investment since 1988.
These two grants will immediately give the agency control over more than
Pounds 100m of government expenditure. But the URA will also take over
English Estates, the government body which helps provide industrial and
commercial premises in the assisted areas and certain other development
areas. Sales of land and property by English Estates could provide another
Pounds 200m a year for the URA.
Ideally, the agency will act at the request of a local authority, says Mr
Redwood. In most cases, an active partnership with the local council will be
essential, for the URA will not automatically have planning powers.
In exceptional circumstances, however, the agency will be given development
control powers in areas designated by the secretary of state. But even then,
development would have to be within the framework of the local planning
authority's plans.
'There will be considerable attractions for local councils to co-operate
with the agency,' Mr Redwood says. 'The URA will have cash, contacts and
expertise which can all assist local efforts.'
With larger projects, there may even be some form of local participation,
with a steering group bringing together all the partners required for
successful urban regeneration: central government, the local authority, the
private sector and voluntary and community groups.
It is the creation of such partnerships across the country that Mr Redwood
sees as the great achievement of 13 years of Conservative urban regeneration
policy. He is particularly enthusiastic about City Challenge, the process by
which inner-city areas bid for funds for urban regeneration.
'It was one of Michael Heseltine's most creative ideas on his return to the
environment department,' he says. 'City Challenge changes the way that
people look at regenerating their area: they realise that it can't be done
by government money alone.'
On arriving at the department of the environment's Marsham Street
headquarters in the post-election reshuffle, he was faced with 54 bids for
funds in the second round of City Challenge. To the surprise of officials,
he decided that every bidding authority should have the opportunity to make
a presentation of its case to a minister - John Redwood personally sat in on
some 20 bids.
Choosing the winners was no simple matter.
'In every case, we asked ourselves the question, does the scheme make sense
 -will it work? Some did not, but most did, so we then went on to make the
hard decisions about which offered the best way to spend the money.
'There was no difficulty in agreeing on the 10 best proposals, or in
eliminating the weakest. But in between, there was a large block of bids of
merit which were very difficult to separate.
'At the margins, we came down to examining levels of relative deprivation to
select which should go forward.'
Mr Redwood is sensitive to the plight of the unsuccessful bidders,
especially those who have failed in both rounds.
'We have tried to include an outline of the reasons when writing to those
local authorities which were unsuccessful,' he says. 'I am very open to
discussion to help improve the chances of subsequent bids.'
And he points out that the plans drawn up to prepare bids are not wasted:
they can be used to apply for funds under other parts of the urban programme
or to raise capital from the private sector.
Despite his evident enthusiasm for the way that City Challenge galvanises
local authorities, Mr Redwood cautions that the jury is still out on whether
it can deliver its promise.
'It remains to be seen whether the partnerships which are formed to mount
bids can be held together,' he says. 'We shall be following their progress
closely, ensuring that targets are met.'
But he is confident that a new relationship is developing between the
Conservative government and the largely Labour-controlled inner-city local
authorities. One symbol of that is the partnership between the prime
minister and the leader of Manchester city council to bid for the Olympic
games on behalf of the city.
Another is the more emollient approach taken to the reform of local
government management. Proposals put out by Mr Heseltine for consultation
last year - which included the introduction of directly elected mayors -
have been referred to a working group, including local authority
representatives, to examine best practice and come up with an agreed
approach.
'We wish to work with local councils,' says Mr Redwood. 'And there is a
realisation on their side - particularly since the election - that if they
want to speak for their own areas, they must talk to us.'
After 13 years of often open warfare between Whitehall and the town halls,
Mr Redwood's desire for a new relationship will be widely welcomed.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (1): Charm and a challenge - As
Whitehall encourages local leadership in its approach to inner city
regeneration, council leaders have come to realise the need to work with the
grain of government policy if they are to do the best for their areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LAST two years have seen a remarkable evolution in UK urban policy, with
a new partnership emerging between the government and inner-city councils.
After a decade of antagonism between central and local government, ministers
with responsibility for local government have launched a charm offensive to
build new relationships.
Previously, local government was seen as an impediment to restoring
inner-city areas - even, through its attitudes, as a factor in urban decay.
Now the emphasis in Whitehall is on fostering local leadership as part of
the solution.
Rather than holding control over spending at the centre, an increasing
proportion of government funds is being dispensed to local authorities to
spend as they see fit to implement agreed strategies.
Council leaders, for their part, recognise that, with the re-election of a
fourth-term Conservative government, they must work with the grain of
government policy, if they are to do the best for their areas.
The key change in creating this new partnership in urban regeneration was
the return of Michael Heseltine to the Cabinet at the end of 1990, for a
second term at the department of the environment. Mr Heseltine had spent
time on the back benches, drawing lessons from his first term at the
department and looking at overseas experience, particularly in North
America.
During his first term, he had invented the urban development corporations
(UDCs), to demonstrate a new approach to inner-city regeneration. Government
funds were used to reclaim derelict land and provide infrastructure, in
order to tempt the private sector back into urban areas. Scarce public
resources would be used to lever in much larger amounts of private
investment, encouraging partnerships between the sectors rather than leaving
everything to the public sector.
The UDCs have had mixed success: some were much more successful than others
in attracting private investment; and the collapse of the commercial
property market has stalled some of the more ambitious plans, especially in
London Docklands. But none has failed to make an impact on its area - and
there have been spectacular successes as the table of comparative data on
page 2 of this survey shows.
Since the UDCs are necessarily limited in scope to relatively small areas,
Mr Heseltine sought a way of persuading urban local authorities to take the
leadership role in similar strategies. The solution was City Challenge:
offering significant sums of money for inner-city projects to councils which
could demonstrate the active participation of the private sector.
The money was to be allocated by competitive bidding, putting the onus on
local authorities to make the case - a challenge which most have taken up
with enthusiasm.
Mr Victor Hausner, whose London-based consultancy advises the environment
department on the programme, emphasises the importance of the new role given
to local government. 'City Challenge is probably the most significant nod to
local authorities in the last decade,' he says.
A key element of the City Challenge approach was its 'one-stop' nature:
rather than deal with several departments to win funding under different
heads, councils could bid for a single sum to be spent in a number of ways.
The size of the purse was also important: instead of spreading the jam too
thinly across many areas, the idea was to make a significant impact on a
relatively small area. Equally significant was the five-year perspective:
successful regeneration requires the sort of long-term planning which the
uncertainties of annual funding make difficult.
The downside of the competitive bidding for funds is that, inevitably, there
must be losers as well as winners. It is this element which has led critics
to describe City Challenge as a gameshow - though this has not usually
stopped the critics from bidding, often successfully, for funds.
But the need for there to be losers, pour encourager les autres, raises the
question of what happens to areas which repeatedly fail to produce
convincing bids. So far, some 30 of the 57 urban priority areas have been
successful: but three - Bristol, Salford and Sheffield - have failed in both
rounds.
As the case study of Bristol, on page 4, shows, such a failure can be
particularly disheartening for the voluntary bodies which form part of the
team in putting together a bid. If losing knocks the stuffing out of those
in the front line, the effect of entering City Challenge could actually be
to damage an area's prospects.
Already there is evidence that ad hoc solutions have to be found when City
Challenge bids fail. When Birmingham failed to win funds for its Heartlands
regeneration project in the first pacemaker round, a UDC was unexpectedly
conjured up.
The project was an ambitious partnership between private and public sector
of exactly the type the government was keen to foster. Yet it looked likely
to collapse without the funds sought under City Challenge for land
reclamation and infrastructure.
Creating a UDC allowed the government to bridge the gap with a similar level
of funding, to the surprise of many who had thought that the development
corporations were soon to be wound up. Large urban areas cannot be allowed
to fail, especially when they are politically marginal.
Those local authorities which have so far failed in City Challenge will, no
doubt, look forward to a third round next year. However, the decision has
yet to be made on whether there will be another round. The large amounts of
money committed to inner-city regeneration are an attractive target for the
Treasury in a tough public expenditure round.
Even if there is a further round, the list of urban priority areas eligible
to bid will be reviewed. The 57 were selected on the basis of the 1981
census, and many of the areas included have changed considerably since then.
It will have surprised many, for example, that the prosperous south-west
London borough of Wandsworth was in on the bidding, along with very deprived
councils, such as North Tyneside and London's Tower Hamlets.
With new data coming through from the 1991 census in November, it would not
be surprising if the list were to be amended, and even shortened, before a
further round of City Challenge.
Finally, there will be new opportunities for inner-city development once the
new Urban Regeneration Agency is launched later next year under the
chairmanship of Lord Walker. Mr John Redwood, the inner cities minister,
describes the URA as a 'roving UDC' in his interview, on page 2. It will be
able to clear land and - if necessary - sweep away red tape, with a healthy
budget to encourage private sector investment.
The agency will not supplant the existing UDCs, which will continue to
receive separate funding until they are wound up (probably by the middle of
the decade). However, it will work closely with them, with a committee of
UDC chairmen meeting regularly with Lord Walker to discuss common problems.
Lord Walker has extensive experience of urban regeneration from his periods
as environment secretary and as Welsh secretary. In the latter position, he
worked closely with local authorities, using government resources skilfully
to promote regeneration in Wales.
He will be equally keen to promote good relationships with local
authorities, adding further to the constructive bipartisan approach which is
now developing.

Wall Street
US STOCKS moved narrowly with no clear trend yesterday and activity was
subdued as Wall Street remained focused on events in Europe, writes Karen
Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 3.51 off at 3,315.70, after
showing a gain of some six points at midday. NYSE turnover was
unexceptional, at less than 190m shares, with falls leading rises by 940 to
785. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was just 0.01 up at 419.93 and the Nasdaq
composite put on 1.93 to 587.82.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its index of business
activity in the area grew to 14.7 in September from August's 12.6, implying
slow but steady expansion in the manufacturing sector. Initial unemployment
claims for the week ended September 5 were up 6,000 to 400,000. There was
little market reaction to the domestic economic news, as attention remained
riveted on European money markets.
GTE, the biggest US local telephone company, led NYSE trading. The stock
firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 33 after the company announced that it had
priced a 30m common stock offering at Dollars 32 7/8 a share. GTE has about
895m shares outstanding.
International Business Machines edged Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars 83 3/4
, after losing Dollars 2 5/8 on Wednesday when analysts lowered their
ratings on the stock and reduced earnings forecasts following news that
Amdahl, another big mainframe computer maker, expected a third-quarter loss.
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing declined Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 101 3/4
after the company warned that its 1992 earnings could fall at the low end of
analysts' estimates, depending on the economy. Analysts had predicted 1992
earnings of about Dollars 5.70 to Dollars 5.80 a share, after a 1991 figure
of Dollars 5.26.
United Technologies, the aero-engines to motor components group, tumbled
Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 51 3/8 on reports that its third-quarter results
would fall short of expectations.
Boeing eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 after the company reached an
agreement in principle with GPA Group, the aircraft leasing concern, to
defer delivery of up to 154 aircraft worth Dollars 5bn for up to three
years.
National Westminster's American Depositary Shares rose Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 38 after the UK bank cut its base lending rate to 10 per cent from
12 per cent, bringing it back to its Wednesday morning level.
Constar International soared Dollars 7 7/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 after agreeing
to be acquired by Crown Cork &amp; Seal for Dollars 32 1/2 a share. Crown Cork
slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 36 1/8 .
In Nasdaq trading, Apple Computer lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 after an
analyst at Donaldson Luf-kin &amp; Jenrette downgraded his rating on the stock
from 'neutral' to 'unattractive'. Canada
A FIRMER Canadian dollar eased currency worries, but Toronto stocks ended
lower as participants remained cautious. The French Maastricht vote on
Sunday, the triple-witching expiry and concern about European currencies
pressured the market.
The TSE 300 index lost 7.7 at 3,446.1 and falls outpaced advances by 319 to
240 after volume of 31.3m shares.

FT  18 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Denmark's fall mars its reputation for
caution / Review of performance in Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danish share market has put up one of Europe's worst performances this
year, with a fall in the CSE index to date of 24 per cent, as a reputation
for financial propriety has been damaged by financial sector trauma
elsewhere in the Nordic bloc, as well as by some problems at home.
At the beginning of the year, almost everyone forecast a solid rise in
Copenhagen share prices in 1992. The assumptions behind this forecast were
that interest rates would fall and that recovery in the US economy would
lift international demand.
Both these conditions have been disappointed, and domestic factors have made
matters worse. First, Danish voters injected a new element of uncertainty
into the equation when they rejected the Maastricht treaty in the referendum
on June 2. This has resulted in an increase in the yield gap between Danish
and German bonds from about 80 basis points before the referendum to around
180 points now.
The fall in share prices has actually been slightly less than is warranted
by the rise in yields in bond markets, said one Copenhagen broker yesterday.
The risk premium for investing in shares has therefore narrowed from about
one per cent at the beginning of the year to about 0.5 per cent today.
Secondly, the collapse of Hafnia Holding, parent company of the Hafnia
insurance group, which went into payments suspension in August, has upset
investors, especially foreigners. Although the problems in the Danish
financial sector are not as severe as they are in the other Nordic
countries, it is difficult for outsiders to see this, says a Copenhagen
broker.
The future of the market will also depend on interest rate movements.
'Prices should not fall much more,' says Mr Flemming Madsen, chief analyst
at Danske Bors, the broking arm of Danske Bank, 'but they will remain very
sensitive to interest rate changes.'
Mr Madsen and other brokers point out that on earnings performance the
bigger Danish industrials do not deserve the fall in share prices which they
have seen this year. An average increase in earnings of 11 per cent is
expected for this group in 1992, followed by a further improvement in 1993,
meaning that prospective price/earnings ratios are now lower than at any
time for three years.
Stock prices for some of these companies, Novo Nordisk, Danisco, FLS
Industries, Radiometer, and Sophus Berendsen among them, can be expected to
bounce strongly once the market in general begins to recover, brokers say.
On the other hand, shipping shares, banks and other financial institutions
are not recommended by Danish brokers.
The difficulties in the freight market were behind one of the more dramatic
developments in the Danish market over the past month, when the East Asiatic
Company's share price fell from a high of DKr92 to DKr52 after reporting a
first-half loss of DKr181m.
The loss arose mainly in the group's shipping operations, but investors lost
confidence more especially as a result of criticism of the management.
EAC had recovered to DKr66 last night. Mr Henning Sparso, the group's
chairman for the past 10 years, resigned after a board meeting last Friday,
and an outsider, Mr Jan Erlund, who is a lawyer, was named to succeed him
after a meeting of shareholders has approved the appointment in October.
Banks are not in such deep trouble as those in other Nordic countries and,
so far, none of the larger banks has had trouble in meeting Denmark's
exceptionally high 10 per cent capital adequacy ratio.
Indeed, shares in the two big banks are still above par value, which
contrasts with bank shares in the other Nordic countries, with Den Danske
Bank's at DKr229 and Unidanmark's at DKr132 last night. They are, however,
down 32 and 44 per cent respectively from their 1992 highs and, until
interest rates fall and domestic demand picks up, they will continue to face
a difficult period.

effect

HOPES of lower interest rates boosted shares in Milan yesterday, but the
Bundesbank's decision to keep its rates high hit prices in Paris and
Frankfurt, writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani, the Goldman Sachs strategist, said last night that
recent events were good news for European equities, at a minimum implying
lower interest rates in countries where they had risen to protect the
currency, and a probable acceleration in the timetable to cut German rates.
FRANKFURT closed an uncertain day with a late decline, the DAX index ending
5.89 lower at 1,578.67. Caution reigned ahead of the expiry of stock and
futures options today, and the French Maastricht referendum on Sunday, and
turnover fell from DM6.3bn to DM5.9bn.
Currency considerations moved from the D-Mark/dollar relationship to that
with others in the EC, and the threat to some major exporters. Volkswagen
dropped DM9.20 to DM320.80, cutting its rise on the week to just DM4.80,
while BMW, only DM2.50 lower at DM544.50, stayed DM28.50 ahead on the week.
Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that VW had such
thin margins in Europe that a 1 per cent swing in the D-Mark/French franc
parity could wipe out its trading profits there, whereas BMW was much more
profitable. VW too, he said, was more susceptible to the fear that the
German consumer would cut spending, and push up the national savings ratio
in the interests of economic austerity.
That fear hit retailing, where Douglas, Karstadt and Kaufhof fell DM10 to
DM455, DM4.50 to DM525, and DM11.50 to DM418.50 respectively, all showing
falls on a week over which the DAX was still 3.3 per cent higher yesterday.
Meanwhile, Mannesmann lost DM12 to DM231 and Thyssen DM4.50 to DM190, both
emerging as serious underperformers on the week so far after Reuter, in
Amsterdam, reminded markets of the serious overcapacity in the European
steel industry.
PARIS was disappointed in the Bundesbank decision, which stifled a morning
rally and left the CAC-40 index down 7.04 at 1,852.74, after an intraday
high of 1,879.32. Turnover remained reasonable at FFr3bn.
Some corporate news enlivened activity with first half earnings from LVMH
coming in slightly ahead of expectations. Its shares closed up FFr35 at
FFr3,913. Chargeurs also pleased the market with good figures, particularly
from the textile division, and it closed FFr59 ahead at FFr1,199.
MADRID seemed to be undecided about the merits of a pesata devaluation, as
the general index shed 0.27 to 210.98. Turnover was high at Pta15bn.
Some analysts said that devaluation was likely to add seriously to the
inflation rate and affect the economy because of the lack of a strong export
base. There were also fears that the interest rates may have to be raised.
The Spanish component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, expressed in
D-Marks, fell 32.91 to 965.50 in the post-bourse.
Active stocks included Popular, up Pta70 at Pta9,760 and Union Fenosa, down
Pta26 or 4.9 per cent at Pta499 with some 3.2m shares traded.
AMSTERDAM found much to talk about after Elsevier revealed that it was to
merge with Reed of the UK. Some analysts were cautious about the terms and
Elsevier's shares shed Fl 11.50 or 9.8 per cent to Fl 105.20. Frans Maas,
the transport group, reported a 6 per cent increase in first half earnings,
and it closed Fl 2.50 higher at Fl 62.50.
MILAN, which soared on Monday when the lira saw a limited devaluation (and
receded on Tuesday and Wednesday), climbed again as the Bank of Italy
suspended its obligations to keep the lira inside the set limits of the ERM.
The Comit index rose 12.22 to 367.15, leaving the market little changed on
the week so far in lira terms. The hard currency investor, meanwhile, is
looking at a fall of nearly 10 per cent in the lira denominated equities
against the D-Mark over the same period.
ZURICH, the professionals' investment choice in recent days, closed higher
in heavy volume, dominated by foreign demand. Major banks and front-line
industrials were in the limelight as the SMI index rose 15.6 to 1,889.6.
A higher Swiss franc and lower interest rates helped Union Bank bearers top
the active list as it rose SFr11 to SFr770, CS Holding bearers putting on
SFr95 to SFr1,905. Nestle came second, its bearers gaining SFr11 to SFr988,
and Brown Boveri were also active as the bearers rose SFr70 to SFr3,800.
BRUSSELS enjoyed another day of advances, led by dollar-sensitive stocks.
The Bel-20 index gained 20.96 to 1,131.56. Delhaize was one of the strongest
performers, up BFr70 or 4.2 per cent at BFr1,710.
STOCKHOLM saw advances in some dollar-sensitive blue chips and forestry
shares although the general mood remained uncertain. The Affarsvarlden Index
lost 4.7 to 735.3 in turnover up to SKr505m from SKr430m.
Banks were upset by high interest rates and news on Wednesday that Gota AB
had suspended payments to creditors. S-E-Banken C shares lost SKr2.00 to
SKr11.50 and Handelsbanken B shares dropped SKr5 to SKr25.
OSLO gained on the stronger dollar as the composite index advanced 5.7 to
324.18 in turnover of NKr267.4m.
Among the day's strongest performers were Norsk Hydro, up NKr5 to NKr144 and
Saga Petroleum free shares up NKr3.50 at NKr66.50.
HELSINKI displayed one of the open wounds of the Nordic markets this year.
The HEX index rose 1.6 to 578.7 but this masked a 10.5 per cent drop in the
bank and finance index on continued gloomy prospects for the industry.

FT  18 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage and
speculative buying lifts Nikkei
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES-LINKED arbitrage buying and speculative short-term purchases lifted
share prices yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 171.82 at 18,116.52. It fell briefly to set a
day's low of 17,804.60 in the morning on light profit-taking, before
arbitrage and dealer buying took it to a high for the session of 18,204.74
in the afternoon.
Institutional investors, however, stayed on the sidelines and volume
remained low, at 270m shares against the previous day's 263m.
Declines still outnumbered rises at the close by 554 to 445, with 144 issues
unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks was 3.03 firmer
at 1,355.63. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.29 to 1,085.79.
A lack of news prompted speculative traders to focus on mining and
non-ferrous metal companies. Reports of a gold discovery in the Oita
prefecture, in southern Japan, triggered heavy buying orders. Mitsui Mining
&amp; Smelting rose by its daily limit of Y80 to Y453 and Sumitomo Metal Mining
advanced Y51 to Y782.
Banks were mixed, some investors regarding the sector as a potential
beneficiary of lower interest rates, while others were concerned about
mounting problem loans. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y10 at Y2,690 but
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y30 to Y1,620. Bank of Tokyo added Y50 at Y1,350
on overseas rumours that it would merge with Mitsubishi Bank, down Y10 at
Y2,220.
Pharmaceutical and food issues advanced on the Aids theme. Green Cross, the
most active stock of the day, moved up Y50 to Y1,720 and Meiji Milk Products
Y20 to Y1,080.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 17.90 to 19,501.41 in volume of 26.5m
shares.
The Hanshin group advanced on the recent winning streak of Hanshin Tigers,
the Osaka-based professional baseball group, Hanshin Department Store
climbing Y85 to Y725 and Hanshin Real Estate appreciating Y41 to Y600.
Roundup
TURBULENCE in European currency markets affected trading in the Pacific Rim
region yesterday, although a number of markets showed gains in late
dealings.
HONG KONG rebounded in the afternoon and the Hang Seng Index ended 4.77 up
at 5,637.90 after touching 5,543.25. Turnover rose from HKDollars 1.18bn to
HKDollars 1.94bn. HSBC fell HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53.50 on worries that
Midland Bank, of the UK, would show lower earnings because of sterling's
weakness.
TAIWAN's weighted index fell 222.83, or 6.1 per cent, to a 20-month low of
3,441.69 on news that a number of investors had failed to make TDollars
1.7bn in payments to broking houses for stock purchases.
SINGAPORE saw heavy selling of blue chips late in the day. The Straits Times
Industrial index lost 15.97 at 1,351.80 in volume of 27.8m shares. KUALA
LUMPUR's composite index rose 1.98 to 587.13 foll-owing a cut of 20 basis
points in base rate to 9 per cent.
BANGKOK was optimistic about attempts by pro-democracy parties to form a new
governing coalition and the SET index added 10.93 at 824.26. Turnover was
Bt12.5bn.
NEW ZEALAND ended higher on large volume. The NZSE-40 index gained 14.08 at
1,483.95. Turnover was 18.2m shares, worth NZDollars 39.5m.
BOMBAY fell as state-owned financial institutions sold heavily, and bulls
then followed suit. The BSE index closed 26.78 off at 3,378.18, and brokers
said Tuesday's rise in petrol and petroleum product prices hit the market.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Concerns on liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING ON the UK money markets was dominated by concerns about the massive
liquidity shortage created by the Bank of England's recent attempts to prop
up the pound, writes Emma Tucker.
Estimates of the number of pounds bought by the Bank ahead of Britain's
suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism on Wednesday ranged
between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn.
In the early morning, as traders worried about how the Bank was going to
inject such big quantities back into the system, the overnight rate shot up
to 150 per cent and one-month money traded at 18 per cent.
Tensions eased, however, after the Bank announced a temporary facility to
the banking system, to take effect today in a technical operation which
would complement its normal money market operations.
The Bank said the facilities were being made available to a group of banks,
the gilt-edged marketmakers and the five biggest building societies to
relieve the money market shortage expected today. The initial duration of
the help would be seven days and the rate of interest 10 per cent.
The money market position would be reviewed in a week's time to assess the
need to roll over the special facility, the Bank said.
'There is possibly going to be a larger than usual shortage tomorrow. We
have always reserved the right to deal direct with the banks in addition to
the discount houses if it suited us,' a spokesman for the Bank of England
said.
On the cash markets, short sterling soared as expectations of further cuts
in base rates took hold of the baskets. Short sterling futures, buoyed early
in the day by the Bank's announcement that it was cutting the minimum
lending rate to 10 per cent from 12 per cent, closed 263 basis points
higher.
The December contract finished at 91.28 compared with a close of 88.65 on
the previous day. This suggested that base rates would be 9 per cent, or
just below, by the expiry of the contract.
The fact that the three-month interbank rate ended at 10 1/4 per cent was
more a reflection of residual worries over the liquidity shortage facing the
system than anything to do with expec-tations of base rate moves.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Further tension and turbulence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE foreign exchange market remained turbulent yesterday, as sterling fell
further and tensions continued within what remains of the European exchange
rate mechanism, writes Tracy Corrigan.
However, dealers said the market was calmer than on Wednesday, as traders
tried to take stock.
Following its suspension from the ERM late on Wednesday, sterling slid in
early trading on news that the lira had also been suspended. The pound fell
to around DM2.60 - about 18 pfennings below its minimum level in the ERM,
abandoned the previous evening. But the reversal of Wednesday's two-point
rise in minimum lending rate, bringing the base rate back to 10 per cent,
helped lift sterling somewhat.
A trader commented: 'There was a feeling that, with rates lower, the UK
economy could start to improve, and that helped renew confidence in the
currency.'
The pound rallied from further weakness against the D-Mark to reach DM2.68
at one stage. However, uncertainty over the future economic policy of the
government continued to undermine sterling. A statement from the Treasury
that the pound would rejoin the ERM as soon as market conditions permitted
unsettled the currency, which fell back again to close in London at
DM2.6400, off 11 pfennigs on the day.
'The worry is that we will rejoin the ERM rather than consider another
policy, and more particularly, that we might go in at current levels,' one
trader said.
Meanwhile, the failure of the Bundesbank to lower interest rates, after some
dealers had expected a cut, boosted the D-Mark against the dollar. The
latter ended at DM1.4830, down from the previous close of DM1.5185. In New
York it finished at DM1.4755.
Elsewhere, there were continued tensions within the ERM. As the French franc
began to come under some selling pressure, Mr Michael Sapin, French finance
minister, said the French currency was holding up well in the turmoil.
He said there was nothing particularly significant about a level of FFr3.42
per D-Mark, at which the currency closed last night. But it was near enough
to its DM3.43 floor for dealers to remain nervous.
However, the pressure on the French franc could prove more short-lived. Mr
Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB, said: 'If there is a Yes vote in the
French referendum on Maastricht on Sunday, I think we will see a sharp
rebound in the franc.'
The Irish punt came under severe pressure yesterday, as the Irish central
bank and the Bundesbank both intervened. The lira was buffeted in the
currencies market, ending at L829.2 per D-Mark, against L823.6. Prior to its
suspension, the lira's floor was L820.6.

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA INTERNATIONAL, Indonesia's second largest company and dominant player
in the automotive industry, yesterday announced a 67 per cent fall in
first-half net profits.
The company recorded net profits of Rp44bn (Dollars 21.6m) compared with
Rp129.4bn a year earlier. The performance of Astra, which has a market
capitalisation of Dollars 1.2bn, deteriorated in the second quarter,
registering net profits of just Rp11.8bn. The interim net figure included a
Rp16.9bn gain on the sale of shares in its United Tractors subsidiary.
Brokers have been downgrading forecasts in recent months and said the
figures were in line with expectations. The company's vehicle sales were
down 32 per cent by volume, although it increased market share to 59 per
cent against 55 per cent.
Some brokers expressed optimism for the second half and believed sales would
be lifted by an easing of bank lending rates. One foreign broker was
forecasting net profits for the year of about Rp120bn, down from Rp210bn in
1991.
The half-year results come amid increased speculation that the Soeryadjaya
family, which owns 76 per cent of the company, is preparing to sell up to
half its stake.
The family has acknowledged it needed to raise finance to restructure its
privately-owned Summa Group. Bank Summa, the group's core company, has
suffered from losses in its property portfolio. Brokers said the family has
raised about Dollars 400m, using Astra shares as collateral, to inject into
the Summa Group.
Astra is holding an extraordinary general meeting today to confirm the
appointment of Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo as chairman, to replace Mr William
Soeryadjaya, the company's founder. Astra officials said the move was to
reassure investors that no formal link existed between the company and the
Summa Group.
Speculation over Astra's future ownership has helped depress its shares
which have underperformed the Jakarta stock exchange index by 32 per cent in
the past year and by 10 per cent in the past month.

fruit juice business

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the large Cincinnati-based consumer products company, is
pulling out of the 100% fruit juice business by discontinuing its Citrus
Hill orange juice business and selling three other fruit juice brands.
The move will halve the number of jobs in P&amp;G's US juice products business,
which stands at 2,300. P&amp;G is taking a Dollars 200m charge to cover the
costs of the move, although it stressed that some staff could probably be
absorbed into other divisions.
P&amp;G said yesterday the withdrawal was designed to 'help get our food and
beverage house in order', but it stressed again that it was 'in the food
business for the long haul'.
The relatively weak performance of P&amp;G's food division has prompted
speculation that the unit might be sold. Last year, the unit made pre-tax
profits of Dollars 126m (before an asset sale gain) on sales of Dollars
3.71bn, compared with a Dollars 2.88bn pre-tax profit on sales of Dollars
29.4bn for P&amp;G overall.
The 100% juice business has been unprofitable for P&amp;G, although the company
declined to specify the size of its losses. It explained that the decision
to discontinue Citrus Hill, but seek offers for the other brands, reflected
the likely possibility of finding buyers.
The three brands which P&amp;G plans to sell are Speas Farm apple juice, Texsun
orange/grapefruit juices, and Lincoln apple juice. Also up for disposal are
a juice processing facility and separate fruit sectioning plant, both in
Florida. Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank, is handling the
disposals.
P&amp;G said it remained committed to its juice drink brands, which include
Sunny Delight and Hawaiian Punch in the US, as well as Valensina and Punica
in Europe.
It plans to replace its Citrus Hill Plus Calcium brand with a
calcium-fortified version of its Sunny Delight juice drink product.

SHARES in Foster's Brewing, the Melbourne-based international brewing group,

The fall is in reaction to this week's announcement of large write-downs

ADollars 1.10 a share, to raise about ADollars 1bn. BHP's interest in

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer maker, yesterday said parent company
pre-tax earnings would plunge 91 per cent to Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in the half
year ending this month.
The decline is caused by the slowdown in the domestic economy and the weak
sale of electronics equipment internationally. Fujitsu expects losses in
most of its semiconductor operations.
The revised forecast confirms earlier reports that Fujitsu would suffer a
steep fall in profits. Although Fujitsu yesterday said it was still
preparing a formal forecast for consolidated earnings in the first half, it
expected to post a net loss of about Y20bn.
For the full year Fujitsu cut in half its forecast for pre-tax consolidated
profits to Y40bn. This compares with last year's pre-tax level of Y51.5bn.
Net earnings are expected to reach Y10bn, compared to Y12.2bn last year.
Consolidated sales are projected at Y3,650bn, an increase over last year's
Y3,441.9bn. On a parent company basis, pre-tax profits for the full year are
forecast at Y25bn, against Y40bn.

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of National Australia Bank (NAB), one of Australia's four top
trading banks, yesterday announced a write-down of its holding in banking
rival ANZ.
NAB plans to write down to market value its stake of just over 5 per cent in
the results for the year to September 30.
NAB's 50.6m ANZ shares are stated in its books at ADollars 5.38, (USDollars
3.95) compared with yesterday's closing price of ADollars 2.94 on Australian
stock exchanges, down 3 cents on the day. At this level, NAB's policy would
wipe more than ADollars 123m from its net profits for the year.
The write-down follows similar action by Westpac in its recent report for
the first half to March, which included a write-down to market value of its
8.3 per cent stake in ANZ.
There are no other significant stated cross-shareholdings between the
leading Australian banks. NAB directors said yesterday no tax benefit would
arise from the ANZ write-down. They said NAB had also revalued its property
assets, resulting in a ADollars 357m cut in value which would be adjusted
against reserves with no impact on operating results.
NAB shares rose 1 cent to ADollars 7.34 after the announcement yesterday,
suggesting the write-downs had been factored into the bank's share price.

Most other regional banks which have made loans to the non-banks, such as

JARDINE International Motor Holdings (JIMH), the motor trading arm of the
Jardine Matheson group of Hong Kong, yesterday announced a 156 per cent leap
in net earnings to USDollars 29.7m for the six months to June, from
USDollars 11.6m a year earlier.
The results were up from a low base, with luxury car sales hit by the Gulf
war in 1991. But profits were ahead of most expectations, because of the
strength of sales of the new Mercedes-Benz S series car in Hong Kong and
China.
JIMH said growth was strong in China. The strength of Asian sales was
partially off-set by its performance in Australia, the UK and US. Its new
Lancaster dealerships in the UK were badly affected by the recession, while
profit margins weakened further in Australia.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'The strength of the demand for
Mercedes-Benz cars in Hong Kong and China will enable the group to achieve
excellent results for the full year.' The company recommended an interim
dividend of 1.06 US cents, compared with 0.72 cents last time.

FAY, Richwhite, the New Zealand investment bank, yesterday announced a
strong rise in net profits to NZDollars 14.3m (USDollars 7.85m) for the 12
months to June 30 - a sharp improvement on the NZDollars 10.03m earned in
the previous 15 months.
The directors said the profits included a net contribution of NZDollars 2.2m
from its 26 per cent holding in BNZ, the New Zealand bank it is selling to
National Australia Bank. Fay, Richwhite also earned NZDollars 10.2m in
equity accounted earnings from BNZ, down from NZDollars 20.1m in the
previous 15 months. Fay, Richwhite's merchant banking operations contributed
NZDollars 12.1m. The directors said that over the past 12 months this side
had completed the sale of NZDollars 500m of mortgages purchased from the
Housing Corporation.
Sales and other gross operating revenues were NZDollars 105.8m compared with
NZDollars 121.94m, while taxable profits came to NZDollars 14.3m against
NZDollars 9.83m. No tax was payable. Profits after extraordinary items were
NZDollars 24.32m compared with losses of NZDollars 20.88m.
Shareholders' funds amoun-ted to NZDollars 182.49m against NZDollars 173.37m
last time. The dir-ectors are recommending a fin-al dividend of 2 cents a
share down from 10 cents. Net tangible assets per share emerged at 39 cents,
against 37 cents.
AP-DJ adds: Mr David Richwhite, joint chief executive, said: 'We look
forward to completing the sale of our BNZ shares to National Australia Bank,
which will enable us to retire all investment debt of NZDollars 281m and
direct our attention to producing an increased level of equity earnings from
merchant banking operations.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa wakes up to global
game / Examining the German airline's bid for Continental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, one of the sleeping giants of the aviation industry, has finally
decided to join in the world airline game of monopoly with a Dollars 400m
proposal to acquire Continental Airlines of the US in partnership with Mr
Marvin Davis, the Californian financier.
The move comes barely a fortnight after the German national carrier, the
world's fifth-largest in terms of revenue, unveiled a restructuring
programme to cut operating losses which are expected to rise to DM1.2bn
(Dollars 807m) this year from DM800m in 1991.
On the surface, the bid may look odd from an airline which has traditionally
shunned buying stakes in other airlines, preferring to negotiate commercial
and marketing agreements to strengthen its international network.
It is all the more surprising since Lufthansa is in the throes of scaling
back some operations, delaying delivery of new aircraft into its fleet and
planning to cut 6 000 jobs over the next two years.
But the carrier clearly felt it could no longer sit on the sidelines and
watch its main competitors on both sides of the Atlantic jostling for
position in an increasingly global airline market.
The big three US carriers - American, United and Delta - have all been
aggressively expanding their European operations. For Lufthansa, the biggest
threat has come from Atlanta-based Delta, which last year acquired the
European routes and Frankfurt hub of the now defunct Pan Am.
The German carrier has also bitterly complained that the current bilateral
aviation agreement between Germany and the US is heavily unbalanced in
favour of US carriers.
Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, has campaigned vigorously to persuade
his government to renegotiate the agreement with the US.
But the threat has not only come from the American side. BA, which Mr Weber
views as his principal European competitor, is seeking to strengthen its
position in the US market with its proposed Dollars 750m investment in USAir
while challenging Lufthansa in the German market through its Deutsche BA
German airline venture.
Dutch carrier KLM, another big Lufthansa competitor, has been strengthening
its ties with Northwest Airlines of the US. The 'open skies' agreement
reached last week between the Netherlands and the US is also expected to
give KLM an additional boost.
However, while seeking to put his house in order at home, Mr Weber has
started looking more aggressively at forging alliances and buying stakes in
other carriers to secure his group's long-term future.
This summer, Lufthansa's Condor unit took a 26.5 per cent stake in Lauda
Air, the Austrian carrier founded by Nikki Lauda, the former world motor
racing champion.
Mr Weber has also been considering a joint airline venture in Moscow which
would challenge directly BA's plans to set up an international airline with
Aeroflot called Air Russia. Lufthansa is also considering acquiring a stake
in Malev, the Hungarian airline.
Now comes the bid for Continental. Of all the US airline bankruptcies,
Continental's has probably been the most complex and, in many respects, the
most interesting. The end-game now under way looks to be no different.
When Continental filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy
Code in late 1990, it was clear that the airline comprised a mixed bag of
corporate possibilities and drawbacks.
On the plus side, Continental operated a fairly attractive network,
especially in terms of its Far Eastern route authorities. It also possessed
a low operating-cost structure - a hangover from the days when Mr Frank
Lorenzo, notorious for his union-busting strategies, ran and owned the
airline.
On the minus side, Continental was burdened by enormous debts - another
Lorenzo bequest and the proximate cause of the bankruptcy filing. These
amounted to Dollars 2.2bn of on-balance sheet borrowings, and approximately
Dollars 4bn-worth of off-balance sheet aircraft operating leases. A second
drawback was the extent to which Continental's fate was intertwined with
that of Eastern Airlines, another ailing carrier formerly run by Mr Lorenzo
which grounded its fleet in early 1991. Finally, Continental's reputation
among the public was poor.
Periodically over the next 18 months, Continental held talks with a variety
of interested suitors and investors. These ranged from Northwest Airlines to
the bankrupt Trans World Airlines and even British Airways.
However, it is only over the past six months that progress has finally
become evident. In February, Continental filed a reorganisation plan which
essentially proposed slashing long-term debt from about Dollars 5.8bn to
Dollars 1.7bn, and passing equity ownership of the reorganised company to
unsecured creditors.
With its reorganisation scheme starting to take shape, interested investors
began to supply more serious bids.
The first came in July - from an investor group headed by Charles Hurwitz, a
Texas-based businessman. This was accepted by Continental and, technically,
has preliminary approval from the bankruptcy court. However, the Hurwitz
offer was quickly followed by a proposal from Mr Alfredo Brener, whose
family owns a sizeable stake in Mexicana Airlines. Last month, Air Canada -
in conjunction with another Texan investment group - joined the party. Then,
this week, the Lufthansa/Marvin Davis proposal arrived.
All four proposals are somewhat similar in design. The investors would put
up cash in return for a majority equity stake in the carrier once it emerged
from bankruptcy, with creditors being offered a minority interest. This
would be done in conjunction with the airline's reorganisation plan. The
investors would also receive loan notes, backed by Continental assets, which
they would probably sell on to other investors. The total face value of
these packages has steadily risen from Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m.
But the story is unlikely to end here. Continental's board has a fiduciary
duty to examine all offers and pick the best. There is increasing pressure
from the bankruptcy judge, Ms Helen Balick, to move matters along, but no
date has even been set for the airline to deliver its preferred solution to
the court. In fact, technically, a new offer could be delivered up until
five days before Continental's reorganisation plan is confirmed.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Mexican bonds hope to break new
ground in US
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST Mexican bond issue in the US for a decade - and the first by any
sub-investment grade foreign borrower - was launched yesterday.
The Dollars 250m issue, led by Goldman Sachs, marks an attempt to develop a
new US investor base for Mexico, which carries a split rating of BBplus from
Standard &amp; Poor's and Ba2 from Moody's.
A roadshow has been mounted in eight US cities recently to take the issue to
insurance companies and pension funds which until now have not bought Latin
American debt.
The 10-year bonds are expected to be priced before the end of this week at a
yield over Treasuries of less than 2 1/4 per cent.
Meanwhile, Argentina still plans to return to the Eurobond market later this
month with a Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m issue, despite the failure of the
issue to emerge so far.
Central bank officials say they are negotiating details of the issue - the
country's third this year - with the manager, Credit Suisse-First Boston.
However, they expect to place the bonds at a maximum of five years, with a
spread of less than 3 per cent over the benchmark five-year US Treasury
bonds.
The Argentinian government's new foray into the bond market follows its
successful sale last year of Dollars 500m-worth of Eurobonds in two
placements handled by J P Morgan. Officials are encouraged that Argentina's
cost of borrowing is falling, reflecting the decline of inflation to below
20 per cent a year and a forecasted 8-10 per cent growth in 1992.
Proceeds from the new bond sales will be used to partially roll over
maturing bond debt. Officials deny that Argentina is increasing its Eurobond
borrowings too fast. They argue the new placement is small in comparison
with the estimated Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6bn in bonds that Argentina has
outstanding on the local and international markets. Furthermore, Argentina
is actually reducing its bond debt, by redeeming Dollars 1.5bn-worth of
bonds this year.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Minorco earnings gain 4% to
Dollars 253.4m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based investment arm of Anglo American Corporation
of South Africa, reported a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Dollars 253.4m from Dollars 243.8m for the year to June 30.
Sales jumped to Dollars 1.67bn after the consolidation for a full year of
Terra Industries and Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting, which were bought from
Inspiration. Sales were Dollars 771m last year.
The group has also acquired industrial mineral companies in the UK and east
Germany. Mr David Fisher, finance director, said the moves underlined the
group's strategy of turning an investment company into a natural resources
group.
Operating earnings increased to Dollars 63.8m from Dollars 57m as the
acquired companies more than offset the reduced contributions from the
group's gold interests. In spite of its record production levels, the group
was hit by weak gold prices.
The company has merged its 47 per cent interest in Adobe Resources
Corporation with Santa Fe Energy Resources after unsuccessfully trying to
sell the stake. Minorco's interest is now 9.75 per cent.
Earnings per share climbed to Dollars 1.22 compared with Dollars 1.14 and
the dividend was increased by 6 per cent to 54 cents a share from 51 cents
last time.

IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has formed its first pharmaceuticals joint
venture in Turkey.
The link with Abdi Ibrahim, a medium-sized pharmaceuticals concern,
initially capitalised at Pounds 500,000, will market and distribute seven
ICI products. The company will concentrate on antiseptic drugs which account
for 60 per cent of the market, which in 1991 was worth Dollars 1bn. The
operation is expected to create 400 jobs.
The move signals growing foreign interest in Turkey's pharmaceutical sector,
despite lingering concern over lack of patent protection and other issues.
Annual per capita drug consumption is just Dollars 15.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: ECGD puts sovereign debt up for
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's Export Credit Guarantee Department has put part of its Pounds 6.4bn
(Dollars 11.32bn) of sovereign debt up for sale. This is its first attempt
to sell off part of the portfolio it took on through debt reschedulings by
lesser developed countries (LDCs).
The ECGD, which refused to say how much of the portfolio it is trying to
sell, said it had written to a number of financial institutions to seek
offers for the debt.
The sale of the debt was made possible by an agreement to forgive part of
the debt of lower middle-income and very poor countries, prompted last year
by UK prime minister John Major. This agreement, known as the 'Trinidad
Terms', also allowed for a 'modest' proportion of the rescheduled debt to be
sold.
The ECGD's ability to sell off part of its sovereign debt is helped by its
provisioning policy. In recent years it has been following the Bank of
England's 'matrix', which was developed to direct provisioning by commercial
banks.
Unlike many continental credit insurers, the great majority of the ECGD's
debt has already been fully provided for, so all cash raised by the sale of
debt will trim the provisions it has to carry.
The Trinidad Terms, adopted in 1991, cover 20 of the poorest and most
heavily indebted countries, including Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, the
Philippines and Poland.
Bankers active in the LDC debt market in London confirmed they had been
contacted by the ECGD, but refused to comment on the size of the proposed
sale.
One commented that there was only a very thin market in the debt of most of
the countries covered by the Trinidad Terms, implying that the ECGD could be
offered far less than recent prices quoted in the market.

NEWS CORPORATION, Mr Rupert Murdoch's Australia-based international media

looking for new ventures, AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
In the company's annual report, Mr Murdoch says that steps taken to
consolidate the group, coupled with 'intensive management' of its
businesses, will 'continue to bring us rapidly increasing earnings'. Last
month News Corp posted an operating profit after tax of ADollars 501.7m
(USDollars 368.2m).
Mr Murdoch said the company was continuing 'to examine opportunities for
owning and operating media and entertainment ventures around the world. Most
recently we made a small investment in a Spanish television network and are
looking at other similar ventures'.
The company's risk-taking corporate culture remains unchanged, despite the
financial crunch of the past two years. Mr Murdoch said News Corp was
'institutionally committed to the proposition that fortune favours the
brave'.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: LVMH up to FFr1.29bnin spite of
downturn

<TEXT>
LVMH, the French luxury goods group which owns a string of high prestige
brand names ranging from Louis Vuitton luggage to Hennessy cognac, saw net
profits rise by 7 per cent to FFr1.29bn (Dollars 239m) from FFr1.21bn in the
first half of the year in spite of the downturn in the luxury products
industry.
The global market for luxury goods, which benefited from buoyant growth for
most of the 1980s, has slowed. It has suffered from the economic instability
of its markets, notably the US and Japan, and from changing consumer
attitudes in western Europe.
These problems have affected some of LVMH's activities, particularly wine
and spirits. The company said yesterday that the weakness of the Japanese
economy had hit sales of luggage and cognac in that country. LVMH, one of
the big players in the champagne industry, has also suffered from the
sluggish state of the champagne market in western Europe.
Overall group sales in the first six months of this year rose by 4.5 per
cent to FFr9.68bn from FFr9.26bn in the same period last year. Operating
income showed a marginal increase to FFr2.35bn from FFr2.34bn
Wines and spirits suffered a fall in sales to FFr4.44bn from FFr4.76bn while
operating profits slipped to FFr1.26bn from FFr1.51bn. LVMH, which has
refused to comment on speculation that it has extended its drinks interests
by buying a 7 per cent stake in Grand Marnier liqueur, said that cognac
sales in Japan have shown a slight recovery.
Luggage and leather products were also affected by Japan's instability, but
managed to increase operating profits to FFr890m from FFr827m on sales up to
FFr2.33bn from FFr2.15bn.
Perfumes and cosmetics benefited from the launch of new fragrances. Sales
rose to FFr2.54bn from FFr2.05bn and operating profits to FFr330m from
FFr121m.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Gloomy profits forecast by
leading Japanese brokers
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S 14 leading securities houses do not expect to make a profit for the
first half of 1992-93, prompting Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, to
urge the industry to reform itself in order to regain investor confidence.
Nomura Securities, the largest of Japan's Big Four houses, revised its
pre-tax profit estimate down from Y20bn (Dollars 160m) to zero for the six
months ending September, and said it expected an after-tax loss of Y7bn, its
first since 1954.
Weak stock prices and low turnover also bruised the country's 10 second-tier
brokerages, all of which are cutting staff.
Two other members of the Big Four, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities,
forecast no pre-tax profits, while Nikko expects an after-tax loss of Y500m,
compared with a profit of Y1.2bn last year. Yamaichi Securities expects a
pre-tax loss of Y18bn and a net loss of Y17bn, its second successive year of
losses.
Yesterday's downward revisions came in spite of confidence in April that the
worst of the turmoil in the Tokyo market was over. Brokers had forecast a
daily average trading value of Y350bn to Y400bn, but the figure until August
was around Y240bn. The industry now expects stock brokerage commissions for
the first half to be about 35 per cent lower than a year earlier.
Since emergency support measures were announced last month the market has
gained strength and brokers hope this a sign that earnings will improve in
the second half. For the full year, Nomura forecasts a pre-tax profit of
Y20bn, down from a previous estimate of Y60bn; Daiwa Y12bn (Y50bn); Nikko
Y15bn (Y47bn); and Yamaichi Y1bn (Y30bn).
The brokers plan to take advantage of the emergency measure that relaxed
regulations forcing them to disclose potentially embarrassing appraisal
losses on their securities portfolios. All the houses said they would not
announce these figures.
Mr Hata, who introduced the emergency package, said the brokers must regain
the trust of individual investors by making the market more 'transparent and
fair'. He said the industry must prevent a repeat of the scandals that
undermined investor confidence, and continue their streamlining programmes.
While the Big Four continue to struggle, most of the 10 leading second-tier
brokers face an even more difficult trading environment and are likely to
announce further staff cuts and branch closures before the year is out.
All 10 houses have forecast first-half losses, and only Kokusai Securities,
which has had particular success in bonds and derivatives, expects a full
year profit, a modest Y2.5bn before tax and Y2bn after-tax.
The largest pre-tax losses for the first half are expected at New Japan
Securities, Y19.2bn; Kankaku Securities, Y18bn; and Sanyo Securities,
Y16.4bn. Yamatane Securities, now arguing with its banks over the funding of
its restructuring, forecast a pre-tax loss of Y5.1bn, compared with a loss
of Y2.3bn last year.

<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, is in negotiations to buy fine chemicals
business of Bristol-Myers Squibb's German subsidiary. DSM did not disclose
terms or the sales figures of the businesses to be acquired.
The operations DSM plans to acquire involve the manufacture of intermediates
for antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs and diagnostic agents.
The fine chemicals facilities at Regensburg, Germany, would be incorporated
into DSM's Andeno fine chemicals division, the company said. Pharmaceuticals
production at Regensburg would remain part of Bristol-Myers Squibb.
The move is part of a trend for pharmaceuticals groups to dispose of
non-core activities. Chemicals groups have been anxious to acquire fine
chemicals and speciality activities.
DSM has recently launched a corporate strategy called DSM 2000 aimed at
focusing the group's operations.
The company announced last month it planned to sell the US operations of
Pixley Richards, its plastics moulding and assembly subsidiary.
The company is also understood to be looking for a partner for its European
fertiliser business.
It is Europe's seventh-largest nitrogen fertiliser producer, and operates
two Dutch ammonia plants with more than 1m tonnes a year capacity.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: RVI first-half losses rise to
FFr437m

<TEXT>
RENAULT Vehicules Industriels (RVI), the struggling French state-controlled
truck maker, yesterday announced far worse than expected losses, in spite of
a reduced deficit at Mack, its US subsidiary.
Pre-tax losses at RVI rose to FFr437m (Dollars 90.85m) in the first six
months of the year. This was nearly three and a half times the FFr128m loss
it made in the first half of 1991, before a FFr156m extraordinary
contribution from its acquisition of the outstanding majority stake in Mack,
for which RVI paid less than it had provided for.
RVI is unlikely to make an overall profit this year, after the small FFr23m
net surplus it reported in 1991, warned Mr Marc Randon, group
secretary-general.
He attributed the setback to a decline in European sales, down 13 per cent
against the first half of last year and 32 per cent below the levels
achieved in the first six months of 1990. Those figures exclude Germany,
where three quarters of the market is controlled by the national truck
industry.
RVI group sales fell by 3.4 per cent to FFr13.36bn from the FFr13.83bn
reported in the first half of 1991, on which operating losses rose to
FFr301m from FFr106m.
Over the same period, restructuring costs climbed to FFr136m from FFr22m,
because of the 1,000 French job losses announced last April.
RVI warned that more cost cuts would be needed, although it planned to hold
the research and development budget at current levels and to invest in
enlarging its sales networks, especially in northern Europe.
RVI's European branch saw a plunge in operating profits to FFr151m from
FFr484m, while Mack reduced its operating losses to FFr83m from FFr102m.
The US truck market was showing signs of recovery, but intense price
competition was affecting the profits of all producers there. Mr Randon said
the objective was to return the US subsidiary to break-even by 1994.
RVI is 55 per cent owned by Renault, with the remaining 45 per cent held by
AB Volvo, parent company of the Swedish automotive group.

reported first-half net profits up 6 per cent from the year earlier period,
to Fl 118.5m (Dollars 70.86m) from Fl 117.5m in the corresponding period
last year, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
The company said profit was bolstered by higher sales and better operating
margins in its network services and logistics services areas. Sales grew 6
per cent to Fl 675.3m from Fl 634.6m, in spite of weaker turnover in its
freight and transport services division.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: German acquisition lifts
Saint-Gobain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SAINT-GOBAIN, the French glass and materials group, saw its net profits rise
by 9.8 per cent to FFr1.35bn (Dollars 210.18m) in the first half of the year
compared with FFr1.22bn in the same period last year.
The group benefited from the acquisition of Oberland, the German glass
maker, last year.
Oberland's contribution helped to offset the sluggish state of the
international building materials market, which has been hit by the slowdown
in the construction industries in North America and western Europe.
Turnover rose by 3.6 per cent in the interim period to FFr38.77bn from
FFr37.41bn and operating profits increased to FFr3.69bn from FFr3.58bn.
Income from industrial investments fell to FFr2.14bn from FFr2.27bn, while
income from financial investments fell to FFr1.09bn from FFr1.34bn.
The glass treatment divisions showed growth during the first half, although
Saint-Gobain's construction materials interests suffered from slowdowns in
North America and Brazil.
The group's paper and reinforced fibre businesses were hit by a fall in
prices. Ceramics were affected by the problems of the capital goods sector.
The group had hoped to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio from 56 per cent last
year to about 40 per cent by the end of this year.
However Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman, warned earlier this year that it
would be unable to achieve its target.
The debt/equity ratio fell to 55 per cent, on net debt of FFr20.3bn, at the
end of the interim period, from 62 per cent on FFr21.9bn, at the same point
in 1991.
Clarins, the French skincare products manufacturer, yesterday announced a 20
per cent increase in net profits to FFr130m from FFr108.2m in the first half
of the year.
Clarins said that it still hoped to achieve its aim of 15 per cent growth
for the year, in spite of the difficult state of the international
marketplace.

FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: French banks' profits flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLUGGISH state of the French banking sector was yesterday highlighted by
flat first-half profits from two banks, Credit du Nord and Banque Francaise
de Commerce Exterieur, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Credit du Nord, the retail banking arm of the Paribas financial group, broke
even in the first six months of 1992 with a fall in net profits to FFr1.8m
(Dollars 330,000) from FFr103.3m in the same period of the previous year.
Net banking income rose by 10.7 per cent to FFr3bn and gross profits
increased by 14.5 per cent to FFr1bn. However, an increase in provisions
from FFr590m to FFr804m ensured that net profits fell.
Credit du Nord said it was on course for an increase in profits for the full
financial year unless the economic environment deteriorated.
Nord-Est, an industrial holding company also owned by Paribas, returned to
the black in the first half with a net profit of FFr568m, compared with a
loss of FFr25m in the first six months of 1991.
Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur held net profits at FFr103m during
the first half and said that it anticipated an increase in profits for the
full financial year.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, said that its long-awaited new audio
product, the digital compact cassette (DCC), will be launched in Japan next
week and in four European countries in the second half of next month.
The company had originally planned a worldwide launch for this month, but
was forced to postpone due to what it described as minor problems in pilot
production of the new DCC player.
Philips said US sales of DCC will start in the first week of November. It
confirmed earlier statements that the initial European launch in the second
half of October will focus on Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The DCC player that is to go on sale in Japan on Monday will cost the
equivalent of Dollars 799. This suggested retail price will also be adopted
in the US and Europe.
Philips, which is counting on the product to help revive its flagging
consumer electronics business, will face head-on competition from a rival
product, the Minidisc, which has been developed by Sony of Japan and which
is scheduled to reach shops in key international markets in November.
The DCC, unlike an earlier Philips invention, the compact disc (CD), is
recordable. The company said yesterday that a 90-minute blank tape will cost
Dollars 9.99.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Simon finds 'green' profits elusive in a
recession - The engineering group's decision last month to axe its
environmental arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR YEARS after first touting itself as an environmental stock, a label
which lifted its shares to a 40 per cent premium to its sector at one stage,
Simon Engineering has decided the grass perhaps is greener elsewhere.
Last month the company announced it was putting its main environmental
businesses up for sale. These include Simon's waste water treatment
business, which makes sewage and industrial effluent treatment equipment,
with annual sales of Pounds 65m, and its environmental consultancy business,
with sales of Pounds 35m.
Several international groups, believed to include SAUR of France and Waste
Management of the US, have shown interest. Simon hopes Barings, its
advisers, can finalise the disposal before preliminary results are announced
in March.
The money raised, perhaps as much as Pounds 50m, will be invested in its
three remaining core businesses of access equipment, industrial services and
process engineering.
The announcement, which accompanied news that pre-tax profits fell from
Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 6.05m in the six months to June 30, led to a further
fall in Simon's shares. They stood last night at 138p, only a few pence
above a 12-year low set on Wednesday, and down from a peak of 410p in July
1990. The City felt it had been misled and that Simon's decision to go
'ex-green' suggested it was unsure of its own direction.
One analyst, who did not want to be named, said Simon had become a
'corporate magpie'.
'They seem to pick things up, get bored with them, then fly on to something
else. It's a valid question to ask if they really know what they are doing,'
he said.
Institutional shareholders, who include Confederation Life, the Prudential
and BAT, were more understanding and said the City was partly to blame. 'The
City helped make this into a green stock and pushed it to ludicrous levels.
It is partly their fault the company is not what they thought it was,' one
large shareholder said.
Simon's own view of the disposal lies in its recent history. Under the
management since 1988 of Mr Roy Roberts, former chairman of Dowty, and Mr
Brian Kemp, chief executive since 1989, Simon has been restructured from a
sleepy industrial holding company.
Business areas were cut from 16 to four and exports became a priority. In
1990 the company raised Pounds 46m through a rights issue. The money was
used on acquisitions and expansion of the four core businesses.
Simon Access, which makes powered access equipment such as truck-mounted
platforms, made acquisitions in the US and Europe. Industrial services was
expanded with last year's takeover of Robertson, a geological consultant.
About Pounds 25m was spent developing the environmental division, through
smaller takeovers such as Hydro-Search.
Mr Kemp said the four-pronged strategy had been scuppered by recession. 'We
said at the rights issue we could afford to maintain those four on the back
of our increasing earnings. But since then our earnings have halved and the
whole economic background is a good deal more pessimistic,' he said.
The axe fell on the environmental arm because customer spending and new
environmental legislation did not come as quickly as Simon expected. Mr Kemp
said UK water companies had invested in large scale infrastructure projects,
but spending on sewage treatment equipment was 20 per cent below
expectations.
'We have seen in the last 18 months that greenness is not always associated
with profitability and results have been poor,' he said.
There is sympathy for this view among analysts, who suspect Simon also
realised the environmental market would only become more competitive as
larger foreign companies moved in, forcing margins down.
Mr Kemp agrees Simon was neither big enough nor a niche business. 'We would
have had to spend a lot of money getting there. But you cannot, in this
climate, proceed on all four fronts at the same time. There are questions of
management and financial resources,' he said.
The City will probably come round to Simon's reasoning. But it will take
longer for the company's shares to be rehabilitated.
Stripped of its green tinge, Simon has lost the unifying rationale behind
its other divisions. For example, industrial services and process
engineering are stand alone businesses yet have an environmental angle which
binds them together. Once the binding is removed, Simon is in danger of
again being seen as an eclectic industrial holding company.
The disposal also raises the question of what else may eventually be sold.
Mr Kemp says no further disposals are pending but no division is 'sacred'.
'If you look five years ahead the group's focus will reduce even more. We
have to get bigger in fewer businesses to compete internationally,' he said.
Simon's second problem, which is more serious, is its financial position.
Recession in the construction and paper industries, which hit Simon's access
and process engineering divisions respectively, has meant group earnings per
share fell from 34.5p in 1989 to 12.5p last year. Borrowings, mainly to fund
acquisitions, have risen to Pounds 51m and interest cover has fallen from 17
times to 4.1 times. Last year Simon had to dig into reserves to pay an
uncovered dividend.
Its shares are yielding more than 12 per cent, implying the market now
expects a dividend cut. According to Mr Kemp, this year's dividend could
still be covered if some of the process engineering division's more than
Pounds 1bn of outstanding quotations are translated into firm orders, and if
a 20 per cent year on year order improvement for access equipment is
sustained.
Selling the environmental division would also give Simon the option of
repaying nearly all borrowings, and bringing down gearing, now at 40 per
cent.
'If we dispose of the division for about Pounds 50m all our financial ratios
would improve, including our ability to maintain the dividend,' said Mr
Kemp.

The Oliver Group, footwear retailer, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds
5.2m to Pounds 4.87m in the half year to June 30.
Turnover rose marginally to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 36.8m), but margins were

discounting.
Losses per share increased to 19.28p (18.08p) and there is no interim

A strong performance from its US operations helped Bemrose Corporation, the
printing group, report a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 1.85m, for the half year to June 27.
Sales rose to Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 21.5m).
The group's core business of security printing in the UK continued to
perform strongly on the back of term contracts.
Three of the group's main cheque contracts have been renewed for three to
five years, although it expects to lose orders as the banks take more work
in house.
Renaissance Publishing consolidated production from three to two factories
and installed a new Harris Web press at a cost of almost Dollars 3m (Pounds
1.68m).
Earnings per share rose to 7.14p (6.49p). The interim dividend is unchanged
at 4.3p.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Charles Baynes falls to Pounds 1.88m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLES BAYNES, the spec-ialist engineering and packaging distribution
company, suffered the expected downturn in profitability in the first half
of 1992, reporting a fall from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 1.88m pre-tax.
However, the directors said they had enough confidence in the longer term
outlook and the group's cash position to lift the interim dividend by 5 per
cent to 0.525p (0.5p). Earnings per share declined to 1.05p (1.8p).
The cash position was further enhanced to Pounds 12m after the period-end by
the sale of the building components division to Williams Holdings, the
industrial conglomerate, for Pounds 8.6m cash.
Turnover in this division, affected by the 'dire straits' of the
construction sector, had fallen 17 per cent in the half, though there was a
small profit, the company said.
Group turnover improved from Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 37.2m but the company
said a direct comparison was not meaningful. It pointed to the acquisitions
of Fist Fast and Truflo for Pounds 10.6m in April 1991, the closing of
Stoneguard in 1991 and the acquisition of Frank Ford, the aircraft
components business for Pounds 1.1m in January. The company said that on a
comparable basis turnover fell 10 per cent from 1991 levels.
Aerospace, the largest part of the group, saw sales fall 26 per cent due to
difficulties from re-scheduling orders, while sales of technical products
fell 17 per cent, leavened only by the Belgian valve business. Packaging was
the bright spot with a 9 per cent increase, though demand was flat.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Electronic market problems behind setback
at Canning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS AT W Canning, the Birmingham-based speciality chemicals manufacturer
and electronics distributor, declined slightly during the first half of 1992
as it faced continuing problems selling components in continental Europe.
The pre-tax line amounted to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 3.05m). Total sales of
Pounds 59.1m were down on last time's first half figure of Pounds 61.7m but
higher than the Pounds 55.4m recorded in the 1991 second half.
The sales pattern reflected the group's changing shape. Its drive into niche
chemical markets produced growth while commodity price reductions helped to
protect margins. However, sales declined in the electronic component markets
of Germany, France, Italy and Spain and provoked a decision to change the
focus of the business from generalised to specialised distribution.
Chemicals' operating profits were Pounds 3.9m against Pounds 700,000 for
electronics. In the 1990 second half the two divisions made a roughly equal
contribution to operating profits.
Electronic market problems led Canning to close its Semitronic subsidiary in
Spain, a withdrawal from the market which takes Pounds 2m off shareholders'
funds. This has been partially offset by the sale for Pounds 1.35m of a 90
per cent shareholding in LJ Specialities, a chemical company. Gearing by the
year end should be down from 58 per cent to 50 per cent.
Although Mr David Probert, chairman, expects continued growth on the
chemical side and a return to prosperity in electronics by the end of 1993,
he noted that 'there is considerable uncertainty in many of the group's
markets with no discernible sign of a general improvement in demand.'
This uncertainty has been compounded by the events surrounding the parity of
sterling. 'Forecasting is more difficult than I have ever known it,' he
said.
Nevertheless, the group had enough confidence to maintain the interim
dividend at 2.94p, based on earnings per share of 5.9p (6.2p).

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: John Lewis down 15% as recession continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES AT the John Lewis Partnership's department store chain have been
'encouraging' since the beginning of August adding to the accumulating
evidence that retail sales have strengthened over the past few weeks.
However, the employee-owned retail group, which runs 22 department stores
and 99 Waitrose supermarkets, yesterday reported a 15 per cent fall to
Pounds 20.2m in interim pre-tax profits, reflecting the effects of recession
and Sunday trading by rivals and increased interest costs.
Announcing his last set of results before retiring as chairman, Mr Peter
Lewis took the opportunity to condemn the government's continued failure to
intervene to prevent unlawful Sunday trading.
'It must be the first sales tax ever exacted for keeping the law and handed
over for the benefit of the delinquents,' he said.
In the half year to July 25, JLP's sales were 2 per cent ahead at Pounds
1.09bn. However, department store sales declined a shade to Pounds 501.2m -
'a result the like of which I do not think I can recall,' said Mr Lewis.
Waitrose came under pressure from competitor openings but pushed sales up 4
per cent to Pounds 573.9m. The company said there had been some sharp falls
in some food prices which had lowered cash takings.
The wholesaling and manufacturing businesses recorded a more encouraging
performance with a 13 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 19.7m.
Trading profits fell 5 per cent to Pounds 38m, but were further eroded by a
higher interest charge of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 10.8m). Costs were reasonably
controlled but continued to rise faster than sales.
Mr Lewis said he did not think it was likely that there would be a general
economic boost before the end of the year, but thought there was room for
profits improvement through the individual efforts of JLP's employees.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: APV declines 17% to Pounds 12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APV, the food manufacturing equipment maker, blamed the lack of even a
modest economic recovery for a 17 per cent fall in profits for the first
half of 1992.
The return on sales margin slipped from 5.1 to 3.8 per cent.
The pre-tax decline to Pounds 12m (Pounds 14.5m) was struck on turnover up 8
per cent at Pounds 437m (Pounds 402.9m).
A fall in other operating income to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 4.3m) contributed to
the near-20 per cent slide to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 20.5m) in operating
profits.
APV said that demand had fallen in its dry food side, with sales down 10 per
cent at Pounds 127.8m and profits tumbling to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 5.6m).
Mr Clive Strowger, who became chief executive in July after the early
retirement of Mr Fred Smith at the end of 1991, said that the French bakery
operations had suffered particularly from a lack of orders and a downturn in
profit.
Also the 'adverse' economic climate led to 'traditional customers deferring
capital investment programmes'.
With competition growing, net margins shrank from 3.9 to 1.1 per cent in the
division.
However, Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, asserted: 'APV will undertake no
meaningful work at less than cost.'
By contrast, the liquid food division, fuelled by growth in continental
Europe and Asia, lifted profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.3m on
turnover up almost 20 per cent at Pounds 247.3m (Pounds 206.9m). Margins
slipped from 5.1 to 4.6 per cent - the company said there was a 'shortfall
in high margin orders'.
In the 'hotch-potch' group of companies, of which Vent-Axia, the UK
ventilation fan maker, is 'the largest and the best', according to Mr
Strowger, profits eased to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 4.4m) on turnover ahead at
Pounds 61.9m (Pounds 54m).
Earnings per share emerged at 2.8p (3.3p) net and 3.5p (3.7p) on a nil
distribution basis.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 2p.
COMMENT
Leaderless for the first half, APV now has Mr Strowger at the helm, and it
needs him to sort out the margins problem. Mr Smith tended to acquire
companies and then let them get on with running themselves. It is to be
hoped that the new chief executive will identify the over-complexity of the
group as a fundamental problem - it has 40 companies with 130 operations.
Stronger central controls are needed to take strategic planning, product
development and marketing by the scruff of the neck and Mr Strowger has his
work cut out. The dull results will remain so, though the 'disappointing'
order intake since June is a worry for a company with high operational
margins. Forecast full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 30m give a
multiple between 12 and 13. There is no great pressure on the dividend,
though things will drift until Mr Strowger has made his presence felt.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Store's slow start hits Bentalls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A slow start to the newly acquired store at the Lakeside shopping centre in
Thurrock, Essex, accounted for just under half of the Pounds 1.05m pre-tax
losses reported by Bentalls, the department store operator, for the half
year to August 1.
The deficit compared with a Pounds 207,000 profit last time.
Mr Edward Bentall, chairman, said that with consumers still reluctant to
spend, directors had been reviewing operations to identify how further cost
savings could be made. The head office was to be relocated, while the
situation at Lakeside was being assessed.
He said trading in August had shown a considerable improvement over last
year, while further sales gains were expected when the Bentall Centre opened
in November.
Agreement had been reached to sell the Bentalls charge card business to GE
Capital. The move would reduce borrowings by more than Pounds 6m.
Turnover edged ahead by Pounds 1m to Pounds 31.5m. Losses per share were
1.63p (0.32p earnings), but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.6p.

provisions

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDER Proudfoot, the US-based but UK-quoted management consultant, made
a Pounds 6m provision against liabilities, interest and penalties on unpaid
overseas taxes in its interim results.
The group, which suffered a sharp decline in its share price over the last
few months following uncertainty over its trading outlook, declared pre-tax
profits halved to Pounds 12m in the six months to June 30.
Turnover was up 7 per cent to Pounds 95m (Pounds 88.5m). Excluding the
acquisition of Indevo Consulting of Sweden in September last year turnover
fell 3 per cent.
Basic earnings per share were 11.25p (24.24p) or 10.94p (22.7p) fully
diluted. The interim dividend is held at 6p and the company said the final
dividend would also be maintained at 6p.
Directors disclosed that there had been reorganisation costs during the
period of Pounds 1.3m principally related to the Crosby and Indevo
businesses, and Pounds 1.5m on product development.
Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, said that an internal review recently
discovered that the company may not have paid sufficient taxes on middle
managers employees in one country in which it operates over about five
years. The board made a provision to cover all additional charges which may
be incurred.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Davis Service rise to
Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVIS SERVICE Group, which has now all but severed its links with
motor-related activities, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds
8.03m in the six months to June 30.
In July 1991 it sold three of its four motor dealerships for Pounds 6.69m to
a management buy-out and in early April this year disposed of its Godfrey
Davis (Contract Hire) business to NWS Bank, a subsidiary of the Bank of
Scotland, for Pounds 5.75m.
Pre-tax profits of the continuing businesses grew to Pounds 8.22m (Pounds
6.65m).
Mr George Boyle, finance director, said that contract hire carried a large
amount of 'back-to-back' borrowings. As a result of the sale, borrowings
were sharply cut to Pounds 8.3m at the end of June. At the beginning of the
half year they had stood at Pounds 77.8m. The only outstanding motor-related
activity is the dealership in St Albans.
Interest payable for the contract hire side totalled Pounds 2.75m in the
half, leaving group interest charges at Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 5.83m). This in
turn offset the fall in overall operating profits to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds
12.9m), though for continuing businesses there was a rise to Pounds 8.22m
(Pounds 7.68m).
Group turnover fell to Pounds 124.7m (Pounds 155m), but for continuing
activities, it rose almost 6 per cent to Pounds 112.2m.
By division, the textile maintenance side, which accounts for about 55 per
cent of the group, was hit by the effects of the recession on the hotel
industry in the Sunlight Textile Services segment, and by employers
controlling costs in Sunlight Workwear Services.
In site services - about 22 per cent of the group - improved demand from
local authorities for temporary classrooms offset falls in the construction
sector, which accounts for 40 per cent of the division.
Government policies of compulsory tendering and 'contracting out' helped
ensure a good performance in support services, which provides cleaning and
maintenance staff.
Earnings grew to 6.39p (5.61p) per share and the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.73p.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laporte falls 12% in difficult trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAPORTE, the UK's second largest independent chemical group, yesterday
posted pre-tax profits for the six months to July 3 down 12 per cent from
Pounds 50.3m to Pounds 44.5m.
Earnings per share fell 6 per cent from 20.1p to 18.8p. The interim dividend
is increased from 6.8p to 7p.
The result was achieved on sales up from Pounds 302.6m to Pounds 321.3m, in
spite of difficult trading conditions. The company said that in spite of the
continued recession, it believed prospects for growth of the business
remained good.
The smaller reduction in earnings per share was achieved by a lower tax rate
and the reduced equity base following the restructuring of Interox, the
50-50 joint-venture with Solvay of Belgium. Solvay acquired Interox's bulk
hydrogen peroxide and persalts businesses in May, and cancelled two thirds
of its 25 per cent stake in Laporte.
Group turnover included Pounds 74m from Interox up to that date. Interox's
profits up to May 21 were Pounds 9.6m, down from Pounds 16.4m for the first
six months last year. Laporte has retained the organic peroxides and
persulphates specialities business which it said had put in a similar
performance to last year at Pounds 5.8m.
Three of Laporte's five divisions, organic speciality chemicals,
construction chemicals, and hygiene and process chemicals, increased
profits. The metals and electronic chemicals division maintained its
operating profits. However, the absorbents division's results fell, mainly
because of rationalisation of the continental businesses and weak
performances in South America and south-east Asia.
The company continued its investment programme, with Pounds 29m being spent
on capital plant in the absorbents division. About Pounds 41m was spent on
acquisitions which included Rockwood, an American building pigments company
acquired in April.
The company said capital expenditure and acquisitions were likely to be
lower in the second half. Group debt at the period end was Pounds 70m for
gearing of 30 per cent.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US buy helps Wassall to Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASSALL, the mini-conglom-erate run by former Hanson executives, doubled
pre-tax profits in the six months ended June 30 on the back of its recent
acquisition of DAP, a US supplier of construction products and filling
compounds.
Profits increased to Pounds 6.24m (Pounds 3.12m) on increased sales of
Pounds 117m (Pounds 63.8m).
The consumer division, which includes DAP and Antler, the UK luggage
manufacturer, increased operating profit to Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 340,000).
DAP generated Pounds 2.8m of this.
The US business is undergoing a rationalisation programme which has meant
the closure of a number of plants and a reduction in its product range.
When Wassall bought DAP last year half of its sales were generated by 18
products, while the other half was generated by 700 products.
Wassall has earmarked Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.2m) of capital expenditure over
the next two years to replace old machinery, open a new warehouse and expand
DAP's DIY sheds which is the fastest growing part of the US DIY market.
By the year end margins are expected to have risen by almost 3 percentage
points to 7 per cent.
The closures businesses, which includes bottle top companies in the UK,
Italy and South Africa, increased operating profits from Pounds 3.49m to
Pounds 3.82m.
The industrial and commercial side arrested last year's fall in profits with
a strong performance from Gilchrist pre-press services which offset a
disappointing result from office furniture. Operating profits rose to Pounds
195,000 (Pounds 156,000).
Borrowings increased to Pounds 28m (Pounds 24m) representing gearing of 45
per cent. However, debt is expected to fall to Pounds 20m by the year end.
Earnings per share improved to 3.46p (3.13p adjusted) and the interim
dividend is increased to 0.8p (0.67p adjusted).
COMMENT
Wassall is one of the few companies content to be labelled a conglomerate.
The C word may have become unfashionable in the nineties but Mr Christopher
Miller, chairman, believes there are almost as many undervalued
manufacturing companies for sale now as there were in the eighties.
Wassall's doubling of profits on the back of its acquisition of DAP
underlines his argument. Mr Miller would admit that there is an element of
luck. About 70 per cent of sales are generated overseas, which is an added
bonus during a sterling crisis. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds
17.5m, giving earnings per share of 9.9p, the shares - up 14p to close at
172p - are on a prospective multiple of 17.2. It may look expensive but for
the moment its 35 per cent premium to the market is justified.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Halifax defies gloom with 4% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX, the largest UK building society, yesterday defied the gloom in the
housing market by announcing a 4 per cent increase in its pre-tax profits to
Pounds 318m for the half year to July 31.
Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, described the results as good figures in a bad
market. 'They confirm the underlying financial strength of the Halifax,' he
said.
However, Mr Foulds gave a warning about profits in the remainder of the
year. 'It is unrealistic to look for an improved second half year, and after
yesterday's events we remain even more concerned about the continued
depressed state of the housing market.'
He called on the government to take measures to improve the housing market,
otherwise any recovery would be deferred.
In spite of Mr Foulds's warning, Halifax's profits growth in the first half
contrasted impressively with the 10 per cent fall in interim profits of
Abbey National, the second largest UK mortgage lender.
Total assets of the society rose by 9 per cent on a year ago to Pounds 61bn.
The bad debt charge for the period was up nearly 10 per cent to Pounds 135m.
Total income grew 6 per cent to Pounds 791m, and interest income was up 3
per cent at Pounds 611m.
Despite the lack of demand in the market, Halifax's mortgage book grew to
Pounds 51.1bn, up from Pounds 46.5bn a year earlier and Pounds 49m at the
end of January, and its share of the mortgage market has risen to 19 per
cent, against 10 per cent a year ago.
The increase appears to reflect a partial withdrawal from the market by
smaller lenders.
Halifax refuses to give any details of its problems with mortgage arrears
and repossessions, beyond saying that evictions were down by 40 per cent in
the half year because of its policy of showing greater forebearance to
customers in serious difficulty.
Mr David Gilchrist, general manager, said very few customers indeed had been
saved through the 'rent-into-mortgage' schemes advocated by the government
last December.
Savings deposits held by Halifax in the half year were Pounds 48.7bn (Pounds
45.3bn), but the bulk of the increase came from capitalised interest.
Halifax's 500-branch estate agency chain reduced its loss from Pounds 6.6m
to Pounds 4.4m.

   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dowding &amp; Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair group, blamed the
recession for a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.53m for the
year to June 30.
Mr Jim Cole, chief executive, said yesterday he was 'disappointed' that this
was the second year the recession had seriously affected trading and
profitability. Turnover slipped by 6.2 per cent to Pounds 74.7m (Pounds
79.6m) and operating profits fell to Pounds 7.31m (Pounds 9.01m), but gross
margins were maintained.
After allowing for tax and an extraordinary Pounds 633,000 charge related to
the cost of the group's failed bid for Torday &amp; Carlisle, attributable
profits fell to Pounds 3.55m (Pounds 5.46m). Dowding and Mills retains an
8.7 per cent stake in Torday.
Earnings per share slipped to 3.12p (4.09p) but the proposed final dividend
is increased to 1.58p (1.52p) for a total of 2.5p (2.4p).
Mr Peter Hollings, chairman, said business remained tough 'and there is no
sign yet of any improvement or when it will occur'.

<TEXT>
BZW Investment Management, the fund management arm of Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, yesterday took the unusual step of offering to buy out the management
contract for an investment trust in which it is a shareholder because it is
concerned about the existing managers.
BZWIM aid it had made 'a substantial cash offer' to buy out the mangement
contract of Temple Bar Investment Trust, which is currently managed by
Guinness Mahon. 'On behalf of its clients, BZWIM has been a long-term
shareholder in Temple Bar Investment Trust and has become concerned with the
recent changes in the management of the company.'
Several weeks ago, BZWIM approached Sir Roland Smith, Temple Bar's chairman,
and asked to acquire the management contract. BZWIM was rebuffed, although
the full board will meet shortly to consider the proposal.
Under the proposal, BZWIM would pay a sum, believed to be equal to one
year's management fees, to the board of Temple Bar in exchange for the
contract. The trust, with roughly a 14 per cent exposure to property, would
then be managed using BZWIM's traditional and quantitative management
techniques.

FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation moves help put L&amp;G Pounds
74m back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the life assurance group, reported a turnround to pre-tax
profits of Pounds 74m in the first half to June 30, from a Pounds 56.1m
previous loss.
The shares added 24p to 323p.
There was some disappointment that the group failed to increase its interim
dividend. The unchanged figure of 6.2p was paid from earnings per share of
11.58p (11.8p loss).
Two exceptional factors buoyed the profits. The UK investment business was
transferred to the life fund, producing an exceptional profit of Pounds
31.5m. Also, the restructuring of the US subsidiary's investment portfolio,
meant that investment gains of Pounds 12.1m were realised, up from Pounds
2.4m.
The general insurance business cut its operating losses from Pounds 116m to
Pounds 33m. Lower subsidence claims and the absence of severe weather
conditions were the main factors.
Interest centred on the mortgage guarantee insurance business, which has
depressed the group's performance and share price for the last two years.
The loss on this business was reduced to Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 88.9m).
However, provisions against losses were raised to Pounds 185m (Pounds 158m).
Mr David Prosser, chief executive, urged further base rate cuts.
COMMENT
It is easy to see why Legal &amp; General wants base rates back down to 8 per
cent in the hope of triggering a recovery in the housing market. Its shares
are trading off a historic yield of about 8 per cent, suggesting that the
market is treating it as a composite insurer, rather than a life company.
Its exposure to mortgage indemnity insurance is the culprit. Analysts are
happy that L&amp;G's policy on reserves for losses on the business has been much
more conservative than some of its rivals. Its loss rate has also been lower
than others. But re-rating is unlikely until the housing market stages an
unambiguous recovery. On the positive side, L&amp;G has halted the slide in its
market share for general life products - once the significant market for
with-profits bonds is excluded - and streamlined its distribution channels.
Nonetheless, forecasts for its full-year profits range widely, suggesting
the stock should be treated cautiously until prospects for recovery are
clearer.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Rome draws up austerity budget to tackle deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday announced cost-cutting and revenue-raising
measures totalling L93,000bn (Pounds 41.2bn) in a 1993 budget package
designed to tackle the country's budget deficit.
However, the scale of the savings disappointed some economists, who had been
calling for measures worth up to L120,000bn to cut the deficit and counter
the impact of higher interest rates and inflation.
The package envisages L43,000bn in spending cuts and L42,000bn in
revenue-raising measures, mainly from new taxes and charges. A further
L7,000bn is expected in privatisation proceeds. The government plans to
freeze spending next year at 1992 levels.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, stressed that the credibility of the
government and the lira were linked to his budget plans. 'We must restore to
Italians our own self-confidence and, for those watching from abroad,
confidence in our country and currency,' he said.
The bulk of the savings will come from cuts in Italy's generous state
pensions system.
Under the latest scheme, the pensionable ages will be raised. Further
savings will come by freezing a 1.8 per cent pensions rise due in November,
and next year's increase in pensions will be linked to the rise in the cost
of living, rather than to salary levels which are normally higher.
Meanwhile, salaries for the 3m public sector employees due to renegotiate
their contracts next year, except for schoolteachers, will be frozen at this
year's levels. There will also be a freeze on public sector hiring.
In an attempt to win the support of union leaders, the government put
forward measures to curb tax evasion and show the burden was being spread
fairly.
Tax-dodging, rife among the self-employed, will be countered by introducing
a form of 'minimum tax' to prevent the self-employed from declaring an
income lower than their employees.
Free medicines and a variety of other public health benefits will be
abolished for those earning over L40m a year, while extra charges are to be
imposed on large cars, boats and aircraft.
Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, said the measures, for the first time,
were focused on cutting spending rather than on raising income.
Details of the package prompted some recovery in the lira, the value of
which had declined against that of the D-Mark yesterday. On the stock
market, prices made up part of the ground lost on Wednesday.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Unemployment rises to 2.8m: Increase of 47,400 takes jobless
figures to five-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government released more gloomy economic news yesterday when it
announced that Britain's unemployment total rose last month to a five-year
high of 2.8m.
The increase in the month - at more than 47,000 - was much higher than
expected.
The seasonally adjusted increase was the 28th consecutive monthly rise and
the largest in one month since January.
Other official figures disappointed hopes of recovery in UK industry.
Manufacturing output was flat in July month on month and showed no growth in
the three months to the end of July.
Commenting on the unemployment figures, Employment Department officials
yesterday stressed that firmer evidence was needed before a worsening trend
could be confirmed. They said August could be a quirky month, partly because
this year it incorporated five weeks and because of the effect of graduates
claiming benefit.
Analysts believe the rise may partly be a result of the general election. Mr
James Barty, of Morgan Grenfell, said some companies had waited to see the
effect of the result on the economy and were now putting into effect
previous plans for job cuts.
Another set of Employment Department statistics showed that the jobless
figure is much higher when calculated by international standards. The new
quarterly Labour Force Survey found that the number of people looking for
work in the spring averaged 2.65m, against the 2.61m benefit claimants
counted in the monthly total for May.
Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said the government was reviewing
the range of measures available to those without work.
Ms Joyce Quin, shadow employment minister, said the figures showed 'yet more
evidence of the government's appalling economic mismanagement. We have the
fastest rising unemployment in Europe. It is no use blaming the Germans or
the French referendum for that.'
The new total of 2,807,500 represents 9.9 per cent of the workforce and is
the highest since June 1987. Unadjusted unemployment jumped by 71,541 to
2,845,508 in August, 10.1 per cent of the workforce. Unemployment rose in
every region, with the largest increase again recorded in the south-east.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness, as they say, is good for you. But not quite as good as before
yesterday's interim figures. A rise of only 1 per cent in pre-tax profits
suggests the market was right in worrying about whether Guinness could
continue to outperform. There can be no definitive answer till after the
recession. Some of Guinness' problems are clearly a reflection of the cycle.
In Japan, for example, sliding demand for premium spirits has been
compounded by de-stocking in the distribution chain. The first half saw a
higher interest charge. That should be offset in the second half by profits
from recent acquisitions which are skewed towards the end of the year.
Still, the easy growth in spirits is probably over, and margins are
virtually flat at 31 per cent. The US reorganisation following the Glenmore
acquisition will take time to bear fruit. Similarly, though margins are
growing in beer, the work of absorbing Union Cervecera is not complete and
demand in the Spanish market remains weak. Given the company's own caution,
it is hard to see why it should trade on a signficantly higher multiple than
Grand Metropolitan or Allied-Lyons, though it has scope to continue raising
dividends faster than earnings.

FT  18 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: RMC Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone tempted to get carried away by the link between financial markets and
the real economy should listen carefully to RMC. Sterling's devaluation will
obviously boost the impact on translation of German profits in the second
half; but judging by yesterday's interim trading statement there is no quick
fix to continuing overcapacity and price pressure in the UK. If anything,
there is a danger that the illusion of instant recovery will encourage
weaker competitors to delay difficult closure decisions, thereby prolonging
the agony.
One can sympathise with RMC's determination to hang on to its concrete
market share on the grounds that it should be a long term winner: refusal to
close plants will nevertheless keep the squeeze on margins in the short
term. There is a similar obduracy about aggregates, of a kind which can only
make the likes of Tarmac, ECC and Evered Bardon wince. Besides the problem
of surplus capacity, any help to volumes from interest rate cuts over the
next 18 months will more than likely be offset by lower infrastructure and
commercial property activity.
The encouraging bit is that RMC has experienced no slowdown yet in Germany,
which accounted for more than 50 per cent of operating profits in the first
half. The outlook for next year, though, remains uncertain and elsewhere in
Europe Spain and (to a lesser extent) France are flagging. At their current
level - up 34p at 443p - the shares are only for genuine long termists.

FT  18 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Reed/Elsevier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cheering of City analysts at the merger of Reed and Elsevier will
certainly be echoed by Reed's shareholders. Elsevier's secure revenues from
scientific publishing contrast starkly with Reed's exposure to consumer
advertising. By merging, Reed shareholders have gained access to Elsevier's
high-quality earnings flow in return for giving up some of their potential
profits from any cyclical advertising upturn. Given that recovery still
seems far away, that looks like a good deal for Reed, though it is at least
partly discounted by yesterday's 45p share price rise to 531p.
The deal creates a large group with strong finances which put it in a good
position to make acquisitions. The Official Airlines Guide may be a natural
purchase to go with Reed's travel-related businesses. Together the companies
can invest more heavily in electronic publishing and they may be able to
cross-market some products. But there are relatively few cost savings, and
it has yet to be proved that the strategic benefits will follow. It is
questionable, for example, whether Elsevier's strength as an up-market
European publisher will help Reed overcome its difficulties in breaking into
the continental consumer magazine market.
The marriage of a growth company with good earnings to a partly-cyclical
stock also looks slightly odd at a time when companies such as ICI are
breaking up to avoid the growth side of their business being rated as a
lowly cyclical. Reed and Elsevier argue that the merger is worth at least
the sum of its parts and offers opportunity for the future. They must hope
that the markets do not come to think that two plus two equals three.

examine where we are before making too many assumptions about the future.
Base rates, after all, are at exactly the same level as at the end of last
week. In the meantime, the effective devaluation of sterling, as measured by
the Bank of England's trade-weighted index, has been less than 6 per cent.
That combination is scarcely enough to produce 0.75 percentage points of
extra growth in a full year. The August unemployment figures may now be
merely a footnote in history but they were a reminder of quite how bleak the
starting point for that boost had become.
The 105-point rise in the London market can only be justified on the basis
that interest rates will now fall further. Similar assumptions are being
factored into gilts, where the short end was up between two and three points
yesterday while long-dated paper fell sharply on worries about resurgent
inflation. The attraction of further rate cuts is plain. They would pave the
way for some badly needed growth. That would make some sense out of the
devaluation and take the heat out of the recall of parliament and what
promises to be a painful Tory party conference.
That the government chose initially only to bring rates back to 10 per cent,
however, suggests it may not be in much of a hurry. Perhaps it still hopes
forlornly for speedy re-entry to the system. Perhaps it wishes to retain
some vestige of anti-inflation credibility. Even outside the system, the UK
never managed rates below those of Germany for long. Investors who are
betting on a dash for growth could yet be in for a disappointment.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Enterprise in extremis: The outlook for European union is
bleak, whatever the outcome of the French referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The game is up. Whatever the outcome of the French referendum on the
Maastricht treaty on Sunday, it is hard to see how the treaty's grand vision
of European political and monetary union can survive in its present form.
In Brussels yesterday, Britain's bloody retreat from the European exchange
rate mechanism - coupled with Italy's temporary abstention - was hailed as a
necessary measure to maintain confidence in the European Monetary System.
But the Anglo-Italian moves - matched by the devaluation of the Spanish
peseta - raise the prospect of a two-tier Europe, with the weaker economies
dropping behind a 'hard-core' block led by Germany. Maastricht's goal of
monetary union for all of the Twelve by the end of the century, never easy,
now seems remote indeed.
Moreover, the atmosphere of recrimination which accompanied Britain's
retreat - particularly the charges in London of Bundesbank sabotage forcing
the devaluation of sterling - seem certain to poison the immediate prospects
for future European co-operation. 'What (these events) demonstrate is the
fragile nature of the Community,' says a senior EC official.
For three months since Danish voters narrowly rejected the Maastricht treaty
last June, European heads of government have insisted that the enterprise
could be salvaged. They have stuck to this view, despite growing doubts
about the treaty in Britain and, more importantly, in France and Germany,
the driving forces behind greater European integration.
Maastricht was conceived in what now seems a distant era of optimism.
Although the treaty contained important provisions on a common social
policy, foreign policy and tentatively defence, the most important bargain
was struck on monetary union. Germany agreed, under French pressure, to
trade its D-Mark for an ill-defined political union and the goal of a single
currency, at the earliest by 1997, at the latest by 1999.
In retrospect, as some senior officials in Brussels admit, Maastricht may
have been a bridge too far. The Danish referendum has exposed the gulf
between the Europe planned by the technocrats and heads of states and the
Europe of the people - a point Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president and arch-federalist, now concedes.
More important, the events of the past week have exposed what may be an even
more fundamental flaw: the notion, implicit in Maastricht, that a united
Germany could be tied down by treaty constraints to the point where Europe
co-operation takes precedence over perceived vital national interests.
Perhaps the turning point came earlier this month during an informal meeting
of finance ministers in Bath when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank
president, and Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, were ambushed by
their 11 counterparts and urged to lower interest rates to help a general
European economic recovery.
'It was a bloodbath,' says one participant. At one point, according to
another source, Mr Waigel had to restrain Mr Schlesinger from walking out of
the meeting, so enraged was the Bundesbank chief by the pressure he was put
under. This private arm-twisting may explain, first, the Bundesbank's
grudging cut of  1/4 percentage point in the Lombard rate this week, and Mr
Schlesinger's subsequent comments in an interview - later denied - that he
favoured a broader realignment of currencies in the ERM.
Mr Schlesinger's comments helped to propel the emergency meeting of the EC
monetary committee which ended at just before 6am yesterday morning and
which killed British hopes of persuading the other member states to suspend
the operations of the ERM until after Sunday.
The currency game has still to play out. If President Mitterrand's gamble of
putting the treaty to a referendum pays off, and there is a Yes vote, there
is some prospect of relief for the weaker EC currencies. If the vote is No,
further speculative attacks seem inevitable.
In political terms, a Yes vote would put tremendous pressure on all EC
states - including Denmark and Britain - to support Maastricht unequivocally
and quickly. The problem is that the Danish government wants more time to
prepare public opinion for a possible second referendum.
The UK government's position is no less delicate. Faced with growing
opposition to the treaty on his backbenches, Mr John Major, the British
prime minister, must also do his duty as holder of the six-monthly rotating
EC presidency. The risk, says one EC official, is that Britain will find
itself once again isolated, as France and Germany debate what comes after
Maastricht if there is a No on Sunday.
For this reason, it seems likely that Britain will call a summit of the
heads of state shortly after the French referendum. The aim would be to
salvage what is left of the treaty, rather than to engage in a full-scale
renegotiation; to push for broader European co-operation without necessarily
drawing up new Community law; to initiate enlargement of the Community; and
to press for completion of important business such as the single market.
This 'business as usual' approach is characteristically British. There must
be some doubts about whether Mr Major can carry it off.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Fix, float or do nothing: The difficult options facing
Britain's economic policymakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER, PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely is it open to governments to rebuild their economic policies from
scratch. Yet that is the position in which Mr John Major's embattled
administration now finds itself, even if it is reluctant to admit as much.
What are its options, after the failed attempt to transform Britain into a
low-inflation, competitive international trading nation by anchoring
sterling to the D-Mark?
The main choices might crudely be characterised as: fix, float or do nothing
 -this last being little more than floating by another name. In other words,
should Mr Norman Lamont or any successor as chancellor restore sterling to
the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) or perpetuate the present punch-drunk
float? Yesterday's nebulous commitment to go back into the ERM as conditions
permit would provide an adequate cloak for whichever of these divergent
policies ultimately appealed to the government. There is then a set of
sub-options, which concern ways of reinforcing credibility once the basic
policy choice has been made. What follows is a plain man's guide to the pros
and cons of the various avenues open to the government. It starts with the
de facto option of the moment, namely:
Floating. The minimalist case advanced by pro-floaters for allowing sterling
to find its own level is that anything would be better than continuing to
put up with a German monetary policy within the ERM that is wholly unsuited
to British domestic economic conditions. Policymakers in Britain would enjoy
the freedom to set interest rates at a level designed to address the problem
of debt deflation and the associated maladies of falling house prices,
rising unemployment and low consumer confidence. In fact they have already
done so by permitting a two-point reduction in interest rates back to the 10
per cent level of Tuesday.
Instead of the burden of adjustment falling on domestic demand, the exchange
rate would, if this policy were maintained, take the strain; and it would
provide an escape valve over the longer run against the vicissitudes of
policy in the US, as well as Germany. On this view the exchange rate is a
market price; and it provides an adjustment mechanism that is perfectly
designed to cope with divergent economic policies in the Group of Seven
industrialised countries and in the ERM. Once a move to floating and the
conflict between what is needed to support the pound and the requirements of
the domestic economy disappears.
This was, in effect, Britain's answer to a similar problem in 1931, when
sterling went off the Gold Standard. The subsequent float was associated
(see chart) with Britain's highest rate of economic growth this century. But
there are snags.
Devaluation following a decision to float carries inflationary risks, as the
increased cost of imports feeds through to domestic prices. In the 1930s,
when Britain was still at the heart of the sterling area, that risk was less
because a great deal of the world was simultaneously floating downward with
sterling. Today, the sterling area is no more and Britain's pattern of trade
has shifted substantially to continental Europe. The inflationary
consequences of devaluation are thus potentially greater.
The obvious, and worrying, precedent is the decision by Tony (now Lord)
Barber to float the pound in 1972. That contributed significantly to an
inflationary boom that took the annual rate of increase in the retail price
index to 27 per cent by mid-decade. A further worry is that, after the
government's loss of credibility over the past week, the markets might not
take kindly to a rapid reduction in interest rates. Even if base rates of 6
to 7 per cent were appropriate for the woes of the British economy today, a
rapid move in that direction might put sterling into free fall.
Yet the risks can be overstated. As far as inflation is concerned, today's
devaluation is taking place against a background of an extremely depressed
level of activity, which will tend to reduce the adverse impact on prices.
And while the markets clearly need careful handling in the short run they
are not necessarily antipathetic to expansionary policy. According to David
Hale, chief economist of the Kemper financial group in Chicago, the UK's
poor economic performance has contributed to negative market sentiment in
recent months. Improved sentiment for British equities on the basis of lower
interest rates and devaluation could well be associated with subsequent
capital inflows which would help stabilise the pound.
A second snag concerns the political implications of staying out of the ERM.
John Major's frequently stated desire to put Britain at the heart of Europe
would be hard to reconcile with a free-floating position outside the system.
Yet it is possible that his aspiration has already sustained a mortal blow
as a result of this week's events. A No vote in this weekend's French
referendum would anyway make it hard to define where precisely the heart of
Europe is located.
Should the government decide that the inherent risks of floating are
outweighed by the rewards, it would probably have to review its overall
fiscal stance and would almost certainly feel obliged to improve domestic
monetary discipline to compensate for the abandoned D-Mark exchange rate
anchor. The trouble with such a move is that it was the failure of domestic
money supply targetry in the 1980s that prompted the ill-fated experiment
with exchange rate targets in the first place.
This means that Britain might be forced to rely on a wider range of
indicators. The risk is that a lack of precision in defining the targets
constitutes an invitation to sacrifice monetary virtue on the altar of
political imperatives. Yet precision encourages financial intermediaries to
use their ingenuity to by-pass disciplinary measures, for example, by
borrowing off-shore, so distorting the authorities' chosen target.
Another strategy for bolstering Britain's credibility in a return to
floating would be to grant independence to the Bank of England. This is
music to the ears of Bank officials, who would almost certainly be tougher
guardians of the currency than their counterparts in the Treasury. The Bank
never conceded that monetary policy was tight, let alone excessively tight,
when sterling was hopelessly overvalued in the early 1980s. But it took
decades, rather than years for the Bundesbank to establish its reputation
for monetary rectitude. So Britain's Liberal Democrats, who have been
pushing this nostrum hard, have probably over-sold their case. Which brings
us to:
Fixing. There is unlikely to be any such thing as a quick fix, not least
because nobody can be sure of the future shape of the ERM, in the light of
the French referendum and the problems of the Italians - who are bravely (or
foolishly) committed to re-assuming their ERM obligations next Tuesday - and
the Spaniards. Britain has also given itself more time to decide on a return
than Italy because the Treasury feels that the turmoil on currency markets
over the past week has other causes than the French vote. UK Treasury
officials yesterday said the recent weakness of the dollar, low US interest
rates and the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy were other factors that
had derailed UK policy.
This reasoning is largely self-serving. But it could also imply that these
problems would have to be resolved before the UK will be prepared to
consider full EMS membership as a genuine policy option. And the markets
appear to be looking for a protracted period on the sidelines. Yesterday's
rise in share prices was predicated on a continuing fall in interest rates,
implying a possible further depreciation in the sterling parity. Gilt
yields, meantime, fell at the short end of the market on similar assumptions
about falling base rates, while long bond yields rose on the thesis that
inflationary pressures looked more threatening with the ERM discipline
removed.
The case for going back in at some point in the future, if there is a
worthwhile ERM left to go into, is simple enough. As John Shepperd,
economist at SG Warburg Securities, puts it: 'Whatever happens over the next
few weeks I am convinced that Mr Major has not turned his back on the ERM
for good. Even if Britain re-joins at a lower rate of perhaps DM 2.65, the
ERM policy is the only route open for Britain if it wants to lock into lower
inflation. All the other policy prescriptions look threadbare.'
In one sense the sheer awfulness of the latest debacle lends strength to the
ERM case. An argument for entry in 1990 was the belief that Britain was not
competent to run its own monetary policy. After this week's humiliation, the
same argument must apply in spades. But that in turn could also be taken to
imply that Britain's second-time judgment about when to re-enter and its
choice of central rate within the parity grid might be flawed once again.
The argument could run in perpetuity.
Perhaps the most powerful argument for reconsidering an external anchor for
monetary policy is that Britain, along with Sweden, has lived through a
series of post-war currency depreciations, in and out of fixed rate exchange
rate systems, that have proved to be nugatory. In the end the nominal
depreciations have always been off-set by inflation and competitiveness has
shown no long-run real improvement. While there may be a case for
devaluation in response to one-off external shocks, a succession of
devaluations becomes self-defeating as market expectations adjust.
The floaters' counter-argument is that the present devaluation is not
primarily about restoring competitiveness. It is merely a by-product of the
attempt to address domestic economic problems with appropriate domestic
remedies.
The UK would certainly face massive problems rebuilding the credibility of
its commitment to the mechanism. It was, after all, the chancellor, who said
recently that: 'The ERM is not an optional extra, an add on to be jettisoned
at the first hint of trouble. It is and will remain at the very centre of
our macroeconomic strategy.' In the event, Britain showed less determination
to stay in the ERM than Sweden, a non-member, was prepared to demonstrate in
maintaining the link between its currency and the Ecu.
It would be unwise to underestimate John Major's commitment to disinflation
via the ERM. But he is also an accomplished politician. It is hard to
believe, regardless of the purely economic merits of the case, that he would
embark on a second experiment with an external monetary target before the
economy is firmly established on a growth path again. For many on the Tory
benches and in the country, once was more than enough.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Sunday matters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THE tumult on the currency markets this week, attention has been
distracted from the event that helped to bring it about - France's
referendum campaign about the Maastricht treaty. Some are arguing that the
vote has suddenly diminished in significance - that since the financial
apocalypse foretold as a consequence of a French No is already upon us, the
referendum somehow matters less. That argument is wrong. What happens on
Sunday remains of central importance to Europe and to France.
It is important for Europe because of the pivotal role France has played in
the integration process from the beginning. And it is important for France
because a commitment to Europe - and in particular to Franco-German
co-operation - has defined the country's history and identity since the
second world war. Indeed, until this year it appeared the French had
identified themselves so completely with efforts to create a closer European
union that the subject did not merit serious domestic debate.
Impossible as it seemed when President Francois Mitterrand called the
referendum last June, all those assumptions have now been thrown open to
question by the possibility that voters will reject Maastricht this weekend.
To understand that is the reason to hope that France will vote Yes.
A No vote would not just destroy the treaty on European Union, or force EC
institutions to tread water for a while. It would mark the biggest reverse
in the Community's history, and one from which it would take years to
recover. Rightly or wrongly, it would also be seen as undermining France's
relationship with Germany at the worst possible political moment. Rumblings
to this effect have been evident not far beneath the surface of the
referendum debate, with French politicians on both sides of the argument
referring to 'German demons' and German politicians struggling to contain
their irritation. Approval of Maastricht is needed to banish such atavistic
noises from mainstream politics, and permit the countries at the core of
Europe to concentrate on steering the Community through the troubles that
lie ahead.
Even in the unlikely event of a resounding Yes, this will be exceptionally
difficult. It will involve creative thinking by all EC governments, and a
significant effort to assuage the concerns about the Maastricht treaty that
have emerged in several member states apart from France.
The treaty can only come into force when all 12 governments have ratified,
and no one has yet come up with a remotely plausible answer to the problem
posed by Denmark's vote to reject it last June. Moreover, the humiliation of
the British government in the last two days makes it less likely that
parliament will readily ratify Maastricht in its present form, and
considerably less likely that Mr John Major, as current Community president,
will be able to give much of a lead. As for Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
faces mounting political problems of his own - including domestic opposition
to the treaty's provisions for economic and monetary union, which will have
been fuelled by this week's market turbulence.
All this points to the need for European governments to take another hard
look at important aspects of the treaty - and in particular to obey economic
logic in framing the timetable and scope for completion of monetary union,
perhaps at variable speeds. But first we need a positive outcome on Sunday.
A French Yes will not be sufficient to put the Community back on the rails.
But without one, EC leaders will be hard-pressed even to begin trying.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Policy after the collapse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC policy of the UK is now in tatters. So, unfortunately, is its
relationship with the German monetary authorities. The UK must refashion the
first and repair the second. But it must also preserve what has been
achieved under Mr John Major, both within the UK economy and in the UK's
relations with the rest of Europe. The UK can and must be both actively and
sympathetically involved in European integration. It will be so only if it
solves its fundamental economic problem, that of securing non-inflationary
growth.
The ERM policy did not fail because the UK government was tactically inept,
though it was. Nor did the policy fail because of the maladroitness of the
Bundesbank, though that certainly helped. The policy failed because its
price became too high. It became impossible to believe in the survival of a
policy that seemed to promise indefinite continuation of recession,
ever-rising unemployment and progressive fiscal deterioration. The markets
decided that no government could support the parity at the price of an
economic decline unparallelled in the history of the ERM.
The defeat was suffered for two noble causes: a desire to eliminate the UK's
ruinous inflationary psychology and a determination to play a full part in
the councils of Europe. The FT supports both causes, as it supported the ERM
policy. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Lamont are to be damned for their pursuit of
this policy, nor even for their repeated assertions that they would never do
what, in the end, they were forced to do. Such assertions are the swiftly
debased coinage of any semi-fixed exchange rate regime.
Yet sterling cannot simply be returned to the ERM at the earliest
opportunity, as if nothing had happened. Even a resounding Yes in Sunday's
Maastricht referendum in France would not decide the matter.
Brutal reminders
The argument for ERM membership was that it would both add to the
credibility of UK monetary policy and reinforce the country's participation
in European integration. But no new parity can have credibility. Who
imagines that the government, after already losing some 7 per cent of the
value of the huge sums dispensed in sterling's defence, would soon repeat
the experience? Who believes that the backbiting between the British
government and the German authorities of recent days has helped European
integration?
The last two years and, above all, the last few weeks have given brutal
reminders of the rake's progress of vulnerable parities in exchange rate
regimes like the ERM: the ever-more fulsome avowal of decreasingly credible
commitments, the conflict between domestic and external exigencies, the
arguments between those responsible for the key currency and those on the
periphery, the one-way bet offered to speculators, the final panic and then
the ignominious collapse.
These are not risks to be run lightly once more. A regime with the
economically turbulent unified Germany at its heart would again tie the UK
to a frequently inappropriate monetary policy. At present that policy is
probably still too tight. Until the dust settles in Germany, the UK would do
best to wait in the wings.
Real dangers
It should, instead, take the opportunity offered by its floating exchange
rate. But it must not ignore the real dangers of doing so. What is needed is
to build on the still incomplete achievement of low inflation. The higher
prices that will follow directly from the current devaluation must not be
allowed to generate a new wage-price spiral.
No dashes for consumption-led growth can be contemplated. The government was
right to lower base rate to 10 per cent once again, but it should go no
further than that for the moment. Devaluation will stimulate manufacturing,
itself among the most depressed parts of the economy. A slow recovery, led
by exports, would be far safer and gain far more credibility for whatever
parity might ultimately be chosen than an attempt to stimulate consumption
through much reduced interest rates. Any such reduction might also lead to a
complete collapse of sterling, because it would be rightly perceived as a
return to the often repeated short-term growthmanship of the UK.
The case for granting the Bank of England the power to set interest rates,
subject to an explicit and public override by the government, is now
overwhelming. A government prepared to cede that power to the Bundesbank
should not be averse to giving it to a reformed Bank of England. The Bank,
in turn, should focus precisely on what the Bundesbank does, the growth of
credit and money supply, the exchange rate and long-term rates of interest.
A policy dedicated to attaining non-inflationary growth is best for the UK
and also the best way for the UK to prepare itself for further involvement
in European monetary integration. Europe needs a UK that believes in itself,
not one that believes itself incapable of anything better than devotion to
an inward-looking Bundesbank. What the Bundesbank was expected to do for the
UK can also be done by the Bank of England. It was done by the Bank for
centuries. That is the only monetary policy the British government can now
sensibly adopt.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Management: Rambo bosses back off / Examining whether
recession has put a brake on the 'empowerment' of middle managers and other
staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the proposition looks paradoxical, even dangerously absurd:
that, at the very time when the survival of countless companies is
threatened by the worst recession since the 1930s, top executives should be
decentralising authority and 'empowering' their managers and other
employees.
In difficult times in the past, and especially during recessions, most
executives have done precisely the opposite. They have slashed spending by
reinforcing their own power and that of the centre, taking back some of the
authority which in better times they had delegated down the organisation.
Yet, in one form or another, 'empowerment' is what countless consultants,
and almost every business academic, persist in advising companies to
introduce.
Some managements are understandably frightened by the idea: they think it
will reduce their authority and render decision-making slow or risky. But in
America, PepsiCo, Xerox, General Electric, Ford, General Mills and a myriad
of other companies have embraced 'empowerment' or the very similar
principles of 'high-involvement'.
In Europe, new practitioners range from BhS, the British retailing group
which is now very much on the mend, to Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy, which is
becoming less Germanic and hierarchical by the month. A few years ago the
Basle-based company began using the term 'directed autonomy', which
management found less threatening. But now, though it avoids the e-word when
it can, it frequently feels obliged to use it to convey what it says is a
more far-reaching process and set of attitudes, in which management's role
is not just to provide direction, but also autonomy and support, so that the
employee feels self-empowered.
Empowerment may be a ghastly word and it is certainly over-used, but the
degree of interest in the concept in Europe, particularly the UK, is
soaring.
This is demonstrated by a recent surge in consultancy work on and around the
subject. A number of strategic and especially accountancy-based
consultancies have suffered sliding revenues and staff cutbacks in the past
two years. But at Kinsley Lord, a specialist UK firm which sees empowerment
as a centrepiece of its work on organisational change, business has boomed
since the start of the recession.
The firm's revenues have shot up by a third in the first nine months of the
current year, and are expected to rise more sharply still in 1993.
Gemini is a much larger European-American consultancy of 1,200 people which
specialises in both strategic and organisational change - including the
fashionable 'process re-engineering' - but to which empowerment is equally
central. Its revenues also grew by a third last year, a rate which is now
accelerating. 'Harnessing the drive, ingenuity and power of people is
central to what we do,' says Peter Beilby, its European senior
vice-president for marketing.
His colleague, Professor Dean Berry, says: 'Companies may not start out with
empowerment as a goal. But when they strip levels out, try to compress
time-to-market, and redesign other processes, they end up with it. Even with
advanced information technology, you can't really run a delayered
organisation by 'command and control' methods,' he says. 'The people route
is more timely, simpler, more cost effective, and less risky.'
The trend towards greater decentralisation, involvement and authority in
many companies - though not always to a degree which merits the grand term
'empowerment' - is confirmed by two accountancy-based consultancies. At
KPMG, David Bishop, a partner, says that in the UK the recession is causing
centralisation only in companies which are in extremis.
'In some organisations, it's driving them to decentralise responsibility
faster as the best way to simplify business processes and get costs out the
door,' he reports. This trend is not necessarily in conflict with directives
from the top to cut costs, he argues. The key question is whether middle
managers and other employees have any choice in the level or the method of
cuts.
Vic Luck, head of consulting to commerce and industry in the UK at Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, agrees that some companies are pulling financial authorisation back
to the centre and that a second, small group is 'taking a step backwards' by
cutting total quality programmes because they are not giving immediate
results. But a third group of companies is continuing with its
decentralisation programmes, he says. At the same time, they are cutting
expenditure, frequently by giving staff their head in cost reduction
programmes.
A remarkable example of this last year was within British Airways
Engineering. Alongside a total quality programme introduced with the help of
consultants from Kepner-Tregoe, management's targets for expenditure cuts
were exceeded almost threefold when aircraft maintenance staff were let
loose on the problem; they produced savings of Pounds 24m against the target
of Pounds 8.5m.
John Perkins, BA's chief engineer, now says: 'I don't mind admitting I was a
Rambo-style manager - I have changed my own style because I have seen that
it is just not the most successful way.'
His approach contrasts markedly with standard airline management. Most
airline campaigns to create greater 'customer care', and other such
programmes designed to change staff behaviour, tend to empower employees
less than they programme them to act in a particular way.
Airline managers who are more conservative than Perkins would argue that
this is because most tasks in their industry are done more effectively via
control than through empowerment. That is certainly the approach practised
by successful, but rather soulless, US airlines such as Delta and American.
But it is also why passengers tend to be cynical about staff retraining
programmes which provide a superficial gloss of empowerment, yet which do
not allow them even to provide the occasional hungry passenger with a second
bag of peanuts.
This is just the very trite tip of an iceberg of confusion, anxiety and, for
some people, excitement which surrounds the concept of empowerment.
A second article on empowerment will appear on Monday.

 -An initiative to help employees with children and aged parents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
Corporate America has just unveiled an important initiative to help
employees find adequate care for children and elderly parents while they are
at work.
More than 100 companies have joined forces and committed Dollars 25.4m
(Pounds 12.8m) to fund a range of child and 'elder care' programmes in 44
communities across the US. The move is being led by 11 of the largest
businesses in the US, including International Business Machines, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Exxon, Motorola and American Express.
Schemes include the construction of childcare centres, training for
child-minders who look after children in their own homes, special programmes
to occupy school-age children during holidays and the organisation of
volunteers to visit aged relatives.
American companies which once shunned any role in their employees' family
lives have become much more involved in the area over the past three to four
years, due largely to the growing number of women in the labour force and
competition to attract and retain skilled labour of either sex.
The same pressures are evident in politics, with both houses of Congress
recently passing legislation which would require employers to give workers
up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, with health insurance kept in force, to look
after sick family members or for their own medical needs, including
pregnancy.
President Bush is certain to veto the legislation on the grounds that such
leave should be negotiated by workers, rather than mandated by government.
But polls suggest the idea is extremely popular around the nation and it is
likely to become law if Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee,
wins the November election.
The new corporate initiative represents a big leap forward: previously, each
company generally pursued policies on its own. The degree of co-operation
they have now agreed upon is unprecedented and is likely to set an example
many other businesses will follow.
Indeed, the founders of the venture are encouraging other companies to join
it. In a statement accompanying the initiative, the 11 leading companies
declared that 'dependant care is a primary concern of American business.
Our diverse workforce is increasingly populated by employees who must
arrange care for family members - young and old - in order to be fully
productive at work. Meeting the basic need for support of our working
families is one of the most critical issues we face.'
The basic advantages in pooling resources are seen as:
Economic and logistic. Individual companies have found that it is either too
costly, or their employees are too scattered, to make it worthwhile setting
up a programme in a particular community. When they join together, the
increased scale makes projects feasible.
A systematic approach. Until now, companies have tended to take a piecemeal
approach to dependant care issues, with each tackling just a few of the wide
range of problems faced by families. According to Fran Rodgers, chief
executive of Work/Family Directions, a Boston-based dependant care
consulting company, the new scheme 'attacks many problems at the same time'.
Community involvement. The new initiative draws in many local community
organisations and, while primarily designed to help companies' employees, it
is also meant to raise standards of childcare across the community. For
example, child-minders in some communities will be given training
irrespective of whether company employees use their services.
Companies involved in the scheme stress that it does not mean they
themselves are plunging into the dependant care business. The funds they are
contributing will be used as grants to help independent care providers.
The largest number of projects in the programme involve improving the care
of school-aged children when they are not safely in the class-room.
Many parents find some of their greatest difficulties are in finding quality
help for this age group, especially during school holidays, rather than
meeting the less complex needs of pre-school children.
However, in dollar terms, well over half of the Dollars 25.4m will be spent
on building or expanding childcare centres. Just Dollars 1.5m will go for
the care of the elderly, which is in many respects a trickier problem to
solve: parents often live some distance from their children and potential
difficulties are far more varied than those of children.
The initiative represents corporate America's strongest recognition yet that
companies which want to attract the best employees will need to pay much
more attention in the 1990s to helping staff find a balance between the
demands of a job and increasingly complex home lives.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Technology: Harvesting a cornucopia - The search for crops
that resist disease has caused scientists to create more genetically diverse
varieties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1970, a terrible thing happened to the US maize crop. A virulent new
strain of fungus made its way into Florida and quickly raced northwest,
killing half the crop from Miami to Texas. The cost to farmers was estimated
at Dollars 1bn.
The blight, scientists say, came close to transforming the US from a food
exporting nation into a food importer. The incident taught scientists a
valuable, albeit expensive, lesson.
One reason the devastation was so great was that farmers were using one
basic variety of maize. Billions of rows of the crop were carbon copies of
each other. Another strain might have proved resistant and stopped the virus
in its trek across the country. But since farmers were working with such a
narrow genetic base, most of the maize had the same degree of susceptibility
to the disease.
Since then, both US and international scientists have taken the preservation
of different plant varieties more seriously. Organisations like the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, with an operating
budget of up to Dollars 300m a year, scour the planet in search of rare
plant strains which, crossed with more traditional varieties, would provide
resistance against various diseases.
The United Nations is heavily involved in collecting and preserving plant
varieties, as are many national governments. Indeed, gene banks, both public
and private, have sprung up around the globe from Malaysia to Alaska.
In times of crisis, these gene banks prove valuable. When a disease hits a
major crop, botanists search for a section of DNA which would provide
resistance to infection. Once the area is identified, scientists can
transfer genes between related plants by traditional cross-pollination
techniques. In the future, genetic engineering will be used.
The collection of rare plant species for crossing with traditional crops has
already begun to make a financial difference to the world's farmers.
According to the Rural Advancement Foundation, varieties created through the
introduction of rare plant genes produce Dollars 2.7bn in wheat sales each
year, and Dollars 677m in rice sales.
One Turkish wheat variety which proved immune to several North American
plagues is alone worth Dollars 50m a year to US farmers. Scientists say rare
plant species may also prove valuable in the search for more nutritious
foods.
'We collect berries from the tundras of Canada because they have extremely
high vitamin C content,' said Henry Shands, a senior botanist with the
Genetics Resources Group at the US Department of Agriculture. 'Someday we
may be able to use that.'
Over the last few years, the search for rare plants has gained a new
urgency. As civilisation encroaches on previously wild areas, from tropical
rain forests to the tundras of Siberia, scientists fear the rate of loss of
plant varieties has accelerated to 2 per cent a year.
'We have lost 75 per cent of the genetic diversity of the world's top 20
crops since the Second World War,' estimated Patrick Mooney, a botanist at
the Rural Advancement Foundation.
Some of the world's most genetically diverse areas are under threat from
dams, roads, logging and modern agriculture. Robert Rhoades, an
anthropologist at the University of Georgia, estimates that as many as
60,000 plant species - a quarter of the world's total - may be lost or
endangered within the next 50 years.
The advancement of biotechnology has added to the sense of urgency. 'In the
old days, we just concentrated on different strains of major crops,'
explained Shands. 'But now, scientists can make use of the genes of plants
which are from a different species to improve disease resistance.'
Scientists say the narrowness of the gene base of many major crops is
frightening. 'All the coffee in Latin America comes from one original tree,
brought from Africa,' said Mooney. 'The rubber crop in Malaysia began with
21 trees smuggled out of Brazil. This kind of narrow gene base makes plants
vulnerable to being wiped out by disease.'
Technology improvements of the 1960s made matters worse, as scientists
developed 'miracle' seeds by cross breeding plants to increase yield and
hardiness. The resulting crop was such a success that many farmers abandoned
other varieties, cutting down the world's genetic base even further.
As recently as 1959, rice farmers in Sri Lanka cultivated some 2,000
traditional varieties of rice. Today, they grow just five principal strains.
In India, which once harvested 30,000 varieties, more than 75 per cent of
total production is now accounted for by 10 strains.
Many scientists feel so strongly about the preservation of plant material
that their work has taken on a heroic aspect. Even in the 1920s and 1930s, a
handful of Soviet botanists realised that rare plant materials would some
day be valuable.
Nikolay Vavilov, the head of a team which collected stocks from the far
corners of the earth, was sent to prison after a dispute with one of
Stalin's favoured agronomists. His associates, during the 900-day siege of
Leningrad in the Second World War, starved to death rather than eat the
plants and seeds which they had been saving in the laboratories.
Today, researchers still have to brave dangerous conditions in their search
for rare plants. Scientists at the Potato Centre in the Andes mountains of
Peru have been attacked by guerrillas in the course of gathering rare potato
strains. 'There is the sense that we are doing something so important, the
danger is worth it,' said George White, who heads the gene bank for the US
Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Maryland.
Not all the collection work involves trips to the tropics, though. Kent
Whealey directs an organisation in Iowa called the Seed Savers Exchange,
which depends on local resources for its seed bank. According to Whealey,
many farmers in the US grew traditional varieties their ancestors brought
with them many years ago. When the farming crisis gripped the country, many
were forced out of business.
The Seed Savers Exchange gave them a place to deposit the seed heirlooms,
rather than watch them die out with the family farm. Another source for the
exchange is seed companies which are closing down, or being bought out by
other, larger companies.
'There's been a lot of consolidation in the seed industry over the last few
years,' said Whealey. 'So we go through catalogues of companies that are
going out of business, to see if there might be something worth saving.'
The organisation says it holds some 10,000 seed varieties in storage. With
the preservation of the world's plant varieties gaining greater urgency,
many scientists complain that resources for their work are too limited.
'We were hoping the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro this year would
grant us more funds, but we didn't get much,' Mooney complained.
But Shands of the USDA puts things in another perspective. 'Sometimes we
don't really know what the materials might be used for,' he said. 'So it's
hard to argue that this should receive more priority than, say, feeding the
starving people of Somalia. I guess we should be happy with the funding we
get.'

Marketing directors who fret about the effectiveness of their companies'
direct mail campaigns have a new weapon in their armoury - the ability to
profile their customer database by financial as well as socio-economic type
via the postcode.
A joint agreement between Infolink Decision Services and GB Mailing Systems
has led to the launch of GB Profiler with Define, a software module that
links the UK's 1.4m postcodes in the GB Address and AddressPlus postcoding
software packages to the Infolink Define consumer market segmentation
system.
Define enables marketers to profile an area's financial and socio-economic
background using regularly updated information from Infolink's consumer
credit database. Infolink says the implications for in-house database
management and for the effectiveness of direct mail campaigns are enormous.

Computer-aided design technology is coming to the aid of the growing number
of people tempted by the challenging prospect of building their own homes.
The self-build market is worth about Pounds 3bn a year in the UK alone, with
about 23,000 homes self-built every year. Now Medina Gimson, which
specialises in the design and manufacture of one-off timber frame packages
for self-builders, is making the benefits of Cad technology directly
accessible to its customers.
Cad systems for house design have been available to the building industry
for some years but the Medina initiative allows self-builders to sit
alongside the designers and watch their home take shape on screen in a
matter of hours.
The system was unveiled yesterday at the National Self Build Homes Show at
Alexandra Palace in London, which runs until Sunday. Medina Gimson: UK, 0732

FT  18 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): TV chip adjusts the fine tuning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A French-Japanese collaboration has produced a semiconductor chip that
promises to bring down the cost of manufacturing a television substantially,
writes Steven Butler.
Sanyo Electric and Thomson Consumer Electronics have started producing a
chip that in just a few seconds adjusts 46 different parameters - including
colour, luminance, and horizontal and vertical synchronization - to produce
a perfectly clear, balanced picture. Until now, the parameters had to be
adjusted separately, some by machine, some directly by line workers.
The cross-border collaboration fits a pattern that could be more common in
the years ahead. Although Japanese companies bring considerable experience
in semiconductor technology, western companies like Thomson still have the
edge on digital processing. Digital processing is critical to the operation
of the chip, and will be important for the next generation of electronics
products.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Protection plea for EC workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS should not suffer severe loss of rights to future occupational
pension benefits when they move jobs within the European Community,
according to a UK government draft proposal.
It is estimated that about 3m EC nationals work in other EC countries,
mainly in skilled manual, professional or managerial jobs. Labour mobility
is a principle aim of the European Community.
Watsons Europe, the actuarial firm, estimates that about 150,000 managers
are adversely affected by the lack of harmonisation in EC pensions. Some
workers are able to negotiate compensation for loss of pension rights with
their new employers.
The government believes the single European market, due to be completed by
December 31 1992, might mean many more workers moving between jobs in
different EC countries. Many migrants have to freeze occupational pensions
in one country and start a new one in the state to which they move.
Efforts to harmonise occupational pension schemes were scuppered last year
by the EC because pensions are linked to taxation and therefore affect the
sovereignty of member states' taxation policies.
The UK government intends to use its presidency of the council of ministers
to make progress on the issue. It hopes to reach an agreement in time for a
meeting of EC social affairs ministers in Edinburgh in December.
EC workers enjoy greater protection over state pension benefits. A British
worker who retires in France must be paid a proportionate amount of his or
her state pension from the country of origin, plus a proportionate amount of
that of the host country, depending on length of residence.
A consultation paper, published by the social security department, calls on
the EC to protect the future occupational benefits of these workers. The
paper includes the draft resolution for consideration by other EC member
states.
The deadline for comments on the Social Security Department's consultation
document is September 25 1992.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Dealing with a matter of trust: Norma Cohen meets the man
with the task of reforming pension law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Roy Goode, chairman of the government's independent Pension Law
Review Committee, makes little secret of the fact that he has chosen the
most contentious issue in the industry - and most commercially sensitive -
as his committee's central theme.
'There are rights of scheme members and there are expectations which are not
necessarily rights,' he said. 'Some of those expectations are reasonable and
some are not. The question is how far pension expectations need to be taken
into account by trustees.'
The conflict arises, he says, when employers make entitlement to benefits
vague to avoid locking themselves into commitments they may not be able to
afford, while employees make contributions in the belief that specific
benefits will be forthcoming in all circumstances.
'We are asking whether there are some scheme rules which are capable of
being exercised so unfairly that they should only be exercised with a
court's permission. And are there some which should be banned altogether?'
Within that framework lie matters of great commercial consequence, both for
scheme members who receive benefits and for corporate sponsors who, more or
less, underwrite them. 'You have to decide who owns the scheme before you
can decide on whose behalf you are protecting it,' he said.
Professor Goode will only smile when the commercial consequences of his
report are mentioned and says he has come to the matter with no particular
point of view. 'I have an open mind - but not a vacant one,' he said.
However, he acknowledges that he is likely to come under considerable
pressure from plan sponsors and their advisers to write a report with their
commercial interests in mind.
Already, the lobbying appears to have begun. Yesterday the pension fund
trade association, the National Association of Pension Funds, formally
offered its members expertise to help the committee, while actuarial
consultants R. Watsons said it would be encouraging its clients to respond
as well.
The committee has its roots in the unprecedented theft of more than Pounds
400m from pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. But its
remit has been drawn to encompass what has emerged as the central issue in
the industry - ownership.
Revelations of mismanagement or misuse of surpluses have outraged pension
scheme members, sometimes with reason, sometimes not. But, in all, it has
created political pressure for pension fund reform as never before.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Health body calls in police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST MIDLANDS Regional Health Authority has decided to call in police
following a critical district auditor's report on a Pounds 2.5m cost-cutting
study.
The study, carried out by United Research Group, a US consultancy, was
intended to identify ways of saving up to Pounds 50m in the authority's
supplies division through better purchasing and greater efficiency.
The auditor found that the study - which managers admit yielded few benefits
 -was badly managed and involved Pounds 350,000 of expenses, including
entertainment.
The decision to call in the police followed discussions with the Audit
Commission, which supervises the district auditors' service.
It reflected 'the serious nature of the report and its contents', a
spokesman for the authority said.
Mr Stuart Fletcher, the authority's managing director, and its chairman, Sir
James Ackers, are expected to meet the chief constable of West Midlands
police shortly.
Last week, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, strengthened the
management of the authority by sending in Sir Roy Griffiths, one of the most
senior figures in the National Health Service.
Sir Roy, who is deputy chairman of the National Health Service policy board,
will help the authority to strengthen and improve management controls so
that they command public confidence.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Pension law panel issues questionnaire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDEPENDENT body appointed by the government to review occupational
pension law yesterday issued a wide-ranging questionnaire aimed at
determining whether current law adequately protects the reasonable
expectations of pension-scheme members.
Professor Roy Goode, professor of English law at Oxford University and
chairman of the pension law review committee, said it was seeking answers to
81 detailed questions by December 15.
The committee must publish its findings by May 1993. It was announced on
June 8 by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, after hearings by a
parliamentary select committee into the disappearance of more than Pounds
400m from occupational pension schemes controlled by the late Robert
Maxwell.
The committee's remit is to review the regulatory framework for pension
schemes and to recommend legislative changes if necessary.
Yesterday the National Association of Pension Funds, the trade association
for the pensions industry, said it welcomed the questionnaire and its
members would make their expertise available to the committee.
Prof Goode said, however, that the committee, which includes representatives
of the pension and fund management industry as well as consumers, is
concerned that the views and expectations of ordinary pension members should
be adequately reflected in its report.
To that end it is preparing a survey of scheme members through a written
questionnaire, to be followed up with interviews in depth with individual
scheme members.
Prof Goode said at a press conference yesterday: 'We particularly want to
understand what scheme participants understand about their pension rights.'
He said the group's primary task would be to answer the basic question about
scheme members' legal entitlement to pension benefits. 'All other questions
about pension fund protection flow from that,' he said.
The question about ownership of scheme assets generally and surpluses in
particular are considered to be the most controversial in the pensions
industry. Prof Goode said the group might recommend legislation although it
would be up to the government to decide whether to table a bill before
parliament.
Among the questions the committee is seeking answers to is whether there are
scheme rules, powers or discretions (including the power to amend or close a
scheme) that the law should control.
It is also asking whether pension rights should be enshrined in employment
contracts, whether trust law should be abandoned and whether methods of
calculation of pensions should be standardised.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Council tax information fails to reveal size of bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COUNCIL tax information campaign was launched by the government yesterday,
but it will steer studiously clear of giving any guideline figures on the
level of the tax.
Leaflets explaining the tax will be sent to 20m households next week at a
cost of Pounds 3m.
The leaflets will explain how properties are valued, how discounts and
exemptions will apply, and transitional reductions that will be made
available.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said: 'We are on time and on
target despite mischievous speculation.'
The council tax will replace the poll tax next April. Householders will be
allocated to one of eight charging bands according to the value of their
property, with 25 per cent discounts for one-person households and 50 per
cent discounts for empty properties.
Estimates from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy
suggest that the average council tax bill will be about Pounds 540 a year.
Those in the lowest band stand to pay about Pounds 350, and those in the top
band over Pounds 1,000. Precise figures will depend upon next year's grant
settlement, to be announced in the autumn.
A telephone inquiry service has been launched to provide information about
the council tax. Councils that subscribe to Capita Managed Services
GuideLine will be able to give payers of the tax a local telephone number
for information about how the tax works, payment procedures and how to
appeal against valuations.
Calls will be rerouted to Capita's Reading centre, where an automated
switchboard will allow the caller to select pre-recorded messages tailored
to each council's needs.

THREE quarters of leading company pension schemes have workforce
representatives on the trustee board, according to Incomes Data Services,
the independent pay research group.
One in five pension schemes has at least one pensioner as a trustee,
according to the survey of 72 pension schemes published today.
A 1983 government actuaries survey of all private-sector occupational
pension schemes found that about a third had workforce representatives on
their trustee boards.
Mr Bryn Davies, actuary with Union Pension Services, said: 'This represents
some progress but the debate over boards of trustees is bedevilled. We have
seen Lord Hanson on television telling us he is an employee representative,
which is not what most people mean.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Scargill says 30 pits to be closed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Scargill, president of the NUM mining union, claimed yesterday to
have obtained confidential documents showing that British Coal planned to
close up to 30 collieries - with the loss of more than 25,000 jobs.
The detailed list allegedly shows that three pits will close in the
north-east; 11 in the Coal Board's Yorkshire area; nine in Nottinghamshire;
two in Derbyshire; two in the Midlands; two in south Wales and one in
Lancashire.
A covering letter dated September 1 1992 accompanied the list and was
purportedly from Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury.
The DTI refused to comment on the allegations, as did British Coal.
Mr Scargill said: 'Such butchery of the British coalmining industry would
represent a catastrophe not only for Britain's miners and their communities,
but also for the British economy, which is already on the verge of
collapse.'
Negotiations are nearing completion on new coal contracts with the
electricity industry which will pave the way to the privatisation of British
Coal. They are expected to lead to extensive pit closures as the corporation
strives to become fully commercial.

THE ANNUAL increase in average earnings to July was 6 per cent, the lowest
rate since 1980, according to government figures published yesterday.
The level provided some comfort for the Department of Employment on the day
that it announced that unemployment had risen by a seasonally adjusted
47,000 in August to 2.8m.
It also said that the number of stoppages through industrial action in July
was 35, the lowest monthly total since 1929, and the number of working days
lost in the year to July was 0.5m, the lowest annual total since records
began in 1920.
Industrialists and economists will focus on the unemployment figures, which
on an unadjusted basis rose by 71,541 in August to 2.85m, and on the
employment figures.
The UK workforce in employment in June was 25.4m, a fall of 182,000 during
the second quarter of the year and a reduction of 651,000 over the year to
June.
Continuing the pattern of the recession, unemployment continued to grow more
rapidly in the south of England than in most other regions between July and
August.
The unemployment rate in the south-east reached 9.5 per cent in August, 0.2
percentage points above the previous month, and 9.4 per cent in the
south-west, 0.3 per cent up.
Recorded unemployment among men was 13.2 per cent, against 5.5 per cent for
women, although that is heavily influenced by who is eligible to claim
unemployment benefit.
The July figure of 6 per cent for the rise in average earnings compares with
6.25 per cent in June, adjusted from the previous estimate of 6 per cent. It
is likely that the figure will fall below 6 per cent within the next few
months if overtime remains static and bonus payments continue to fall.
The number of people on government training and employment programmes has
fallen 12.3 per cent since the spring of last year, refuting the widely held
view that the unemployment figures are being substantially depressed by such
schemes, David Goodhart writes.
The figure comes from the Department of Employment's Labour Force Survey,
which was yesterday published on a quarterly basis for the first time,
instead of annually.
The main reason for the fall in the number of people on government schemes
is demographic - with fewer young people in the population going on to Youth
Training, the scheme for those aged 16 to 18.

BOTH THE UK and Germany have experienced substantial growth in
self-employment but the increase has been most dynamic in the UK, according
to a report from the Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial
Society, a charitable group.
In its report, the group, which seeks to promote closer understanding
between the UK and Germany, compares the phenomenon of self-employment in
both countries and examines common characteristics and differences.
The report says the UK economic and policy climate promotes start-ups, while
that in Germany favours maintaining those already self-employed.
Policymakers need to understand the implications of self-employment for the
labour market, it says.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Bupa chief calls for end to 'war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's private-health sector needs to develop a much better understanding
with the medical profession, the chief executive of Bupa, the biggest
private provider, said yesterday.
Mr Peter Jacobs told a Bupa conference in London: 'In some quarters the
perception is one of warfare - a struggle on the part of the consultants to
keep their fees as high as possible and of insurers to keep costs down.'
Fees charged by doctors for private medical treatment were last week
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
An explosion in treatment costs, Mr Jacobs said, was threatening both the
public and private sectors. It arose from growing public expectations, the
ageing of the population and technological developments.
While Bupa did not seek to become involved in clinical judgments in
individual cases, it was examining ways of establishing and monitoring best
practice and avoiding wasteful use of resources.
Mr Jacobs said: 'In doing so, we will take into account the legitimate
interests of all the parties involved - the hospitals, insurers and medical
profession.'
He also appealed for closer working between the public and private health
sectors.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Output standstill hits hopes for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that British industry might be recovering from the recession were
dampened yesterday by news that manufacturing output was unchanged in July.
Official figures showed that the output of manufactured goods in the three
months to the end of July was flat compared with the previous three months
and 0.9 per cent lower than the same period a year ago. In July, the level
of output was the same as in June.
The figures suggested that a small rise in manufacturing production in the
first half of the year - which led some economists to suggest that
manufacturing industry had seen the worst of the recession - petered out
during the summer.
Manufacturing output rose 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year and
0.5 per cent in the second quarter after six consecutive quarters of falling
production.
Overall industrial production, which includes oil and gas output, grew 1 per
cent in July. That was due to a sharp increase in energy production.
The Central Statistical Office figures showed that output for most sectors
of manufacturing fell slightly or was flat during the three months to the
end of July. Food, drink and tobacco output grew by 1 per cent compared with
the previous three months, while output of the minerals, engineering,
textiles and clothing sectors was almost unchanged.

FT  18 SEP 92 / August car production down 7.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CAR production in August fell by 7.8 per cent from the same month a year
earlier, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office.
Car output in August declined to 52,943 from 57,388 a year earlier.
In the first eight months of the year, however, output was virtually
unchanged at 858,204, a marginal 0.5 per cent rise from the 853,769 achieved
in the corresponding period a year earlier.
UK car output has performed relatively well during the recession, with much
higher production for export markets largely making up for lower output for
the home market.
Production fell only 4.8 per cent from the peak of 1.3m in 1989 to 1.24m
last year. In the same period, UK new car sales fell 30.9 per cent from 2.3m
in 1989 to 1.59m.
The share of output for export markets jumped from 21.6 per cent in 1989 to
48.9 per cent last year.
The trend has been reversed this year, however, with car output for export
markets falling 17.9 per cent in the first eight months to 331,525,
accounting for 38.6 per cent of output compared with a share of 52.7 per
cent in the same period last year.
The immediate outlook for car production has been clouded by short-time
working announced recently by Ford and Rover in the face of disappointing UK
sales and weakening demand abroad.
UK commercial vehicle output of 12,437 in August was 48.8 per cent higher
than a year earlier, while production in the first eight months has jumped
29 per cent to 175,528. The increase reflects the start-up last autumn of
production by Ford of its Fiesta-based Courier van, for which Ford's plant
in Dagenham, Essex, is the sole source of supply for Europe.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Fewer on state training projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people on government training and employment programmes has
fallen 12.3 per cent since the spring of last year, refuting the widely-held
view that the unemployment figures are being substantially depressed by such
schemes.
The figure comes from the Department of Employment's Labour Force Survey,

instead of annually.
The main reason for fall in the number of people on government schemes is
demographic - with fewer young people in the population going on to Youth
Training, the scheme for 16-18 year olds.
The government will take some cheer from the figure showing that 3m people
were receiving job-related training in spring this year, a rise of 66 per
cent compared with spring 1984 and a fall of only 100,000 or 4 per cent
compared with spring last year.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Manx report can be released
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited report into the Pounds 42m collapse of the Savings and
Investment Bank on the Isle of Man 10 years ago can now be published, a
judge ruled yesterday.
The 500-page Chadwick report into the bank's crash was shelved until the
trial of two of its senior executives on fraud charges had been completed.
The report is likely further to embarrass the island's government over the
past standards of regulation of its offshore financial industry. Publication
is expected to open the way for ex-gratia payments to SIB depositors.
The government hopes that will enable the island - which now has one of the
toughest regulatory regimes in the world - to put the affair behind it.
Two years ago a Bank of England report into general supervisory standards on
the island was severely critical of Manx treasury officials. The Chadwick
report is also expected to criticise the officials.
Publication is expected on Tuesday after deletions ordered yesterday by
Deemster John Corrin, the Manx High Court's senior judge. He said the
deletions were minor and would not affect the thrust of the report.
He had received only one representation - from Fryers Bell, the island
accountants - that its name be erased from the report.
Depositors welcomed the decision, but criticised the Pounds 5,000 maximum
level of individual payments likely from a government fund of Pounds 4.45m.
Depositor protection schemes introduced on the island since the collapse
mirror those of the UK and allow for a Pounds 15,000 maximum individual
claim, with money levied from all other holders of banking licences on the
island.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Law firm retains earnings title
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLAUGHTER and May, the City solicitors, has maintained its position as the
UK's most profitable law firm in the year to March, according to an earnings
league table published yesterday by the magazine Legal Business, Robert Rice
writes.
The firm had average net profit per partner of Pounds 390,000 on turnover of
Pounds 113m, and profit per fee earner (lawyer) of Pounds 67,000. It has 567
fee earners. Slaughter and May has increased profitability against flat
turnover. Last year it had average net profit per partner of Pounds 377,000
on turnover of Pounds 113m.
Its nearest rival was again Linklaters &amp; Paines, with average net profit of
Pounds 380,000 on turnover of Pounds 154m, and profit per fee earner of
Pounds 75,000. Linklaters has 718 fee earners.
The figures show that in general Britain's top law firms appear to be
surviving the recession well. The magazine says gross revenues have
increased slightly and profits have remained high. The top 35 firms had a
combined turnover of more than Pounds 2bn.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Ashdown attacks PM's 'failure to lead': Liberal Democrat
Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUSTAINED onslaught on Mr John Major for failing to give a lead to the
nation and to the international community was the theme of Mr Paddy
Ashdown's rallying speech to the Liberal Democrats yesterday as the party
ended its Harrogate conference.
His attack, which won him a standing ovation, was coupled with a warning
that the government's credibility had been so undermined by its mishandling
of the economic crisis that from now onwards it was 'on borrowed time'.
He said: 'Now we know them for what they are. The Tory party - the party of
devaluation.'
The Liberal Democrat leader, who has previously expressed praise for some of
Mr Major's actions since achieving power, excoriated the prime minister as
someone whose pledges were worthless, and who pretended the crisis was not
there. Portraying Mr Major as the ancient mariner, Mr Ashdown depicted him
as 'becalmed, alone, save for the loyal Lamont, the albatross of Thatcherism
around his neck, his government paralysed by inaction'.
He stopped short, however, of calling for the resignation of Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, saying instead that the priority was to restore
stability and some control.
He called on Mr Major to make a full statement about what the government
intended to do; to put beyond doubt that the UK intended to return to the
exchange rate mechanism; and to enable the Bank of England to start acting
as an independent central bank.
The prime minister's lack of leadership extended, he continued, to the UK's
role in international affairs, most notably the future of the European
Community and the plight of the people of Somalia and of the former
Yugoslavia.
On party strategy, the subject most discussed this week, Mr Ashdown
applauded the decision on Wednesday that allows for dialogue and some joint
action with members of other parties, saying: 'It is the role of our party
to lead the process of working with others to assure the country's future.'
He also urged Liberal Democrats to become the 'opportunity party', in areas
such as education and housing.
While his speech pledged conditional support for Mr Major over the economic
crisis and over Maastricht, political realities were reflected in his light
attack on Labour for joining the government's 'summer slumber'.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Fudge and mudge alive and kicking: Alison Smith watches the
party's internal struggle for credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bird that represents the Liberal Democrats has this week in Harrogate
been allowed out of its pre-election cage to fly freely around the
conference hall.
It will be back on its perch before the next election, but made the most of
its freedom at this gathering.
Had the conference been immediately before an election, the discussion of
prostitution would have been stifled; a wider range of speakers would have
been paraded in front of the cameras; and the man who urged: 'Let us go
forward as trendsetters' would surely have been dissuaded from wearing a
cosy, patterned cardigan as he did so.
There was a change in Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, too. For him a
pre-election conference would have been one long photo-opportunity, and he
would not have made the slip of an unduly sharp tone in response to Mr David
Alton's impending departure from the party over its policy on abortion.
That issue was a classic example of the party grassroots seizing its chance
to debate subjects which, however important, are peripheral to mainstream
politics.
At times this has led to self-parody: discussing cruelty to animals and
holding nine separate votes while the UK economy goes through its most
turbulent 24 hours in recent years is no way to solve the party's
credibility problem.
The activists remain unmoved by the evident irritation of some of the
party's MPs at such antics.
The document prepared by the policy committee and hailed by Mr Ashdown as
charting the way forward to the next election manifesto, escaped the
ignominy of being sent back to the drawing board by just 13 votes, and may
be unrecognisable when it next sees the light of day.
The conference also threw out policy proposals to bring franchising of
services and stations to British Rail; and heavily qualified the party
managers' commitment to the market while underlining the party's commitment
to full employment.
It was not all bad news for the leadership, however. One new feature was the
co-operation between the parliamentary party and the Association of Liberal
Democrat Councillors (ALDC) to ensure that Wednesday's strategy debate did
not end in a debacle.
The blandly worded motion's acceptance of dialogue outside the party -
although not the promotion of such dialogue - together with comforting
clauses about the commitment to community politics owed much to a proposal
from the ALDC. It seemed a far cry from the call that went out from the SDP
to end the 'fudge and mudge' of British politics.
The alliance with the ALDC is worth a great deal to the leadership,
especially as only 20 members of the party are in the House of Commons.
While the 3,500 Liberal Democrat councillors very rarely make national
headlines, they are, some MPs believe, at least as influential within the
party as their representatives at Westminster.
The deal between the two groups got the party through the conference,
although failed to hide the divide between those who believe co-operation
with Labour is needed, and those who believe it is the last thing that is
needed.
Liberal Democrat activists can seem given to idealism rather than realism,
but it was Ms Clare Brooks, a veteran Liberal activist and councillor, who
came the closest to summing up accurately the position on dialogue and
deals.
'At the end of the day, the parliamentary party will do whatever they want
to do,' she said.
They will do so when they know what it is. At present, the party that prides
itself on facing up to the difficult questions confronting the UK seems not
to have faced up to its own future.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Trade deficit widens in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in exports in July led to the largest US trade deficit for
nearly two years, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
The deficit rose to Dollars 7.8bn compared with a shortfall of Dollars 6.7bn
in June.
This was the biggest deficit since November 1990 and a worrying indication
of the difficulty the US is having in balancing its external accounts,
despite a prolonged slowdown in the domestic economy.
The higher deficit mainly reflected a sharp fall in exports which declined
2.2 per cent to Dollars 37.3bn. US sales to depressed European markets were
down sharply.
However, analysts noted that a big fall in exports of civilian aircraft (a
volatile component of the figures on a monthly basis) accounted for much of
the overall decline. Aircraft sales surged in June.
US imports fell 0.6 per cent to Dollars 45.2bn, providing more evidence of
the weakness of the US economic recovery this summer. The trade deficit for
the first seven months of this year was Dollars 43.4bn against Dollars
36.1bn last year, indicating that several years of progress in reducing the
US external deficit has ground to a halt.
The poor trade figures are the latest in a series of economic jolts for the
Bush administration.
Figures earlier this week showed a 0.5 per cent decline in both retail sales
and industrial production in August. Consumer confidence and industrial
orders have also fallen recently.
The consensus view is still that the US economy is growing sluggishly at
about the 1.4 per cent annual rate registered in the second quarter.
However, some forecasters are growing more bearish.
Separate figures yesterday for state unemployment insurance claims also
pointed to stagnant economic conditions in the approach to the presidential
election in November.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Democratic challenger harried over his attitude to draft
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's re-election campaign yesterday increased the
virulence of its attacks on Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, for
having avoided the military draft 23 years ago.
Mr Bush's team, confronted by a fistful of polls showing the challenger
consolidating his lead, cited in evidence a document published in the very
conservative Washington Times newspaper yesterday and written by the former
commander of a reserve unit associated with the University of Arkansas.
Mr Clinton had communicated with the man in 1969 about his draft status.
In the document, dated ten days ago, Lt-Col Eugene Holmes wrote that he
believed Mr Clinton had 'purposely deceived me' by using the possibility of
joining the reserves 'as a ploy to work with the draft board and delay his
induction and get a new draft classification.'
Questioning the candidate's 'patriotism and integrity,' Lt-Col Holmes warned
of 'the imminent danger of a draft-dodger becoming US commander-in-chief.'
He concluded by saying that, because of ill-health, he would answer no more
questions on the matter.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said the document - published in
a newspaper deeply opposed to Mr Clinton and, though the spokesman denied
it, possibly furnished by the Bush campaign - went to 'the heart of why Bill
Clinton should not be president of the United States.'
This week, the draft issue has been the principal focus of what has
sometimes seemed an increasingly desperate Bush re-election strategy. There
is little hard evidence yet that it is paying dividends. The latest national
poll, out yesterday, for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News, has Mr Clinton
ahead 51:41 per cent, little changed from its previous survey but a smaller
margin than in most other surveys this week.
It found that doubts about Mr Clinton's character, though higher than
reservations about Mr Bush's, have not increased at all recently. Only about
half those polled were satisfied with his explanations about the draft, but
a higher percentage was unhappy with Mr Bush's denial of involvement in the
Iran-contra scandals.
A New York Times poll of Florida, the fourth largest state, found Mr Clinton
six points ahead, contradicting another poll published on Wednesday and
giving Mr Bush a seven-point margin in what has long been a Republican
stronghold in presidential elections.
All the polls suggest that concerns about the economy transcend by far
interest in the draft question and in the Republican emphasis on traditional
family values.
This latter point has also placed Mr Bush on the spot. He was expected
yesterday to veto the recently passed 'family leave' bill, requiring
companies with more than 50 employees to allow absence from work on
compassionate and other personal grounds without penalty.
He will soften this opposition by proposing tax credits for companies to
achieve the same end.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Israelis and Syrians jockey for position / A look at the
strategic importance of the commanding Golan Heights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU don't have to be any sort of military expert to see what excites both
Israel and Syria about the Golan Heights, the bone of contention between the
two enemies at the Middle East peace talks in Washington.
From the top of one of a string of volcanic outcrops that stand like
sentinels along the Israeli-held side of the ceasefire line, there is a
commanding panorama over the Syrian town of Kunetra across open plains
sweeping 60 km north-eastwards to Damascus. An Israeli tank could reach the
capital in a couple of hours, a most unsettling thought for Syria's leaders.
Equally, the heights form an imposing physical barrier guarding Israel's
north-eastern flank. Once down the western escarpment of the Golan, the way
is clear to control vital water resources of the Sea of Galilee and Jordan
River, and to run quickly across Galilee to the port of Haifa.
Israel has occupied the Golan since capturing them from Syria in the 1967
Six Day War. It nearly lost them to a Syrian tank assault in 1973, but
recovered and vowed never to relinquish its control.
Now, however, Syria's willingness to negotiate with Israel has posed an
unprecedented challenge to the hitherto unyielding Israeli determination, in
the words of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, 'never to go down from the Golan
Heights.' Before the latest round of peace talks now going on in Washington,
Mr Rabin himself caused uproar at home by saying it was clear that peace
with Syria would require 'some sort of territorial compromise' over the
Golan.
At the moment, Israel and Syria are only at the stage of negotiating a joint
statement of principles that would lead on to dealing with the central issue
of the Golan. But Mr Rabin will then have to reveal what compromise he has
in mind. So far, he has given no indication that he would concede the
long-standing Syrian demand that Israel withdraw from the entire territory.
However, unlike the other occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, there is no strong ideological argument among Israelis for holding on
to the Golan. Even most of the right-wing and religious Israeli nationalists
who have settled in the West Bank and Gaza do not regard the heights as part
of the biblical Land of Israel, or Eretz Israel, which must never be
relinquished on ideological grounds.
In fact, most of the 12,000 Jewish settlers in the Golan voted for Mr
Rabin's Labour party or its left-liberal allies in the June election. Most
are concerned that Israel should not give up the Golan and are organising a
'peace with the Golan' campaign.
Mr Rabin has publicly floated the idea of acknowledging Syrian sovereignty
over the Golan on a lease-back basis allowing Israelis to stay, but the
Syrians have dismissed it.
The key issue remains that of military security.
'Among serious Israeli military analysts there remains a consensus that the
Golan comprises vital strategic depth for Israel,' says Mr Joseph Alpher,
deputy head of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies.
'Even in the missile age, it is crucial to the defence of northern Israel.'
But Mr Alpher suggests this does not imply that Israel must maintain a
physical presence on the heights in the form of troops and tanks. He says
the emphasis should be on enlarging the strategic depth of the Golan area by
the establishment of a big demilitarised zone covering the heights and
surrounding territory.
'In terms of what the real security needs are, this is the real issue,' says
Mr Alpher.
Syrian officials yesterday said two-and-a-half hours of talks with Israel on
the Golan Heights issue had failed to make progress and that negotiations
were near deadlock, write our Middle East staff.
Mr Mouwafak al-Allaf, chief Syrian delegate to the talks, said there was 'no
progress whatsoever' in yesterday's talks, adding that he feared the Israeli
delegation 'did not come here with any authority to talk about peace and
talk about all the important elements and issues.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Saudi political reform move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KING FAHD, the Saudi Arabian ruler, has given a further important nudge to a
process of political reforms he began more than six months ago by appointing
the speaker for a proposed new Consultative Council.
The King yesterday named Sheikh Mohammed bin Ibrahim bin Jubeir, at present
the Kingdom's justice minister, as speaker to the 60-member council which
was announced, along with the promulgation of a new Basic Law for Saudi
Arabia, on March 1.
Mr Abdallah bin Mohammed al Sheikh is to replace Sheikh bin Jabeir in the
justice ministry.
Other members of the council, which will for the first time give non-royals
a say in running the affairs of Saudi Arabia, have yet to be named. However,
at least some of the 60 are understood already to have been selected.
Sheikh bin Jubeir is an expert in Islamic law and held the post of chairman
of the Grievances Council, a special court designed to expedite solution of
legal, contractual and financial disputes. He also helped draft the new
Sharia-based Basic Law.
A consultative council was originally promised more than 20 years ago by the
late King Feisal and the pledge was fulfilled only this year by King Fahd.
The new body will have no lawmaking teeth, but would have the ability of
summoning and questioning ministers, and would be able to hand legislation
back to the King for review.

INVESTMENT in Japanese manufacturing is tumbling under the weight of the
recession, according an extensive survey of investment intentions published
yesterday by the Japan Development Bank.
The survey of 2,326 large manufacturing companies found that planned
investment for the next six months would be 10.5 per cent down on last year
and 3.2 per cent lower than the first half of this year.
The bank forecast investment falls next year of a further 11.9 per cent as
manufacturers retreat from the ambitious spending plans of the late 1980s.
The economy's weak state, with manufacturing inventories rising despite
falling output and investment, will be confirmed today by figures for the
August money supply.
The consensus among Tokyo analysts is that the broad money measure M2 is
likely to grow by only 0.2 per cent. However, a minority of economists are
predicting the first-ever negative money supply growth.
Meanwhile, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association yesterday followed
the lead of the electronics industry by significantly downgrading estimates
of demand this year.
Mr Yutaka Kume, Nissan chairman and the association's president, said demand
for new cars would fall well below earlier growth forecasts of 1.1 per cent.
The fall raises prospects of the car industry joining electronics and steel
in calling for government subsidies.
Investment in the two industries is falling fast, according to the Japan
Development Bank survey, which found capital spending in electronics likely
to be 23.7 per cent down in the next six months, with investment in the car
industry likely to fall 13.6 per cent.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Election factor spurs trade war: Simon Davies and Simon
Holberton go behind the US-China dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HONG Kong business community's interest in an election 13,000km across
the Pacific contrasts with its somewhat apathetic response to the planting
of the seeds of democracy in its own front yard.
The importance of Hong Kong as a conduit for trade between the US and China
is such that the election of a US presidentcan have more impact on the Hong
Kong economy than the election of any localpolitician.
And the breakdown this week of talks between Washington and Beijing, aimed
at avoiding the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on a 'hit-list' of Chinese
goods, has heightened interest in the US election.
At stake is nearly 20 per cent, by value, of China's 1991 exports to the US.
Of last year's near USDollars 20bn of sales to the US, USDollars 13.3bn were
routed through Hong Kong and an unknown, but presumed large, percentage was
made by Hong Kong-owned factories in southern China.
'There is always a political and an economic imperative in trade disputes,'
says Mr Jim Walker, research director of Credit Lyonnais Securities. 'This
dispute is driven by a political imperative: the re-election of George
Bush.'
Many economists argue that, if the proposed hit-list on USDollars
3.9bn-worth of imports from China were to be applied, there would be far
more damage to Hong Kong than to China, which has a rapidly growing domestic
market.
The Hong Kong government issued an implicit warning to the US recently that
application of the hit-list, which could mean tariffs of up to 100 per cent,
would have a knock-on effect of USDollars 4.5bn on Hong Kong's trade.
There are fears the real impact could be worse. China is already threatening
to block a similar amount in US imports to China. According Mr Ian
MacFarlane, Wardley Investment Services chief economist, this would
eradicate a further HKDollars 500m in Hong Kong trade.
The Hong Kong government estimates that the territory would lose 16,000 jobs
and 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product as an immediate reaction to the
tariffs. The knock-on effect would be more severe.
Wardley claims that the secondary impact - loss of investment confidence,
tourism and business related to re-exports - would result in as much as 2
per cent being sliced off GDP in the following year; in 1993, that would
mean a loss of about HKDollars 14bn.
Hong Kong is the outlet for 80 per cent of Guangdong province's exports, and
about 75 per cent of products manufactured by Hong Kong companies are made
in Guangdong.
Given the escalation of the dispute, however, the atmosphere in Hong Kong is
surprisingly relaxed; nobody believes the colony will in fact be hit by the
full list of trade tariffs against China.
'There is a high probability that Hong Kong will have to brace itself for
some bad news, but I don't think it will be as bad as people are now
calculating,' says Mr MacFarlane. Other economists believe Hong Kong will
come out totally unscathed.
First, the US is pushing against a door the Chinese government wants to
open. Beijing is well aware that, if it is to achieve its aim of membership
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, its foreign trading regime
will have to conform to what Washington wants.
Chinese trade negotiators have already given US negotiators a substantial
list of product categories covered by import bans. It has agreed it will not
enforce 'secret' trade regulations, and will eliminate all import
substitution policies.
Second, although the Chinese currency is still officially pegged near Yn5.4
to the dollar, it is trading at nearly Yn7 in the officially-sanctioned
'swap' market. In the short term, at least, this sizeable devaluation ought
to be a boon to Chinese exports to the US, even if the trade talks fail and
tariffs are raised.
Then there is Mr Bush himself. Beijing does not like change and, in the
incumbent, it sees a US president who has kept economics and trade separate
from human rights. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic party's
presidential candidate, is an unknown quantity for China. The
responsibilities of office may lead a President Clinton to moderate his
anti-China rhetoric of the campaign trail, but China will not want to risk
that by harming the electoral chances of the only friend it has in
Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S stock market plunged 6.1 per cent after leading investors defaulted
on TDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 35.6m) of payments to local brokerages for share
purchases, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The defaults, disclosed by the stock exchange late on Wednesday, appeared to
be linked to the arrest of Mr Oung Ta-ming, a textile tycoon, last week over
a Dollars 22m stock scandal, Taiwan's biggest.
Brokers said the market plunge could trigger a chain of larger defaults in
coming days. 'There is a collapse of confidence because Oung is the most
important player in the market. It's hard to predict how bad the situation
will get,' said Mr Hong Chi-ming of Top Soon Portfolio Securities.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said it would investigate the reason
for the defaults. Stock exchange officials said as many as eight investors
had failed to make payments totalling TDollars 1.7bn to six brokerages.
But another leading player, Mr Lei Po-lung, who was not named among the
eight, told newspapers he was responsible for the defaults. Big speculators
often use other investors to trade stocks for them. The newspapers quoted Mr
Lei as saying he bought stocks on behalf of the Hualon group, which Oung
heads, and Hualon then declined to provide money for the purchases.
The stock market's weighted index plummeted 222.83 points to a 20-month low
of 3,441.69.

FT  18 SEP 92 / HK bows to China over finance for new airport

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL reality intruded into Hong Kong's plans to build a new airport
yesterday, when the colonial government walked away from its previous
proposals to fund the project and accepted China's solution.
To placate China, the government will commit HKDollars 40bn (Pounds 2.7bn)
in new equity to the project - taking the total public sector contribution
to the HKDollars 163.7bn project from Dollars HK80.4bn to HKDollars 120.4bn
 -and in the process virtually eradicating the need for debt.
Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, has sanctioned this offer -
presented to Beijing on Wednesday - without any guarantee that the Chinese
will accept it.
As his officials were quick to point out yesterday, it is a Chinese offer
the government had agreed to. But there are enough changes to the Chinese
idea - not the least being a doubling of the amount of new equity - for them
to cavil.
'It's just a matter of facing reality,' said one official. 'And we have the
money.'
The government's acceptance of the Chinese plan - which allows for the use
of funds from land sales to be ploughed into the project - underlined a
growing concern within the administration about the need to get China's
agreement.
A big contract expires in November and costs would rise if it needs to be
re-tendered.
For the past six months, colonial officials have been saying that the
proposals they presented to China in the spring were the most cost-effective
and efficient way to build an airport and connecting railway to serve Hong
Kong well into the 21st century.
These initial proposals called on the government to provide two public
corporations with only a modest amount of up-front equity - HKDollars 16.6bn
 -to support a maximum of HKDollars 73bn of debt.
Yesterday the government said it would increase its equity contribution to
the airport by Dollars HK25bn and the railway corporation by Dollars HK15bn.
This will allow the debt the corporations would have to incur to fall to a
maximum of HKDollars 22.9bn.
The reduction in debt goes a long way to answering the concerns of China
which - domestic Hong Kong politics aside - has always been alarmed by the
level of borrowings the project was expected to carry.
Acceptance of the Chinese offer left some in Hong Kong's financial community
feeling slightly queasy. As a banker noted: 'It just doesn't make sense.
Borrowing costs are low and the financial package as constructed was
bankable.'
Local politicians also expressed concern about Mr Patten's augmented
proposal to the Chinese. Mr Stephen Poon, a conservative, said he had doubts
about the equity injection for the airport, given that the old plan was
considered 'cost-effective'.
Mr Lee Wing Tak, the Democrat's spokesman, pointed to the possibility that
the increased land sales - 62 hectares in all - needed to raise the equity
for the project would have a downward effect on land prices and hence, total
government revenue.
But as Mr Lee said, Mr Patten's reply represents a 'political compromise
rather than economic considerations'.
Now all Mr Patten has to do is wait and see if China will accept this
victory or ask for more.

FT  18 SEP 92 / National pride stands in the way of Kuriles talks / A look
at the row between Russia and Japan over disputed islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON AND STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE granting this week of a 50-year lease to a Hong Kong company to develop
part of Shikotan, one of the remote Kurile islands off the Japanese coast,
will do nothing to help resolve a territorial dispute which is poisoning
relations between Russia and Japan.
The row may escalate if reports are confirmed that an Austrian company might
build a golf course on Kunishir, another of the islands.
Both countries have much to lose by failure to settle a dispute that has
become mainly a question of national pride and which led to the abrupt
cancellation last week of a visit to Japan by President Boris Yeltsin.
Russia has all but lost an opportunity for large-scale economic aid, which
Japan has said it will only grant if it gets back the four islands it calls
its Northern Territories.
Japan's goal of climbing out of its shell to play a bigger role in world
affairs looks impossible if it cannot overcome an obsessive dispute with a
close neighbour.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said one positive result of
the cancellation of talks was that both sides now had an incentive to think
hard about how to break the deadlock.
But after such brusque treatment, the Japanese are finding it difficult to
conceal the hurt. A foreign ministry official complained of questions of
'national honour' and 'injustice done to the Japanese'.
And Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, said of President
Yeltsin: 'If his official remarks cannot be trusted, I don't know what can.'
He was responding to Mr Yeltsin's statements that the visit had been called
off because of Japanese inflexibility rather than the 'domestic problems'
cited to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister.
In fact, President Yeltsin appeared to have caved in to nationalist pressure
not to give back any territory.
Although the Soviet Union took several pieces of territory from the Japanese
in the closing days of the second world war, Tokyo has limited its demands
to Iturup, Kunishir, Shikotan and Hobbemai.
This is because despite several exchanges of territories this century, only
these islands have always been part of Japan and only their fate has been
left to be settled by a post-war agreement.
In 1951, the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed by Japan and the US but
shunned by Stalin, stipulated that Japan renounced all claim on the
'Kuriles'. The Japanese say this never meant the Northern Territories but
the 18 other islands forming the Kurile chain.
But the really weighty argument in favour of Russia returning at least two
of the islands is the joint declaration of 1956, where the two sides agreed
that Russia would hand over Hobbemai (an uninhabited group of islets) and
Shikotan on the signing of a peace treaty. The fate of the others was to be
negotiated subsequently.
But while Mr Yeltsin may be willing to reaffirm the 1956 agreement, the
issue has been seized on by an unholy alliance of neo-communists and Russian
nationalists who accused him of planning a sellout of national interests.
Against this background, Japan's demands for Russian recognition of its
sovereignty over all four islands - presented by Tokyo as a concession after
initially seeking their immediate handover - were doomed from the start.

US SPECIAL prosecutor Lawrence Walsh announced yesterday the end of his long

presidency and is still causing political problems for President George
Bush, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Walsh, in letters to the special court that appointed him nearly six
years ago and to Attorney-General William Barr, said no more criminal
charges were expected.
Mr Walsh investigated the White House-run operation to sell arms to Iran in
1985-86, in an attempt to win the release of US hostages in Lebanon.
The other part of the covert operation involved diverting profits from the
Iran arms sales to provide weapons to the Nicaraguan contra rebels while US
military aid to them was outlawed by Congress.

R J REYNOLDS Tobacco International has acquired a controlling interest in
two of Ukraine's four tobacco factories and promised to expand production.
RJR hopes that, with its 70 per cent interest in the Lviv tobacco factory in
western Ukraine and in the Kremenchuh tobacco factory in the south-central
area of the country, it will be able to supply more than one-quarter of the
80bn cigarettes Ukraine's 52m people smoke annually.
The deal will make RJR, which already produces cigarettes in St Petersburg,
the largest producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States and
represents a wider attempt by the company to expand into east Europe and the
former Soviet Union, where smoking is still fashionable.
'It should be recognised that in eastern Europe and the CIS, total cigarette
consumption is about 700bn units and represents a major potential market,'
said Mr Thomas Marsh, RJR's regional president. 'I can assure you that RJR
is not the only company which has recognised this.'
These are tough times for tobacco companies in North America and western
Europe, and RJR, which produces two of the 10 best-selling cigarette brands,
has been under attack from the non-smoking lobby. By contrast, RJR
executives have received a warm reception from Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the
Ukrainian president. 'Most people smoke and get great pleasure from
smoking,' he said. Mr Kravchuk apologetically conceded that he was a
non-smoker but hastened to add: 'My son is an enthusiastic smoker.'
In turn, Mr Marsh praised Mr Kravchuk's commitment to 'very rapid movement
to a free market' and said that the speed with which the Ukrainian
government negotiated the joint venture has encouraged RJR Tobacco's parent
company, RJR Nabisco, to invest in food processing in Ukraine.
Mr Serhi Boriak, a part-time economic adviser to the Ukrainian president,
who was hired as a consultant by RJR for the deal, said RJR was able to
negotiate the agreement so swiftly by avoiding ministerial structures and
working directly through the president.
A Ukrainian official said RJR acquired its stakes in exchange for a Dollars
4m investment in new equipment in each factory.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Clinton pressed to seek Nafta changes
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN intense debate within the camp of Governor Bill Clinton is likely to
delay the response of the Democratic presidential candidate to Republican
taunts that he is 'waffling' in his support of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
It is reported that the candidate is being urged, by some of his political
advisers, to adopt the line of Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic leader in the
House of Representatives. He has said the Nafta must be returned to the
negotiating table, to strengthen environmental and labour provisions, or the
pact will be rejected in Congress next year.
These advisers are said to be nervously eyeing opinion poll data that show
the governor's support soft among blue-collar workers in the key states of
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, who fear their jobs will go south to
Mexicans.
They could stay home on election day or cast a protest vote for Mr Ross
Perot, the Texas billionaire who has withdrawn from the presidential race
but is still on the ballot in some states as an independent candidate.
Mr Clinton is already facing criticism for having endorsed fuel efficiency
standards, which the US car industry claims will cost thousands of jobs.
Many of the governor's liberal farm and labour supporters believe the pact
must be renegotiated to produce stronger, enforceable job and environmental
protection.
His more moderate business backers have been assuring him that the
weaknesses in the Nafta's relevant provisions can be rectified by
'implementing legislation' written in Congress, and that the pact need not
be sent back for further work.
One of the key issues is a US-Mexico cross-border tax on imports, which is
opposed by the US administration. Various leading Democrats have suggested
the tax would pay for environmental and worker-adjustment programmes. This
would be likely to require additional talks with the Mexicans.
There has been close co-ordination between the Clinton campaign and
Congressional Democrats, who have strongly rebuked President George Bush for
'politicising' the Nafta, which was developed with bi-partisan support.
The pact was sent to Congress on Wednesday so the governor has time to claim
he is studying the details.
Although one of his trade specialists said he need not take a position until
driven to it by the first presidential campaign debate (if any), others in
the campaign expect a decision by Mr Clinton by the end of the month.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL telephone traffic grew by 13 per cent last year, according to
a report to be published next week by the London-based International
Institute of Communications.
Falling international telephone charges and a rise in the volume of
non-business calling across frontiers helped partially to counteract the
effect of recession. About 35bn minutes of international telephone calls
were made during 1991.
The market shares of leading telephone companies grew at widely different
rates, reflecting the impact of competition unleashed in some countries in
the 1980s.
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US carrier, handled 6.6bn
minutes of outgoing traffic - up 7.8 per cent compared with 1990. By
contrast, traffic handled by its main rivals, MCI and Sprint, grew 35.1 per
cent to 1.6bn minutes, and 25.3 per cent to 723m minutes, respectively.
International traffic via British Telecom grew by only 1.9 per cent to 2.2bn
minutes. The traffic base of Cable and Wireless, whose Mercury
Communications subsidiary is BT's main competitor, grew 28.6 per cent to
1.7bn minutes.
The report provides a measure of the extent of integration among the
European Community's economies. Of all international calls made in the EC in
1991, 55 per cent went to other EC countries and 11 per cent to the rest of
Europe.
The US deficit on international traffic, which has provoked a number of
trade disputes in recent years, grew by a further 18 per cent last year to
3.2bn minutes.

TALKS on Bosnia-Hercegovina's future open in Geneva today in an attempt to
formulate a lasting political settlement and allow refugees to return home.
However, the talks have no time limit and no agenda other than some basic
principles laid down at the London Conference on the former Yugoslavia last
month.
Mr Martti Ahtisaari, head of Finland's foreign service called in by the
United Nations, will chair the closed-door negotiations involving
representatives of the mainly Moslem Bosnian government and the Serb and
Croatian factions. UN officials said yesterday they still expected all three
sides to turn up, despite another threat from Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the
Bosnian president, to boycott the talks while Bosnian Serb forces continue
air attacks against government-held towns.
Leaders of the three factions last week promised Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen, co-chairmen of the joint UN/EC Geneva conference on former Yugoslavia,
that they would attach no preconditions to attending the talks. Earlier this
week Mr Izetbegovic withdrew a similar threat, agreeing to send Mr Haris
Silajdzic, Bosnian foreign minister. The Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic,
his deputy, Mr Nikola Koljevic, and the Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban, will
also be in Geneva.
The London conference stipulated that any long-term Bosnian settlement must
entail respect for existing borders, unless changed by mutual agreement, the
return of territory seized by force, the right of refugees to return home
and protection for minorities. With the EC's 'cantonisation' plan now off
the agenda, Mr Vance and Lord Owen have given Mr Ahtisaari a free hand to
broker any political solution compatible with the principles of the London
conference. But officials warn that the talks, if they do not break down,
are likely to be prolonged.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, will meet
representatives of the three Bosnian factions in Geneva today, in the hope
of securing assurances on the safety of relief flights into Sarajevo to
enable the airlift to restart. Suspension of the airlift a fortnight ago,
after an Italian cargo aircraft was downed by a missile, has left the
Bosnian capital short of essential supplies and prevented the planned
build-up of winter stockpiles for up to 1m people in central and southern
Bosnia.
Mr Ron Redmond, a UNHCR spokesman, said Mrs Ogata hoped to be able to
recommend a restart of the air bridge later today; flights could resume this
weekend if donor-governments agreed. However, with Bosnian Serb forces
stepping up their air bombardments this week, Mrs Ogata wants the personal
assurances of all Bosnian political leaders that the UN airlift can be
resumed in safety.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Panic feels pressure of diehards: Serb nationalists are
becoming more radical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER confidence vote is being threatened against the federal Yugoslav
prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, in a move which could further weaken his
already fragile position in the federation.
The threat came from senior nationalist members of Serbia's ruling Socialist
party after Mr Panic yesterday suggested to his cabinet that the smaller
Yugoslavia lodge a fresh application for membership of the United Nations.
Mr Panic earlier this week received a commitment from both Moscow and Peking
that they would support the application. But Serbia's Socialist party argues
that Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, has an automatic
right to the seat since it is the legal successor of the former Yugoslavia.
Yesterday, UN and European Community diplomats said the new Yugoslavia, as
yet, has not the right to claim that status. Mr Borisav Jovic, an ardent
critic of Mr Panic and a close supporter of Serbian president, Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, said the prime minister, by discussing the UN issue with the
Yugoslav government and not the federal parliament, was by-passing his
powers.
But western diplomats yesterday said this was a pretext for further
undermining Mr Panic, who is viewed as one of the few Serb politicians with
whom the UN and the EC can negotiate. 'This is precisely the danger. We
cannot make Panic into another Gorbachev - with lots of international
support, but no domestic backing,' an EC diplomat said. 'The west should
help Panic by lifting the sanctions,' said one of Mr Panic's advisers.
The UN remains determined not to lift the sanctions. 'If the sanctions are
not lifted, then Panic might fall,' his adviser added, conceding that Mr
Milosevic could gain either way.
'This is Balkan politics. If some of the sanctions are lifted, Milosevic can
claim victory by saying his firm stance showed the west that Serbia had a
case all along. If they are not, then Milosevic can kick Panic out,' another
adviser to the prime minister explained.
He added that the west should impose sanctions on Croatia, since it has
seized a swathe of territory in Bosnia-Hercegovina, undermining the UN.
Public support remains dogged for Mr Milosevic. 'To put it simply. If the
west wants Milosevic out, we will support Milosevic. We don't want to be
dictated to by the west,' said Mr Jovan Zivanovic, a car mechanic.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey points to top read in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fifth Pan European Survey (PES), the largest survey of the reading
habits of professional and business executives from 16 west European
countries, publicly available today , shows that National Geographic
magazine is by far the most popular read from a basket of 380 newspapers and
magazines, including 19 international titles.
The survey questioned 8,000 men and women - selected from an initial sample
of 26,000 - aged between 25 and 64, who satisfied at least one of the
following criteria on an annual basis: a minimum gross personal income of
Pounds 22,000; six or more business trips by air; director of an
establishment with 25 or more employees; or possessed a higher degree.
Another common factor was that four out of five use the English language.
Sponsored by The Economist, Financial Times, International Herald Tribune,
News-week, Scientific American and Time magazine, the study thus claims to
have tapped into the reading preferences of the 5.7m people who fall into
those categories.
Among the findings of the study are:
International publications have increased their share of this particular
readership from 29 per cent in 1981 to 34 per cent today.
Since the last PES survey in 1988, the Financial Times has expanded its
readership to 292,000 from 264,000; the International Herald Tribune has
shrunk from 74,000 to 72,000; and the European edition of the Wall Street
Journal has almost doubled its readership, from 34,000 to 62,000.
Over the same period, Time magazine has maintained its leadership position,
growing from 261,000 readers in 1988 to 313,000 currently, followed by The
Economist, up from 210,000 to 263,000.
National Geographic leads the readership table of the 19 international
publications considered, with 592,000, followed by L'Express (346,000), Time
(313,000) and in fourth place the Financial Times.

FT  18 SEP 92 / France and Italy urge EC to fight mafia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Italy will today call for increased co-operation between EC
members to fight organised crime in Europe under the banner of the
Maastricht treaty.
At a special meeting of interior and justice ministers, the French and
Italians will propose the immediate establishment of a working group
specialising in the fight against the mafia.
They will also call for harmonisation of criminal law in member states to
make international co-operation and crime-busting easier, and acceleration
of the establishment of Europol, a pan-European criminal intelligence
agency.
The ministers of the 12 are also likely to talk about how to handle the
influx of refugees from the former Yugoslav republics, but the meeting will
mostly be devoted to crime-fighting in the EC.
Britain, which holds the EC presidency, arranged the extra meeting at the
request of the Italian and French justice ministers, following the
assassination of Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino, two anti-mafia
judges in Sicily.
The timing is particularly felicitous for the French government, faced with
a close vote Sunday on the Maastricht treaty. The spread of organised crime
across open EC borders is a spectre raised by No campaigners in France.
'The French were quick to spot that it wouldn't be at all bad if they could
demonstrate that when serious things happen in this area, the 12 rally round
and do something,' said one senior EC official.
As if to underline the point, the Franco-Italian document places great
emphasis on the advantages of inter-governmental co-operation under the
treaty. 'Europeans now have the institutional resources to reinforce
co-operation in justice and police matters on the basis of the Maastricht
treaty,' it says.
Immigration and judicial policy is one of the two 'pillars' of the
Maastricht treaty in which the influence of the European Commission and the
Court of Justice would be limited or non-existent. It would probably survive
even if the rest of the agreement fell apart.
A computer replacing 60m documents will connect customs officers across the
Community as of January 1 1993, Reuter adds.
The Customs Information System network, set to go live in October, will
allow customs offices to send encoded messages about suspected drug
smuggling, fraudulent export certificates and illegal trafficking in arms,
endangered species or cultural treasures.
The system is aimed at goods coming from or going to third countries, not
those moving within the EC.

FT  18 SEP 92 / German right-wing extremists 'no danger'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alexander von Stahl, the German advocate general, asserted that
right-wing militant organisations did not represent a danger to Germany
despite the wave of attacks against asylum-seekers.
Mr von Stahl said no organisational structure could be detected among the
largely young German assailants. Instead, the assaults on foreigners were
frequently 'locally, spontaneously and often very alcoholically motivated,'
he suggested.
Mr von Stahl's controversial remarks contradicted persistent indications
that right-wing groups in east and west Germany had managed to influence a
considerable number of young east German extremists.
German police yesterday arrested seven neo-Nazis and issued arrest warrants
for six more after raiding more than 100 homes to crack down on rightist
violence.
Heinz Wolf, police chief in the eastern German state of Saxony, said the
raids on Wednesday by more than 500 policemen yielded a large haul of
illegal weapons and racist pamphlets.
He said the raids were made after investigations into attacks on foreigners
by rightist youths, many of them skinheads. Those arrested were accused of
breach of the peace, arson and grievous bodily harm.
Youths in the east German port city of Wismar in the state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern attacked a hostel for asylum-seekers late on
Wednesday for the third night in succession. Police took eight persons into
temporary custody. Unidentified persons threw a Molotov cocktail against a
hostel for asylum-seekers in Zemitz, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, but guards were
able to extinguish the blaze quickly.
The interior ministry yesterday said Romania had agreed to take back its
citizens who fail to prove they suffered political persecution at home. The
statement said Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters has been seeking agreements
with the main countries involved to take back their citizens if they fail to
win asylum in Germany.
Until now, rejected refugees were allowed to appeal the decision and in
practice remained in Germany for years. Sixty per cent of the 43,000
Romanians who came to Germany from January to the end of August were gypsies
but only 0.2 per cent of them have been granted asylum.

CARITAS, the Roman Catholic charitable agency, says it has been assured by
the mayor of Vienna that the city will re-open its hostels to Bosnian
refugees within a few days.
Mr Helmut Schuler, director of Caritas in Austria, said he accepted the
city's decision last Friday to close its crowded hostels temporarily.
Attempts were being made to send more refugees to provincial cities and to
find suitable winter accommodation for many of those already in Vienna.
Mr Schuler feared that some politicians would use the refugee-related
troubles in Germany as an excuse to prolong the closure. If so, Caritas
would continue to put pressure on the government. 'It is impossible to say
that we cannot accept real refugees,' he said.
He pointed out that the situation in Austria was not comparable to that in
Germany. Half the 50,000 Bosnian refugees in Austria were staying with
friends or relatives, and another 25 per cent were in the homes of private
citizens.
Bosnian refugees arriving in Vienna now faced a 'confused' situation'. The
city's hostels were turning them away but charitable organisations were
trying to find shelter for everyone.
Mr Schuler was critical of other western European countries for not taking
more refugees.
The Danish minority government faced a critical situation in the Folketing
last night, where it appeared to be in danger of defeat over a proposal to
send just under 200 Danish soldiers to the former Yugoslavia to help protect
UN food convoys, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The opposition Social Democratic party was insisting that the government
could only send volunteers, a restriction which Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
foreign minister in the Conservative-Liberal minority government, described
as 'totally unacceptable'.
The parties were last night trying to find a formula which could satisfy
both sides, but if these efforts fail, a combination of the Social
Democratic party, the Radical party and the left-wing Socialist People's
party was prepared to defeat the government.
The concluding debate on the government proposal was due to start late last
night, but Folketing officials said that in view of the critical situation,
the debate could be postponed until today.

FT  18 SEP 92 / In search of a crime rate mechanism: Justice ministers'
talks about policing the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE in the 1990s is proving easier for the criminal than for the forces
of law and order.
That is the disquieting message for the meeting today in Brussels of EC
justice ministers, who will discuss the growing threat of organised crime,
among other security issues such as extradition and harmonisation of
national laws.
The meeting was requested by Italy, which recently has felt most threatened
by the increasing power of organised crime and the willingness of the
Sicilian mafia to challenge the government.
But the Italians are not alone in ringing alarm bells. Germany's interior
ministry recently warned that the planned scrapping of EC border controls at
the start of next year, with political changes in eastern Europe, could lead
to an upsurge in drug-related crime in Europe.
In London, Mr Douglas Tweddle, chief investigation officer of UK Customs and
Excise, also warned that the relaxation of customs controls will widen
opportunities for criminality in other spheres such as tax and excise fraud.
Supporters of Europol, the planned criminal intelligence agency, see it as a
symbol of growing co-operation within Europe in the face of a criminal
fraternity which, as one senior police officer put it, 'does not respect
boundaries'.
However, Europol continues to generate debate and division about where it
should have its permanent offices and about the scope and scale of its
future operations. This is a debate that would bring a knowing smile to any
Eurosceptic - all to do with issues of sovereignty, accountability and,
ultimately, of power.
The initial idea mooted by the Germans last year was that Europol should be
based at the German police BKN headquarters at Wiesbaden and should
transform itself as soon as possible into a European version of the American
FBI.
Wiesbaden is central in Europe and already has sophisticated intelligence
systems, but the German idea provoked immediate resistance from other EC
members, which considered this would not only concentrate political power in
Germany, but also prove impractical in terms of existing national law.
Britain would prefer that the Europol offices be based on more neutral
political soil, either at Strasbourg or next to the Interpol offices at
Lyons.
However, some in the community question Interpol's political accountability.
The agency serves more than 154 subscribing countries, and the view persists
that some of these should be kept well away from sensitive European
intelligence.
Italy and the Netherlands have been pressing to have Europol on their
territories, while France appears happy with Strasbourg.
EC member states, meanwhile, are far from agreed on what Europol should do,
if and when it gets off the ground by its target date, January 1 1993.
Within the UK, senior police officers such as Sir Roger Birch, chief
constable of Sussex and chairman of the UK police's international affairs
committee, have argued that Europol risks duplication of information.
Also, they say national data protection laws continue to limit the exchange
of information that might be useful in tracking international criminals.
Meanwhile, the attitude of signatories to arrangements for 'hot pursuit'
across frontiers and extradition requests is still far from harmonious,
often exacerbated by rivalries between police organisations and intelligence
agencies.
A basic problem is how increased co-operation in information can be
translated, first, into the arrest of criminals and, second, into their
conviction under relatively consistent judicial procedures.
International criminals - whose names are known to police, customs officers
and intelligence agencies - can hide behind shell companies, nominees and
expendable lieutenants. This is why the Italians, in particular, are anxious
for the Europeans to accept in law the concept of conviction on the basis of
membership of a criminal organisation.
In many European legal systems, such a concept is difficult to establish;
even in Italy, courts have been divided. Even so, as crime syndicates become
increasingly transnational, it is becoming more urgent to establish criteria
mutually acceptable to the EC governments for the prosecution of such
organisations.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Russians set for doubling in the price of oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES for oil on the Russian domestic market will double in the next few
days following the signing of a decree by Mr Boris Yeltsin, in an attempt to
provide increased income to the hard-pressed oil producers.
Mr Alexei Ulukayev, the government's economic adviser, said yesterday after
a meeting of the Russian cabinet that the move would add about 20 - 25 per
cent to annual inflation. Mr Seregei Vassiliev, head of the Centre for
Economic Reform, said earlier this week that inflation was presently running
at more than 20 per cent a month.
The price rise would bring the price of oil - presently trading at between
Rbs1,800 and Rbs2,200 a tonne - up to Rbs4,000-Rbs5,000. This would mean
fixing the state price at the price presently obtained in the oil exchanges.
Coal prices are also expected to rise by 30 per cent - an increase largely
caused by the government's agreement to pay increased wages to the
industrially powerful miners.
Production of oil, Russia's main hard currency export, is forecast to fall
again this year from last year's levels of 460m tonnes to 395m tonnes. Mr
Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, said that the lack of investment in
the industry would mean a further 50m tonne fall in 1993.
However, the need to provide extra funds to the oil sector means a further
squeeze on consumers, already experiencing a sharp drop in living standards.
Mr Ulukayev sought to reassure the public by saying that gas and electricity
prices would not go up, and that supplies of oil for heating during the
coming winter were higher than the previous year.
Further evidence of the deepening crisis in the government's finances came
yesterday from Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the acting head of the Russian
central bank, who told the Itar-Tass news service that the government had
received only 40 per cent of its planned income in the first eight months of
the year.
He said: 'It's possible we will be forced to stop spending as in the budget
and limit ourselves to the money we receive.' One recent estimate of the
budget deficit stands at Rbs950bn.
Mr Vassiliev said that tax revenues were not coming in at the rate planned,
while expected revenues from privatisation are running at less than a
quarter of the levels planned. However, he placed much of the blame for the
gathering financial crisis on Mr Gerashchenko, and on his policy of granting
credits to enterprises and other former Soviet republics.
Preparations are now being made for the first state visit to Britain by Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
Mr Yeltsin is keen to undertake the visit, which is planned for November
9-11, though a final decision has not yet been taken by the Russian side and
British officials yesterday would not confirm that the visit would
definitely take place.
However, plans are being finalised for the trip which would combine a visit
to the Queen, a banquet in the City's Guildhall, with meetings with the
prime minister and senior ministers.
The visit is timed to coincide with Britain's turn in the chair of the
European Community, though the trip will also focus on bilateral issues
between the two countries.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the industry secretary, will visit Moscow at the end
of this month with British business leaders in order to explore the
possibilities of increased commercial contacts.
Mrs Gillian Shepherd, the employment secretary, has just completed a working
visit in which she discussed UK aid to the fledgling and under-funded
Russian employment service with Russian ministers.
Western creditor nations should be able to reach an agreement on
rescheduling Russia's external debt by the end of this month, or at any rate
early in October, a senior US official said yesterday, writes George Graham
in Washington.
Mr David Mulford, US treasury under-secretary in charge of international
affairs, said Russian debt would be discussed at tomorrow's meeting of
finance ministers of the Group of Seven, with the hope of settling the
framework for a rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor countries. 'We
hope to be able to do a Paris Club by the end of this month, or if not then,
very shortly thereafter,' he said.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Devaluation leaves most
unaffected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY SPECULATORS have made a killing, the government has lost face, but for
most people this week's devaluation of the pound on the foreign exchanges
makes little difference. At least for now.
There will be some immediate winners and losers among the general public.
Those people lucky enough to be sitting on an uncashed dollar or D-Mark
cheque will have made overnight windfall gains as a result of Wednesday's
sterling devaluation. People planning foreign trips will now find that their
holiday savings buy fewer beers by the beach.
But for the majority of people there are no immediate harmful effects and
some goods news too.
The chilling prospect of a rise in mortgage interest rates has receded.
Wednesday's rise in interest rates, as the government attempted to defend
the value of sterling against foreign exchange dealers, has been reversed.
Indeed, life outside the exchange rate mechanism may allow single-digit
interest rates in Britain before long, were the government to choose to
postpone its proposed re-entry into the ERM.
Meanwhile, the domestic purchasing power of the incomes and savings of
ordinary people will initially be little changed by Wednesday's events. Some
importers may react by raising their prices immediately. But the impact of
the fall in the foreign exchange market value of sterling does not mean - as
Mr Harold Wilson pointed out in his prime ministerial broadcast after the
1967 devaluation - 'that the pound here in Britain - in your pocket or purse
or in your bank - has been devalued'.
The most important, if least obvious, initial effect of the devaluation of
sterling is its impact on the competitiveness of UK exporters. The impact of
the fall in the sterling exchange rate should boost the profitability of
British exporters of internationally traded goods over the coming year.
The 7 per cent devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark means that
exporters, by leaving the foreign currency prices of their goods unchanged,
can boost their sterling margins. The rise in industrial profitability,
towards European levels, should make manufacturing in the UK more attractive
and help to close Britain's trade deficit - unless, that is, sterling's
devaluation is followed by a renewed burst of domestic wage and price
inflation. That has certainly been the British experience in the quarter of
a century since Mr Wilson's apparently reassuring words.
At home, a pound is now worth little over a tenth of its 1967 value. Its
purchasing power has fallen by 89 per cent since the beginning of that year.
So a pound earned in 1967 would buy only 10p worth of goods at today's
prices, as the upper chart shows.
The fall in the international purchasing power of sterling has been almost
as severe. A pound would buy Dollars 2.80 worth of goods in the US at the
beginning of 1967. Since then the pound has depreciated by 36 per cent
against the dollar to Dollars 1.78, while the fall in the dollar's domestic
purchasing power is 77 per cent. As a result, the US purchasing power of a
1967 pound has fallen by 85 per cent.
The fall of the purchasing power of a UK pound in Germany has been sharper.
Germany has had a slower rate of consumer price inflation - the domestic
purchasing power of a D-Mark has fallen by 59 per cent since 1967 - but the
depreciation of the value of sterling has been 76.2 per cent. So the overall
purchasing power of a pound in Germany has fallen by 90 per cent.
The devaluation of sterling on the foreign exchanges means that the amount
of foreign goods that a pound sterling buys has been eroded further. But if
the fall in the value of sterling is once more followed by higher UK price
inflation, then the gains in competitiveness will also disappear.
One reason for resisting calls for a devaluation was that British
manufacturers were not uncompetitive in international markets. But even if a
rise in the profitability of exporters is needed, a devaluation might not
deliver that.
The government has argued that the beneficial effects of a devaluation tend
to disappear within two years as employers and workers increase their wages
rather than expand capacity.
Will the combination of still high interest rates and rising unemployment
damp these inflationary pressures? If not, then this sterling devaluation
will be no different from any other.

DON'T mention it, commanded Lyn Martin, as the conversation turned to the
events of the past two days.
Lyn and her husband Tony head the FT's family of floating voters. From their
home in Solihull, West Midlands, they watched the spring election campaign
and then went their different ways in the polling booth. Lyn voted
Conservative while Tony voted Liberal Democrat.
Now Lyn is having second thoughts although, she said yesterday, 'you can

STERLING is a notable absentee from the statistical grid issued yesterday by
the Bank of England showing the new Exchange Rate Mechanism bands.
Although both the Italian lira and sterling were suspended from the ERM, the
lira is included in the grid. A Bank official said: 'The Italians insisted
that they remain in the grid at their old central rate.'
A footnote to the grid explains that the Italian monetary authorities are
ignoring the bands, in terms of their exchange rate intervention policy, for
the time being.

THE formal launch of the ProShare Association, the new movement to encourage
wider share ownership, has been postponed because of the financial crisis,
Philip Coggan writes. The launch was due to have been held next Wednesday.
ProShare was set up in February with financial backing from the Department
of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange and 20 industrial and commercial
companies.
Mr Geoffrey Mandrell, ProShare's chief executive, said 'We are ready to
launch the association. However, as the UK economy is entering uncharted
territory we have to allow the short-term issues to be resolved. As soon as
things have quietened down a bit, we will launch the association.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: What the economists have to say
now
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERRY HOLTHAM, Shearson Lehman
A cut in interest rates won't necessarily lead to higher growth if the US
experience is anything to go by.  High household debt and a weak housing
market will still act as a constraint.  The only way the government can do
anything about the situation is either to allow inflation to rise - not
really a viable option - or to take over some of the private debt and not to
worry about the PSBR.  Ultimately the government has to wait until Sunday to
see what happens and then try to construct a sane European macro-economic
policy.
*****
PAUL CHERTKOW, UBS Phillips and Drew
The main aim for Britain is to stimulate recovery under an independent Bank
of England. The government should cut interest rates immediately to 9 per
cent and then by further steps to 7 per cent by the end of the year. That
would mean sterling floating to around DM2.50 - a level which would see
investor support for the currency because recovery prospects would look an
awful lot better. As for the exchange rate mechanism the whole system seems
to be in danger of collapse. There is no certainty about the system any
more.
*****
ROGER BOOTLE, Greenwell Montagu
abandon any idea of returning to the exchange rate mechanism. It should
adopt a policy of setting interest rates with regard to domestic economic
conditions and let the exchange rate do what it wants. An appropriate level
for interest rates would be 6 per cent. At this level I don't think the
pound would be dramatically lower and the inflationary consequences of this
strategy would be comparatively minor. I cannot think of circumstances
better suited to successful devaluation than the ones at the moment.
*****
PETER SPENCER, Kleinworts
I would not touch the exchange rate mechanism with a bargepole unless the
French vote very positively for economic and monetary union. I would go for
a system of free floating exchange rates with monetary targets based on a
weighted average of monetary aggregates. Whatever we do, it will be very
difficult to duck Germany's high interest rates, so I doubt interest rates
will come down quickly. I think strong inflationary impulses have been
un-leashed by this devaluation. If we cut rates the pound would go into free
fall.
*****
DAVID CURRIE, London Business School
The government was right to pursue the policy of European convergence within
the exchange rate mechanism to attain low inflation and a central role in
Europe. The failure of this policy following tactical errors leaves its
European strategy in disarray. The government will be tempted to resume that
policy but that may well be a mistake. The severe dent to credibility means
that a return to ERM membership even at current levels of the pound will
mean continued high UK interest rates, holding back economic recovery.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: The true cost to Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE true cost to Britain of its vain battle this week to defend the pound
emerged yesterday at about Pounds 750m, Peter Marsh writes. That is the
estimate of the amount by which the pounds that the Bank of England bought
for D-Marks in its intervention operations on Wednesday dropped in value
between the start of trading on that day and the close in London last night.
In a few hectic hours on Wednesday, the Bank bought sterling worth an
estimated Pounds 15bn for D-Marks from its foreign currency reserves. The
operations consumed a large chunk of Britain's Dollars 44bn fund of
reserves, as well as perhaps a third of the special Pounds 7bn foreign
currency loan which the Treasury arranged earlier this month as a 'war
chest' to defend sterling.
Yesterday's estimate of about Pounds 15bn in intervention by the Bank - the
Bundesbank and the Bank of France also bought sterling worth perhaps a
further Pounds 5bn - is an increase on the earlier estimate of Pounds 9bn.
The huge intervention effort on Wednesday is thought to be the biggest
action of this kind by a central bank to defend a currency.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Treasury gurus lick wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER this week's bloody and futile battle to defend the pound, the senior
officials trying to uphold the currency's value have emerged with plenty of
scars but few honours.
Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury, and Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, held important roles as
the government on Wednesday twice ordered a rise in interest rates and spent
up to Pounds 15bn supporting the pound - only to end the day admitting
defeat with an effective devaluation.
Sir Terry and Mr Leigh-Pemberton were among a small group who advised Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as he sought to conduct the government's
defence strategy from his office in the Treasury.
Other actors in the drama included Mr Andrew Turnbull, Treasury deputy
secretary in charge of monetary policy, Mr Alan Budd, Treasury economic
adviser, and Mr Eddie George, deputy governor at the Bank and overall
supervisor of its market operations.
As the officials yesterday licked their wounds, there was no shortage of
people accusing them of having chosen the wrong weapons. Many in the City
reckon the government should have put up interest rates much earlier in the
effort to defend the pound - perhaps two weeks ago - in an effort to
convince the markets of its willingness to bring out the heavy artillery in
propping up the currency.
Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities, the investment group,
said the initial action of raising interest rates by 2 percentage points at
around 11 am on Wednesday looked 'messy' and smacked of panic.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at brokers Greenwell Montagu, said: 'I
don't think anyone with any knowledge of foreign exchange markets would have
expected the actions the government took to quieten things down. The
Treasury totally underestimated the huge force of the money flowing out of
the pound via the currency markets.'
One difficulty, according to Mr Bootle, is that the Treasury has few people
with a background in financial markets. 'Time and again in the past 30
years, we have seen the government crucified by the markets, but the Civil
Service insists on filling the top jobs in the Treasury by people who come
in with academic backgrounds.'
One handicap in recruiting such people with a knowledge of financial markets
to the Treasury is the large difference in salaries paid to civil servants
compared with people in the City. In recent years, there has been a large
flow of people from the Treasury going to work for financial groups, with
few going the other way.
According to Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of economics at brokers Charterhouse
Tilney, this week's events indicate the Treasury's difficulty in assessing
the mood of financial markets, where many saw big obstacles to Britain's
maintaining the high interest rates required by membership of the exchange
rate mechanism at a time of deep recession.
'The position was looking to many people increasingly untenable,' Mr Jeffrey
said. 'We have seen this week just how distant the Treasury is from the real
world.'
While such criticisms are commonly made about the Treasury, there are
indications that some aspects of Treasury culture are changing. For example,
Mr Budd, who came to the Treasury last year from being economic adviser at
Barclays Bank and is one of the few Treasury senior mandarins with
experience in the financial services sector, has instituted a series of
regular meeting with top economists from companies as part of an attempt to
find out about economic conditions in industry.
Mr Gerry Grimstone, a former senior Treasury official who is now head of
corporate finance at Schroders, the merchant bank, said that in spite of
such efforts a culture gap existed between the Treasury and the outside
world. 'Treasury people are a bit like the inhabitants of a monastery who
think they have all the answers. They are the keepers of the faith and the
others outside are the infidels.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Midlands cheered by prospects
for exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders looked at the new world and found it, if not good, at least
better than on Tuesday, or last week - or even last month.
Yesterday's meeting of the west Midlands regional council of the
Confederation of British Industry pondered the fate of the floating,
devalued pound and the government's stricken anti-inflation policy. When
participants came out of the council chamber they smiled.
'The meeting was not depressed by any means,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, the
chairman.
But manufacturers in this traditional manufacturing region are far from
jumping for joy. On the domestic market 'confidence is low, the state of
trade is depressed', according to Mr Townsend. Yet losing the restraints of
the exchange rate mechanism means opportunities for exporters have suddenly
emerged.
'A year down the road, people may be saying this (the devaluation) was a
jolly good thing,' said Mr Edward Roberts, chief executive of Heath Springs,
a Redditch company which saw orders evaporate in June.
Since the early-1980s recession, west Midlands manufacturers have become
much more energetic in export markets. Painful bouts of cost-cutting have
made them generally more competitive.
A devalued currency adds an extra competitive margin. Sterling Tubes, the
Walsall steel tubemaker, exports 70 per cent of its production. Fighting
narrowing margins on an oversupplied market, the company was asking itself,
said Mr Bill Good, the managing director, 'can we afford to remain in the
US? Now we are committed to stay - 10 per cent from two dollars to the pound
is worth Pounds 0.5m.'
For Wagon Industrial, the Telford group with materials handling, engineering
and automotive interests, devaluation is 'an extremely good thing'. Not only
will it be able to export more, but also, said Mr John Hudson, the chief
executive, 'the 50 per cent of group profits coming from overseas
subsidiaries will be more valuable when translated into sterling'.
The assessment is widely shared. 'In terms of us exporting, especially to
the US,' said Mr Steven Mills, managing director of Bromsgrove Industries,
an engineering mini-conglomerate, the lower pound-dollar rate 'will be much
more conducive'.
Although Mr Mills believed 'something was needed to give a kick-start to the
economy' and that the lower pound 'in a perverse way will help', there
remain nagging worries about immediate prospects. Treating devaluation as
broadly good news, Mr David Probert, chairman of W. Canning, the speciality
chemicals and electronics distribution group, added the caveat: 'One doesn't
know how the funny games have affected business confidence.'
Mr Roger Pauli, managing director of Stuart Crystal, feared further
weakening of consumer confidence. 'We've enjoyed a modest level of retail
growth this year but a weakening of consumer confidence could reverse that
trend.'
According to Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman of JC Bamford Excavators,
the Staffordshire group, the events of the past few days 'are not going to
help the construction industry, which is in its worst recession since the
war'. What JCB would like is what many others want. 'It would obviously be
better for interest rates to go down substantially to encourage our business
and everybody else's,' said Mr Johnston.
West Midlands CBI wants the government to bear down on inflation by
'continuing to keep public-sector costs down, by keeping wage demands down,'
said Mr Townsend.

<TEXT>
GAVYN DAVIES, Goldman Sachs
It will be very difficult to rejoin the system quickly because I think the
chances of getting back into the same bind are too great. I think the
government will take the opportunity for a breathing space in which to ease
policy and get the pound and interest rates lower. They will then wait for a
recovery and lower German rates before trying to rejoin. I don't think they
are going to push rates below German rates because they won't want to see
the pound in free fall. Sterling should settle at around DM2.50-DM2.60 with
rates at around 9 per cent.
*****
STEVE HANNAH, IBJ International
confidence in the government's economic policy in the years to come and the
premium we will have to pay on sterling as a result will be very high. But
having blown its credibility the government might as well make the most of
the situation while it can. It should introduce a balanced package of lower
interest rates, but at the same time tighten fiscal policy. The government
can't be seen to be taking all the benefits without accepting some
disciplines. Otherwise we could become the banana economy of Europe.
*****
JIM O'NEILL, Swiss Bank Corporation
Maastricht is essentially dead; the French are going to vote on something
which no longer exists. That means Britain can concentrate on domestic
issues. We should let the pound go down to about DM2.50 and cut interest
rates. But regaining credibility with the financial markets will be
difficult for the government. If Britain re-joined the system too soon we
could see things go wrong disastrously once again and the pound could be
tipped over the edge. From a political and economic view it would be better
to let the pound float.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Mortgage lenders in rates plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE lenders and housebuilders yesterday begged the government not to
rush back into the European exchange rate mechanism. They said ministers
should take the opportunity to reduce UK interest rates further to ease the
burden on homeowners.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said:
'The government has freed itself from the straitjacket of the ERM and now
has a golden opportunity to put the UK economy on the road to recovery.'
Leeds Permanent Building Society said: 'If we stay out of the ERM it is
likely rates will fall. If we rejoin it will depend on the terms and
conditions, but the government will be very wary and not want to see a
repeat of the last few days.'
Sir Brian said confidence in the housing market would have sunk even lower
as a result of the events of the past two days. 'Even though interest rates
finished no higher than they had been at the beginning of the week, I cannot
see anybody wanting to rush out and buy a home.'
The best way of salvaging the situation would be to assist the housing
market. That would have a beneficial knock-on effect on the rest of the
economy.
The government would need to do more than lower interest rates. It should
also raise the ceiling on mortgage tax relief from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds
60,000 and remove stamp duty from house purchases, he said.
Building societies echoed the call for further interest rate cuts.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy group chief executive of the Woolwich, said: 'The
return to 10 per cent base rates is a relief and obviates rate increases
that would have further depressed the housing market and worsened problems
of arrears repossessions.
'This should not mask the underlying need for positive action to restore
market buoyancy. Such action should now embrace interest rate cuts to
reflect sterling's lower market-related value,' he said.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Labour leader ready for battle
in parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT PROMISES to be an exciting debut. At his election as Labour leader Mr
John Smith's greatest regret was that he had no opportunity to tackle the
prime minister in the chamber before the Commons rose for its summer recess.
Now both he and Mr Gordon Brown, his shadow chancellor, will make their
first appearance on the parliamentary stage in their new roles in next
Thursday's hothouse debate on the economy.
A wounded prime minister and chancellor will have to make their defence in a
bear pit, aware that many on their own back benches will be as sceptical as
the opponents they face.
Yesterday a Labour pack, led by Mr Brown and Mr Smith, were tearing into the
corpse of the government economic policy that died in the foreign exchange
markets on Black Wednesday.
In back rooms, researchers were dredging through recent government speeches
for the numerous statements on the pound and the ERM for ammunition to fire
in next week's debate.
Yet the smug chorus of 'We told you so' from Labour cannot disguise the fact
that, by insisting on staying in the ERM and opposing devaluation, Messrs
Smith and Brown were genuflecting to the very exchange rate policy advocated
by their opponents.
There are plenty of explanations for that. Not least, if the Labour
leadership had argued the case for devaluation it would have been accused of
economic defeatism, of advocating stop-go, high-spending policies, even of
that unspeakable sin, 'talking the pound down'.
Because they did not do so, as one assiduous propagandist pointed out
yesterday, 'the Tories cannot now use the 'party of devaluation' charge as a
stick to beat us with'.
All that bears some truth. But a credibility problem remains over what
Labour will say when the Conservatives hit back with the inevitable
question: What would you have done?
So far, attempts by journalists to pose that to the Labour leaders have been
dodged. Once off the offensive, Mr Smith and Mr Brown have argued that
Labour would never have found itself in the circumstances that the
government encountered on Wednesday.
Had they been elected in April, they say, their recovery programme of job
creation, fiscal incentives to industry and other shorter-term measures
would by now have started to generate enough confidence to have seen off
pressure on the pound.
Raise a sceptical eyebrow at that claim and the next response is that Labour
would also have used the European Community presidency to seek international
co-operation to bolster recovery across the Continent.
If that still does not wash, the Labour leadership's loyalists insist that a
Smith government would at least have seen the writing on the wall sooner
than Mr Major and, if it were necessary, raised interest rates earlier to
head off a collapse of confidence in sterling.
Such claims may just pass muster as sound bites on the news programmes. But
they have generated a fair deal of scepticism on Labour's benches, both back
and front.
Before this week's debacle in the foreign exchange markets, the lobby for a
change of tack on ERM policy - and on the whole Maastricht treaty - had been
growing. Mr Bryan Gould, the arch-Euro-sceptic, had led a chorus of
frontbench doubters, and overtly pro-Maastricht Labour MPs had questioned
the leadership's line as lacking in credibility.
Mr Brian Sedgemore, the former anti-European turned quasi-federalist
leftwinger for Hackney South and Shoreditch, has proved one of the most
adept at arguing that Mr Smith's standpoint has undermined Labour's
credibility.
'What we have been arguing is that you can have the same fiscal deficit, or
perhaps a slightly larger one, significant cuts in interest rates and still
maintain the parity of the pound at DM2.95 - it has been moonshine,' he
said.
'Furthermore, some who have argued it have not believed it.'
Labour, he goes on, can say that it has kept its virility as a
non-devaluationist party. But the downside is that the leadership must now
devise a new grand strategy with its credibility impaired.
How much all that will matter in the debate next Thursday remains to be
seen. Certainly the critical spotlight will be on the government, not the
opposition.
With devaluation a fait accompli and the French referendum outcome creating
an opportunity to devise a fresh Labour policy on Maastricht and the
economy, the Commons on Thursday will also offer Mr Smith a Godsent chance
to demonstrate his debating skills on Mr Major as the prelude to a
resounding reception in Blackpool.
But already some niggling doubts over his economic caution and strategic
judgment have been raised. Mr Smith knows he must be sure his shots hit
their mark.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Tory MPs fight shy of the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THEY emerged from a series of crisis meetings, prime minister John Major
and chancellor Norman Lamont must have been dismayed yesterday at their
party's apparent lack of enthusiasm for the exchange rate mechanism.
In the constituencies, party members were bemused as they struggled to make
sense of events experts on their television screens are unable to agree on.
'The average member in the last 24 hours is just totally, utterly confused,'
said Mr Malcolm Griffiths, Conservative association chairman in the
Tory-held Langbaurgh constituency. 'They don't really understand what's
going on. I'd think that covers a fair number of MPs too.'
It is vital to the credibility of both Mr Major and Mr Lamont that they win
their party's support for the resumption of sterling's participation in the
ERM, assuming the system survives the French referendum on Sunday.
The party conference in Brighton is just two weeks away and in spite of the
cabinet's unanimous backing, it was clear that it was far from shoring up
support lower down the hierarchy.
Loyalists like Mr Terence Higgins, former chairman of the Treasury and Civil
Service select committee, tried to portray Tory Euro-sceptics as a hard-line
minority who 'have created a greater impression of disunity in the party
than in fact exists'.
But what was striking yesterday was the extent to which antipathy to the
mechanism and the concept of fixed exchange rates appeared to have spread
beyond the most vociferous of the 'usual suspects'.
Many MPs wanted to see the ERM reformed to make it more flexible. Such
pragmatists are the people Mr Major and Mr Lamont urgently need to win back.
Sir Ivan Lawrence, MP for Burton and chairman of the home affairs select
committee, was among those who said the ERM was 'nothing like flexible
enough'.
He said: 'We are so much at the mercy of gambling by the banks - it helps
them and hinders us to have a set level below which you couldn't go. I have
always thought tying ourselves into the ERM was not good for the economy. My
economic betters may have better judgment than I but emotionally I am
against it.'
Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham and a former junior minister, said the
mechanism had to be 'rejigged'. Emu was not 'a very plausible aim after all
this'. He called for consideration to be given to linking sterling to the
reformed mechanism 'in some lower and looser form'.
Mr Peter Ainsworth, MP for ultra-safe Surrey East, said the past few days
had demonstrated that fixed exchange rates were 'fallible'. But he backed
the way the government responded to this week's crisis. 'It was the only
option yesterday to get out. It is prudent of the government to make it a
temporary suspension.'
Mr Winston Churchill, MP for Davyhulme, also voiced strong support for the
chancellor, characterising the government's attempt at honouring its ERM
obligations as 'brave but forlorn'. The crisis was 'likely to prove
excellent news for those who feared the worst'.
Among those who unreservedly opposed a return to the ERM was Mr John
Wilkinson, MP for Ruislip-Northwood, who said it was 'not acceptable' for
the government to 'swan' back into the mechanism and warned of trouble in
next week's Commons debate. 'They have another thought coming if they
imagine they will have our unconditional support.'
Support for a return to the mechanism 'as soon as we can' came from Mrs
Edwina Currie, MP for Derbyshire South and another former minister. If
Britain remained outside the ERM, there was 'a fear it would affect foreign
investment'.
In the constituencies, the past two days' events have also aroused strong
feelings. Moves towards closer European integration have been questioned by
some Tory supporters who had not previously challenged the concept.
'It's very sad the stability Europe offered has proved to be a bit of an
illusion,' said Mr Harry Davies, chairman of the Stockton north Conservative
association.
Mr Davies, who is on the left of the Tory party, believes the crisis will
make party members reassess their views on Europe, and force Conservative
leaders to review the policy of total reliance on inflation control. He
hopes it will lead to greater flexibility. He said: 'I joined the
Conservative party because I didn't like dogma.'
There was a general feeling that Mr Major's survival chances were better
than Mr Lamont's.
Mr Davies said he had a 'soft spot' for Mr Heseltine, although many
Conservatives think him 'a little erratic'.
It was very unlikely that Mr Major would go. But he warned: 'It's a little
like football when the team's in trouble and the chairman says, I have the
fullest confidence in the manager. And then, the next week, he goes.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Fund managers try to cut risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS STERLING sank further yesterday, foreign exchange dealers were not the
only professionals active in the market. Fund managers and corporate
treasurers with exposure to sterling have had a busy couple of days.
'It was a case of trying to minimise the risk in a portfolio,' said Mr
Terence Prideaux of Kemper Investment Management, a US investment house.
'Given the size of the currency flows, any prudent investment manager would
have had to explore the question of currency exposure.'
Another fund manager said: 'You knew, as soon as 15 per cent interest rates
were announced, that it wasn't sustainable.'
Dealers reported activity from a wide range of fund managers, particularly
Swiss and US. While some fund managers moved assets between markets, others
tried to hedge currency exposure within their existing portfolios.
'The main focus was hedging currencies against the D-Mark,' said Mr Axel
Benkner of DWS, the German fund management group.
Corporate treasurers, while still assessing the long-term effects of recent
events on their businesses, were also active in moving against potential
short-term exposure.
'There has been a fair amount of activity' among corporate treasurers, said
Mr Tony Rice, group treasurer at British Aerospace. 'Those of us with dollar
exposure have had to sit on our hands for a while.'
Even in the spot foreign exchange market - the world's most liquid market -
trading became difficult as the margin between buy and sell prices on the
dollar-sterling rate, normally 3-10 basis points, hit 50 basis points.
Some treasurers decided that discretion was the better part of valour. 'We
were reluctant to deal in a disorderly market,' said one corporate treasurer
at a UK company.
The recent level of volatility pushed prices up, making it uneconomical to
hedge using options. Instead, activity has been concentrated in the forward
foreign exchange market and even in the spot market, contributing to the
pressure on the pound.
In spite of tumultuous market conditions, foreign exchange traders found
themselves with a one-way bet as the Bank of England proved an unlimited
buyer of sterling throughout the day.
As the Bank intervened in the market, offering to buy sterling in minimum
amounts of Pounds 30m - compared with a normal market size of Pounds
5m-Pounds 10m - it found banks and corporate treasurers willing to sell.
'Every bank around the world had taken a position against sterling,' one
broker said.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: City finds new hope amid
apparent crisis - Fund managers pour money into equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STEEP rise of the equity market yesterday might appear a perverse
reaction to an apparent economic crisis, but to people in the City the jump
in shares was entirely logical.
The volume of share trading was huge as fund managers poured money into the
market.
'It is one of those very rare occasions in one's life when the world does
change overnight,' said Mr Nick Knight, equity strategist at Nomura Research
Institute. Mr Knight has been one of the most bearish stock market
commentators in recent months, but overnight he became optimistic.
He had not had time for detailed analysis but said: 'Forget the numbers.
We're bullish]'
Mr Knight expects a cut in UK interest rates from 10 per cent to 8 per cent,
perhaps today. The reversal from the 15 per cent interest rate mooted only
24 hours earlier could hardly be more dramatic. 'On Wednesday morning the
policy was low inflation at any price,' he said. 'Today (Thursday) it is
growth at any price.
'Up till 2pm on Wednesday the government's performance had been incredibly
bad.
'The first sensible thing they did was push rates from 12 per cent to 15 per
cent. The next sensible thing was to walk away from it that evening, and the
third was to cut to 10 per cent.'
Mr Alun Jones, UK equity research analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, was not
quite so dramatic in his remarks, but he, too, said he believed that the
whole basis for looking at the market had changed.
He had expected the government to try to defend sterling with higher
interest rates for longer than a few hours, although he had assumed the end
result would be the same. He too said he was looking for an interest rate
cut - though perhaps only of 1 percentage point - by the time of the
Conservative party conference, which starts on October 5 in Brighton.
Cynical analysts suggested that the best hope the prime minister and the
chancellor of the exchequer had of regaining support in the Conservative
party was to cut interest rates before the conference begins.
An interest rate fall needs to work through to a reduction in mortgage rates
before consumers' willingness to spend is likely to recover.
The equity market is now looking for a recovery in company profits, firstly
from the effect of translating profits made abroad into sterling at a lower
exchange rate. Then comes the benefit of a weaker pound to companies that
export and those which compete with imported goods. After that, a resumption
of growth in the economy expected from lower interest rates should begin to
feed into company profits.
An immediate boost will come for companies that translate their overseas
profits into sterling at year-end rather than average exchange rates. Mr
Jones said that whereas a week ago stockbrokers were forecasting lower
profits for the market as a whole for this year, it was now possible to look
for a small rise.
In 1993, UBS P&amp;D thinks, a 10 per cent devaluation in sterling would add 6
per cent to industrial profits. Further, a revival in the economy should be
possible without an immediate increase in inflation. 'The economy is so weak
that inflationary pressures are snuffed out for quite a while,' it said.
The equity market had been a little uncomfortable about the idea of
persistent low inflation. Equities have been regarded as a hedge through the
high-inflation years, and performed well relative to fixed interest
securities.
Favoured sectors and stocks are those with big overseas earnings or which
compete internationally, and among mainly domestic companies, those in
cyclical industries.
During the recession, fund managers shifted the weighting of their
portfolios away from cyclical stocks to the so-called defensive sectors  -
companies that should do well even in more difficult times, such as drug
companies, food retailers and utilities such as water and electric
companies.
Yesterday the switch back began. As Mr Knight put it: 'Sell defensives;
there is nothing to be defensive against.'
Rises were seen in the share prices of companies with large US earnings,
such as Tomkins, Siebe and United Biscuits. Coats Viyella gained both from
its dollar exposure and because it competes in the UK with imports, as does
British Steel, another gainer.
Also well ahead were companies in the building sector, such as Blue Circle,
which would benefit from lower interest rates, and, in furniture stores, MFI
rose strongly.
Defensive stocks were left behind in the general surge. A few shares even
fell yesterday, particularly in UK-oriented companies and utilities such as
Northern Foods, Sainsbury, British Telecom and some water stocks. Marks and
Spencer shares rose less than the market.
Also gaining were some of the banks, whose exposure to bad debts is now
perceived to be less serious. There were dramatic increases in the prices of
smaller property companies, such as Stanhope and Rosehaugh, which had been
regarded as high-risk investments when the outlook was for interest rates to
remain high.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK economy: Special deal prods banks into
reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK BANKS were very reluctant to reduce interest rates yesterday, even though
the government cut the rate at which the Bank of England lends to the
market, or the minimum lending rate, by 2 percentage points.
The MLR was cut at 9.30 yesterday morning, reversing Wednesday's increase,
but it was not until after 3pm that any big banks cut their base lending
rates - only after 40 banks and five big building societies were summoned to
a meeting at the Bank.
Banks said yesterday the reason for the delay was not any doubt on their
part that the MLR cut was sustainable. They said the lag in responding to
the MLR cut was due to technical problems in the money markets, which were
solved when the Bank put special lending arrangements in place.
According to a banker the root of the problem was the scale of the
government's purchases of sterling on Wednesday, when it was battling to
prop up the pound. Analysts estimate that it bought Pounds 15bn of sterling.
Any institution which sold sterling to the Bank has to deliver the funds
today. UK banks, which act as intermediaries in settling the bulk of these
transactions, have received orders from banks across the world to deliver
sterling to the Bank.
The UK banks do not, however, have enough sterling to meet these obligations
so they have to borrow pounds. Normally they would borrow much of it from
the discount houses, which act as an interface between the Bank and the
clearing banks. Only discount houses can borrow from the Bank at the MLR.
The discount market has insufficient capacity to cope with such demands,
however. As a result, an acute shortage of sterling developed in the markets
and short-term borrowing rates soared.
The banks feared companies would draw on agreed-rate overdraft facilities to
make a quick profit by lending to banks at high short-term rates -
round-tripping.
No bank wanted to be the first to cut its base rate to 10 per cent, so John
Townend, head of the Bank's money market division, summoned treasurers of
banks and building societies. He proposed that the Bank would lend directly
to the banks, bypassing the discount houses, at 10 per cent.
Banks were able to borrow 2 per cent of their eligible liabilities - all
their liabilities except deposits with other banks - for seven days.
Though some banks doubted that sufficient liquidity was being provided by
the Bank, in the event they were reassured. Short-term money market rates
came down and in the end the banks reduced their base rates - much to the
government's relief.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Business faces up to life with
a stronger dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR UK industrialists bemused by the continued upheaval in European
currencies yesterday, one fact stood out. The sterling-dollar rate is now at
Dollars 1.77. At the start of the month it was at Dollars 2. Sterling is
thus 12 per cent lower than it was a fortnight ago.
For reasons that are partly historic, the dollar remains the most important
single currency for UK manufacturers dealing with the outside world. In
terms of actual trading, as opposed to the translation of overseas earnings,
a stronger dollar cuts three ways.
It is good for exporters and those competing against dollar-based goods at
home or abroad. It is bad for importers. And it is decidedly mixed for small
companies that cannot afford sophisticated currency hedging, since a
switchback dollar adds to their trading risks.
An excellent example of an industry that benefits is aerospace. This is a
business denominated in dollars. For UK manufacturers, the weak dollar has
compounded the difficulties caused by the recession in civil aviation and
government cuts in military spending.
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, said yesterday
that a stronger dollar was better for the company. 'We build in pounds and
sell in dollars,' a Rolls-Royce official said.
Rolls-Royce said earlier this month that the weak dollar had reduced its
first-half profits by Pounds 10m compared with last year. The weaker dollar
also benefited Rolls-Royce's principal US competitors, General Electric and
Pratt &amp; Whitney.
A stronger dollar will also help UK aerospace companies such as British
Aerospace and components manufacturers such as Smiths Industries, TI-Dowty
and Lucas.
Sterling's fluctuations will have less impact on UK airlines. British
Airways explained yesterday that it sold tickets on both sides of the
Atlantic. A firmer dollar resulted in improved US traffic while a stronger
pound boosted UK travel across the Atlantic. The US currently accounts for
about 30 per cent of BA's passengers.
Another beneficiary is the UK's oil sector, where sterling's devaluation was
warmly welcomed. 'It's tremendously good news from a sterling oil company's
point of view,' said Mr John Walmesley, the finance director of Enterprise
Oil, the independent oil company. 'It will provide relief for a hard-pressed
sector.'
The devaluation will raise the sterling price of oil close to Pounds 12,
widely regarded among North Sea operators as a 'comfort' threshold.
In the UK motor industry, the effects are limited to specialist
manufacturers, since volume exports of cars from the US to the UK and
continental Europe still play only a minor role in the European market.
Against that, Jaguar and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the two UK luxury
carmakers, will both reap benefits from lower sterling as Britain's main car
exporters to the US.
North America accounted for 44 per cent of Jaguar's worldwide turnover last
year of Pounds 693m, and the previous steep fall in the value of the dollar
has played a role in its mounting losses, totalling Pounds 226m last year.
For Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the loss-making subsidiary of the UK engineering
group Vickers, North America accounts for about 28 per cent of worldwide
turnover.
Jaguar and Rolls-Royce have both suffered badly in the recessions in the UK
and US. In North America, however, fierce competition has meant that there
has been little scope to raise prices to compensate for loss of revenue
caused by the prolonged fall in the value of the dollar.
Devaluation of the pound against the dollar and D-Mark will also give an
important edge to the competitiveness of the UK luxury carmakers in North
America against their main rivals, Mercedes-Benz and BMW of Germany.
Among losers from devaluation are companies that depend on
dollar-denominated raw materials.
The ambivalent effect of weaker sterling on smaller companies is illustrated
by The Rocking Horse Shop, a Yorkshire-based company that makes and
despatches rocking horse kits to the US.'
The company's owner, Mr Tony Dew, said: 'It's knowing what prices to quote
at the time orders are taken which gives us the biggest headache.' Mr Dew
said miscalculating exchange rates between orders and despatch could have a
marked impact on a company with an annual turnover of around Pounds 250,000.
The latest dip in the value of the pound, he says, might give US export
business a boost. 'But then, we buy in some of our raw materials from
Germany, so that won't help.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Holiday prices may rise soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVEL companies, ever eager for early cash, are encouraging customers to
book their summer 1993 holidays now. Bargain-hunters should do so.
Holidays prices will probably not rise over the next few months. But if the
pound remains weak until Christmas, foreign holidays may become more
expensive and some operators might abandon their no-surcharge policy.
The big tour operators began selling their summer 1993 holidays last month,
most undertaking to honour brochure prices and not levy surcharges. Many
took advantage of the dollar, then weak, to offer cut-price holidays to the
US and the Caribbean.
The weak US currency helped to keep down the price of holidays to other
destinations, as airline fuel is priced in dollars.
Mr Keith Waller, marketing director of Owners Abroad Holidays, the
second-biggest UK travel group, says the large companies all bought US
currency forward when the dollar stood at about Dollars 1.90 to the pound. A
stronger dollar will not immediately add to the cost of providing holidays.
Even relatively small holiday companies see forward buying as an essential
part of their operation. Mr Noel Josephides, a director of Sunvil Travel,
the specialist operator, says that before this week's currency turmoil he
had bought forward three quarters of the dollars he needed for the next year
at Dollars 1.92. He had also bought forward a third of his Greek drachma and
half his Portuguese escudo requirements.
Mr Andrew Wilson, commercial director of travel agents Thomas Cook, says
most companies' forward buying arrangements account for only 65 per cent to
70 per cent of their total requirements, so that a stronger dollar might
eventually place some upward pressure on prices.
The large companies will issue new editions of their brochures towards the
end of the year. Smaller companies publish brochures for the first time in
November. Mr Wilson says that if the pound remains weak relative to the
dollar, prices may go up.
Some companies might not offer a 'no surcharge' guarantee with the new
brochures, industry officials believe, although the Association of British
Travel Agents code of practice stipulates that companies must absorb
increased costs up to 2 per cent of the holiday price. If costs rise further
they may levy a surcharge of up to 10 per cent of the holiday price.
Abta members need the association's approval to levy surcharges. Of the 665
Abta tour operators, only five currently have permission to levy additional
charges.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Traders turn a swift foreign
exchange profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER 12 hours at his desk on Wednesday Mr John Banerjee, a 24-year-old
foreign exchange dealer at Chemical Bank, was back in the office at 7am
yesterday, taking over from the bank's regular night shift.
He normally concentrates on trading the dollar/Swiss franc and the
D-Mark/Swiss franc rates, but in the last few days, dealers have abandoned
their regular patches.
'We've all just pitched in,' Mr Banerjee explained. 'I've been trying to
arbitrage the sterling market.'
Since the Bank of England was publicly buying sterling at DM2.7780 on
Wednesday, dealers were able to buy sterling against the dollar and then
sell it to the Bank of England, earning handsome profits as sterling
continued to dip below the floor.
As he walked into the office yesterday, after the pound had been suspended
from the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling was still being sold.
Although volume had subsided somewhat, trading conditions remained
difficult.
'The market is very nervous today, and it is difficult to get people to make
prices and difficult to get client business done,' Mr Banerjee said.
He did not get a lunch break yesterday - but then, he never does. Instead,
like his colleagues, he consumes sandwiches delivered to his desk.
Liquidity improved when the US market opened around midday, and by the end
of the trading day sterling appeared to have stabilised somewhat at about
DM2.63.
By 4.30pm yesterday the roar of orders and price quotes across Mr Banerjee's
desk had started to subside. Traders normally start to leave from 5pm. Even
when markets are busy, a night staff is at hand to take over when European
markets close.
Mr Banerjee joined Chemical Bank two years ago after gaining a degree in
economics from Sussex University.
'When I was at university I studied theoretical foreign exchange models,' Mr
Banerjee remembers. 'They may have some relevance to the big picture, but
what people actually do in the markets is another matter.'
In spite of his relatively short time in the market, Mr Banerjee has already
experienced frantic market conditions.
'The day after the Soviet coup (last summer), the volume in dollar/D-Mark
was phenomenal,' he said.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE leaders yesterday threw their weight behind moves for the meeting
tomorrow of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries, to draw up contingency plans to make sure European currency
instability does not spread.
Officials in Japan are concerned that the European currency crisis may put
the US dollar under pressure, strengthening the yen and thus pushing Japan
towards cutting interest rates.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, said the meeting tomorrow would discuss
ways to calm European currency markets, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance
minister, said Japan was ready to back concerted action to prevent
instability spreading. Mr Hata will meet his US counterpart, Mr Nicholas
Brady, this afternoon.
Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, suggested the G7 might take
co-ordinated action to stabilise European currencies. A finance ministry
official said plans were being prepared for intervention in the Tokyo market
on Monday if, in their referendum on Sunday, the French vote against the
Maastricht treaty on European integration.
The Tokyo market would be the first to feel the violent impact that a French
rejection of the treaty could have on forex markets.
Beyond these immediate worries, the turmoil of the past week, combined with
the imminence of the French vote, has provoked concerns among Japanese
financiers, industrialists and policy-makers.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister at the ministry of international trade and
industry, warned that, if the pound's suspension in the ERM were prolonged,
Japan would be hurt. One worry is that the US dollar may soon be sucked into
the turmoil. That would drag in the yen. If the French vote against
Maastricht, Tokyo analysts expect the D-Mark to strengthen against the
dollar, which would further weaken against the yen.

FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Camdessus predicts a strengthened
EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
predicted yesterday that the European Monetary System would emerge
strengthened from the crisis of the past few days. But he blamed unbalanced
German policies for the underlying strains in the currency markets.
'Too much of a burden' had been placed on the German monetary authorities
and 'not enough emphasis put on budgetary instruments,' he declared. Mr
Camdessus did not criticise Britain, which he praised for having taken
vigorous steps to reduce inflation. 'I would not say that I am pressing for
any kind of adjustment effort for Britain.'
Taking a broader view, Mr Camdessus said the root cause of turbulence in
foreign exchange markets was excessive reliance on monetary, as opposed to
budgetary, policies. 'If we have problems, it is because we have delivered
only half what we promised to do,' he added, in a reference to US as well as
European economic policy.
Leading countries should not use evidence of a 'hesitant' world economic
recovery as an excuse for delaying action to reduce budget deficits. Strong,
immediate steps to consolidate budgets were an urgent priority. Vigorous
action to liberalise labour markets was also needed if resumption of world
growth was to bring about significantly higher employment.
He took a resolutely optimistic view of likely developments in the EMS, as
did Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs.
'No one wants to see turbulence in currency markets, because it can have
spill-over effects into other financial markets if it's not addressed. It
has been addressed,' Mr Mulford said.
It was hard to judge the effectiveness of the combined lira devaluation and
German interest rate cut agreed last weekend, because the turmoil in foreign
exchange markets in the past week had been exacerbated by the prospect of
the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, due on Sunday.
'I think the actions taken in Europe in the past 24 hours have been the
right ones because, in a sense, they suspend judgment on those issues until
we can pass this event, and they take the pressure and the tension out of
the system.'
Mr Mulford said the dollar's revival since the weekend showed that its
earlier weakness was purely a residual effect of European tensions, not a
judgment on the fundamentals of the US economy.
'The present level of the dollar is one at which the United States is
competitive,' Mr Mulford added.
Mr Camdessus praised European Community ministers for unanimously restating
their commitment to the EMS. With this decision, 'the system has once again
demonstrated its remarkable resilience.'
It was encouraging that countries had reacted flexibly and co-operatively to
foreign exchange turmoil and had not resorted to exchange controls.
The latest strains did not imply that the EMS should revert to its pre-1987
rules of operation when relatively frequent adjustments of parities were
normal. Rather, they illustrated the advantages of moving ahead towards
greater economic and monetary integration.

committee
</HEADLINE>

THIS IS the edited text of the statement issued by the European Community
monetary committee after its meeting early yesterday.
'The ministers and central bank governors of the member states of the
European Community, after consultation with the monetary committee of the
European Community, have taken note of:
The decision of the United Kingdom authorities to suspend in present
circumstances the participation of their currency in the exchange rate
mechanism;
The subsequent decision of the Italian authorities to abstain temporarily
from intervention in the foreign exchange markets.
They all stress their unanimous commitment to the European Monetary System
as a key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe.
The authorities of those countries which observe the intervention
obligations of the exchange rate mechanism urge the resumption of the full
participation of the pound sterling and of the lira as soon as possible.
At the request of the Spanish authorities, the ministers and central bank
governors have further, by mutual agreement following a common procedure
involving the Commission, and after consultation with the monetary
committee, decided on a realignment within the exchange rate mechanism of
the EMS.
The bilateral central rates of the Spanish peseta have been reduced by 5 per
cent.
The agrimonetary consequences will be examined by the competent bodies.'

a unit.
Most, however, seemed agreed that the outcome of Sunday's vote was as
important as ever for France and Europe.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister, warned that a No verdict
in Sunday's referendum on Maastricht would create fresh 'difficulties' for
France and other European countries.
For the RPR, the largest opposition party, Mr Edouard Balludur, a former
conservative finance minister, said the crisis on the money exchanges 'shows
we have even more need of Europe, of greater co-ordination among us, without
which we are condemned to disarray'.
Le Monde said in an editorial that 'the bursting apart of the European
Monetary System indicates that a certain number of countries - grouped
around Germany and France - could rapidly create a unified monetary zone' in
a two-speed Europe.
Mr Jacques Barrot, parliamentary leader of the 40 centrist UDC deputies,
said that approving Maastricht would give a new push towards economic and
monetary union, which was needed 'to bolster an EMS which was becoming more
and more battered'. By forging a common Ecu, the Community would have a 'bar
of steel' to replace 'the chain of the EMS, whose links can always snap'.
But Mr Philippe Seguin, a leading No campaigner within the RPR, said the
currency turmoil had shown 'before our eyes' that Maastricht was 'an
historic misconception'. Differing economies could not be put into a
monetary straitjacket, he suggested. He was due last night, at one of the
few big rallies in a campaign that is now winding down, to develop this
theme at Versailles' Palais des Congres.
Echoing Mr Seguin from the other end of the political spectrum, Mr Charles
Fiterman, a leading Communist, said that developing a single currency would
not resolve the differences between EC economies. A French defeat of
Maastricht would allow 'a rapid re-discussion' of the treaty to develop a
new European policy. This would be better than simply 'waiting for crises
which will be inevitable if we advance along the lines laid down in the
(Maastricht) treaty,' Mr Fiterman added.
However, Maastricht's opponents yesterday displayed some nervousness that
financial fears might tip the balance on Sunday in favour of the treaty. Mr
Max Gallo, a Socialist Euro-MP, said it was 'scandalous propaganda' for many
commentators to suggest that the uncertainty surrounding the French
referendum was the cause of this week's 'monetary storm'.
The currency market upheavals underlined the importance of monetary and
economic convergence as an insurance against further shocks, the Patronat
employers' organisation said.
Mr Michel Albert, chairman of AGF, the state-owned insurance group, warned
that a No vote would hit savings and property values. The financial markets
would see 'a fall, the size of which no one can foresee.' Dealers would test
the franc to the limit, which would be 'tantamount to a devaluation,' he
said.

quickly rebuffed

BRITAIN'S attempts to persuade its EC partners to suspend the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism were quickly rebuffed by senior treasury and central
bank officials at their crisis meeting, it emerged yesterday.
The EC's secretive monetary committee, which in effect manages the European
monetary system, took just under six hours to frame a communique aimed at
soothing the turbulent currency markets.
The crisis meeting was already the EC's worst-kept secret when it began just
before midnight on Wednesday. It ended at 5.30am yesterday under the glare
of television arc lights, when the committee opted to endorse suspension of
ERM membership for sterling and the lira, and devaluation of the peseta,
rather than temporary suspension of the whole grid system.
The British plan - which would have allowed the 11 currencies to find their
own level in the markets - was apparently backed by the Italians and
Spanish. But their partners rejected what was seen as an attempt to save
political face at home, and a threat to the future of the EMS.
'(Suspension) would have been really awkward,' said one senior central bank
official yesterday. 'If one had embarked on general floating (of
currencies), one would really have undone the whole structure.'
Officials yesterday claimed that the atmosphere of the meeting had been
comparatively calm and free from recriminations.
British officials claimed that other EC members had repeated calls for lower
German interest rates - without making any headway.
It was clear that political considerations had a strong influence, including
the need to be able to reaffirm economic and monetary union (Emu) as a
legitimate goal of the Community.
Asked as he left the meeting if the committee's decision marked 'the end of
Emu', Mr Horst Kohler, German state secretary of finance, said the meeting
was simply 'the continuation of good co-operation' among the 12.

'Countries .. which have, not without success, mounted domestic battles
against inflation would, by devaluing, place at risk the success of these
policies. They have good reason to avoid this solution. But, according to
circumstances, that is not always possible.' - Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
president of the Bundesbank, in speech in Kiel, September 14, 1992
THIS MONTH'S foreign exchange turmoil illustrates the awesome speed with
which monetary upheaval can spread through the continent.
The Bundesbank has become increasingly suspicious of the way that the
European Monetary System (EMS), set up in 1979, has during the last 5 3/4
years started to develop into a fixed exchange rate system.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of Germany's independent central bank,
outlined in Kiel how countries which had registered higher inflation than
Germany since the last full-scale realignment in January 1987 would sooner
or later have to devalue.
Aided by his own well-publicised hints the next day of a sterling
devaluation, Mr Schlesinger's prediction came true - possibly, more quickly
than the 68-year-old Bundesbank chief could imagine.
During the last five years, most western European countries, either directly
through the EMS's Exchange Rate Mechanism, or indirectly through unilateral
pegging arrangements, have anchored themselves to the D-Mark.
A primary motivation has been to prepare for the EC's goal of economic and
monetary union (Emu) - a goal which the Bundesbank has long regarded with
ill-disguised antipathy.
Within the space of just over a week, the Bundesbank has helped orchestrate
two important coups. What had previously appeared a relatively well ordered
system of European exchange rates has suddenly crumbled.
Into the EMS, the Bundesbank has injected a large amount of greater
flexibility. Into the debate about Emu, it has brought a sizeable dose of
realism about the feasibility of the timetable for moving to a single
currency by the end of the century.
Successive waves of financial market speculation have washed through the
currency defences of four countries, and severely tested several others.
The EMS, which Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, two years ago called 'a
modern-day gold standard with the D-Mark as the anchor', is rapidly losing
the 'softer', more inflation-prone currencies at its periphery.
Finland has severed its unilateral tie to the European currency unit. Italy
has devalued within the EMS by 7 per cent, and is floating - it says - until
Tuesday. Spain has devalued by 5 per cent. And Britain has decided to float
sterling until 'market conditions' permit re-entry to the system.
The Swedish krona has maintained its unilateral link to the Ecu only by dint
of massive foreign exchange intervention and overnight interest rates of 500
per cent. Taking into account the intervention necessary to bolster Nordic
currencies outside the ERM, as well as the support for weak currencies
within the system, total European exchange rate intervention is estimated at
DM60bn to DM70bn over the last few weeks.
In an exchange rate system unprotected by any form of controls on capital
movements, central banks' support ammunition has been rapidly spent.
Intervention has had no impact on the tendency for the EMS to split between
the 'hard core' grouped around the D-Mark - principally, the Benelux
countries, Denmark and France - and the 'wider orbit' currencies outside.
Yesterday, as the Danish krone and Irish punt fell to their lowest permitted
levels against the D-Mark, and the French franc also came under pressure,
the EMS's centrifugal forces again came to the fore.
Even if France votes Yes to Maastricht at Sunday's referendum - an outcome
which could obviate the need for a further formal realignment - the ERM as
it has existed since 1987 now looks unlikely to reappear.
'The EMS seems to be going back to what it was originally: a zone of
exchange rate stability with frequent exchange rate changes by mutual
consent,' says Mr Brendan Brown, economist at Mitsubishi Finance in London.
'The Bundesbank wants to have the best of both worlds - it wants the system
to be flexible enough to allow it to run its own monetary policy, but not so
flexible as to lead to competitive devaluations which would be harmful for
German exporters.'
In the leaner and tougher ERM, the members most likely to keep their places
are those which, virtually without condition, place control over their
monetary affairs in the Bundesbank's hands. For all practical purposes,
these 'hard core' countries are now the only ones that will proceed towards
Emu.
France, which has weathered a much less severe economic downturn than
Britain in its quest for low inflation, has lately shown great restraint in
pressing its desire for interest rate cuts. As a reward, France's
credibility has risen on the foreign exchanges. This is a vital condition
for French success in achieving its long-term goal of Emu - a step which
would involve a collective European central bank taking the Bundesbank's
position as Europe's monetary arbiter.
Before it can reach this destination France must, however, surmount some
important hurdles. Through its stern efforts to bring down German inflation
during the past two years, the Bundesbank has effectively exported deflation
to other ERM members.
This process is likely to continue - even though the Bundesbank will almost
certainly maintain gentle downward pressure on interest rates in the coming
months.
As a result of the financial pressures in Germany caused by German
unification, members of the ERM will continue to pay a price for the
privilege of allowing the Bundesbank to decide their monetary policies.
At the same time, the 'outer orbit' countries which have devalued may
experience - at least in the short term - a pick-up in their economies. If
this happens, electorates in the 'hard core' may look out with some envy to
the edges of the D-Mark solar system - and wonder whether there may not be,
after all, some advantages in seeking to break free from the D-Mark's
gravitational pull.

rise

<TEXT>
THE SPANISH Government was yesterday trying hard to stave off a rise in
interest rates after agreeing to a 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta at
the emergency meeting of the EC monetary committee in Brussels in the early
morning.
By late afternoon, the Bank of Spain is understood to have injected some
Dollars 12bn into the interbank market to dampen strong pressure for higher
rates. The central bank, though, said it had not intervened in the foreign
exchange markets and the peseta showed some signs of stabilising around
Pta70 to the D-Mark, well down on its new parity of Pta68.4 but still
comfortably clear of its Pta72.6 floor.
The Spanish authorities are hoping desperately that the devaluation agreed
in Brussels would see the currency through at least the rest of the week,
until the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Sunday. Upward
pressure on rates in the interbank market showed there were still worries
about the fate of the Spanish currency ahead of the French vote.
Spanish officials went to Brussels on Wednesday night determined to remain
in the exchange rate mechanism and there was considerable satisfaction in
Madrid yesterday that this had been achieved. 'ERM membership is the biggest
asset Spain has,' said Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief economist at Banco
Santander de Negocios.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, told MPs that the government had
been forced to devalue to protect itself against speculators. It had been
inevitable because after the exit of sterling and the lire speculators would
have turned against the peseta and an interest rate rise would have been
unable to prevent it.
Nevertheless, the devaluation badly undermines Madrid's long-standing
commitment to a strong currency and passes the burden of fighting inflation
on to the budget.
Mr de Pinies said he believed the Bank of Spain would need to raise its 13
per cent base rate by up to 2 percentage points if the French vote against
the treaty on Sunday, but warned that this would be 'a very dangerous thing
to do as we enter a recessionary phase in the economy'.
The other solution would be to devalue further, he said. But the 5 per cent
devaluation is already likely, to add at least one percentage point to
Spanish inflation this year said Mr Jorge Hay of Banco Central Hispano.
Business insisted that complementary moves by the government were necessary
to maintain the credibility of the new exchange rate. 'The devaluation means
nothing unless it comes together with a budget that sharply reduces the
public deficit and forces through salary moderation,' said Mr Guillermo de
la Dehesa, chairman of Spain's association of chambers of commerce.
Mr Solchaga is due to present his 1993 budget to parliament next month, a
task already hampered by huge overruns on spending and income shortfalls
this year. Draft proposals suggest the government has been considering a
nominal increase in spending of 8 per cent but this, yesterday, was
beginning to look distinctly expansionary. Mr de Pinies said Madrid should
now be looking at a 5 per cent increase 'at the most'.
Spain's public sector deficit in the first half of this year was 40 per cent
up on 1991 and 116 per cent higher in the month of July. The current account
deficit in the first half overshot official forecasts by more than Pta428bn
to stand at Pta1,405bn. The country is running the second highest trade
deficit in the west.
Yesterday's devaluation was the first since Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez'
socialist Government devalued immediately after coming to power in 1982.

MORE than 40 per cent of the population in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain
have not the slightest idea whether the Maastricht treaty on European union
is a good or bad thing, the latest batch of opinion polls shows. Only in
France, where a referendum on the treaty is due on Sunday, is the Don't Know
category down to a mere 15 per cent.
That is the conclusion of five co-ordinated polls, published yesterday by
Germany's Infas research group, which show that the Yes vote in France is
still ahead of the No vote - but only by 3 points.
The figures, published from a poll taken on September 6 and 7, are 44 per
cent in favour, 41 per cent against, and 15 per cent undecided.
Only in Britain would the No vote in a referendum be higher than the Yes
vote - if all the Don't Knows abstain. There were 24 per cent in favour, 31
per cent against, and no less than 45 per cent undecided.
In Germany, there is still a majority in favour, according to Infas: 36 per
cent would say Yes, 24 per cent No, and 40 per cent Don't Know.
Italy and Spain are by far the most positive: 45 per cent Yes, 14 per cent
No and 41 per cent Don't know in Italy; 40 per cent Yes, 19 per cent No and
41 per cent undecided in Spain.

Europe's motor - British problems will not kill Maastricht or the ERM

<TEXT>
THE European currency crisis inevitably raises a big question mark over the
future prospects of the European Monetary System (EMS). When two of the
participants are abruptly forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, in a
free float which their governments desperately wanted to avoid, and a third
is forced to devalue as a by-product, it is obvious that there was something
deeply wrong with the way the system was functioning, and quite likely with
the system itself.
But to go on to argue, as some commentators have done - that floating
sterling automatically spells the end of the ERM, consigns to oblivion all
plans for economic and monetary union in Europe, and renders wholly
superfluous the French referendum on Sunday on the Maastricht treaty - that
seems a leap too far. Above all, it is characteristically and damagingly
anglocentric.
Take the Maastricht referendum first. This week's currency storm may well
have repercussions on Sunday's vote, but it would take a wise man to predict
with any confidence whether these would be more likely to strengthen the Yes
or the No tendency.
The anti-Maastricht camp may claim that the crisis shows you cannot believe
the British or trust the Germans; but the pro-Maastricht lobby will surely
claim that France has been largely protected from the storm precisely
because it has stuck close to Germany, with a hard-franc policy whose
credibility is based on many years of a consistent Eurocentric economic
policy.
How the voters will react to these contradictory arguments must be a matter
of pure speculation. The No vote may well be fuelled by the belief that the
policy of European economic convergence is responsible for low growth and
high unemployment. It is not immediately obvious, however, why French voters
should take this latest episode in the long-running bankruptcy of British
economic and monetary policy as an additional reason for rejecting the
Maastricht treaty.
On the contrary, they might conclude that the Exchange Rate Mechanism is a
reassuring port in the storm, and that the case for Emu remains exactly
where it was before, as argued in the Delors Report: the opening of a single
European market, with free movement of goods and capital, and linked
exchange rates, requires much greater economic co-ordination and probably a
single monetary policy.
There is just one proviso: the treaty recognises that some European
economies might not be in any shape to accept the corresponding disciplines,
and makes explicit provision for the possibility of a two-speed monetary
union. This week's currency crisis has just proved the hypothesis in spades.
But Germany, France and the Benelux countries may well be able to sustain
the central core of the ERM, and there is nothing in the sterling crisis
this week to prove that they could not take a new step forward towards
monetary union later this decade.
Most extraordinary among the aspects of the British government's performance
this week was its attempt on Wednesday night to have the entire ERM system
suspended until after the French referendum. The most probable consequence
of a temporary suspension of the ERM is that it would prove permanent, and
there would be no ERM to return to.
The more fundamental point is that Maastricht is an essentially political
treaty, the culmination of a shared strategy of European integration,
developed by the founding members of the Community over the past 40 years.
The motor of that strategy is the political alliance of France and Germany,
which has consistently led the way for the development of the Community,
buttressed by their association with Italy and the Benelux countries.
It is hard to predict in detail just how these core countries will attempt a
rescue if the French electorate turns against the treaty on Sunday; it is
difficult to see how the Community will keep the treaty on the rails even if
the result is Yes.
But, among all the options available, the one which seems most unlikely is
that France should abandon its strategy of a tight alliance with Germany.
Conversely, it is almost as unlikely that Germany should abandon its
strategy of a tight alliance with France.
The Germans have some temptation to turn inwards, to their unification
problems, and some temptation to assert a bigger international role for
Germany, as at the UN. But, at the end of the day, the Germans and the
French are almost certain to revert to their joint alliance as their top
foreign policy priority.
The Germans have no alternative that looks equally plausible in the medium
term; the French have no alternative at all.
This week's British proposal for a suspension of the ERM was a transparent
attempt to prevent the appearance of too obvious a two-speed Europe, with
Britain (and Italy) consigned to the slower track. The hard political fact
is that there has always been a two-speed Europe, and Britain has always
been on the slower track because that is the European speed it has
preferred.
Prime Minister John Major has repeatedly said his aim was to put Britain at
the heart of Europe, and he continues to repeat his commitment to the
principle of the ERM. But the heart of Europe is defined by the relationship
of France and Germany, and it is their relationship which will determine the
future of the Community.

forecasts
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government is to submit new budgetary forecasts for 1993-95 in
the next seven days, afters its original figures were criticised as
inadequate in parliament last week, Haig Simonian reports from Milan.
The decision yesterday to revise the forecasts, prepared each July, follows
the recent turmoil in the currency markets.
The predictions, which envisage a fall in the budget deficit to just 4.9 per
cent of gross domestic product by 1995, haf already been attacked by
economists as too upbeat.
The figures, drawn up soon after the new government of Prof Giuliano Amato
came to office, showed total public sector debt was expected to fall
marginally to 113.5 per cent of GDP in 1985 after reaching a peak of 113.6
per cent in 1994.
Even some ministers have admitted the inflation forecasts made in July were
optimistic.  Price rises, which declined to annual 5.3 per cent om 1993, 2.5
per cent in 1994 and 2 per cent in 1995.  'That's even more optimistic after
the latest devaluations,' said one bank economist yesterday.
The economic growth targets of 1.6 per cent next year, 2.4 per cent in 1994
and 2.6 per cent in 1995 are also seen as being on the bright side. Most
contentious of all the assumptions was the outlook for interest rates, which
underlie all the forecasts.

GERMANY reacted yesterday to British charges of complicity in the plight of
the pound, more in sorrow - or in silence - than in anger.
A thunderous silence was the reaction of the Bundesbank itself, an ironic
answer to the charge from Downing Street that top German officials had
precipitated the currency collapse with their loose talk.
Off the record, the charge was politely rejected. On the record, it only
said the latest exchange rate realignments in the Exchange Rate Mechanism
were 'an appropriate answer to the previous tensions'.
Mr Theo Waigel, minister of finance, was the most forthright in his
response: 'To put the blame on Germany is not fair. I do not think that
apportioning blame is right. I think everyone should consider what the cause
is in their own area of responsibility.'
Indeed the instant reaction to the bitterness of British officials, who had
spelt out a series of occasions on which the Bundesbank's alleged
'whispering campaign' had undermined the pound, was to talk of 'the very
natural desire of the British government to find a scapegoat'.
'The anger of the moment is always understandable,' said one well-placed
official in Bonn. 'But we must distinguish very clearly between immediate
irritation and a sober consideration of our long-term relations. Of course
we understand that one needs a whipping boy at such a moment, and it is easy
to look abroad to find one.'
He insisted personal relations between Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
British prime minister John Major remained 'really close', which could never
be said of the chancellor's relations with Mr Major's predecessor, Lady
Thatcher. And he listed the occasions on which Germany acted as honest
broker for Britain in the Maastricht negotiations, helping push through the
'opt-out' clause on economic and monetary union, and the similar British
exclusion from EC social policy.
In spite of the oil pouring on troubled waters, immediate difficulties
remain. There is some doubt over the plans for a bilateral summit on
November 11, and who will attend.
Germany's determination not to go ahead with production of the European
Fighter Aircraft is a big bone of contention, and has badly soured relations
between Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
his British counterpart.
There has also been grumbling about British 'high-handedness' in the EC
presidency, directed above all at Mr Norman Lamont, the British Chancellor.
His obvious delight in the isolation of Germany at the Bath meeting of
finance ministers two weeks ago has caused lasting bitterness.
That comes back to the currency questions, which remain the most explosive
of all. The German attitude remains that if the Bundesbank and Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, its president, were talking down the pound, they were only
telling the truth.
Bankers and economists in Frankfurt yesterday closed ranks to defend him. 'I
cannot imagine that Mr Schlesinger brought about the sterling crisis
single-handed,' said Mr Peter Pietsch, Commerzbank economist, yesterday. 'On
Monday they got a lot of approval for what they did in cutting interest
rates. How come that has all been forgotten now?'

FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Series of surrenders for Amato - The
government has survived an unprecedented battering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRISIS has lent a cruel touch to Italy's cartoonists. One of the most
acerbic has Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, and his three economic
ministers dressed in military uniform with their hands raised beside a white
flag and a burning of pile of lire.
For the 2 1/2 -month-old Amato government, the events of the past few days
have been a continual series of surrenders to the overwhelming pressures on
the lira. The latest was the decision yesterday morning to let the lira
float at least until Monday. Only 12 hours earlier the Bank of Italy denied
any such move was contemplated.
On the surface, no post-war Italian government has ever been so battered and
tossed by fast-moving events. Indeed, by the short-lived standards of the
previous 50 governments, it is remarkable that such a weak four-party
coalition has survived so far.
With a parliament still smarting from his surprise decision the previous
Wednesday to seek emergency powers to deal with the economic and financial
crisis, Prof Amato was roundly criticised for presenting the weekend 7 per
cent devaluation of the lira in overly optimistic terms.
Members of his own Socialist party were sniping at him, and his relations
with the Bank of Italy, the one institution which has sought to keep its
head above the fray, were strained by arguments over how to defend the lira.
His resolve was certainly stiffened by a meeting with President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, whose clear support for the prime minister has become an important
factor. Mr Scalfaro, in his brief period of office, has established
considerable authority which few politicians or parties are likely to
challenge lightly.
Equally, the prospect in such turbulent circumstances of a political vacuum,
no matter how brief, seems to have concentrated the minds of politicians.
Prof Amato has been able to exploit this as a desperate but ultimately
powerful card to sustain his government. His departure would profoundly
damage Italy's international credibility and confirm market scepticism that
the country is incapable of providing stable governments.
Moreover, Prof Amato has said on several occasions that a new government
would merely face the same set of problems, and almost certainly have to
adopt similar policies. Whatever the outcome of the French referendum on
Maastricht on Sunday and short-term developments in the Exchange Rate
Mechanism, Italy will still face external pressure to tackle its disastrous
public finances and reduce the public-sector deficit.
This is set to shoot beyond 11 per cent of GDP next year without tough
remedial action. Thus the precise composition of an Italian government
becomes irrelevant if policies are being forced upon it from outside,
especially by the markets.
But there are practical internal considerations which militate against a
change of government now. A new government would first have to look to the
narrow 16-seat majority provided by the present coalition of Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. Alternatively, there
would be an attempt to establish new alliances, perhaps across party lines,
with a break in the existing structure of both the Socialists and Christian
Democrats.
Inevitably, this would be time-consuming and probably accelerate fresh
elections - and none of the big parties is in fit shape to go to the
country. They have no money and are split internally, with the exception of
the emergent Lombard League. Their leaderships are discredited in the
public's eye both for clinging to power, and as a result of the Milan
corruption scandal and the awesome extent of the abuse of power exposed. Now
the public is blaming them for blithely ignoring Italy's problems for
decades and producing the present mess.
At last the politicians are showing signs they can no longer ignore this
huge ground-swell of discontent over their incompetence and excessive
privileges, treating the state as their personal war chest. This week
parliament rescinded plans to award its members an extra L750,000 (Pounds
335) a month in allowances and refused the pay rises of as high as L62m a
year, backdated to 1991, granted by the Andreotti government to the heads of
state companies.
Prof Amato has garnered considerable public support by presenting his as a
technocratic government trying to tackle long-ignored problems.
He may not obtain from parliament the emergency powers he wants to take
economic decisions without resort to long parliamentary procedures. But he
looks set to have parliament's endorsement for fundamental reforms of four
areas eating away at the budget - pensions, public health, the civil service
and regional administration.
The government faces two immediate issues. The first concerns the 1993
budget and the extent to which efforts to find nearly L100,000bn to hold
down the deficit convince the markets - which may be in the mood to feel
that nothing is enough. The second centres on the impact of the devaluation
and floating of the lira. Its fall to a more realistic level - an effective
devaluation of at least 15 per cent against the D-Mark, economists argue -
could make up for the inadequacy of Monday's 7 per cent realignment.
But equally, such a fall might have a greater inflationary impact, despite
the domestic recession, than the government can control. A central pillar of
government policy in holding down prices is a tripartite agreement with the
unions and employers. An outline deal reached in July de-indexing wages now
looks fragile - especially if the unions judge the government unable either
to keep inflation below 5 per cent or to introduce measures which ensure the
sacrifices will be borne equally by everyone.
Beyond this, the reactions of ordinary Italians are hard to predict. They
have seen the wealthy scramble to get their money out of the country while
they themselves are only just beginning to realise the scale of the crisis
engulfing Italy. But soon there will be higher taxes, more unemployment and
the soft living standards, taken from granted after decades of growth, will
be eroded.

FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Pressure grows for Germans to hold
their own referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NARROW Yes vote in France in favour of the Maastricht Treaty on European
union on Sunday would strengthen the campaign for a referendum in Germany,
according to political analysts.
A No vote would bring the entire ratification process in the German
parliament to a standstill, while the whole European Community takes stock
of the situation.
Already the campaign for a referendum, hitherto not a serious possibility,
is gathering more substantial supporters.
Mr Peter Gauweiler, the Bavarian environment minister, a leading figure in
the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the man who coined the phrase
'Esperanto-money' for the future European currency, yesterday issued a
public appeal for such a move.
He was joined by Mr Manfred Brunner, of the Free Democrats (FDP), the chef
de cabinet of Mr Manfred Bangemann, the senior German commissioner in
Brussels. Mr Brunner, whose anti-Maastricht views have been long known, was
immediately sacked from his post in the Commission.
There is also growing support for a referendum among the opposition Social
Democrats, who are already campaigning for such popular votes to be included
in the rewritten German constitution.
On the other hand, a clear majority of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
and the CSU remain opposed to any such vote, not least because they fear the
issue is too complicated, and it would become confused with domestic
politics - as in France.
If the French decision is No, then the Social Democrats believe that the
entire ratification process - due to begin with a first reading in the
Bundestag on October 7 - should be abandoned. The CDU is more cautious,
suggesting that it should merely be put on ice until the future is clear.
SPD strategists also believe the contents of Maastricht should simply be set
aside, and European integration pursued through 'functional integration'
issue by issue, rather than through attempts at 'institutional integration'
as in the Maastricht Treaty.
They admit that such an attitude might put them close to the position of
Britain's Mr John Major, but believe it would be the only realistic way to
continue the integration process.

FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Irish punt drops to floor
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government reaffirmed its commitment to the narrow band of the
exchange rate mechanism yesterday as the punt dropped to its floor level of
DM2.619, triggering intervention by the Irish central bank and the
Bundesbank.
Later it recovered to trade at DM2.6275. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance
minister, said: 'We have to hold our confidence in the ERM and stay firm.
Our position is to remain in the narrow band. That's what keeps our economy
on course and our stability. There is no immediate concern but we will
continue to monitor the situation.' The government would 'do what is
necessary' to keep the punt within the ERM narrow band.
A central bank spokesman confirmed that it had been supporting the punt
yesterday and the Bundesbank said that it had bought IPounds 13.5m.
Ireland broke its long-standing currency link with sterling in 1979 when it
joined the ERM. The Irish economy, however, is still dependent on the UK
market for 32 per cent of its exports, and many Irish businesses have
subsidiaries in the UK.
Some industrial leaders were saying in private yesterday that a continuing
decline in sterling might force the Irish government to a devaluation.
At one point yesterday, the pound sterling fell by some 7 per cent to parity
with the Irish currency.
Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy stockbrokers in Dublin, said:
'The fundamentals of the Irish economy are good.  If sterling devaluation is
a one-off change, and sterling re-enters the ERM, then we can handle parity.
 Sterling continuing outside the ERM is another matter.'
Mr Michael Noonan, the finance spokesman for the opposition Fine Gael party,
backed the government's stance, saying: 'The UK is now the sick man of
Europe.
It would be a great mistake, after 13 years of effort to get a strong
currency linked to the D-Mark, to abandon that and link ourselves to
sterling again.' He said that after a general realignment of exchange rates,
there would be an easing of interest rates and 'we will then emerge with a
strong currency and lower interest rates'.
The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin this week
revised up to 3.5 per cent its GNP growth forecast for the Irish economy for
1992, and predicted a surge in the balance-of-payments current-account
surplus by 36 per cent to IPounds 2.2bn, largely due to strong performances
in manufacturing industry.
Prof Kieran Kennedy, ESRI director, said: 'There is a 10 per cent
competitiveness cushion in the exchange rate.  The economy could endure
sterling falling to parity or even to 1.05 against the punt without
tremendous pain.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Reed and Elsevier merge to create Pounds 5bn publishing
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REED International and Elsevier of the Netherlands have agreed to merge,
creating one of the world's biggest publishers with a market capitalisation
of more than Pounds 5bn.
The combined group, to be named Reed Elsevier, will have a total of 25,000
employees, with 11,000 in the UK, 4,500 in the Netherlands and 7,500 in the
US.
The merger, due to take effect on January 1, will be on a 50-50 basis
without any premium to either set of shareholders, and both Reed and
Elsevier will keep separate stock exchange listings.
Reed, whose interests range from legal publishing and business publications
to consumer magazines and local and regional newspapers, will, however,
receive a significant minority stake in Elsevier to reflect Reed's higher
market capitalisation.
Mr Pierre Vinken, chairman of Elsevier who will also be chairman of the
merged company, said Elsevier had in the past decade achieved world
leadership in scientific information publishing. 'We now want to extend this
success in other publishing areas.'
Mr Peter Davis, Reed's chairman, who will be chief executive and deputy
chairman of Reed Elsevier, said that for Reed the merger 'achieves two of
our strategic aims, a stronger presence in Europe and in subscription-based
information publishing'.
Three years ago Elsevier and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, agreed
an exchange of shares with a view towards a merger. The stakes were later
sold and the companies went their separate ways.
Based on forecasts for the year to the end of 1992, the new group would on a
pro forma basis have revenues of Pounds 2.442bn or Fl 7.838bn and pre-tax
profits of Pounds 424m.
Reed's share price rose to 531p, an increase of 45p on the day, because the
deal was seen to increase the group's stake in such high margin areas as
scientific publishing.
On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, however, Elsevier's share price fell to a
low of Fl 104.7 in the early afternoon from Wednesday's close of Fl 116.7
before recovering slightly to close at Fl 105.2 - a decline of 9.8 per cent
on the day.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Franc, krone and punt fall to ERM floors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc, Danish krone and Irish punt yesterday fell to their floors
in the European exchange rate mechanism, prompting central bank
intervention, as speculators moved on to new targets after pummelling the
pound, lira and peseta on Wednesday.
That assault, which forced the British government to suspend sterling from
membership of the ERM on Wednesday night, led early yesterday to a temporary
withdrawal of the lira from the ERM and a 5 per cent devaluation of the
peseta.
Those moves were agreed at an emergency session of the European Community
monetary committee in Brussels after the Bundesbank - despite pressure from
other European governments at the meeting - had declined to deliver a
further cut in German interest rates.
Despite the currency turmoil, the European Commission mounted a solid
defence of the plan for a single European currency, with officials saying
the ERM had proved its efficacy but had also shown its limitations. They
argued that this week's events in the currency markets demonstrated the
imperative need for a single currency.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president and inspirer of the Maastricht plan
for economic and monetary union, acknowledged that the EMS was far from
being 'a miracle cure' but added: 'It is only through common disciplines and
a single currency that we can avoid the sort of events we have just
witnessed.'
France and Italy yesterday called for a European Community summit meeting
after Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on political and
economic union.
Italy said European leaders needed to weigh up the referendum result and to
restore immediate monetary discipline as quickly as possible.
The new pressure within the ERM reinforced the view in financial markets
that the system in its current form may have been mortally wounded by this
week's speculative onslaught in currency markets.
The Italian government said it planned to rejoin the ERM on Tuesday, but
currency traders were sceptical that this would be possible in the event of
a No vote in the French referendum.
The British government - while reaffirming its intention to put sterling
back in the system - let it be known an early re-entry was not likely.
After intervention, the punt, krone and French franc finished above their
ERM floors against the D-Mark, but the free-floating lira slipped below the
new lower limit set only on Sunday.
Sterling closed 4 per cent lower against the D-Mark in London, at DM2.64,
compared with its pre-suspension DM2.778 floor in the ERM, a level it
maintained in late New York trading.
As the Far Eastern markets opened today, the pound remained steady around
last night's level, while the franc hovered close to its ERM floor against
the D-Mark. The lira was trading around L835 to the D-Mark, down from about
L829 in the European markets.
Last night, devaluation of the punt was ruled out by Mr Bertie Ahern, the
Irish finance minister. As the franc weakened, Mr Michel Sapin, French
finance minister, attempted to defend the currency by maintaining that its
value could only go up in the wake of the current chaos.
Bond market analysts in Paris argued that the ERM would take years to
recover and that monetary union was out of the question for the time being.
'The markets have already voted on Maastricht', said Mr Christopher Potts,
market strategist at Banque Indosuez. What was now at stake in the Sunday
vote was whether the franc would be able to continue to keep its link with
the D-Mark, he said.
The Danish government, like the Irish, reaffirmed its commitment to the
mechanism, arguing that the state of its economy did not justify a
devaluation.
In the British government bond market, short-dated bonds rose on
expectations that UK interest rates would soon move lower.
Italian bond prices also rallied sharply, gaining up to 1 1/2 points. But
Irish, Spanish and German bonds fell.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Major strives to salvage policy: FT-SE jumps 105 points as
base rates are cut to 10 per cent and sterling sinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday sought to salvage the government's economic strategy
from the wreckage of devaluation by insisting that sterling would eventually
rejoin the exchange rate mechanism.
But senior ministers were forced to admit that it might be months before
sterling was again tied to the D-Mark as it continued to sink in the
currency markets. Meanwhile, base rates were cut to 10 per cent and the
stock market soared.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisted the defeat of inflation would
remain at the core of his policy. However, ministerial colleagues said the
government could not now avoid a fundamental reappraisal of its overall
economic strategy.
Mr Major also faced the threat of revolt by Tory MPs over his approach to
Europe and the economy, with a growing number arguing that he should abandon
the ERM entirely in favour of a rapid cut in interest rates to 'kick-start'
economic recovery.
Mr Lamont, who was given a vote of confidence at an emergency cabinet
meeting, flatly rejected suggestions that he should resign. He said: 'I am
not going to resign. I have been operating the policy of the whole
government, and I know that I have the support of the prime minister and the
full support of my cabinet colleagues.' In his first formal television
interviews since the crisis erupted, Mr Lamont said: 'What we faced
yesterday - and in the last couple of weeks - has been a wholly exceptional
set of circumstances, the like of which haven't been seen for 20 years or
more.
'It affected not just this country but Italy, which has also had to leave
the exchange rate mechanism, and Spain, which has had to devalue its
currency as well. What I did yesterday was simple commonsense in the face of
a whirlwind.'
Mr Lamont denied there had been a devaluation of the pound. He told ITN: 'We
have not resorted to devaluation. The pound is now currently floating and we
will have to see what level it finds.'
The damage-limitation exercise did not dispel widespread doubts at
Westminster over the chancellor's long-term future. Some of his colleagues
believe his authority has been fatally undermined.
Cabinet ministers said that the political row over the Bundesbank's role in
causing the sterling crisis would delay attempts by the government to ratify
the Maastricht treaty even if it was approved by the French electorate on
Sunday.
It is now thought that detailed debate on the legislation will have to be
delayed until after the Edinburgh summit in December.
As the Bank of England reversed the 2-point rise in base rates announced as
part of its vain efforts on Wednesday, the pound slid more than 13 pfennigs
below its previous ERM floor to close in London at DM2.6400.
But the reversal of Wednesday's sharp rise in interest rates, and
expectations of further rate cuts gave share prices their biggest boost
since the Conservative party's election victory in April.
The FT-SE 100 share index closed up 105.6 at 2,483.9 in one of the most
heavily traded sessions on record. Equity dealers sensed that sterling's
effective devaluation and suspension from the ERM could signal a shift in UK
government policies in the direction of lower interest rates.
Mr Lamont, who appeared in surprisingly resilient mood after the drama of
Wednesday's devaluation, indicated that he wanted to make a number of
assessments before deciding when and at what rate to take the pound back
into the ERM.
The most immediate would be the pattern of exchange after the results of the
French referendum. But the chancellor also wants a thorough examination by
the European Community of the effectiveness of co-operation between
governments and central banks within the ERM.
Such a debate would focus inevitably on the obligations of the Bundesbank in
helping to defend the weaker currencies.
Mr Lamont's next concern is to get confirmation that German interest rates -
at the root of sterling's problems in the ERM - are set firmly on a downward
path before fixing a new rate for the pound against the D-Mark.
That suggests the Treasury believes there may be scope for further small
cuts in British interest rates over the next few months if the inflation
rate continues to fall at the present rate.
In spite of Mr Lamont's devaluation denial, there was little conviction
behind Downing Street's suggestion that it was possible that sterling could
rise significantly before it was taken back into the ERM.
Mr Major's aides were keen to stress that every member of the cabinet had
endorsed at yesterday's meeting the decision to rejoin eventually.
Some ministers were also raising the question of whether Mr Major should
re-examine the option of granting statutory independence to the Bank of
England - an idea favoured by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary. The aim would be to restore credibility to the government's
anti-inflation strategy. But colleagues said that after his experience in
recent days with the Bundesbank, Mr Lamont was disinclined to consider it as
an immediate option.
Seizing on the cabinet's attempt to rally to Mr Lamont, Labour gave notice
that it would target Mr Major as chief culprit for the sterling crisis in
next Thursday's Commons debate.
While Mr John Smith, the party leader, claimed that the chaotic events
revealed 'muddle and confusion' at the heart of Mr Major's government, Mr
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, quoting from Mr Major's speech made
less than a week ago that ruled out devaluation, said: 'It is time for the
prime minister to explain in full in a statement to the British people what
the government policy for the economy now is.'

The visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen gave the assurance to
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, according to the premier's office.
Qian emphasised that China would do nothing to harm the Middle East peace
process, said a statement from Mr Rabin's office. 'He said China will not
sell weapons to the region,' the statement added.
Qian, on a three-day visit to Israel, assured Israel on Wednesday that a

Israel has in the past voiced concern at Chinese arms sales to countries in
the Middle East.
China this week confirmed it would boycott Middle East arms control talks
between the permanent members of the UN Security Council in protest at
planned sales of US warplanes sales to Taiwan.

FT  18 SEP 92 / BNL case reversal may embarrass Bush

THE US court case over Dollars 5bn of illegal Iraqi loans made by the
Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) took an
unexpected turn yesterday when lawyers for the former branch manager of BNL
Atlanta said he wished to withdraw his guilty plea and face a full-scale
trial instead.
The court, which was supposed to be considering a prison sentence for Mr
Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL manager, was told that he had been
pressed by government prosecutors to support their theory that he was the
sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans scandal.
More than Dollars 2bn of the BNL loans helped to finance Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and ballistic weapons projects.
The reason for changing Mr Drogoul's plea from guilty to innocent, it was
argued, was fresh evidence indicating that he had acted with the approval of
BNL's management in Rome and with the knowledge of the US government.
BNL has denied that it was aware of the Iraqi loans, and the US prosecutors
have argued that Mr Drogoul defrauded BNL. But defence lawyers have cited
evidence to the contrary, including a 1991 CIA report, disclosed in the US
Congress this week, which states that BNL officials in Rome knew of the
Iraqi loans and even signed some of them.
Judge Marvin Shoob, who has already said he does not believe Mr Drogoul
acted alone, announced he would rule on the plea motion next Tuesday in
Atlanta.
The Bush administration could face serious embarrassment if the judge were
to decide to order a full BNL trial.
Federal prosecutors said they were inclined to oppose the request and the
judge, after first saying he was unlikely to grant the motion, then said:
'Candidly I don't know what I am going to do. The defence may have good
reasons for changing the plea.'
Mr Bobby Lee Cook, the prominent Georgia lawyer defending Mr Drogoul, told
the FT he would argue that the BNL manager was carrying out the policies of
BNL, with acquiescence and permission from BNL in Rome. 'Mr Drogoul was also
facilitating the well-known policy of the American government in supplying
arms, technology and other materiel to Iraq. He believed that the government
of the United States knew precisely what was happening and did not object
because it was consonant with their policy at that time,' the lawyer said.
In court yesterday, Mr Cook named a former US intelligence agent as one of
the key intermediaries in the BNL Atlanta Iraqi loan programme.
'It is obvious from this hearing that the government has not been forthright
or honest,' Mr Cook claimed. 'The government would have the court and the
public believe this entire affair was designed and orchestrated by a young
branch manager, without any knowledge or approval from Rome. That position
offends logic and also turns the facts upside-down.
'It is an effort on behalf of the administration to rewrite and to
reconstitute history, and to hide and suppress from the court and from the
people the devastating and catastrophic blunders that our government made in
arming and supporting Saddam Hussein,' Mr Cook said.

<TEXT>
THE US Federal Communications Commission has ruled that telephone companies
must allow competitors greater access to public telephone networks. The
decision paves the way for competition in the Dollars 90bn US regional
telephone service market.
'A monopoly assures the quiet life. I think the quiet life has ended,' said
Mr Alfred Sikes, FCC chairman. Its action yesterday represented 'a historic
step' in opening 'one of the last monopoly reserves' in the
telecommunications industry.
'This decision finally gives customers the ability to select the company
that provides their local (telephone) access service,' said Mr Royce
Holland, president of Metropolitan Fiber Systems, a company that has been
seeking access to the local telephone service market.
The FCC, in a series of unanimous decisions, is to allow companies that
operate private networks to connect their networks to local telephone
networks and has proposed letting such connections take public telephone
services.
The regulator also decided to change eventually the way local telephone
companies price the use of their networks by long-distance telephone service
providers.
Prices will not change for the next 12 months, however, until a plan has
been designed to link access charges to the volume of telephone traffic
provided by a long-distance telephone company.
'With expanded competition, the FCC now should move quickly to reduce
regulation of local exchange companies. That would represent further
progress toward a fully competitive marketplace and be beneficial to
consumers,' said Ameritech, the parent company of telephone companies in the
Great Lakes region.

TRAVEL companies are encouraging customers to book their summer 1993
holidays now.
If the pound remains weak until Christmas, foreign holidays may become more
expensive and some tour operators may abandon their no-surcharge policy.
Mr Andrew Wilson, commercial director of Thomas Cook, travel agents, says a
stronger dollar might eventually place some upward pressure on prices.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Lamont denies shift in policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont last night gave the following interview to BBC television
news:
Interviewer: It was said again and again that the pound would not be
devalued and the government would take whatever measures are necessary to
prevent that. Those statements turned out not to be true. How can anybody
rely on your word?
Mr Lamont: 'I have not sought a devaluation, nor I think did the Italian
prime minister, nor the Spanish finance minister, all of whom found
themselves overwhelmed by the extraordinary events of the last couple of
weeks, the like of which we haven't seen for 20 or 30 years.
'It has been a very exceptional set of circumstances. The French referendum
has created extraordinary strains within the exchange rate mechanism and
this has posed enormous problems, not just for us, but for many other
countries.
'I don't suppose the Swedish finance minister found it very easy putting up
interest rates to some 500 per cent over-night.
'That is the sort of extraordinary circumstance that we have been living
through. What I did was simple common sense. The decision I made was an
unavoidable one.'
That justified you in being unable to live up to your word?
'I believe the decision that I made was the correct one, since I have not
sought a devaluation, I did not seek to leave the exchange rate mechanism,
but we were overwhelmed by these wholly exceptional circumstances.'
How was it that the centrepiece as you described it of the government's
whole economic strategy for the next many years could be destroyed in one
day?
'Well, what we have done is to suspend our membership and I have made it
clear that we intend to resume our membership when circumstances allow. But
our policy is a continuous one.
'Our policy is to get inflation down and there will be no let-up in that at
all. We have been dramatically successful in getting inflation down from
nearly 11 per cent to under 4 per cent in less than two years. It's been a
long, hard slog and I can assure you, having worked so hard to get this
country to be a country of low inflation, I am not going to chuck it away
just in a few weeks' time. I refuse to do that.'
But, chancellor, again, how did it happen that the centrepiece of membership
of the ERM was destroyed in one day?
'What happened was that we faced an extraordinary set of circumstances - a
huge speculative flow that was shifting because of the uncertainties caused
by the French referendum. Those were circumstances the like of which we
haven't seen for decades.'
And which you did not foresee?
'I did not foresee that we would be forced to take the decision that we had
to take.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Managers in scramble to
minimise risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS STERLING sank further yesterday, foreign exchange dealers were not the
only professionals active in the market. Fund managers and corporate
treasurers with exposure to sterling have had a busy couple of days.
'It was a case of trying to minimise the risk in a portfolio,' said Mr
Terence Prideaux of Kemper Investment Management, a US investment house.
'Given the size of the currency flows, any prudent investment manager would
have had to explore the question of currency exposure.'
Another fund manager, who said he had taken a position against sterling 'at
the margin' to protect a portfolio already heavily weighted against the
pound, said: 'You knew, as soon as 15 per cent interest rates were
announced, that it wasn't sustainable. It was just a non-starter.'
Dealers said that there was activity from a wide range of fund managers,
with Swiss and US managers particularly quick off the mark.
While some fund managers moved assets between markets, others tried to hedge
currency exposure within their existing portfolios.
'The main focus was hedging currencies against the D-Mark,' said Mr Axel
Benkner of DWS, the German fund management group.
Corporate treasurers, while still assessing the long-term effects of recent
events on their businesses, were also active in moving against potential
short-term exposure in recent days.
'There has been a fair amount of activity' among corporate treasurers, said
Mr Tony Rice, group treasurer at British Aerospace. 'Those of us with dollar
exposure have had to sit on our hands for a while. Today was an opportunity
to put cover in place at much lower rates.'
However, a number of fund managers and corporate treasurers complained that
the volatile market conditions eroded liquidity, just when they most needed
to get their business done.
'The problem we were up against is that in times of such uncertainty banks
are unwilling to commit themselves in the forward market,' he said.
'This morning the long-dated forward foreign exchange market disappeared and
the sterling swaps market was gone for several hours.'
Even in the spot foreign exchange market - the world's most liquid market,
trading became more difficult, as the margin between buy and sell prices on
the dollar/ sterling rate, normally between 3 basis points and 10 basis
points, went up to 50 basis points.
In those conditions, some treasurers decided that discretion was the better
part of valour.
'We were reluctant to deal in a disorderly market,' said one corporate
treasurer at a UK company, 'so we decided to stay on the sidelines until
things calmed down.'
Corporate treasurers and fund managers often hedge exposure in the options
market.
However, the recent level of volatility - and growing demand as sterling
came under increasing pressure in recent weeks - pushed prices up to
extremely high levels, which makes it uneconomical to hedge using options.
Instead, activity has been concentrated in the forward foreign exchange
market and even in the spot market, contributing to the pressure against the
pound.
The surge of volume in the foreign exchange market, coupled with the
widening of spreads (essentially, the fees charged by banks) will
substantially have boosted trading profits at banks.
But the biggest source of profits for foreign exchange traders, at least on
Wednesday, was that, in spite of tumultuous market conditions, they found
themselves with a one-way bet, as the Bank of England proved an unlimited
buyer of sterling throughout the day.
Total central bank intervention on Wednesday alone may have topped Pounds
20bn.
A senior executive in one of London's moneybroking firms, which are reckoned
to handle around 40 per cent of foreign exchange business on a typical day,
said that the leading broking firms alone had handled more than Pounds 10bn
of sterling purchases by the Bank of England on that day.
As the Bank intervened in the market, offering to buy sterling in minimum
amounts of Pounds 30m - compared to a normal market size of Pounds 5m-Pounds
10m - it found a succession of banks and corporate treasurers willing to
sell.
'Every bank around the world had taken a position against sterling,' the
broker said.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Business faces up to stronger
Dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR UK industrialists bemused by the continued upheaval in European
currencies yesterday, one fact stood out like a beacon. The sterling-dollar
rate is now at Dollars 1.77. At the start of the month it was at Dollars 2.
Sterling is thus 12 per cent lower than it was a fortnight ago.
For reasons that are partly historic, the dollar remains the most important
single currency for UK manufacturers dealing with the outside world. In
terms of actual trading, as opposed to the translation of overseas earnings,
a stronger dollar cuts three ways.
It is good for exporters and those competing against dollar-based goods at
home or abroad. It is bad for importers. And it is decidedly mixed for small
companies that cannot afford sophisticated currency hedging, since a
switchback dollar adds to their trading risks.
An excellent example of an industry that benefits is aerospace. This is a
business denominated in dollars. For UK manufacturers, the weak dollar has
compounded the difficulties caused by the recession in civil aviation and
government cuts in military spending.
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, said yesterday
that a stronger dollar was better for the company. 'We build in pounds and
sell in dollars,' a Rolls-Royce official said.
Rolls-Royce said earlier this month that the weak dollar had reduced its
first-half profits by Pounds 10m compared with last year. The weaker dollar
also benefited Rolls-Royce's principal US competitors, General Electric and
Pratt &amp; Whitney.
A stronger dollar will also help UK aerospace companies such as British
Aerospace and components manufacturers such as Smiths Industries, TI-Dowty
and Lucas.
Sterling's fluctuations will have less impact on UK airlines. British
Airways explained yesterday that it sold tickets on both sides of the
Atlantic. A firmer dollar resulted in improved US traffic while a stronger
pound boosted UK travel across the Atlantic. The US currently accounts for
about 30 per cent of BA's passengers.
Another beneficiary is the UK's oil sector, where sterling's devaluation was
warmly welcomed. 'It's tremendously good news from a sterling oil company's
point of view,' said Mr John Walmesley, the finance dirctor of Enterprise
Oil, the independent oil company. 'It will provide relief for a hard-pressed
sector.'
The devaluation will raise the sterling price of oil close to Pounds 12,
widely regarded among North Sea operators as a 'comfort' threshold.
In the UK motor industry, the effects are limited to specialist
manufacturers, since volume exports of cars from the US to the UK and
continental Europe still play only a minor role in the European market.
Against that, Jaguar and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the two UK luxury
carmakers, will both reap benefits from lower sterling as Britain's main car
exporters to the US.
North America accounted for 44 per cent of Jaguar's worldwide turnover last
year of Pounds 693m, and the previous steep fall in the value of the dollar
has played a role in its mounting losses, totalling Pounds 226m last year.
For Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the loss-making subsidiary of the UK engineering
group Vickers, North America accounts for about 28 per cent of worldwide
turnover.
Jaguar and Rolls-Royce have both suffered badly in the recessions in the UK
and US. In North America, however, fierce competition has meant that there
has been little scope to raise prices to compensate for loss of revenue
caused by the prolonged fall in the value of the dollar.
Devaluation of the pound against the dollar and D-Mark will also give an
important edge to the competitiveness of the UK luxury carmakers in North
America against their main rivals, Mercedes-Benz and BMW of Germany.
Among losers from devaluation are companies that depend on
dollar-denominated raw materials.
A good example is UK Corrugated, one of the country's largest producers of
cardboard boxes. The company's chief executive, Mr Pat Barrett, said
yesterday, 'Nobody can make any sensible decisions for the next 10 days. I
am going to play golf all day tomorrow.'
Mr Barrett's dilemma is that UK Corrugated imports 30 per cent of its raw
materials from the US. Earlier this year the company was paying Dollars 540
a tonne for kraftliner - its basic raw material - or Pounds 308 at the
exchange rate then prevailing. The supplier's price then went up by Dollars
40. But because of the rise in sterling, the company could absorb the rise
without trying to pass it on to customers.
Now, after sterling's fall, UK Corrugated is likely to pay about Pounds 331
a tonne, a 7.5 per cent rise.
Mr Barrett said yesterday: 'The government's policy of maintaining the pound
in the ERM to control inflation was absolutely right for my industry. The
strong pound controlled the cost of imported raw materials. For us, the cost
of making cardboard boxes has gone up 2 1/2 per cent since Tuesday.'
The ambivalent effect of weaker sterling on smaller companies is illustrated
by The Rocking Horse Shop, a Yorkshire-based company that makes and
despatches craftsman-built rocking horse kits to the US.'
The company's owner, Mr Tony Dew, said: 'It's knowing what prices to quote
at the time orders are taken which gives us the biggest headache.' Mr Dew
said miscalculating exchange rates over the period between orders and
despatch for products averaging between Pounds 100 and Pounds 150 could have
a marked impact on a company with an annual turnover of around Pounds
250,000.
The latest dip in the value of the pound, he says, might give US export
business a boost. 'But then, we buy in some of our raw materials from
Germany, so that won't help.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Japan backs G7 currency plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE leaders yesterday threw their weight behind moves for the meeting
tomorrow of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries, to draw up contingency plans to make sure European currency
instability does not spread.
Officials in Japan are concerned that the European currency crisis may put
the US dollar under pressure, strengthening the yen and thus pushing Japan
towards cutting interest rates.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, said the meeting tomorrow would discuss
ways to calm European currency markets, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance
minister, said Japan was ready to back concerted action to prevent
instability spreading. Mr Hata will meet his US counterpart, Mr Nicholas
Brady, this afternoon.
Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, suggested the G7 might take
co-ordinated action to stabilise European currencies. A senior official at
the finance ministry said plans were being prepared for concerted
intervention in the Tokyo market on Monday if, in their referendum on
Sunday, the French vote against the Maastricht treaty on European
integration.
The Tokyo market would be the first to feel the violent impact that a French
rejection of the treaty could have on forex markets. Finance ministry
officials said the G7 meeting would probably draw up a contingency plan for
concerted intervention in Tokyo in case the vote went against the treaty.
Beyond these immediate worries, the turmoil of the past week, combined with
the imminence of the French vote, has provoked concerns among Japanese
financiers, industrialists and policy-makers.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister at the ministry of international trade and
industry, warned that, if the pound's suspension in the ERM were prolonged,
Japan would be hurt. One main worry is that the US dollar may soon be sucked
into the turmoil. That would drag in the yen. If the French vote against
Maastricht, Tokyo financial analysts expect the D-Mark to strengthen against
the dollar, which would further weaken against the yen.
A weaker dollar would limit the US scope to cut interest rates to revive its
economy. Prospects for a recovery of Japan's battered economy would be
enhanced by higher exports to North America, so Japan would come under
strong pressure to cut interest rates. Mr Yukio Yanbe, DKB Research
Institute's chief economist, said: 'If the dollar weakens, a wider
adjustment will be necessary to prevent the dollar falling too far.'

FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Tough Italian plan for budget
savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday announced cost-cutting and revenue-raising
measures totalling L93,000bn (Pounds 41.2bn) in a 1993 budget package
designed to tackle the country's budget deficit. However, the scale of the
savings disappointed some economists, who had been calling for measures
worth up to L120,000bn.
The package envisages L43,000bn in spending cuts and L42,000bn in
revenue-raising measures, mainly from new taxes and charges. A further
L7,000bn is expected in privatisation proceeds. The government plans to
freeze spending next year at 1992 levels.
In a stern warning to potential opponents, Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime
minister, stressed that the credibility of the government and the lira were
linked to his budget plans. 'We must restore to Italians our own
self-confidence and, for those watching from abroad, confidence in our
country and currency,' he said.
The bulk of the savings will come from cuts in Italy's generous state
pensions system.
Under the latest scheme, the pensionable ages will be raised. Further
savings will come by freezing a 1.8 per cent pensions rise due in November,
and next year's increase in pensions will be linked to the rise in the cost
of living, rather than to salary levels which are normally higher.
Meanwhile, salaries for the 3m public sector employees due to renegotiate
their contracts next year, except for schoolteachers, will be frozen at this
year's levels. There will also be a freeze on public sector hiring.
In an attempt to win the grudging support of union leaders, called in to see
Mr Amato before the cabinet meeting yesterday, the government put forward
measures to curb tax evasion and show that the burden was being spread
fairly.
Tax-dodging, rife among the self-employed, will be countered by introducing
a form of 'minimum tax' to prevent any self-employed individual from
declaring an income lower than that of his employees.
Free medicines and a variety of other public health benefits will be
abolished for those earning over L40m a year, while extra charges are to be
imposed on large cars, boats and aircraft.
Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, said the measures, for the first time
in Italy, were focused on cutting spending rather than on raising income. In
the past, ambitious revenue-raising proposals have been diluted in
parliament. 'We responded with vigorous measures to a rigorous situation.
That's my message,' the minister said.
Details of the package prompted some recovery in the lira, the value of
which had declined against that of the D-Mark yesterday. On the stock
market, prices made up part of the ground lost on Wednesday.
The government is to submit new budgetary forecasts for 1993-95 in the next
seven days. Its original figures were criticised in parliament last week as
inadequate.
The predictions, which envisage a fall in the budget deficit to just 4.9 per
cent of gross domestic product by 1995, had already been attacked by
economists as too upbeat. Drawn up soon after Prof Amato's government had
come to office, they showed total public sector debt was expected to fall
marginally to 113.5 per cent of GDP in 1995, having reached a peak of 113.6
per cent in 1994.
Price rises, which declined last month to an annual 5.3 per cent, were
forecast to drop to 3.5 per cent in 1993, 2.5 per cent in 1994, and 2 per
cent in 1995.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (11): Power for the people - The widening
quest for energy sources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER CUTS periodically show that Pakistan cannot meet the energy needs of a
rapidly growing consumer market and industry. While the government has given
fresh incentives to set up factories, providing investment in transportation
and energy is also needed.
In energy, Pakistan is seeking private sector investments in new electricity
projects and oil and gas production. Industrial entrepreneurs are allowed to
set up their own generation plants but that adds to the cost of new
projects.
Electricity generating capacity is projected to rise to 9,356 megawatts by
the middle of next year, but demand is expected to rise to 11,000 MW by
1995. The supply is currently estimated to fall 10 to 15 per cent below
demand depending on the output of hydro electric schemes which rely on
rainfall.
The government has let the private sector set up independent power plants to
help meet the shortfall. Fresh measures have also been announced to increase
production of petroleum, as the country produces 65,000 barrels of oil per
day but needs to import about 170,000 b/d.
Last year fresh incentives were introduced to stimulate exploration and
refining. The government has promised to process applications for
exploration licences within three months of submission. In the past,
approvals have taken up to three years.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, hopes there will be a surge in private
power projects given the size of the country's population. 'In this
expanding market, efficient generation of power is required. With
privatisation, we expect to get the investment. Very few markets are that
large and offer opportunities for investment', he says.
Pakistan also sees opportunities for importing power, oil and gas from the
newly independent central Asian republics and Afghanistan. An agreement has
been signed with Tajikistan for the supply of 1,000 MW for which new
transmission lines will be built.
Imports of gas from Afghanistan and Turkmenistan will also be studied, and
recent oil discoveries in Uzbekistan raise the possibility of importing oil
from that country.
All these proposals are fraught with difficulties, however. Energy
investments will be repaid only in the long term. Although the population is
rising, prosperity will also have to rise to ensure a bigger energy
consumption.
In spite of the inducements for oil and gas exploration, some businessmen
believe that crime and violence, especially in remote areas of the southern
province of Sindh, are a barrier to new exploration projects.
The government has said it will set up a special force to protect oil
installations, but it remains to be seen if that will reassure potential
investors.
Prospects for importing energy from central Asia depend on future events in
Afghanistan. Pakistani officials who support the country's central Asian
initiatives argue that the intra-mujahideen infighting in Kabul is likely to
die down in the next two or three years, the time frame needed to begin
establishing some of the projects.
But no-one knows how long it will take before peace and stability are
restored to Afghanistan. A durable peace there may be the key to Pakistan's
central Asian strategy and its ability to draw on that region to meet its
energy needs.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (13): Good news from Hab River - Cash for
power should soon start flowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS month's ground-breaking ceremony at Hub Chowki for the Dollars 1.7bn
Hab River power project is expected to switch on a burst of foreign
investment in electricity generation projects throughout Pakistan.
For the government, which has embarked on one of Asia's more ambitious
institutional restructuring programmes, and for Pakistan's would-be
electricity consumers, this will not be a moment too soon.
Pakistan has just 8,312MW of total installed capacity, 6,857MW under the
Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and the balance under the
Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation, both of which are due for shake-up
in the 1990s.
The figure is far below western standards, which indicate that countries of
100m people or more should have about 80,000MW-100,000MW of electricity
supply capacity.
According to water and power ministry officials, at least 10 private sector
power projects have been on hold during the prolonged talks over Hab River.
Negotiations for the 1,292MW oil-fired power scheme had been going on for
four years, with the deal having tentatively been wrapped up twice before.
This time, representatives of Xenel Industries, the Saudi-based chief
sponsoring company for the build-own-operate (BOO) scheme, and of the water
and power ministry and WAPDA firmly believe that the agreement formally
signed in early July sufficiently allays all fears and clears the decks for
an imminent construction start-up, with power from the first of four 323MW
units to be generated within 40 months.
Because Pakistan opted for an oil-fired power station, the project was
subjected to a comprehensive World Bank environmental study, requiring
stringent environmental controls to meet the Bank's criteria.
Pakistan opted for oil because of its proximity to the Gulf. Under the deal,
HubCo will lift 1.5m tonnes of oil a year from the Pakistan State Oil
Company in a deal worth Dollars 150m a year.
When completed, Hab River will boost Pakistan's power generating capacity by
some 15 per cent.
It will be Pakistan's first private sector power scheme. The complexity of
the financial structures put into place by the private sector and by the
World Bank should bode well for other entrepreneurs seeking to take
advantage of Pakistan's liberalisation programme. They will now have a
formula from which to work in pursuing their own deals.
Under BOO, the sponsors will own and operate the project indefinitely. In
effect, the Hab River scheme becomes an independent company generating
electricity and selling it into the national grid.
The managing company being set up to run the scheme is the Hab River Power
Group (HubCo). It is the intention of the sponsors for HubCo to have a
widely-based public shareholding. It has been registered as a company and
share trading will eventually take place on the Karachi Stock Exchange.
The project will be financed through the sale by HubCo of electricity,
priced at commercial rates, to WAPDA. The notional start price is Rs1.36
(about 5.5 US cents) per kilowatt hour.
This has escalator clauses built in to take account of rupee devaluation,
inflation and a variety of other factors that could affect electricity
prices. The agreement runs for 30 years, considered to be long under normal
BOO arrangements (the ideal is between 10-15 years, according to most
experts).
The most recent impasse was caused by the emergence of Islamic (interest
free) banking as a national issue. The imposition of Islamic banking rules
temporarily scared off the commercial western banks invited to part-finance
the scheme.
The breakthrough came recently when the Pakistani authorities and HubCo
representatives were able to formulate an implementation agreement
guaranteeing the protection of the bankers' investment in the scheme, no
matter what happened on the Islamic banking issue, which is now before the
national Supreme Court.
The two other elements of the tripartite accord were the power purchase
accord, covering the commercial tariffs at which HubCo will sell power to
the national grid, and the fuel purchase agreement, covering deliveries by
the Pakistan State Oil Company of imported oil needed to run the power
station.
All those involved in the talks agree that the deal would not have been
possible without the World Bank, which helped structure the deal and created
some innovative forms of specialist finance to kick-start the agreement.
These included the Private Sector Energy Development Fund (PSEDF), set up to
provide seed finance at long-term commercial rates (but with up-front grace
periods) to private sector interests seeking to invest in the project. The
PSEDF will provide about one-third of the commercial bank financing.
Another facility is the the Enhanced Co-Finance Operation (ECO), another
World Bank invention specifically for Hab River, which will help protect the
commercial banks against sovereign risks in case of failure by the
government to comply with its side of the bargain. As it now stands,
commercial bank financing aims to supply about Dollars 630m to the project.
The banking consortium comprises the Bank of Tokyo, Credit Lyonnais of
France, Citibank UK, and Sakura Bank of Japan. Union Bank of Switzerland was
involved in the consortium, but last week confirmed it was withdrawing
because of 'a strategic decision not to invest in fossil-fuelled projects'.
Other elements of the financing include a Pakistan bond issue of Dollars
100m; HubCo and others equity investment totalling Dollars 243m; local
equity of Dollars 188m and offshore backing from aid agencies breaking down
as follows: PSEDF (Dollars 415m); Japan Export Import Bank Dollars 120m);
World Bank (IBRD) Dollars 240m; Japan's Miti Dollars 70m; Sace of Italy
Dollars 200m; France's Coface Dollars 41m and the Commonwealth Development
Corporation Dollars 12m.
In addition to Xenel, the prime sponsor, co-sponsors will include Mitsui &amp;
Co of Japan and British Electricity International of the UK.
Mitsui also will be the prime contractor, while BEI will operate and
maintain the complex.
The US firm of K&amp;M is the engineering consultant and was prime mover in the
contract negotiations.
Other key equipment subcontractors are Campenon Bernard of France (civil
engineering); Ansaldo of Italy (turbines), and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries of Japan.
The deal has enabled HubCo to confirm the appointment of Mr Kenneth
Fergusson as HubCo chief executive officer, under the chairmanship of Mr
Mohammad Alireza, who is also chairman of Xenel.
Mr Fergusson, born in 1938, spent the early part of his career with ICI and
RTZ, studied at Imperial College and Harvard Business School and was
director-general of the European Transonic Windtunnel in Germany and a
managing director of the London Dockland Light Railway.

PAKISTAN'S economic growth rates, though at times impressive, have not
helped to improve the quality of life of many of the country's 117m people.
It was the world's fifth fastest growing country during the 1980s. But it
came 120th among 160 countries in the UNDP's human development index.
Some of the individual indicators for human develop- ment are depressing.
The government estimates that:
only 34 per cent of adults are literate;
public expenditure on education was 2.3 per cent of GNP last year,
significantly below the 3.7 per cent average for developing countries;
only 40 per cent of children of primary school age are enrolled in schools;
52 per cent of children suffer from malnutrition and only 55 per cent of the
population has access to medical care.
Conditions for women are worse than for men. This has been a particular
source of concern for foreign aid donors and development experts. To counter
this, the federal and provincial governments have committed Rs53bn (Pounds
1.15bn) over the next three years to a Social Action Programme to improve
the indicators.
'We feel that we need to have an accelerated programme so that lost time can
be made up', says Mr Sardar Asseff Ahmed Ali, minister of state for economic
affairs.
Under the programme's tar- gets, literacy is projected to rise to 50 per
cent from the present 34 per cent. In addition, there should be improve-
ments in nutrition, primary health care, family planning, rural water supply
and sanit- ation. 'This will be the biggest quantum jump in Pakistan's
history in the social sector', says Mr Ali.
Despite the programme, there is still concern at some of the obstacles in
the way of improving social welfare, especially the high population growth.
The present 3 per cent growth rate is among the highest in the developing
world. In addition, some developmental experts are concerned that
initiatives for improving the status of women can only succeed if more women
hold public office.
At present, there are only two women members (Benazir Bhutto and her mother)
in Pak- istan's 217 seat lower house of parliament and one among the 87
upper house legislators.
Prime minister Nawaz Sharif's government plans to introduce a special
constitutional amendment which will reserve 20 seats for women in the lower
house, Mr Ali says. Some developmental experts argue that more women members
in the parliament may in turn strengthen the women's rights lobby, putting
more pressure on the government to give closer attention to their
development. On this and other areas of social programmes, the next three
years will be an important test of Pakistan's ability to match its quality
of economic growth with the quality of life for its people.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (2): Time for drastic surgery - Finance
minister Aziz faces cruel choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SARTAJ AZIZ, Pakistan's finance minister, finds himself in a dilemma. The
most serious problem he faces is the budget deficit, which ballooned last
year to 8.8 per cent of gross domestic product.
He is committed to reducing it, but is fearful of choking off the rapid
economic growth which is necessary for the success of the government's
radical reform programme. Consequently, he is uncertain whether to seek a
new agreement with the International Monetary Fund to replace a Structural
Adjustment Facility which expires this year.
A sharp drop in the deficit to below 5 per cent would risk a vicious circle
of lower economic growth, lower tax revenues and worsening budgetary
problems, Mr Aziz feels. Rather, he wants a benign circle of more
investment, faster growth and higher tax revenues.
Though the government had forecast a fall to 5 per cent of GDP in the
financial year which ended in June 1992, Mr Aziz says it has so far fallen
to slightly below 7 per cent and that the immediate target is between 6 and
6.5 per cent. For the most recent shortfall, he blames low cotton prices,
higher than expected oil prices, the world recession and the government's
own economy-opening reforms, including cuts in tariffs and rises in interest
rates paid by the government on domestic debt to banks.
The budget deficit is, however, a chronic problem attributable to grossly
inefficient tax authorities, a bloated public sector and a lack of political
will among governments to tax the private sector where it hurts.
Most of the agricultural sector, as well as large parts of industry, pay
virtually no direct tax. Customs duties make up a hefty 43 per cent of
federal tax revenues, excise duties 22 per cent, sales tax 17 per cent and
income taxes only 18 per cent. The entire tax system is plagued by evasion
and corruption.
The deficit has been financed by external borrowing, putting a strain on
Pakistan's external payments position, and by monetary creation. Inflation
more than doubled to 12.7 per cent in the year to end June 1991, though it
has moderated since.
This has been accompanied by a chronically low domestic savings rate, which
has contributed to weak investment in infrastructure.
The recent worsening in the budget deficit was partly beyond the present
government's control, resulting from lax spending controls before it took
office, higher oil prices during the Gulf crisis, and delays in implementing
new taxes.
A significant part of government spending is difficult for a finance
minister to address: 35 per cent of current expenditure goes on defence and
27 per cent on debt service. As a result, what cuts there have been in
recent years have tended to be in development spending - reductions which
Pakistan can ill afford. However, there is scope to reduce spending on
subsidies, on administration, and on financing the public sector as it
shrinks through privatisation.
The most obvious answer to the deficit problem is to generate more revenue.
Mr Aziz's goal is to do this by widening the tax base, increasing the
efficiency of collection, and lowering tax rates to reduce the incentives
for evasion.
Mr Aziz says direct income taxes on farmers would not bring in very much
revenue, and that they are subject to indirect taxation. Meanwhile, he has
resorted to some unusual taxes in order to bring companies into the tax net.
Companies which were paying no tax are now being charged a  1/2 per cent
turnover tax. All companies must now pay a tax based on their electricity
bills. 'It is presumed that your income is proportionate to the electricity
you consume,' says Mr Aziz.
Bank loans, though liberalised, are also subject to a new tax and this
year's budget included new duties on exports - measures hardly designed to
encourage new investment in export capacity.
Mr Aziz believes tax evasion will become less prevalent as the economy
becomes more open. High tariff rates and import and foreign exchange
restrictions have fostered heavy smuggling and a massive underground
economy.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Aziz's efforts so far will address the
structural budget problem. While battling the deficit, Mr Aziz can never
forget the country's external payments position which, while it does not
threaten to become critical, is certainly not secure.
Pakistan, which has a foreign debt of Dollars 22bn, depends on aid flows to
finance its balance of payments deficit. Aid flows depend heavily on
assessments of the progress of reform by the IMF and other institutions.
The balance of payments worsened to a deficit of about Dollars 2.8bn in the
year ended June 1992, due to weak commodity prices and import
liberalisation.
However, cotton-based exports have been showing good growth, and the reform
programme has begun to attract foreign exchange into Pakistan from abroad.
In coming years, development of new export capacity will require substantial
imports of capital goods. Remittances from Pakistanis abroad provide a
cushion. But foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 1bn, though stable, are
not a very sound bulwark against any unexpected crisis of confidence.
Mr Aziz can take comfort from the relative stability of the Pakistani
economy, which has shown healthy growth rates for many years and is likely
to continue to do so, with GDP growing around 6 per cent annually, provided
there is the necessary investment in new capacity, technology and
infrastructure.
This is despite weak demand from export markets and moves to tighten credit,
aimed to lower inflation, which have hurt industry. Inflation, after its
jump last year, has fallen somewhat and shows no sign of running out of
control. Agriculture has produced good growth in output and value added.
The economy is diversified, with an already large and dynamic private sector
industrial base now growing rapidly as a result of privatisation. But the
industrialists will need a consistent, effective tax structure and better
infrastructure - including a better-educated workforce - if they are to
drive Pakistan towards its goal of a modernised, open, export-driven
economy.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (3): A shock to the system - Bureaucrats
receive strong medicine of economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAPID privatisation and deregulation are the central elements of Pakistan's
economic reform programme.
Pakistan may have an advantage over countries undertaking similar changes in
that the public sector mentality has been in the ascendant for only 20
years, since Zulfikar Ali Bhutto nationalised big industry and banks in
1972. A dynamic private sector provides a good base for reform.
Upon independence and partition in 1947, Pakistan embarked on an industrial
policy under which the private sector was to take the lead in building a
manufacturing base. The next two decades saw rapid growth in industry, so
that it still accounts for a higher proportion of the economy than might be
expected in a country of its income level. A robust private sector
developed.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, finance minister, says Mr Bhutto's subsequent shift in
direction resulted in 'bureaucratic socialism', with overstaffing,
politically controlled prices, and absence of the dynamism which comes from
private sector risk-taking.
The classic result was loss-making public sector enterprises,
over-regulation, low investment and run-down infrastructure, a low savings
rate, a growth rate financed by excessive borrowing, and a chronic budget
deficit. The economy was heavily protected by high tariffs and import
restrictions.
The present thrust is to re-focus the government into providing the basis
for growth, through investment in physical and social infrastructure, while
rapidly shrinking its role in production and services. At the same time, it
is attempting to remove many bureaucratic shackles on the private sector, to
promote exports and foreign investment and remove barriers to the outside
world.
The bureaucrats, accustomed to decisions being subjected to interminable
committees and reports, can scarcely have known what hit them as the
privatisation programme got under way last year.
Mr Saeed Qadir, a former general and minister under Gen Zia ul-Haq, was
appointed to head a Privatisation Commission within weeks of Mr Sharif's
election as prime minister. The new body, with only a handful of senior
civil servants, began the process with the help of a report commissioned
from a merchant bank by the previous government. A deal was struck with
labour unions, providing 'golden handshakes' for redundant employees of
privatised companies after a year's guaranteed employment.
Soon, public sector units scheduled for privatisation were touting
themselves in marquees set up outside the commission's office in Islamabad.
It is responsible for selling the 115 units which were run by the ministries
of industry and production, though not for utilities which are also being
opened up to private ownership.
So far, 55 units have been sold by public auction for Rs10bn, with an
additional Rs4bn of liabilities transferred. Of the 40 sold units whose
transfers have actually been completed, a minority were profit-making.
Companies being sold cover a broad spectrum, from tractors and textiles to
cement and ghee, vegetable oil used in cooking. Some companies have been
sold to their employees.
The government rejects allegations of corruption in the sales. 'There is no
concentration of wealth, no cartelisation, and no preference being given to
any party,' says Mr Qadir. In response to such suggestions about the early
sales, the commission has opened bidding sessions to the press.
Two banks, Muslim Commercial Bank and Allied Bank, have been privatised, and
United Bank and Habib Bank are to follow. In addition, new private banks
have been permitted and nine have opened. Private housing finance companies
have been allowed. Interest rates have been partially deregulated with the
introduction of government debt auctions, replacing the requirements for
banks to lend to the government at a fixed 6 per cent rate.
Public sector monopolies are being dismantled in energy, telecommunications,
airlines, shipping, road construction and ports.
Of deregulation measures, the most significant is the removal of the need
for the private sector to seek government approval for new investments. This
has greatly reduced the drawbacks to industrial investment. Industry has
also been boosted by cuts in customs duties on imported plant and machinery,
tax holidays for new manufacturing units, and lifting of other restrictions
on growth.
Among measures to promote exports, a public sector monopoly over cotton and
rice exports has been abolished and textile export quotas have been opened
up for sale. The government has reduced the maximum import duty (excepting
some luxury goods) from 125 per cent to 90 per cent (though surcharges
remain), eliminated licensing requirements for permitted imports, reduced
the list of banned imports, and liberalised procedures for importing
machinery.
This has been accompanied by the removal of most foreign exchange controls,
though the rupee is not yet convertible. Pakistanis may now open foreign
currency accounts in Pakistan and trade dollar-denominated bearer
certificates. The regulatory incentive for residents to spirit money out of
the country, and to keep it out, has been virtually eliminated.
Restrictions on foreign investors have also been removed. In most sectors,
they are able to operate on a par with residents. They may own 100 per cent
of equity and, in most cases, remit dividends and sale proceeds. (Foreign
investment is discussed on the facing page).
Some of these reforms are taking time to work through the system. For
example, imports which are supposedly liberalised still encounter
bureaucratic obstacles.
The immediate scope for deep cuts in import duties is severely limited by
the government's budgetary problems, with customs and excise duties
accounting for the bulk of federal tax revenue. The government's
unwillingness to address tariff reform more wholeheartedly has disappointed
donor officials.
But the very speed of reform in other fields has aroused some concern. Mr
Shahid Javed Burki, a Pakistani who heads the World Bank's China desk,
warned in a recent lecture that 'privatisation without attention to the
creation of a regulatory framework within which the private sector must be
obliged to work could create a very unhappy situation'. Without such laws
and institutions to ensure that they are observed, Mr Burki said, 'it is
inviting the kind of response from the people that produced the impulse to
put the public sector on the commanding heights of the economy in the first
place'.

FT  18 SEP 92 / Slow progress on the 'green' route: EC environment ministers
face a tough task after Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TOMORROW'S meeting of European Community environment ministers at Gleneagles
in Scotland will show that progress on enforcing environmental rules remains
elusive, in spite of the UK's vigorous promises of action three months ago
when it took over the EC presidency.
The informal council meeting will be the first time all 12 environment
ministers have met since the Rio Earth Summit in June. It has been called
because of the summit's weighty legacy of administration.
Heading the agenda is the task of putting into practice the Rio resolutions
on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and preserving biodiversity - the
distribution of the world's species.
The UK intends to ratify the climate-change convention - for which it needs
parliamentary approval - by 1993, but has given no date for biodiversity.
The Gleneagles meeting will also consider how to promote 'the greening of
all EC legislation'. That policy is expected to have the support of Mr Karel
van Miert, who took up a six-month appointment as EC environment
commissioner in June, and who is also the community's transport
commissioner.
DG11, the EC environmental council's policy development arm, has had little
influence with other Brussels directorates, and several large Mediterranean
projects have recently received EC money although they were then deemed to
be environmentally harmful.
Behind the scenes, members of the UK team are lobbying for Mr Miert to
remain commissioner after December - he has given a more encouraging
response to the UK position than his predecessor, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana.
However, moves to enforce EC 'green' rules more vigorously - which Mr
Michael Howard, UK environment minister, announced would be a priority - are
making slow progress. Gleneagles will be told that representatives from
national enforcement agencies will have their first meeting in November, but
that falls short of the UK's original plan for a central 'inspectorate of
inspectorates'.
Nor does the repeal of some EC legislation on water standards at which Mr
Howard hinted in June, now look likely.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Ashdown fillip on co-operation: The Liberal Democrats at
Harrogate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, the party leader, was yesterday given an almost free hand
to develop co-operation with other parties. A motion expressing a belief in
working with anyone like-minded and in promoting campaigns on common causes
received strong support at the Liberal Democrat conference.
In his rallying speech to the conference this afternoon, Mr Ashdown is
expected to welcome yesterday's resolution as a good base from which to
proceed. Today's speech will also be used to launch Mr Ashdown's first
full-scale attack on Mr John Major's lack of leadership since the election.
Previously he has sometimes sounded as though he admires the prime minister.
In deliberately rejecting the idea of 'promoting' discussion, the agreement
reached yesterday is a dilution of what Mr Ashdown appeared to have in mind
in his speech in Chard, Somerset, soon after the general election. Then, in
a move which left many of his parliamentary colleagues unhappy, he called
for the Liberal Democrats to be the 'catalyst' for debate with people of
other parties and the politically uncommitted.
The party activists' deep-rooted suspicion of Labour was reflected in many
speeches, and in the cheers that greeted the rejection of an amendment
highlighting areas where members of the two parties agree.
Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, argued that an earlier
proposal which referred to 'promoting a process of discussion' represented a
'begging-bowl approach'.
But Dr Jenny Tonge, the party's general election candidate in Richmond and
Barnes, warned delegates that, in order to defeat the Conservatives, some
Liberal Democrats would have to consider voting tactically for Labour as
some Labour supporters had done in Richmond and Barnes at the election.
Several speakers repeated warnings that it was the electorate's view of the
Liberal Democrats' as being close to Labour that had prevented them from
achieving greater success in the general election.

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Racal demerger heightens chance of a bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEMERGER of Chubb Security from Racal Electronics, which was announced
yesterday, is likely to lead to a period of active but not necessarily
fruitful courtship.
After Racal Electronics last year distributed its 80 per cent stake in
Vodafone, the cellular telephone group, bid speculation began, with Chubb
the main focus of attention. The bid duly came from Williams Holdings but
was repelled.
Slide rules will again be run over the demerged Chubb and Racal. Being
stand-alone businesses, the theory is that more predators will be interested
in making an offer.
Racal is proposing to consolidate five old shares into one new Racal share
and give shareholders one new Chubb share.
But the Chubb business has been considerably strengthened since Williams had
a tilt at the group. Ironically this may mean that the shares are more fully
priced and therefore less likely to attract the suitor.
Most dramatic has been the sharp increase in cash generation and a palpable
increase in management focus on cost cutting that has led to a sharp
increase in profits, particularly in Chubb.
Debt, which stood at Pounds 225m when Sir Ernest Harrison decided to
postpone the last proposed demerger of Chubb, has now been almost halved -
depending on what conversion rate is taken for the dollar debt. As a result
Racal should have no problem servicing its borrowings without the benefit of
the cash generative powers of Chubb.
Chubb has also gone some way along the path of cutting costs through
improved purchasing and the closure of some of its 30 manufacturing sites.
The early benefit of this programme has meant the flotation prospectus can
forecast operating profits of Pounds 28m in the 28 weeks to October and
pre-tax profits after exceptional items of Pounds 21m, up 61 per cent on the
previous year.
Mr David Peacock, the new Chubb chief executive, has recognised that the
Chubb brand names could be better exploited to gain a greater share of a
Pounds 7bn global market.
Racal Electronics, without Chubb, is a more complicated picture, and the
group is not forecasting half year profits at this stage.
More than a third of the group's sales are in data communications, which has
been a problem area since the group made a late entry into analogue modems
in the early 1980s.
Before profitability returns to this division, Racal is likely to be
hampered and possibly vulnerable to a bid.
Mr David Elsbury, the chief executive, believes the corner has been turned
after a repositioning in areas of higher market growth. It is now cash
positive but has yet to prove it can deliver margin improvement.
Elsewhere, the group's radio division - one of the original foundations of
Sir Ernest's empire - has broadened beyond military applications and should
benefit from continuing high research and development expenditure.
Other businesses, like data networks, still require time to develop beyond
the start up phase to full profit potential, making valuation of the group
something of a difficult task.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' stock price continued to decline yesterday
amid growing pessimism about the outlook for sales of its flagship mainframe
computers, following Monday's announcement by Amdahl, another mainframe
manufacturer, of slowing sales.
As Wall Street analysts lowered IBM's investment ratings, the stock fell by
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 82 7/8 at yesterday's close. Amdahl dropped
slightly by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 following a fall of more than
Dollars 5 on Tuesday.
Amdahl's forecast of an operating loss for the current quarter raised
concerns that weak capital spending may have a negative effect on all makers
of mainframe computers.
Many business customers are deferring capital expenditures by upgrading
existing computer systems or purchasing second-hand mainframe computers.
However, mainframe industry executives said that demand for high-end
machines remains 'the same as it has been for the past 12 months'.
Industry analysts agree that the trend toward 'downsizing' to networked
computer systems has had little impact on sales of high-end mainframe
computers. They argue that Amdahl is suffering more than its competitors at
the moment because it lacks the high-capacity data storage products that its
competitors offer.
Amdahl is expected to begin shipments soon of a new generation of data
storage systems that will match the performance of similar products from IBM
and Hitachi.

<TEXT>
DAIRY Farm International, the food retailing arm of the Jardine Matheson
group of Hong Kong, said net profits grew 10 per cent to USDollars 59.9m for
the six months to June.
Earnings were held back by significant losses from Spanish retailer Simago.
The company's Hong Kong retail oper-ations saw shrinking margins due to
higher wages and rental rates, and with 561 stores now open, the market is
reaching saturation level. However, Taiwan is expected to provide
substantial growth. Dairy Farm has now opened 51 Wellcome and Mannings
stores and the company predicted it would move into profit in the latter
part of 1992.
The group's Australian retailer Franklins achieved increased profits and
maintained market share in the face of a severe recession and fierce
competition. The company plans to accelerate new store expansion in the
second half.
Woolworths New Zealand, which was acquired in 1990, achieved significant
profits growth and successfully in-creased its market share. Dairy Farm's 50
per cent owned Maxim's restaurant chain produced excellent results in Hong
Kong.
The HKDollars 1.25bn (USDollars 162m) sale of a 51 per cent stake in Dairy
Farm's manufacturing businesses in China and Hong Kong to Nestle, the Swiss
food group, which was announced in June, should lead to interest savings in
the second half of the year. The company's 25 per cent owned associated Kwik
Save continued to register growth in spite of the weak UK economy, with
interim profits up 8 per cent.
Overall, most analysts expect a better performance in the second half of the
year, aided by strong growth in Taiwan and New Zealand. The company also
said profit margins had shown a slight improvement at Simago.
Turnover was 5 per cent higher at the interim stage at USDollars 2.325bn and
the company recommended a dividend of 1.48 cents, up from 1.35 cents.

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled Canadian property developer, said it had agreed
to sell a 34-storey building in Park Avenue to the New York-based Mutual of
America Life Insurance Company.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Mutual is believed to be
paying more than Dollars 100m for the building.
Mutual said the company plans to invest about Dollars 70m in an extensive
renovation of the property. This could create about 1,000 construction jobs
in New York.
O&amp;Y is likely to use the proceeds of the sale to pay off a series of
outstanding bank mortgages on the property; these are believed to total
about Dollars 100m.
'We are not assuming any mortgages that O&amp;Y had on the building,' said Mr
Thomas Moran, the president and chief operating officer of Mutual.
Mr Moran said Mutual, which has total assets of more than Dollars 6.2bn,
plans to use the building as its new headquarters and to move in by 1995.
'We will use about one third of the building and lease out the rest,' Mr
Moran said.
The building, located near the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, was previously the
world headquarters of ITT, the US financial, industrial and travel
conglomerate. It has remained vacant for the past 18 months.
The building consists of 664,000 sq ft and requires much work to remove
asbestos and make a number of repairs.
The Reichmann family first acquired the Park Avenue building in 1977, when
it bought several prime Manhattan properties.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS smelting conditions
attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PITTSBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL conditions discovered in some aluminium smelters in the
Commonwealth of Independent States by a team from the Aluminium Company of
America were far worse than expected, said Mr Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's
chairman, yesterday.
In some smelters conditions were so poor that the average life expectancy of
a worker was only 47 years.
'There is no way we could be part of that,' said Mr O'Neill. The team from
Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium company, went to see if the group had a
role to play in the CIS. Mr O'Neill said: 'I don't know if there is a place
for Alcoa there. We are not willing to sacrifice our values to do business
in an unseemly way in life-threatening circumstances.'
On the other hand, he said the team found that the CIS had some leading
aluminium technology arising from the former Soviet Union's willingness to
provide unlimited resources for any material for military use. The CIS
industry showed it could produce high quality products in 'ghastly operating
circumstances'.
The Alcoa team was also impressed by the level of education throughout the
CIS smelter workforces.
Mr O'Neill's comments coincided with a symposium in St Petersburg in Russia
this week at which the CIS aluminium industry is putting itself on display,
partly with the aim of encouraging more investment from western companies.
Mr O'Neill warned that the flood of aluminium exports from the CIS to the
west 'won't evaporate' and it was likely that exports of semi-fabricated
aluminium products would also build up. Neither was there any sign that the
CIS domestic economy would revive enough in the medium term to absorb more
of the metal its aluminium industry was producing.
Last year the CIS exported about 1m tonnes of aluminium, which helped drive
the metals price down to its lowest-ever level in real terms. The market is
still over supplied and some analysts believe there must be more output cuts
by western producers if there is to be a strong price recovery.
Mr O'Neill said all Alcoa's smelters were generating a positive cashflow and
unless that changed the group would not close any capacity.
However, neither would it invest in new smelter capacity until it was clear
the industry could look forward to several years of aluminium prices of
between 80 and 85 cents a pound. 'Those conditions will come but I don't
know when,' he added. Last night cash aluminium closed at 57.5 cents a lb on
the London Metal Exchange.

THE NORTH Atlantic battle between the big European and US carriers was
stepped up yesterday with the announcement that Lufthansa, the German
national carrier, had filed a proposal to acquire a majority stake in
Continental Airlines, the bankrupt US airline.
The proposal, which is being made jointly with Mr Marvin Davis, the
Californian financier, envisages Lufthansa/Davis investing Dollars 100m
(Pounds 54m) cash for a majority stake in Continental as part of the
airline's plan to reorganise and move out of bankruptcy.
The investors would also arrange for the placement of Dollars 300m of debt
securities in the US carrier - giving Continental an overall Dollars 400m
capital injection. Continental creditors, meanwhile, would be offered a
minority interest in the airline.
The Lufthansa plan is the latest in a series of proposed deals designed to
forge links between troubled US carriers and European airlines.
Northwest Airlines and KLM are seeking to integrate their operations, while
British Airways wants to invest Dollars 750m for a 44 per cent stake in
USAir - a deal fiercely opposed by the big US carriers.
Yesterday, Mr Andrew Card, the US Transportation Secretary, said that
approval for British Airways' proposed investment in USAir could be affected
by the bilateral aviation arrangements between the two countries.
Lufthansa said the Continental move was part of its strategy to strengthen
its transatlantic services by forging an alliance with a US partner.
Although Lufthansa is restructuring to stem heavy operating losses, it said:
'We must not forget our strategy just because of our financial position.'
Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman, expects the airline's operating loss to rise to
DM1.2bn (Pounds 430m) this year from a loss of DM800m last year.
Texas-based Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, is
considering three other bid proposals.
Yesterday's submission should allow Lufthansa and Mr Davis access to more
information about Continental so they could decide whether to proceed
further.

FT  17 SEP 92 / France and Maastricht: Mitterrand faces more speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand yesterday left hospital after surgery
on a cancerous prostate gland to face a fresh wave of speculation over his
future.
The president's doctors, announcing the discovery of cancerous tissue,
reassured the public that prostate cancer is not dangerous in men of
75-year-old Mr Mitterrand's vintage. Business will be as normal, stressed
his government.
'The president of the republic will exercise his functions to the full,'
said Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, who yesterday chaired the
weekly cabinet meeting in Mr Mitterrand's absence.
Even so, all this has refuelled speculation that France is heading for
political upheaval, irrespective of the outcome of Sunday's vote on European
monetary and political union. Times have moved on since Mr Georges
Clemenceau's quip that the French presidency was as superfluous as the
prostate gland.
Physically, Mr Mitterrand will be able to go on much as before, according to
medical reports. The president will spend the next few days convalescing
before returning to work as normal next week.
Politically, Mr Mitterrand's choices are much the same as they were before
his operation. They hinge on the outcome of Sunday's vote, which was as
unclear as ever yesterday.
The all-embracing powers accorded to the presidency under the fifth republic
mean that he alone has the power to decide whether or not to stay, the
timing of his departure and whether or not to call an early general
election.
On this subject Mr Mitterrand has revealed nothing since his September 3
television appearance, when he was characteristically enigmatic about his
future.
Then, he said he would 'take the responsibilities which fall to me' a day or
so after the result was known.
Broadly, he faces the following options. In the event of the narrow Yes
indicated by opinion polls, he could either continue until his term runs out
in spring 1995, or retire at a convenient earlier date. The official line is
that he will stay to the end of his mandate.
Yet Mr Mitterrand is said to be weighing with his close advisers the pros
and cons of early retirement. An opportune moment would be in the next few
months, in time to hold a presidential election before the March 1993
parliamentary election. This would give the Socialists a chance to field a
winning presidential candidate against a weak and divided opposition,
reducing the Socialists' chances of losing the parliamentary election.
A No on Sunday night would obviously be a serious blow to Mr Mitterrand's
national and international credibility and that of his administration. His
resignation and dissolution of the government might seem the only option if
the gamble fails. Yet Mr Mitterrand could still hold on to power after a No
vote. He would be helped by the fact that the opposition's credibility would
be equally damaged, since the right-wing RPR and centre-right UDF leadership
are both pro-Maastricht.
At worst, the Socialist government might face a censure motion in the
National Assembly after parliament reconvenes on October 1. But it has
survived 15 censure motions since the last general election three years ago.
However, come the general election the electorate would make the Socialist
government pay heavily. Mr Mitterrand could distract attention from a
Maastricht debacle by calling another referendum, as he once said he would,
on reducing the seven-year presidential mandate. But that would be another
gamble.
Yet Mr Mitterrand knows that even if Sunday's result shows he has walked
into his own trap, he has not run out of stratagems yet.

those whose customers are either too poor or too rich to be affected by
mortgage rate movements - will be affected by the interest rate rises.
Mr Bob Winder, finance director of Abercrombie &amp; Kent Travel, whose
customers spend up to Pounds 6,000 each on holidays, said uncertainty would
have a bigger effect than any eventual mortgage rate rise.
'The top end of the market tends to be sophisticated and reacts very
quickly. It's not that they can't find Pounds 6,000 for a holiday - it's
that they don't tend to spend during periods of doubt,' Mr Winder said.
Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager of the luxury Inn on the Park in London,
said the long-term impact on the hotel's restaurant and banqueting
facilities might be severe.
'I always used to think a Europe without frontiers was a good idea,'
Spanish-born Mr Pajares said. 'But after what we've been through in the last
two years, you wonder if it's the best thing for this country.'
At the other end of the scale are companies whose customers have small
mortgages or live in council homes and are less affected by rate rises.
First Leisure, whose interests include bowling alleys and snooker halls, has
proved resilient. Mr John Conlan, its chief executive, said the insecurity
arising from yesterday's news might hamper business. 'Interest rates are not
the primary negative factor for our customers; it's the fear of
unemployment,' he said.
Uncertainty is also likely to affect package holidays bookings, as it did in
the run-up to this year's general election. Mr Peter Rothwell, marketing
director of Lunn Poly, the UK's largest chain of travel agents, said winter
holiday bookings were already 10 per cent down on last year.
Skiing holidays attract a significant number of male under-35s in the south
of England, who will suffer badly if mortgages rise.
A substantial proportion of the 'winter sun' market is, on the other hand,
made up of retired people, with paid-off mortgages and savings, who benefit
from rate rises.
Mr Bob Tyrrell, chief executive of the Henley Centre research institute, saw
bright spots for leisure and other industries: 'There's no doubt that people
have been staying at home more. Spending on heat and power have been very
buoyant, and we may expect that home videos, the food industry and other
home-based activities will be beneficiaries.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Alarm and disbelief in industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST NIGHT'S decision to suspend sterling within the ERM was the last straw
for the UK's business leaders in a day of pure bewilderment.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'We are disappointed that the government has been blown off course by
the currency markets. We think the government should urgently restore some
certainty to its financial policies. The absence of clear guidelines will
further weaken business confidence and the prospects for economic recovery.'
Earlier in the day Mr Paul Coker, managing director of the food group Ranks
Hovis MacDougall, said: 'I can't remember experiencing anything like this
before. The whole thing seems crazy. It's difficult to make rational
decisions.'
Sir Michael Angus, president of the CBI and chairman of the brewing group
Whitbread, said: 'As an industrialist I find it hard to credit what is
happening to our currency. We do not need a devaluation of sterling. Perhaps
a lot of currency speculators do.'
The rise in interest rates to 12 per cent was also greeted with general
dismay. Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of the consumer electronics group Amstrad,
said the effect on consumer spending would be disastrous. 'This will impact
heavily on the high street and companies like Amstrad in the key selling
season leading up to Christmas,' he said.
Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, said: 'People are so
terrified, they just aren't spending. This will frighten them even more. It
will be full stop and let's get under the bed for a week or two.'
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said: 'If
these rates persist, the result can only be a huge increase in company
failures. We could soon be contemplating the horrendous prospect of  1/2 m
jobless building workers.'
Mr Neil Marshall of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing the
UK's 7,000 franchised motor dealers, said that, almost irrespective of what
happened next, any remaining consumer confidence had been destroyed by
yesterday's events.
Before the decision to float sterling was announced most industrialists
continued to defend the government's policy of maintaining sterling's level.
'We need higher interest rates like we need a hole in the head,' Sir Michael
Angus said. 'But if it is a choice between that and devaluation then I
suppose it will have to be.'
Mr Ken Minton, chief executive of Laporte, the chemical company, said it
would be wrong to change course now.
The tobacco group BAT said: 'To leave the ERM would be to have suffered in
vain'.
Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman of Pilkington, the glass group whose profits
have sagged as the recession has affected its two main customers, the
building and vehicle industries, said he hoped the rate increase might break
'the logjam' of economic policy which had been 'just too rigid'.
The decision to float sterling was welcome news for Sir Owen Green, chairman
of the industrial conglomerate BTR, who had called for sterling to float
earlier in the day.
Even the government's supporters acknowledged that higher interest rates
would have a punitive effect on their own investment plans. Mr Barrie
Stephens, chairman of the engineering group Siebe, said managers were
entering uncharted waters.
'The cost of money was already a significant factor in decisions and now it
has become even more expensive,' he explained. 'It will put a further damper
on levels of investment.'
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, called for government action
to stimulate the economy. 'We believe that present circumstances make it
even more imperative that the government takes targeted action to stimulate
key areas of the economy,' he said.
City analysts said the rise in interest rates should not have as bad an
effect on UK companies as it did two years ago. The flood of rights issues
last year has done much to reduce corporate debt, although it is still at
high levels historically. Also, many companies with assets in the US have,
like Hanson, moved their debt into dollars in order to take advantage of low
US interest rates. But companies whose assets are declining in value will
see their gearing rise even if their debt does not.
Lower sterling would boost the profits of UK companies, since about half of
the profits of quoted companies come from abroad.
Andrew Jack writes: Commercial property experts said yesterday it was too
soon to judge the effect on the market of the sudden interest-rate rise but
suggested there would be little damage in the short term.
Mr Gerald Blundell, head of investment strategy at Jones Lang Wootton, the
chartered surveyors, said: 'This is more to do with 24-hour money than
24-year property cycles. There will be no immediate impact.'
Mr Rod Grant, managing partner of surveyors Hillier Parker, said: 'We can't
class this as good news. We are not panic-stricken because we saw it coming,
but it is still a bit of a jolt.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: More shop closures and job losses
feared - Retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS yesterday were praying that the higher level of interest rates
would be short-lived. They said that if mortgage rates had to rise then
consumer confidence, already at a low ebb, would be damaged further.
The sector is one of the first to suffer when consumer confidence falters.
Recession has been restraining retail sales for some years, the first signs
appearing after the stock market crash in October 1987.
Many smaller retailers have already been forced to close. Retail leaders
said yesterday that continued high interest rates would bring more
unemployment and shop closures.
Share prices fell sharply yesterday, although the stock market as a whole
closed higher. Prices of retailers of big-ticket items or housing-related
goods fell. Dixons, the electrical retailer, fell from 202p to 187p, a 7.4
per cent drop. The MFI furniture group saw its shares fall 10p to 91p.
Directors of stores groups were shocked by the two rate rises yesterday. One
said he was 'gobsmacked' when the second increase was announced. Another
said: 'I am sitting here, the sun is shining, and I am looking at my screen
wondering, 'Does anyone know what the hell they are doing?' It's bloody
chaos.'
Mr James May, director general of the British Retail Consortium, a retail
trade group, said that if the higher rate persisted for a couple of months,
retailers 'will face a bleak run-up to Christmas'. Many retailers make a
large proportion of their annual profits in November and December.
He said shops had already cut costs and there was 'not much fat in the
retail industry'.
Mr Nigel Whittaker of Kingfisher, the Woolworth, Superdrug, Comet and B&amp;Q
group, said the rate rise was 'frustrating'. The publication yesterday
morning of retail sales figures for August, which showed a rise in the
volume of sales of 1.8 per cent compared with August last year, had been
'almost the light at the end of the tunnel' he said.
At WH Smith, Sir Malcolm Field, the managing director, said: 'The question
is, how long does it go on for?'
Even food retailers, whose sales have held up relatively well, have been
under pressure in recent months. Mr David Webster, deputy chairman of
Argyll, the supermarket group, said yesterday: 'Food volumes are clearly
under some pressure and this can only be regarded as unhelpful.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Building chiefs warn of greater
hardship - Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION companies, already suffering from the worst recession for 50
years, recoiled in horror yesterday at higher borrowing costs for themselves
and their customers.
Industry leaders warned that anybody - from brick manufacturers, architects
and contractors to estate agents and chartered surveyors - making a living
from construction would suffer even greater hardship. Mr Graeme Odgers,
chief executive of Alfred McAlpine, said higher interest rates would make it
harder to sell homes while businesses would be even less likely to invest in
new offices, shops and factories.
Companies warned that business failures and plant closures were likely to
increase, forcing further redundancies in an industry that has already lost
almost 300,000 jobs since summer 1989. Many have been forced to cut dividend
payments to shareholders as profits have fallen.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers' Confederation, the
industry's largest trade association, said: 'If these rates persist, the
result can only be a huge increase in company failures and we could soon be
contemplating the horrendous prospect of  1/2 m jobless building workers.'
Estate agents said mortgage rate rises would deal the housing market 'a
hammer blow', delaying recovery in property values by at least six months.
Mr Michael Jones, president of the National Association of Estate Agents,
said the increases would kill stone dead an already faltering market.
Mr Colin Parsons, chairman of Taylor Woodrow, the contractor, housebuilder
and property development group, said: 'We might as well close the sales
offices this weekend until sanity returns.'
The biggest fear among builders and estate agents is that house prices,
which have fallen on average by 25 per cent to 30 per cent in southern and
eastern England, might fall even further.
Mr Odgers said housebuilders, already proffering a vast array of sales
incentives to encourage reluctant purchasers, would now concentrate on
offering cheap mortgage schemes. 'Builders which raised large borrowings to
buy expensively priced housing and commercial property land at the end of
the 1980s will be hit doubly,' he said. 'Their own interest bill will rise
while it will become more difficult to reduce debts by selling products to
customers.'
Criticism of government economic policy by construction companies,
traditionally big contributors to Conservative party funds, has intensified
recently as it became apparent that the housing recovery, hoped for after
the general election, would not occur until next year at the earliest.
Mr Robert Napier, chief executive of Redland, one of the UK's biggest
building materials companies, said: 'It has been apparent for some time that
the policy of trying to maintain parity between sterling and the D-Mark
cannot be sustained without seriously damaging the rest of the economy.
'If we do not devalue the pound and reduce excessive interest rates, the
recession will turn into a slump. The effects will be even more damaging for
the construction industry, forcing output to fall even further from the
current low levels.'
General contractors can also expect to suffer, with industry and commerce
even less likely to invest in new buildings.
Construction output, even before yesterday's announcement, was forecast to
fall by 6 per cent in the UK this year. That follows a 9 per cent fall last
year. According to the National Economic Development Office, commercial
construction - mainly offices and shops - is expected to fall by 25 per cent
this year.
More worrying for contractors has been the collapse in their margins as
contract prices have fallen by up to 30 per cent since the late 1980s as
competition for a dwindling workload has increased. Companies are fortunate
if margins on some contracts even cover overheads, according to the Building
Employers' Confederation.
Mr Richard MacCormac, president of the Royal Institute of British
Architects, said that even more architects' practices would close or make
staff redundant. He added: 'It means there will be architects who have to
sell their homes - if they can find a buyer.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / Japan's economic downturn gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Electronics Industry Association said yesterday it was preparing to
apply to the government for subsidies to help the industry through the
'employment adjustment' needed to cope with the recession, which has hit
hard at consumer electronics manufacturers.
The Labour Ministry's central employment security council, an advisory
panel, yesterday disclosed that five other industries had approached the
government over employment subsidies and that a further eight were
considering doing so.
Last week, steel producers said they were likely to apply for subsidies to
help cover the cost of transferring and retraining idle workers.
A company becomes eligible for the subsidy if its sales, production and
employment fall by more than 5 per cent in three months.
Employment subsidies cost the government Y40bn (Pounds 164.6m) in 1987,
which was the last time they were extensively used as the Japanese economy
was hit by a sharp appreciation of the yen.
While unemployment remains low, 'employment adjustment' refers to the
transfer of surplus workers to subsidiaries or other companies.
The electronics industry's troubles present one of the clearest signals yet
of how the recession is starting to eat in to Japan's industrial heartlands.
The association's call for employment subsidies followed a warning that
electronics output, one of the mainstays of Japanese manufacturing, could
suffer its sharpest fall since 1975.
The association said it had scrapped its original forecast of growth of
about 5.6 per cent to a fall in the value of production of between 5 per
cent and 8 per cent.
The fall has been led by a sharp drop in the production of consumer
electronics, video cassette recorders, camcorders and audio products, which
are expected to be about 17 per cent below last year's output.
Electronics output in the first half of the year was 10.4 per cent down on
the same period in 1991.
Further grim economic statistics yesterday confirmed the parlous health of
the Japanese economy.
Corporate bankruptcies were up 28.9 per cent in August from a year earlier,
according to report by Teikoku Data Bank, the credit research company,
published yesterday.
Small manufacturing companies are being particularly badly hit, according to
the report, which shows the main impact of the slowdown in the Japanese
economy is shifting from real estate and finance into industry.
Although the number of bankruptcies rose sharply, the debts owed by
companies which went bankrupt fell by 60 per cent from last year, reflecting
the fall in large bankruptcies and the growing number of small companies
that are falling prey to the recession.
Bankruptcies in manufacturing were up by 68 per cent on last year, while
real estate bankruptcies rose by 16 per cent.
A growing number of bankruptcies are due to the downturn in the Japanese
economy rather than the fall in the stock market which had been the main
force behind the rise in corporate failures over the past two years.
Further evidence of the weak state of the manufacturing sector was disclosed
by official figures for orders of new machinery.
Private sector demand for new machinery rose 12.9 per cent in July compared
with the month before, according to official figures from the Economic
Planning Agency.
However, most of the rise was accounted for by non-manufacturing companies.
Investment in new equipment by manufacturers continues to fall sharply in
many sectors, with machinery orders 26.8 per cent down in the car industry,
13.8 per cent lower in textiles and 5 per cent down in the steel industry .

FT  17 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Benetton outcasts
step back into the limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Benetton, the Italian clothing group, chose Moscow to trumpet its latest
marketing thoughts this week. The company was responsible for uproar in the
UK in January with an advertising campaign featuring, among others, a
picture of a dying Aids sufferer.
This time, Oliviero Toscani, Benetton's advertising guru, selected seven
photographs for poster and magazine advertising. Each carries a tiny
Benetton logo.
The photographs include: an empty electric chair in a New York jail; an
oil-covered bird from the Gulf; an albino African girl among black South
African girls; a grime-smeared child carrying a white doll, photographed in
El Salvador; pigs snuffling in a trash heap in Peru; a photo of children
building a brick wall in an unspecified developing country; and finally, a
group of KGB plain-clothes agents arresting a suspect (above).
Like its previous campaign, Benetton has again focused on the downbeat and
unhappy, this time selecting a set of apparent outcasts to sell its
colourful jumpers.
Toscani says he 'leafed through newspapers and magazines from all over the
world' to find the photographs. Critics of the previous Benetton campaign -
and there were many, from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to gay
activists - accused it of arrogant insensitivity.
Toscani brushed that criticism aside, saying his intention was to move from
'using advertising to promote a product, to the promotion of greater social
awareness'.
Some of the latest campaign photographs may also cause offence, though three
of the six due to run in the UK have already been seen and cleared by the
ASA. Benetton's ambition to be seen as a global company means that the
latest campaign is being unveiled in Tokyo, Beijing, New Delhi, Cairo and
Johannesburg.
The ASA argues that previous Benetton ads featuring black and white people
ran into the problem of compounding negative racial stereotypes, but that
the latest South African picture does not, prima facie, fall into that trap.
Benetton has reason to believe that its Dollars 80m (Pounds 40.6m) global
advertising budget is working: in 1991 it raised net group profits by 23.6
per cent to L164.8bn (Pounds 77.48m) due to higher sales and improved
financial management. Group turnover rose by almost 12 per cent to L2,303bn,
and the company sold 83m items through a chain of more than 6,500 shops in
100 countries.
But there are contrary indications. The US trade magazine Adweek has claimed
Benetton is losing market share, with its number of US stores likely to drop
to about 300 by the end of 1992, against a peak of 700 in the 1980s.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBOTT MEAD Vickers, the advertising agency, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.54m for the first half of 1992, a modest fall from the comparable
Pounds 1.9m.
Turnover increased by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 77.7m (Pounds 73m) during a
period of generally depressed client spending.
Excluding income from BBDO and minor agencies, turnover expanded by less
than 1 per cent, reflecting a reduction of client spending of about 10 per
cent.
AMV, which in March 1991 acquired BBDO, the London agency of BBDO Worldwide,
said that it had new business worth Pounds 42m in the first half and was
currently pitching for a further Pounds 39m. New accounts won so far this
year include ICL, Pillsbury, Adidas and Weetabix.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.5m).
Mr David Abbott, chairman, said: 'We have continued to pay close attention
to costs, giving selective salary increase only, holding property costs and
minimising ancillary expenditure.'
Earnings per share dropped to 6p (8.63p), but the interim dividend goes up 7
per cent to 3p (2.8p). James Capel, the broker, is forecasting pre-tax
profits of Pounds 6.1m for the year (Pounds 5.02m).

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Calor depressed by reorganisation costs
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILDER weather and restructuring costs were blamed by Calor Group, the
bottled gas company, for a 65 per cent fall in profits for the half-year to
June 30.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 32.7m) were struck after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 6m) to cover redundancies and the
write down of stock.
The number of employees was reduced by another 800 to some 2,200.
Several board changes are to take place at the behest of SHV, the biggest
shareholder. The Dutch investment company owns 46.2 per cent of the stock.
Mr Folkert Schukken is to relinquish his role as chief executive on January
1 in favour of Mr Howard Robinson, currently managing director of Calor Gas.
Mr Schukken is to oversee SHV's world-wide liquefied petroleum gas
operations; he will remain on Calor's board as non-executive deputy
chairman.
In the longer term, Mr Michael Davies, chairman, expects to relinquish that
post in favour of one of SHV's board members.
Mr Alistair Pate, finance director, said: 'The moves underline SHV's de
facto control and their intent to get legal control as soon as possible.'
Sales fell by 23 per cent to Pounds 165m (Pounds 214m) because of reduced
tonnage of gas supplied and lower selling prices.
Group operating profit fell to Pounds 27m (Pounds 40.1m).
Mr Hamish Macpherson, treasurer, said that while the core gas business
performed satisfactorily, costs associated with the development of new
businesses rose substantially.
The air separation businesses suffered operating losses of Pounds 3.8m
(Pounds 300,000) associated with technical and marketing costs.
Pam Gas, the joint venture with SHV, lost Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 200,000)
reflecting start-up management costs.
Borrowings stand at Pounds 15m and are expected to rise to about Pounds 20m
by the end of the year.
Earnings per share fell from 13.3p to 4.1p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 6p.

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring helps put Bluebird back in
black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE wide-ranging restructuring of the business in 1991, Bluebird Toys
returned to the black in the six months to June 30.
Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, said the toy designer, manufacturer and
distributor had 'an excellent first half' - profits emerged at Pounds
234,000 pre-tax (losses Pounds 4.47m).
Mr Angus Fisher, group operations director, said that the restructuring was
completed and paid for and that the results were showing the benefit.
In 1991 the company had found itself with excessive manufacturing capacity
in the UK as its international business developed. Cheaper manufacturing in
the Far East became imperative so two UK factories were closed.
The restructure accounted for Pounds 3.34m of last time's losses, and Mr
Fisher said the second-half performance would not match the first.
Group turnover in the first half advanced 49 per cent to Pounds 17.4m
(Pounds 11.7m), thanks in large part, Mr Fisher said, to a 78 per cent rise
in international sales to Pounds 8.68m.
This rise was mostly due to the worldwide distribution and sales agreement
with Mattel, the second biggest US toy maker, and a similar agreement for
Japan with Bandai. Bluebird's diminutive Polly Pocket range is the number
one girl's toy in that country.
UK turnover grew 29 per cent to Pounds 8.72m. Aside from the restructure,
profits were aided by lower overheads - between 1990 and 1991 stock was
reduced 50 per cent and by the end of the period under review it was cut by
a further 37 per cent. The overdraft was paid down by Pounds 2.5m to Pounds
7.5m.
Earnings per share emerged at 2.6p (losses 46.1p) and again there is no
interim dividend, though Mr Norman said the board expected 'to be able to
consider a dividend' at the year-end.

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Alumasc ahead 23% to Pounds 7.2m
</HEADLINE>

   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMASC, the UK's largest beer keg manufacturer which also makes precision
components and specification building products, announced record profits in
the year to June 30.
The growth, however, reflected contributions from companies acquired during
1991 and interest on net cash holdings. Mr John McCall, chairman, said the
year 'disappointed all reasonable expectations of economic recovery.'
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.2m showed a 23 per cent improvement on the
comparable Pounds 5.85m. Net cash balances declined from Pounds 4.5m to
Pounds 3.4m but nonetheless produced net interest receivable of Pounds
254,000 (Pounds 268,000).
Turnover amounted to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 41.8m), but the figure masked a
substantial change in the complexion of sales. The container and dispense
products division, which covers beer keg manufacture, sank to 30 per cent
(52 per cent) of the total, as demand from the brewing industry declined.
In contrast, turnover from specification building products rose to Pounds
20.9m (Pounds 11.3m) partly on acquisitions but also reflecting moves to
break away from dependence on the beer keg market, 'to be less dependent on
a single customer base,' as Mr McCall put it. 'I feel much less exposed than
I used to be five or six years ago,' he said.
Acquisitions pushed up total operating costs, but Mr McCall said that fixed
costs had been reduced in each of the individual businesses, stocks had been
cut and there were no bad debts.
Earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 31.3p; the proposed final dividend is
7.45p, bringing the total to 11p (10p).
Prospects for organic growth were not hopeful. 'Most of our market remain
depressed and hesitant,' Mr McCall said.

Lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.71m, against Pounds 5.14m, were announced
by James Finlay, the overseas trading and financial services group, for the
half year to June 30.
The result last time included a gain of Pounds 1.3m from the sale of the
Tower Bridge property.
As before, the results excluded the plantation interests in Bangladesh as
only a small proportion of the crop is sold by June, but they included the
Kenyan tea interests.
The company said that overall profits in Kenya were likely to be better than
last year. The loss on the Bangladeshi tea operations in 1991 was
substantial but a break-even position was expected for 1992.
Turnover fell to Pounds 70.7m (Pounds 74.2m). Earnings per share dropped by
1p to 1.9p and an unchanged interim dividend of 2p is declared.

Despite a sharp reduction, from Pounds 711,000 to Pounds 492,000, in

World of Leather, the USM-quoted furniture retailer, saw profits of Pounds
94,000 pre-tax for the six months to June 30.
The increase from the comparable Pounds 41,000 was achieved despite turnover
falling to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 13m) reflecting the closure of two stores
last year; turnover on a like-for-like basis showed a marginal improvement,
the company said.
Earnings per share rose from 0.5p to 1.2p. There is no interim dividend; the
last distribution to shareholders was a final of 0.8p in 1989.

THE TURBULENCE in the French drinks industry continued yesterday with
Remy-Cointreau, a leading wine and spirits producer, warning on profits, and
reports that LVMH, one of the largest players in French drinks, had secretly
bought a stake in Grand Marnier liqueur.
Remy, which has interests in wines and spirits including Cointreau liqueur,
had originally been expected to make net profits of about FFr313m (Dollars
65.07m) for the present financial year to March 30, an increase of 15 per
cent on the FFr271m in the previous year.
However, Mr Andre Heriard Dubreuil, Remy chairman, warned shareholders at
yesterday's annual general meeting that final profits may fall short of
those originally forecast because of 'the uncertain economic climate' and
the falling US dollar.
Meanwhile, LVMH has refused to comment on a report in Les Echos, the French
economic daily newspaper, that it has acquired a 7 per cent stake in
Marnier-Lapostolle, the family-controlled company that owns Grand Marnier
liqueur.
LVMH, which today announces its first-half results, said it was 'up to Grand
Marnier to comment on any changes in its shareholding'.
LVMH, which distributes Grand Marnier in south-east Asia, is reported to
have bought the 7 per cent holding from Marceau Investments, a French
finance house.
Marnier-Lapostolle made net profits of FFr75.5m last year on sales of
FFr601m, with its eponymous liqueur representing 80 per cent of total sales.

<TEXT>
BATA, one of the world's largest shoe producers and retailers, is returning
to Poland with the intention of establishing a nationwide network of retail
sales outlets. The move follows the company's return last year to
Czechoslovakia, where it was founded in 1894.
Bata was nationalised by the Communist Czechoslovak government after the
second world war, but has opened 40 shops there this year and bought one
medium-sized shoe producer.
Bata is the first western 'high street' retailer to come to Poland, where
trade remains largely in the hands of small private companies catering for
the country's nearly 40m consumers.
The Bata Shoe Organisation, the holding company for the group, has its
headquarters in Toronto.
Bata will be operating in Poland through Compar Bata, its Italian
subsidiary, in a joint venture with Intercam, which is a privately-owned
Polish company.
Intercam, founded in 1988, is also involved in joint ventures with DHL, the
international freight forwarding group and Ogilvy Mather, the advertising
company.
Bata is planning to open some 30 shops in Poland over the next few years and
intends to purchase some stock from the country's depressed shoe industry.
The company had 300 shops in Poland before the second world war and owned
two factories on what is now Polish territory.
However, Mr Thomas G Bata, the company's managing director, says it will not
be applying for their restitution nor does he have any immediate plans for
the purchase of existing plants.

<TEXT>
DRASTIC restructuring of Union Miniere's operations has helped the Belgian
non-ferrous metals group back into profit for the first half of 1992.
But a BFr1bn (Dollars 34m) extraordinary loss on the sale of the group's
stake in Hessenatie, its freight handling subsidiary, dragged the overall
interim result into the red.
The group, 82 per cent of which is owned by the holding company Societe
Generale de Belgique, made a profit of BFr416m before tax and extraordinary
items, compared with a loss of BFr1.32bn in the six months to June 30 1991.
The company forecast that it would break even for the full year, assuming
there was no further deterioration in the economic situation.
Operating profit rose from BFr4m to BFr894m in the first half. The company
attributed this increase to the BFr2.4bn rationalisation programme announced
last December, and increases in margins on some raw materials.
After tax and extraordinary charges of BFr1.49bn, the group share of
first-half losses was BFr1.39bn, compared with losses of BFr1.33bn last
year.
Turnover rose from BFr59.5bn to BFr66bn in the first six months of the year.

CHARGEURS, the French industrial group with interests in textiles and

The group last year returned to recovery after two years of heavy losses in

Chargeurs has since restructured its activities, notably by selling its UTA
airline interests to Air France.
Group turnover rose by 2.6 per cent from FFr5.29bn to FFr5.42bn in the first
six months of 1992.
Operating profits rose 57 per cent from FFr203m to FFr319m. Earnings per

FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Tokyo to lose five international
listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) suffered a serious loss of face yesterday
when five international companies, including General Motors, Philips
Electronics and News Corporation, formally applied for delisting from the
exchange.
Each of the five companies said a Tokyo listing was too costly to maintain,
and complained that trading in their shares, and those of most foreign
companies, has fallen over the past two years.
The announcements by GM, Philips, News Corp, Avon Products, the US cosmetics
and toiletries manufacturer, and FPL Group, the Florida-based utility,
dismayed TSE officials, who hoped more foreign companies would consider a
Tokyo listing to be necessary to their international profile.
'It's very disappointing. We are not sure whether other foreign companies
will delist. We know that some new companies are interested in listing,'
said Mr Tsutomu Hirabayashi, director of the TSE's office of listing
supervision.
The TSE fears that the delisting of such high profile companies will prompt
some of the other 119 listed foreign companies to withdraw. Japanese brokers
said they were aware of several companies considering an application.
GM criticised the cost of maintaining a Tokyo presence, and said the
delisting, to take effect at the end of this year, was part of a
cost-cutting campaign and 'a result of the very low interest in GM stock' in
Tokyo.
'The extraordinary administrative burdens and costs associated with the TSE
listing are due primarily to the unique form of reports to be filed under
Japanese law and the necessity for preparation of annual reports, quarterly
reports and proxy material,' GM said.
Mr Paul Mandry, assistant general counsel for Avon, said the annual cost of
the Tokyo listing was about Dollars 150,000, though the initial annual cost
to the company had been nearer Dollars 500,000.
'This decision is one of a number of cost-cutting measures that Avon has
implemented,' he said. Avon also had no plans to raise funds in Tokyo in the
near future and did not expect its trading volume to rise.
Several of the companies complained of the costs involved in translating
documents into Japanese and presenting reports according to Japanese
Ministry of Finance specifications, even though their local disclosure
requirements are more stringent.
However, the collapse of Tokyo stock prices and the resulting decline of
investor interest in foreign issues is the most important cause of the
delistings. The total of foreign shares traded in Tokyo peaked in 1987 with
an average of 2.76m shares traded each day. Daily volume this year is down
to an average 475,000 shares.
The five companies have also reported a sharp decline in their local
shareholders. In GM's case, the number has almost halved since the 3,521 of
1987, and the company said yesterday that the remainder account for 0.02 per
cent of all its shareholders.
Trading of foreign stocks was permitted in Tokyo in 1973 and, apart from
tapping the Tokyo market for finance, companies presumed that a listing
would heighten awareness of their products in Japan.
The announcements are also a setback for Japanese brokers, which hoped to
arrange the listings of foreign companies.

GROUPE Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), the Belgian holding company, said yesterday
it would not block the purchase of a 6.72 per cent stake in Banque Bruxelles
Lambert (BBL) by Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking
and insurance group.
ING announced a week ago it wanted to buy the stake from Unipar and SBH
Investments of Italy as a first step towards a full BFr63.6bn (Dollars
2.07bn) bid for BBL, Belgium's second largest bank.
Mr Jacques Thierry, BBL's chairman, yesterday voiced the strong support of
the bank's management for a deal. In addition, Banque Internationale a
Luxembourg (BIL) - which owns 5.7 per cent of BBL - has indicated it is
likely to sell out if ING makes an offer.
GBL owns a direct stake in BBL of 13 per cent and indirectly controls a
further 11 per cent. The group is also head of a BBL shareholder syndicate.
However, it told the bank's directors yesterday that it would not exercise
its priority right to buy the Italian stake.
Nevertheless, GBL directors indicated that the suggested offer price of
BFr3,600 is too low and GBL delegates on the BBL board could still oppose
the offer.

The strike had put on hold a Dollars 2bn deal for the Italian car maker's

Fiat's Cinquecento minicar.
Mr Maciej Brzozowski, a Fiat spokesman, said the agreement had not been

<TEXT>
GOTA, the Swedish holding company which owns Gota Bank, Sweden's fourth
largest commercial bank, said yesterday it had suspended all payments
because of funding problems.
Gota's liabilities amount to about SKr3.5bn (Dollars 643.4m), including
short-term and medium-term borrowings from domestic industrial,
institutional and private investors. The holding company said it would begin
negotiations with investors today to see whether it can repay part of the
debt.
The activities of Gota's subsidiary - Gota Bank - are not affected by
yesterday's announcement. Gota Bank last week announced a dramatic
deterioration in its financial situation, warning that credit losses for
1992 would reach SKr8bn - or double its earlier projections.
The bank added that it would run up an operating loss of between SKr3-SKr4bn
this year. Sweden's centre-right government promised to support Gota Bank,
saying it would take the necessary steps to ensure the stability of the
Swedish financial system.
The government yesterday repeated its pledge to guarantee Gota Bank's
commitments to private individuals, businesses and all other creditors and
counter-parties - liabilities which amount to an estimated SKr65-70bn.
The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, said yesterday it would continue normal
dealings with Gota Bank on both the interbank and securities markets, adding
that it 'intends to give Gota Bank access to the liquidity it requires'.
However, the government has said it will not guarantee the obligations of
Gota, the holding company which owns Gota Bank.
Mr Per Lundberg, managing director of Gota Bank, said the holding company
has borrowings of about SKr3.5bn, including about SKr1bn in commercial paper
certificates and the remainder in loans and sub-ordinated debt.
Most of the funds have come from Swedish companies, municipalities and
individual investors. Negotiations are expected to start today between Gota
and its creditors in an attempt to see whether a proportion of the debt can
be repaid.

FT  17 SEP 92 / R-R aerospace offshoot offers 4.25% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE'S aerospace division is offering many employees pay rises of
4.25 per cent in a move that will end a nine-month pay freeze and further
ameliorate some of the damage caused by the way the freeze was implemented.
Although the company does not conduct national pay negotiations, employees
at various plants around the country have been presented with identical
offers.
Mr Tony McCandless, convener for the AEU engineering union at Derby, where
the company has its largest plant, said: 'This looks like a corporate
offer.'
He said manual workers at Derby and employees at two Scottish plants had
been offered 4.25 per cent and that white-collar workers at Derby and
Bristol had accepted the same. 'After nine months without a rise, we are
slightly disappointed - but at Derby we are likely to put it to the
workforce.'
With the offer nearly 0.5 percentage points above inflation, the likelihood
is that the workforce will approve a deal.
Rolls-Royce's aerospace division caused widespread anger among its 34,000
employees last year when it announced a six-month pay freeze and said it was
terminating current contracts and replacing them with new ones so that it
could implement the freeze.
Some workers interpreted the move as meaning they would be dismissed unless
they signed new contracts. The company's action was widely viewed as
heavy-handed and notices about the contract changes were withdrawn. The pay
freeze was extended in subsequent negotiations.
The 4.25 per cent offer, which will cover nine months at Derby, is about the
average in current pay settlements.
An example of a higher offer was provided by British Sugar this week. It
agreed to raise the pay of 1,200 workers by 5 per cent and decrease the
working week from 39 hours to 37.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Top bosses seek work consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to create an industrial consensus based on the idea of
flexibility for employers and job security plus involvement for employees
was launched yesterday with the backing of several senior industrialists and
union leaders.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post Office, Mr David Sainsbury, deputy
chairman of J. Sainsbury, and Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of
Imperial Chemical Industries, were among supporters of the initiative
launched by the Involvement and Participation Association. It was also
backed by senior personnel directors at ICI and Unilever.
The main proposals, which have emerged from private discussions between
industrialists, union leaders and academics over the past two years,
include:
Making employment security the cornerstone of employment policy but linking
it with job flexibility.
Commitment to sharing success with the whole workforce.
Recognising employees' right to be informed, consulted and represented
whether they are in a union or not.
Sir Bryan acknowledged that employers and unions would have difficulty in
accepting parts of the document.
The employment security commitment is likely to be especially difficult for
employers, and some unions will find it difficult to give implicit support
for German-style works councils and other forms of employee participation,
which are seen as bypassing unions.
The association is asking for responses from companies, unions and other
groups.
Unemployment has risen more than 70 per cent in the past two years, more
than any other country in Europe, according to Ms Joyce Quin, a member of
Labour's employment team. The monthly unemployment figures today are
expected to show a 20,000-plus rise from the previous 2.75m, taking
unemployment near 9 per cent.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Patten warns on teachers' award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOUGH warning from the government to the teachers' pay review body
yesterday to keep down the cost of this year's salary award for teachers
gave further evidence of the Treasury's determination to contain
public-sector pay.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, told the review body: 'It is
unacceptable if, over time, the review bodies recommend settlements in
excess of those being obtained . . .in the private and public sectors.'
After this year's teachers' pay settlement of 7.8 per cent, and 9.5 per cent
the year before, Mr Patten's evidence is a warning to the review body not to
award another significant real increase.
Mr Patten said bluntly: 'The government is determined that the public sector
should not be insulated from the further downward adjustments to pay
settlements which are essential elsewhere in the economy to improve our
international competitiveness and employment prospects.'
He pointed to increases in teacher supply to justify restraint. Applications
this year for entry to training courses are a quarter up on last year, with
trainee numbers in the past two years sharply up and teacher vacancies
sharply down.
The review body, chaired by Sir Graham Day, is also being asked by the
government to design a performance pay scheme. Mr Patten called for
'far-reaching' modifications to the pay structure. He opposed an increase in
the number of responsibility allowances, wanting instead to link 'a larger
proportion of the pay bill to performance rather than through higher pay
awards'.
The review body will make its recommendation in January. Teachers' unions
have called for rises between 9 per cent and 16 per cent. This year's review
body recommendation was met and the government has pledged to honour
recommendations in all but exceptional circumstances.

LONDON needs a significant increase in its government-funded budgets for
training and business support if the capital is to lead Britain out of
recession, according to a report published yesterday by the capital's nine
Training and Enterprise Councils.
The Tecs said training of young people and unemployed adults in London had
been historically underfunded compared with other regions. Tecs required an
increase of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent, or an extra Pounds 45m to
Pounds 68m.
The report by Coopers and Lybrand, the management consultancy, is the first
big exercise in collaboration between Tecs to analyse and explore a regional
issue.
Its costings were dismissed by Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, who
said there were errors in the report.
Mr David Dickinson, chairman of London East Tec, said in response to the
minister's criticisms that the report was based on all the information that
was publicly available. He added that if the government disputed the figures
it should make its internal costings available.

THE HOURS AND TIMES ICA
Clint Eastwood's brilliant and harrowing Unforgiven packs all the punch of a
good Western without indulging in the plot cliches and moral certitudes so
often inherent in the genre. Eastwood, who at 62 seems to have reached his
peak form as a director, seems finally to have gained the artistic
confidence to toss such old chestnuts as the heroic gunslinger, righteous
sheriff and good-hearted whore into the fire, where they proceed to explode
in the audience's face.
The film tells the story of ageing gunfighter, Bill Munny (Eastwood), who
has become an apparently reformed farmer and family man. But things begin to
go bad for him - his wife dies, followed by most of his herd of pigs. When
the opportunity comes to make some fast money by killing two cowboys who
allegedly mutilated a woman, Munny takes the job to insure his children's
future. He enlists the help of his old sidekick, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman)
and sets out for the cowboys' hideout near Big Whiskey, a frontier town
presided over by a tough sheriff (Gene Hackman).
A familiar enough story to this point, though Eastwood and writer David Webb
Peoples proceed to set the whole thing on its head, foregoing standard
Western plot lines to expose the barbarism, cowardice and cruelty that must
have lain at the heart of the real Old West. Munny's glory days as a
gunfighter are gradually shown to be a prolonged spell of drunken, homicidal
insanity in which good guys, bad guys, women and children were his victims.
Indeed, when the time comes for him to engage in his first gunfight, it
turns out to a repellent act of bushwhacking.
The woman Munny and his friends are supposed to be avenging turns out to a
whore whose injuries are far less serious than first thought. Even the good
guys are shown to be corrupt - Hackman's sheriff turns out to be a sadist
with no regard for the law. The mixture of these various rotten elements
leads toward a finale in which characters meet their dismal fate with equal
degrees of ignominy and damnation. The only one who makes a choice that
could be called heroic ends up a cadaver left on display in Big Whiskey's
main street.
It is a grim picture lightened by fine acting, beautiful photography and,
most of all, subversively mordant irony. Nothing is at it seems in Big
Whiskey. It's worse. Richard Harris has a wonderful supporting role as
English Bob, another hired gun who comes across as a gentleman gunfighter
yet is soon exposed a cowardly assassin in the pay of railroad bosses. Munny
is forced to confess that his drink-addled brain cannot recollect the deeds
that made him famous, though it is this very past which comes back to seal
his doom.
Indeed, as a reformed character he is useless, falling off his horse,
shooting poorly and losing fights. It is only when he goes back on the
bottle that he becomes an effective gunman again. Most tellingly of all,
there is the device of having a pulp writer (Saul Rubinek) to 'record' the
whole bloody pageant, thereby allowing the audience to see how myopic,
headline-grabbing eyes can transform barbarism into myth.
Despite Eastwood's finely ironic touch, this must still be one of the
bleakest films to ever top the American box office. Life in 1880's Wyoming
is shown as being nasty, brutish and, for the lucky ones anyway, short. What
looks at first to be a trot to redemption ends up a gallop into hell. True,
there are some half-hearted attempts at Christian imagery - an ill Munny
sleeps for three days before rising to meet his destiny, while Logan is
strung up as if on a cross and whipped when captured. But these are merely
teases - the film's ethos is ultimately Old Testament, with Eastwood's last
words a unredeemed jeremiad that thunders through the streets of Big
Whiskey.
Yet, despite its bleakness, the film remains richly rewarding, peppered with
the sort of memorable one-liners for which Eastwood is famous and ending
with a shoot out that will not disappoint traditionalists. Just don't expect
the good guys to ride off into the sunset.
A League of Their Own combines wartime nostalgia, lots of baseball and an
innocuous dose of feminism. It tells the story of the All-American Girls
Professional Baseball League, formed in 1943 when many male baseball players
had gone off to war. Geena Davis portrays an Oregonian farm girl who is
lured, along with her sister (Lori Petty), to play for the Rockford Peaches.
After much initial scepticism on the part of fans and their hard-drinking
coach (Tom Hanks), the women's grit and determination win the day.
The film works best as a comedy, with especially funny turns by Jon Lovitz
as a wise-cracking scout and Hanks as the drunken has-been player. There is
also some gratifyingly skillful baseball. Davis performs well in the
thankless role of the humourless head girl who just wants to go home and
have babies, while Madonna, as the team's obligatory loose woman, wisely
confines her efforts to providing strong supporting help. Director Penny
Marshall once again proves herself to possess both a deft hand for light
comedy and an unfortunate weakness for sentimentality.
The Hours and Times is a wistful, well-acted drama about an imaginary
weekend that John Lennon and Beatles manager Brian Epstein might have spent
together in 1963. Set in Barcelona, the film concerns Epstein's attempts to
confess his love and longing for Lennon, which the latter gently yet firmly
rejects. Writer/director Christopher Munch has created a slow, knowing,
often agonised film that has a lot more to do with Bergman than Help] He is
greatly aided by Ian Hart's deft impersonation of the cocky yet sensitive
Lennon and David Angus's considered portrayal of the tortured Epstein.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Arts: Teresa Berganza in recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back in the 1970s Victoria de los Angeles used to come to London and give
recitals where she would only start to get her audience warmed up with the
first of her encores and would then go on to sing for another half an hour
or more. It seems this may be a Spanish tradition.
It would be unfair to suggest that Teresa Berganza did not give her audience
at Covent Garden on Tuesday anything to value in her programme, but she did
leave it until late in the day. She is not an earthy Spanish mezzo, a
sizzling and scorching singer like Conchita Supervia was years ago. Berganza
sings with impeccable taste and craftsmanship, which allow for few risks to
get the adrenalin going.
This was an all-Rossini programme, just about an hour of music. Berganza has
the distinction of being a leading post-war Rossinian and his music still
suits her well. The voice has lost some of its focus in the middle, which is
breathy, but it is in good shape at either end, bright at the top with a
keen edge, unforced and resonant at the bottom.
It almost seems a shame that the singer is not approaching her prime now, as
she would be an ideal person to sing the Rossini operas alongside an
orchestra of authentic instruments. The style, like the voice, is perfectly
contained, precise, nothing out of place. The cantata Giovanna d'Arco needed
more panache. But there were some good examples of bel canto songs and one
truly outstanding piece of stylish and expressive singing in the heartfelt
'Addio di Rossini'.
Then came the encores. Rossini in Spanish style, zarzuela, Spanish song,
'Cruda sorte' from L'italiana in Algeri, all well accompanied by Juan
Antonio Alvarez Parejo and sung with enough elan to bring the evening to a
rousing close. The array of flowers was one of the largest the Royal Opera's
recital series can have seen. It is surely too soon for this to have been
the 'Addio di Berganza'.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Arts: Hamlet - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a sense of excitement about a new production of Hamlet that does
not attach to any other English play, for every Hamlet is different and
there is no such thing as a definitive performance. Alan Rickman looks,
speaks and moves as if he has been waiting to play the part all his life. He
has come to it at the right time. His Hamlet looks genuinely youthful.
Ophelia's speech about the 'observed of all observers' has him absolutely
right. He is better educated, better looking, more sensitive and more
civilised than any one else in the Danish Court. The more modern English
phrase is 'effortless superiority'.
Rickman plays the role very quietly. There are few histrionics and no
gimmicks. The moment of real passion comes when he sees Ophelia's burial.
Here he erupts, but it is the madness of grief rather than that of an
unhinged mind. He does not behave so alarmingly even in the bedroom scene
with his mother, where the madness is plainly feigned. This Hamlet loves
Ophelia.
Rickman's simple approach is abetted by an equally simple set. There are few
props - not much more than the odd chair. There is, however, a spare metal
balcony running across the top of the back of the stage and abbuting
T-shaped high into the centre. It also allows a marvellous use of space.
Characters can enter high up on the balcony. Claudius and Gertrude watch the
Murder of Gonzago from this elevated position. Hamlet is sitting with
Ophelia on the T while the players perform beneath. Again Hamlet is tempted
to kill the king with his sword from above in his soliloquy 'Now might I do
it pat'.
There is a lot of space on the ground, allowing Hamlet to walk about. Plenty
of room, too, for the gravediggers and the final fight. The impression is
more of a mixture of desert and prison than a formal court. The unobtrusive
use of lighting by Giorgi Meskhishvili, who also designed the set, has
moments of sheer brilliance.
If Rickman is a quietly convincing, almost conventional Hamlet, the
direction by Robert Sturua has its surprises. Osric is played not as a
precious young fop, but as a fussy middle-aged man with foppish tendencies,
bowler hat and spats. Laertes is different from any previous conception
known to this reviewer. He wears spectacles, is much smaller than Hamlet
and, whether in sports jacket or old leather and jeans, looks like a student
who would genuinely prefer to be at the Sorbonne rather than the court of
Denmark.
Sturua's main coup is to cut the formal fencing at the end to the bone.
There are just enough exchanges between Hamlet and Laertes for the fatal
wound to be inflicted: none of that phoney business where we are asked to
believe that the actors are equally handy with the epee.
One weakness is Polonius. English productions have tended traditionally to
play him as a buffoon. Modern east European productions have portrayed him
as a state bureaucrat. This Polonius falls between all stools and is nothing
in particular. I also wonder whether it is wise to have David Burke playing
both Claudius and Ghost, since one of the points of the play is meant to be
Hamlet's perception of how different his uncle and his father were.
Among the strengths are Geraldine McEwan's Gertrude who shows to perfection
the harrowing experience of ageing overnight. Also Julia Ford's Ophelia who
demonstrates that she has learned from Hamlet's brutal sexual teasing by
doing a mock rape of Cladius. Among the smaller parts Steven Crossley is an
outstanding first player.

The programme listings should have a stock of logos saying 'OLD]', then when
all those familiar series return for the autumn season they could be given
accurate labels instead of 'NEW' claims. Among the well worn series
reappearing today are Taggart (9.00 ITV) with the glum little Scottish
detective played, as ever, by Mark McManus.
BBC1 brings back one of British television's earlier and most highly rated
examples of tabloid television, Crimewatch UK. Like Dickens' Fat Boy this
sets out to make our flesh creep with tales of 'orrible murder and then,
unlike the Fat Boy, grinningly instructs us not to have nightmares. That is
followed by another old series, Question Time (10.15). It is as well to have
some form of extra-parliamentary forum on television to discuss current
politics, but this programme has never been the same since Robin Day left.
BBC2's fascinating series The Climbers (8.00) ends with Chris Bonington
considering the modern phenomenon of superfast climbers who, in a few hours,
race to summits which once took days for large expeditions. Has
mountaineering turned into a stunt?

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Community Hospitals shows 16% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMUNITY Hospitals Group, which runs private hospitals and nursing homes,
increased pre-tax profit by 16 per cent to Pounds 6.75m in the 12 months to
the end of June.
The rise, from Pounds 5.81m, came on turnover up 20 per cent to Pounds 42.1m
(Pounds 35.1m). The pre-tax figure compares with the Pounds 7m given by the
company in March as its 'best view' of the full-year outcome.
Although the tax rate was lower, growth in earnings was limited to less than
3 per cent, from 15.6p to 16p per share, by extra shares in issue after last
year's Pounds 10.4m rights issue.
Sir Peter Thompson, chairman, said the company had had about nine rights
issues since 1981. Now it had reached a stage where organic growth could be
financed in-house.
This might mean gearing rising to between 50 and 60 per cent as capital
spending continued. It was Pounds 21m last year and would be nearly Pounds
20m this year.
In June, net debt stood at Pounds 22m, gearing of 33 per cent, compared with
Pounds 4m and 7 per cent at the end of the pre-vious year. Mr David Croker,
finance director, said Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.1m) of interest had been
capitalised.
The hospital division, which has 10 units and 480 beds, increased operating
profit by 14 per cent to Pounds 5.6m on turnover up 17 per cent to Pounds
36.1m.
While the recession had reduced income from self-pay patients, the insured
market continued to grow and changes in the National Health Service had
created contracting opportunities.
Continuing care improved profit by 56 per cent to Pounds 1.25m on Pounds 6m
turnover. Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive, said the market was being driven
by the increasing number of elderly people, particularly those over 85,
where one in five suffered from dementia.
In addition to the group's eight nursing homes, clusters of sheltered flats
and cottages were being developed alongside its main sites. Services could
also being delivered to people in the community.
A proposed final dividend of 4.1p lifts the total from 6p to 6.5p.
COMMENT
No sooner did Community Hospitals bite the bullet by deciding to fund future
growth with debt in preference to paper than interest rates shot up. One
analyst hastily downgraded a 1992-93 forecast from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds
7.2m pre-tax 'as a gesture' towards what higher financing costs might mean
to a group whose debt was Pounds 22m and rising. While an ageing and
increasingly infirm population will undeniably fuel the health market, the
impact of NHS reforms and the Care in the Community legislation due next
spring is less easy to predict. Trust hospitals, for instance, will increase
competition. The Pounds 7.2m forecast gives a prospective p/e of less than
12 on yesterday's close of 191p. This is a comparatively low rating for a
company in an expanding market and the stock is worth holding. However,
earnings growth has been muffled first by extra equity and now by finance
costs and rising tax.

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: BDM beats flotation forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH DATA Management, the London-based data storage and management
specialist which was floated on the Stock Exchange just before the general
election, yesterday reported full-year results ahead of its flotation
forecasts.
Pre-tax profits in the year to June 30 more than doubled to Pounds 2.5m,
against Pounds 1.14m a year earlier, comfortably beating the forecast of
Pounds 2.38m.
Turnover increased to Pounds 13m (Pounds 12.7m), buoyed by strong demand
from the offshore oil industry for data storage facilities.
Operating profits at Pounds 3.59m (Pounds 2.31m) also exceeded the Pounds
3.5m forecast at the end of March.
Helped by lower-than-expected tax charges and interest cost, earnings per
share increased to 11.9p (7.8p) out of which the company will pay a maiden
dividend of 1p, as expected.
Britannia Data Management, BDM's main operating subsidiary and the UK's
largest contract storer of oil exploration data for leading oil companies,
delivered the strongest performance, recording a 90 per cent increase in
operating profits.
Britannia Storage Systems, the specialist racking systems company, also
enjoyed 'spectacular growth' with sharply higher operating profits. However,
Eurocrate, although remaining profitable, suffered from the 'severe impact
of the recession on the domestic and commercial removals market.'
Mr Stephen Crown, chairman, noted that during the year BDM set up additional
data storage facilities in Aberdeen to service the buoyant market for
off-site storage services required by the oil industry. He said demand since
opening had been so strong that the group was now looking for a second
Aberdeen property.
Despite the recession, Mr Crown said the volume of data stored and handled
in the south-east continued to grow steadily. Reflecting this, BDM acquired
the London-based data storage business of the Exclusive Group for Pounds
1.45m last month.
Since the end of the financial year BDM has won two new five-year contracts
for library and data management services from British Petroleum, valued at
more than Pounds 1.6m a year.
In addition, the group recently formed an alliance with US-based Ovation
Data Services, which will now carry out all computer tape copying at BDM's
storage site at Coulsdon in London.
Mr Crown said the main focus for the company in the next year will be to
expand organically, 'using our strong financial position to expand our
presence in our chosen markets, including upgrading our information
technology-based systems for ourselves and our customers.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: New acquisitions behind 18% jump to Pounds
6.2m at SBJ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS BY Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance group, allowed pre-tax
profits to rise 18 per cent to Pounds 6.23m in the six months to June 30.
However, organic growth proved disappointing.
Turnover rose 20 per cent to Pounds 24.5m, while expenses increased 23 per
cent to Pounds 22.3m.
Mr Tony Keys, finance director, said profits would have fallen without the
contributions from SBJ Regis Low and Nelson Steavenson Bloodstock, which
were bought earlier this year.
He said underlying expenses - disallowing the impact of the new companies -
were down 3 per cent, as a result of staff reductions and tight control on
wage increases.
The acquisitions also helped boost investment and other income to Pounds
3.8m, compared with Pounds 2.8m last time.
Income fell from divisions including SBJ Oil &amp; Gas, SBJ Marine and the North
American operations, which experienced increased competition.
Earnings per share fell 1.15p to 8.77p but the interim dividend is
maintained at 4.25p.
Mr David Beresford Jones, chairman, admitted that the results had not
fulfilled directors' expectations at the time of the 1991 annual report, due
mainly to a disappointing performance from wholesale insurance.
He said he saw no signs of improvement during the rest of the year for the
company's three principal areas of activity.
He anticipated continued difficulties for wholesale insurance and lower
profitability from Regis Low than during its last year before acquisition.

<TEXT>
WATERFORD FOODS, the largest dairy processor in the Irish Republic,
announced a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 8.69m, or
Pounds 8.34m, after amortisation of goodwill, for the six months to June 30.
Turnover advanced by 15 per cent to IPounds 250m.
The company said that 'very good performances were recorded by all our
businesses except the UK fruit juice operations where results were below
expectations. The first half also benefited from the acquisition of United
Co-operative Dairies (UCD) in December 1991.'
The company's 2-for-9 rights issue last February raised IPounds 24.3m. It
completed the purchase of Express Foods, Ireland in July, at the same time
as taking 100 per cent control of Premier Dairies, the principal supplier to
the Dublin liquid milk market.
The latest two acquisitions cost IPounds 89.6m, bringing the total spent on
acquisitions over the past four years to some IPounds 200m.
The company said that 'major progress' was being made in restructuring the
two neighbouring dairy companies it acquired in the UK, Healds in 1989 and
UCD in 1991, and that significant benefits would come through over the next
18 months.
Healds and UCD have a combined milk pool of 60m gallons, and a combined
market share for liquid milk of about 25 per cent in the north- west region
around Manchester.
Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, said a broadening of the company's
product portfolio and cost competitiveness were group priorities and that
the recent acquisitions gave the directors confidence for Waterford's future
as 'a large, international, consumer-orientated food business.'
Goodwill amortisation of IPounds 621,000 held back earnings per share to
4.29p (4.21p). An interim dividend of 1.15p (1.1p) is declared.

overheads

<TEXT>
HOSKYNS, the computer services company, is making redundant 150 of its 3,000
employees in preparation for what it sees as a long haul to the end of the
recession.
About one third of the total are senior managers. Mr Geoff Unwin, chairman,
said the restructuring move was designed to reduce central overheads while
leaving intact staff dealing directly with customers.
He said the business plan for the year had been based on a belief that the
recession would have started to lift by the end of 1992. Yesterday he said
there was no sign of an improvement, 'and no compelling reason why there
should be one. We are pessimistic about next year'.
The company, which is owned by Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, Europe's leading
computing services company, said it would further focus its activities on
the finance sector and on outsourcing - running customers' computer systems
for them - which have been traditional strengths.
The company had a unbroken record of growth until 1991 but the recession has
hit the computing services sector hard as prospective customers have
postponed or cancelled new projects.
At the half-year stage Hoskyns made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.6m on sales
of Pounds 95.7m.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Algeria to control imports
</HEADLINE>

   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA has set up a government committee to decide on import priorities.
This marks a reversal of the policies followed since 1990 of liberalising a
strictly centrally-controlled economic system.
The government said it was acting 'to contain the risk of economic, social
and political collapse', a reference to the resurgence of Islamic
fundamentalism since the electoral process was suspended last January and to
the unprecedented economic strains from the debt service ratio of the last
three years.
Priority will be given to imports of foodstuffs, running at about Dollars
1.8bn this year, pharmaceutical products and building materials. The decree
urges importers to 'limit their foreign exchange spending to a strict
minimum' and to forego ostentatious purchases such as luxury cars.
Imports are expected to reach about Dollars 7bn this year while exports,
mainly oil and gas, will reach Dollars 11.3bn. However, because of the very
heavy cost of servicing foreign debt, the ratio of repayments to foreign
income is expected to remain high, at 74 per cent.

MITSUBISHI Motors of Japan and Daimler-Benz are close to an agreement under
which Mitsubishi will supply the German vehicle group with diesel engines
for light trucks.
Mitsubishi confirmed yesterday the two companies were negotiating an engine
deal, although it refused to discuss details.
The deal, expected to be concluded by year end, would mark one of the first
tangible co-operative arrangements between the two companies, following a
widely publicised decision by the two in 1990 to seek a broad strategic
alliance.
An earlier agreement between the two companies under which Mitsubishi
dealers in Japan have been selling Mercedes-Benz cars has run into
difficulties, in part because Mercedes is interested in developing
independent dealers in Japan who specialise in its vehicles.
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper reported that Mitsubishi would be
developing a 2,800cc diesel engine for Daimler-Benz's T1 model vehicles, to
be marketed from 1995. Mitsubishi would supply about 9,000 engines a year.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Austria still profits from special relationship: One-time
middleman trade with former Comecon states survives bloc's break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Soviet empire collapsed three years ago, Austrians feared much of
their trade would disappear.
The country had long profited from its cold war role as a reliable supplier
and discreet middleman in often clandestine east-west trade. In the
mid-1980s, Austrian exports to countries of Comecon, the Soviet trade bloc,
totalled ASch25bn-ASch30bn (Pounds 1.3bn-Pounds 1.6bn) a year, about 8 per
cent of its total trade. Imports were on a similar scale.
Today, to the surprise and pleasure of Austrian leaders, the economic
resurgence of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland has already more than
offset losses in other former Comecon countries. These three account for
more than 80 per cent of former Comecon trade, according to Austrian
officials.
In the first six months of this year, exports to the three amounted to 11
per cent of Austria's exports. Austria has been more successful in trading
with these countries than any other western country, a fact that goes some
way to explaining why the Austrian economy has resisted recession longer
than those of its western neighbours.
Austria's trade with these countries has grown sharply in the past three
years, although in the case of Poland the growth stopped in the first half
of this year.
Mr Egon Winkler, Austria's overseas trade director, is optimistic that the
trend will continue and perhaps broaden to other eastern countries. 'The
demand for products we can offer is very large in the CIS (Commonwealth of
Independent States) countries, but financing is a problem.'
He says the composition of the eastern trade is already broadly based. 'The
outstanding items are, as you would expect, construction equipment and
materials, services and machinery.'
According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), 14 per cent
of the 49,000 joint ventures set up in eastern Europe have been made by
Austrian companies. And of the roughly Dollars 13bn (Pounds 6.5bn) invested
in eastern European countries, 6.5 per cent has come from Austria.
Austria is trying to cement relationships by offering management training to
fledgling businessmen from eastern countries. Mr Johann Farnleitner, deputy
secretary general of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, says more than 12,000
people have gone through 420 courses to date. 'They are grateful, and we
make sure they have a short stay with an Austrian company while they are
here. It is the beginning of a number of networks.'
The drawback for Austria is low-priced imports from the eastern countries.
The main victims are Austrian makers of cement, fertilisers, farm machinery,
building materials and, to a small extent, low grade steels. (Agriculture
would be another, but Austria, like the EC, fiercely protects its farmers.)
Companies in these sectors have been demanding protection from what they
consider dumping by the eastern countries. Austrian officials acknowledge
that eastern companies benefit from low wages, low energy prices and
virtually no environmental protection costs, but they are in a difficult
position. Austria's exports to Hungary exceed its imports from that country
by a third. The surplus with Czechoslovakia is 20 per cent. 'It is hard for
us to do anything to help these hurt sectors because we are doing so well
overall,' Mr Farnleitner says.
Austria's policy is to try to give these sectors time to adjust. In the case
of cement, which is causing acute problems, the government hopes to set up
an orderly marketing agreement with eastern producers to start when import
quotas are removed at the end of this year.
Some observers estimate that up to 100,000 Austrian jobs may be lost as a
result of the new eastern competition. Mr Farnleitner puts the figure at up
to 40,000.
Mr Franz Vranitzky, the federal chancellor, who has to bear the political
pressure of this development, observes wryly: 'It is one of those difficult
situations in which you see macro-economic success and micro-economic
defeat.'
Another problem has arisen as a result of the association agreements between
the European Community and the three eastern countries. The agreements
stipulate that goods must move directly between the two to win duty-free
status. This causes problems for Austria and other members of the European
Free Trade Association (Efta), especially for the many large European
companies which have established depots in eastern Austria to serve eastern
Europe.
Talks are to be held soon between EC and Efta officials to try to resolve
the problem.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Hopes mount for River Plate bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA and Uruguay believe they have come a step closer to fulfilling a
100-year-old dream of building a bridge across the River Plate, which
divides them.
Officials from both countries are pleased with the results of a two-day
conference last week in Buenos Aires where more than 100 bankers,
construction companies, consultants and architects discussed the project.
The two governments believe the 55km bridge can be built entirely with
private money.
The bridge would cost between Dollars 800m and Dollars 1bn (Pounds 526m).
Investors would recoup their outlay through tolls and services ranging from
fast food outlets to bureaux de change and duty free shops.
After 30 years the concession would be transferred to the two governments.
Economists estimate the bridge could yield rates of return on investment of
14-22 per cent a year. However, one engineer pointed out that a Dollars 1bn
investment would require cashflows in excess of Dollars 100,000 a day - an
improbable scenario. A banker said the risks of such a large, fixed
investment would make some form of state guarantee essential.
To be particularly attractive the project would also require a motorway link
to southern Brazil. But serious discussions with Braslia over construction
of a motorway have hardly begun.
The bridge would present few technical difficulties; the only potential
problem being the sinking of foundations into the estuary's soft, silty bed.
A consultant said that although the project would not have a great
environmental impact, heavy traffic flows could alter social life in
Uruguay's rural interior.
The two governments will spend several weeks considering suggestions made
during the conference before drawing up terms of reference for a group of
consultants to be hired with World Bank loans.
The consultants would report back in 1994. A consortium would then be chosen
to finance, build and manage the bridge, with the hope of completion by
1998.

FT  17 SEP 92 / China resists US pressure to cut tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE days of talks between the US and China, aimed at heading off the
threat of a trade war over access for US goods, have ended in failure.
Mr Michael Moskow, the deputy US trade representative, said nevertheless he
remained 'hopeful' of progress.
The dispute over access to the Chinese market for US goods threatens to blow
up into a trade war. The US deficit with China stands at Dollars 12.7bn and
is rising. Washington argues that China cannot be allowed to run up a huge
trade surplus while keeping its own markets closed through tariffs, import
licensing and other barriers.
The US has warned it will impose punitive tariffs on about Dollars 4bn of
Chinese products if the row is not resolved. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade
representative, last month issued a 44-page list of Chinese imports,
including footwear, silks, luggage and electronic goods, that could face a
doubling of tariffs unless China takes significant action to open its market
by October 10.
China retaliated with a threat to impose higher tariffs on US imports.
The war of words between the two hotted up with the decision of President
George Bush to sell F-16 fighters to Taiwan. Beijing reacted furiously,
adding to the strain on bilateral relations. Outraged commentaries in the
Chinese media accused the US of deceit, lies and interference in China's
domestic affairs.
Beijing said it would refuse to co-operate with the US in the UN and would
stop buying American wheat if the F-16 sale went through.
Mr Moskow said in Beijing yesterday the Chinese side had commented on US
arms sales to Taiwan but it was not a serious part of the discussion. He
stressed that the negotiations, which began a year ago, had focused on
trade.
Further talks are to be held in Washington in early October. One observer
said he expected China to respond to US pressure at the eleventh hour, as it
did in negotiations with the US on copyright and intellectual property.
Heavily dependent on exports to fuel its economic boom, China would come off
worst in any trade war and is unlikely to risk a confrontation.
Only 2 per cent of US exports go to China, but America takes 20 per cent of
Chinese exports.
Mr Moskow said the outcome of the negotiations would affect US treatment of
China's most-favoured-nation trade status and on US attitudes to China's
accession to Gatt.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Body Shop shares fall 40% on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANITA and Gordon Roddick, the founders of Body Shop International, yesterday
saw the value of their personal shareholding fall by Pounds 56m as the
natural cosmetic company's shares dropped 41 per cent following a profits
warning.
The company, which until now had been one of the few UK retailers to have
defied the recession, said lower than expected UK sales since June would hit
profits for the six months to end-August.
Although international trading profits had increased substantially, Body
Shop forecast that group pre-tax profits would fall to 'not less than Pounds
8m' compared with the Pounds 9.1m achieved the year before. The interim
dividend would remain unchanged at 0.68p, the company said.
The stock market reacted savagely whittling away the company's premium
rating and marking Body Shop's shares down 108p to 158p.
Mr Gordon Roddick, Body Shop's chairman, said: 'I think it is a huge
over-reaction. If you look at our underlying business there is nothing
strange. There is nothing odd going on with borrowings or capital
expenditure or anything else.'
Mr Roddick said UK profits had been affected by the continuing recession, a
dispute with one of the company's franchisees which had led to the temporary
closure of six profitable stores, and the expenses associated with the
relocation of its Cos-Tec manufacturing subsidiary.
But he added that the recession could well last longer than anyone had
previously expected.
City analysts suggested Body Shop's UK same-store sales had declined 3 per
cent to 5 per cent during the past three months. One speculated 'some of
Body Shop's unique appeal may also have been diluted recently by the bigger
retailers becoming more environmentally-friendly and the fact that its
products are not cheap'.
Boots has had success with its own-label range of Natural Collection
products and supermarket groups, such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway,
have also earmarked the personal care sector for growth. Mr Roddick
dismissed such suggestions as 'absolute rubbish'. 'You only have to look at
the customers in Boots to know that they are not the same as ours.'
The company will release its interim figures in mid-October.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Roddicks in a tough environment / Analysis of why the
'pinstriped dinosaurs' of the City took the shine off the shares in the
quirky natural cosmetics group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop International has always had a highly ambivalent attitude towards
the pleasures and pains of being a public company.
The quirky natural cosmetics group, which was first floated on the Unlisted
Securities Market eight years ago, has conspicuously enjoyed the glory of
having one of the highest ratings in the retail sector.
But this has never stopped Mrs Anita Roddick, the group's founder and
managing director, from professing that finance 'bored the pants off her'
and periodically denouncing the 'pinstriped dinosaurs in Throgmorton Street'
for their short-sighted obsession with profits above people.
Yesterday, however, the dinosaurs bit back with a vengeance. The
announcement that Body Shop's interim profits were likely to fall by 12 per
cent to not less than Pounds 8m drove the company's shares down 41 per cent
to close at 158p.
Some retail analysts argued that the sharp reappraisal of Body Shop's share
rating - although appearing highly alarming - was little more than a natural
readjustment to realistic expectations.
According to the forecasts of the Nomura Research Institute, Body Shop was
trading on a high prospective multiple of 26 before yesterday's fall and a
more realistic 19 after it, close to the stores sector's rating.
'Obviously a lot of the glamour has now gone out of the stock but we think
Body Shop's problems are essentially restricted to UK sales. The
international business is still doing well and there are no worries over the
balance sheet,' said Mr Ian Macdougall, retail analyst at Nomura.
Body Shop was floated in 1984 at a time when 'the City was positively
orgasmic about the whole niche-market concept', according to Mrs Roddick.
The share price, allowing for share splits, rose from just over 5p in 1984
to a high of 370p this February.
Spurred on by the unprecedented consumer boom of the late 1980s and the
growing wave of environmental awareness which it did so much to encourage,
Body Shop expanded at a furious rate.
The seemingly ubiquitous Mrs Roddick energetically projected the image of an
environmentally concerned company selling jolly good soaps and peppermint
foot lotions.
But below the surface, Body Shop created a relatively solid management team
which avoided many of the financial excesses that characterised its more
reckless rivals.
A group of professional managers - many of them drawn from the ranks of the
big multi-nationals which the company publicly professed so much to disdain
 -ensured that Body Shop was able to show greater staying power than other
niche retailers in tough times.
In the last financial year to February, Body Shop pre-tax profits rose 26
per cent to Pounds 25.2m when most other retailers were bleeding badly. By
the year-end Body Shop had built up a network of 727 stores in 41 countries
and continued to open stores at a rate of one every 2 1/2 days.
Body Shop was able to expand so fast by means of franchising. This enabled
the company to open outlets without incurring huge capital commitments -
although gearing stood at 43 per cent at the end of last year.
The obverse side of expanding by franchising became painfully apparent
earlier this year when a row erupted between the parent company and Mrs
Pauline Rawle, one of its biggest UK franchisees. Body Shop had to resort to
the courts to regain control of six branches which it alleged had fallen
into a 'deplorable condition'. The disruption to sales was one of the
reasons the company cited yesterday for its likely profits fall.
Worries also extend to Body Shop's pricing policy and the growing power of
rival retailers in the company's core markets. But it is almost certainly
too early for the City dinosaurs to begin writing the Roddicks' epitaph as
they have done for the founders of so many other 1980s retail glamour stocks
such as Sock Shop and Tie Rack.
Nevertheless, the volatile relationship between company and City is likely
to continue. A taste of the mood to come was perhaps expressed by one City
analyst who said the profits' fall was little surprise to him because the
company had refused to return his phone calls for a month - 'no doubt
because they were communing with their karma'.
'But,' he added somewhat cruelly, 'it now appears their dogma has been run
over by their karma.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / GPA puts off order for 154 Boeings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, has agreed in principle with Boeing
to defer delivery of up to 154 aircraft worth Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) for
up to three years.
The agreement, which still has to be finalised, would give the group an
important breathing space in the aftermath of its aborted Dollars 800m
flotation.
Mr Jim King, GPA's vice-chairman, said the agreement was subject to a number
of conditions which include completion of the group's equity raising plans.
It has recently unveiled a plan to raise Dollars 350m in a convertible
preference share issue.
GPA has also reached agreements in principle with aircraft manufacturers to
receive Dollars 650m from them over the next 18 months. The funding would be
in the form of loans to help the group lease aircraft in difficult new
markets and the return to GPA of some pre-delivery payments for aircraft it
had ordered.
The tentative agreement with Boeing should help reassure investors. However,
it is clear from yesterday's announcement that Boeing expects GPA's existing
shareholders to show their support for the group first.
GPA said the agreements were dependent on each other and Boeing and its
institutional shareholders wanted to be sure both sides were being
supportive. If the deal goes ahead GPA's firm orders will be cut by Dollars
1.5bn in both 1993 and 1994. It has agreed to buy Dollars 12bn of aircraft
by the end of the decade.
The importance of the deal for GPA is underlined by the fact that GPA would
not have to cancel orders. Cancellation would result in it losing its
Dollars 353.8m of aircraft pre-delivery payments. Boeing would not comment
on whether the group would pay a penalty for the deferral.
GPA is currently locked in negotiations with other aircraft manufacturers,
including Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, to reach similar agreements.
Mr King said the deal was aimed at countering the negative perception of the
scale of GPA's financing and marketing challenge. 'This will ensure that our
firm commitments are appropriate to our available capital and our view of
market demand.'
Boeing said it had already announced it was reducing monthly production of
its 737 aircraft from 21 to 14 this autumn.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Racal to split debt with Chubb under demerger terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RACAL Electronics yesterday announced the terms of the demerger of Chubb,
its security subsidiary, to complete an unbundling of the group by its
chairman, Sir Ernest Harrison, which began with the flotation of Vodafone.
The main element of the proposal is an equal split of Racal Electronics'
debt with the new Chubb Group.
Chubb's shares and Racal's shares, after a one-for-five share consolidation,
will begin trading officially on October 5 if shareholders approve the
proposals.
Sir Ernest said the demerger continued the process of gaining 'appropriate
stock market recognition for the component businesses' within Racal. Before
Racal distributed its 80 per cent stake in Vodafone to its shareholders last
year the market effectively valued the group at a level that suggested the
non-Vodafone business had no value at all.
While the unbundling of Vodafone benefited Racal shareholders - their 80 per
cent of Vodafone is now worth about Pounds 2.3bn and Racal has a market
capitalisation of more than Pounds 900m compared with a total market value
of about Pounds 2bn before the unbundling was announced - the merits of
demerging Chubb are less immediately obvious.
Sir Ernest said yesterday his advisers expected little difference in market
ratings of Chubb and Racal after the demerger. Added value would come from
benefits from standing alone and a premium that would develop as a result of
bid speculation.
'There will be two bid premiums instead of one,' said Mr David Elsbury,
chief executive of Racal Electronics.
It is proposed that Chubb will float with half Racal's debt, or about Pounds
60m at rates prevailing at the last balance sheet date in April. This will
give Chubb gearing of about 42.4 per cent, and most of the non-dollar
borrowings. Racal's pro-forma gearing in April would have been 12.3 per
cent; it will enjoy most of the benefit of the low-interest dollar
borrowings.
Racal said Chubb profits would continue to improve. In the 28 weeks to
October 9 they would be no less than Pounds 28m, up 35 per cent.
Chubb said it would demerge Chubb during its successful defence against a
hostile bid from Williams Holdings last year.

FT  17 SEP 92 / France and Maastricht: Jack Lang adds style to Yes campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French are a formal race. The usual mode of address to a cabinet
minister is Monsieur le ministre. But when Mr Jack Lang addressed a meeting
of young people in the insalubrious Paris suburb of Clichy on Tuesday night,
one boy began his question with 'Bonjour Jack]'.
Mr Lang laughed. He may be France's deputy prime minister, the proud
possessor of no fewer than three ministerial portfolios - arts, education
and media - and the longest-serving member of President Francois
Mitterrand's cabinet, but he is also a populist. Moreover Mr Lang, 53, is
canny enough to realise that being addressed in such a manner by a cheeky
adolescent is a small price to pay for his success in the popularity polls.
Pomposity is not one of Mr Lang's failings. During his nine years at the
arts ministry he has been criticised by the French right for everything from
frittering away public money on his pet avant garde art projects, to
toadying to the president (of whom he is a firm favourite). But not even his
fiercest critics have accused Mr Lang of being stuffy.
It was this lack of stuffiness that persuaded Mr Mitterrand to make Mr Lang
co-chairman of the Socialist party's pro-Maastricht lobby last month in an
attempt to breathe life into the Yes camp's lacklustre campaigning efforts.
Mr Lang smiled winningly at the crowd in Clichy's scruffy municipal hall. He
beamed at the champion boxer and sailor he had brought along for the evening
as representatives of his glittering pro-Maastricht celebrity campaign. His
hand lingered for, perhaps, a little too long on the shapely arm of
Stephanie, head of the Clichy branch of pro-Maastricht youth campaign. He
listened attentively to the questions and tried his best not to look too
bored when he had to discuss economics in his answers.
It may be part of a well-worn act. But he did it brilliantly. Mr Lang did
not dwell for long on the pedantic details of the Maastricht treaty. He
leaves that to Ms Elisabeth Guigou, the glamorous, but glacial, minister for
European affairs, with whom he co-chairs the Yes campaign.
Mr Lang sees the Maastricht treaty as an opportunity for France to stamp its
influence over the rest of Europe.
'Why else do you think the other European countries were concerned about
culture being included in the Maastricht treaty?' If one or two languages
dominate the new Europe, Mr Lang was convinced that French would be one,
'possibly with English or German as the second'.
Ms Guigou and the other Europhilic socialists - not to mention France's
European partners - might not see Europe's future in quite such
Francocentric terms, but Mr Lang's demagoguery went down well with his
audience of the converted in Clichy.
The crowd cheered. Teenage girls giggled under the glare of the television
lights. Their boyfriends guffawed at the arts minister's jokes and gazed
admiringly at the boxer and sailor. The young people of Clichy might not
have learnt very much about the whys and wherefores of European union, but
they had spent an evening basking in Mr Lang's reflected glamour.
The French budget deficit for 1993 should be 'tens of billion francs below
FFr200bn', according to Mr Michel Charasse, the budget minister, writes
Alice Rawsthorn. The French government plans to discuss next year's budget
on September 23 if this Sunday's Maastricht referendum delivers a Yes
majority. If the referendum result is negative, the budget discussions will
be delayed until September 30.

FT  17 SEP 92 / France and Maastricht: Lyons ponders looming vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LYONS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S second most important city has, for four years, been busy touting
itself as the best compromise site for the planned European Central Bank
(ECB).
But the question now for the Lyonnais, days away from the referendum, is
whether they can bring that prospect any nearer by helping approve
Maastricht, the treaty basis for the ECB.
'The advantage of Lyons would be that the bank would not be as exposed to
political pressure of any government, as it would be if it were placed in a
capital city,' argues Mr Jean Chemain, director of Lyons' chamber of
commerce. 'Nor would it give an unfair advantage to any of Europe's major
financial centres over the others, as it would if the bank were sited in
Frankfurt, London, or Paris,' he adds.
The ideal political scenario for Lyons' promoters would be a geographical
split.
Their city, sitting right in the middle of the Community, would get the
headquarters of the ECB whose operational arm would go to a world-level
money centre such as London.
But first, of course, the Maastricht treaty must win French approval in
Sunday's referendum.
This is unlikely if a cosmopolitan city such as Lyons, and its surrounding
Rhone-Alpes region where foreign companies employ no fewer than 80,000
people, cannot muster a sizeable majority in favour of the European union
treaty.
Mr Bruno Charmasson of Le Progres, Lyons' main newspaper, sees a problem.
'The response of Lyons should be Yes in the referendum, but the city has
traditionally had a higher anti-Mitterrand vote than the national average,'
he says.
The chances of a Lyonnais majority for Maastricht depend crucially on voters
keeping European and national issues separate in their minds.
A further local complication is that the local neo-Gaullist RPR is pretty
solidly anti-Maastricht, though the party is somewhat weakened by the
defection of the city's pro-treaty mayor, Mr Michel Noir.
However, this week saw a closing of the pro-Maastricht ranks elsewhere in
the opposition, when for the first time in eight years Mr Raymond Barre, the
Lyonnais former prime minister, shared a platform with his former
presidential boss, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
The pair had parted on bitter terms after the Mitterrand victory in 1981.
But at a recent rally in suburban Lyons, they made common cause to plead the
case for a Yes to Maastricht which, as Mr Giscard d'Estaing stressed, should
in no way prevent voters saying No to the Socialist government in next
March's legislative elections.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Tories join resignation chorus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced mounting pressure for the resignation of Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, including some from the Conservative back
benches.
As the chancellor called an emergency meeting of senior EC officials to
discuss the turmoil, some of the wilder corridor gossip in the Palace of
Westminster asked whether Mr Major might even face a challenge for the party
leadership after next month's Conservative conference.
A broad consensus of Tory MPs brushed aside all such talk as irresponsible
or, at the very least, premature. But there was open discussion about how
long Mr Lamont would hold his present post following the suspension of
Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism.
Mr John Carlisle, Conservative MP for Luton North and a persistent critic,
said that if the chancellor had been finance director of 'UK plc' he would
have been forced to resign. 'Possibly he should stay and see this one
through, but after that he must seriously consider his position.'
Mr Carlisle said there was 'no thought at all of any leadership challenge
being mounted'. The party 'might demand Mr Lamont's head but not at this
stage the prime minister's,' he added.
Other prominent Euro-sceptics were more charitable to Mr Lamont and less so
to Mr Major. Mr John Townend, chairman of the influential Tory backbench
finance committee, said he was 'very opposed to sniping at the chancellor',
who had inherited membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.
'I hope Norman Lamont is not going to be made to carry the can for it,' he
said, adding that British ERM membership was 'the prime minister's policy.'
He nonetheless voiced support for Mr Major, describing him as 'the best
prime minister we have got'.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, said Mr Major had
made 'a fundamental mistake when he was a junior minister' by supporting
Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, in the debate over ERM membership and
not Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister.
Lord Ridley, the former cabinet minister, said he had 'every sympathy' for
Mr Lamont, who had 'done his level best'. The mistake was to have joined the
ERM in the first place. 'It is a total chimera that there is a sort of El
Dorado to be found down this road.'
Euro-sceptics were of the view that even a 12 per cent base rate could prove
disastrous for the depressed domestic economy if sustained for more than a
few days. Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield and former Tory
chairman of the cross-party health select committee, said yesterday's events
amounted to 'the disembowelling of what little life there is left in the
British economy.'
Speaking yesterday morning after a two percentage point increase in interest
rates to 12 per cent had been announced - but before the suspension of
Britain's ERM membership - Mr Townend said that a short 10-day period of
higher rates would not cause 'any serious trouble'. But he added: 'If it
goes on for several months it will be devastating for British industry.'
He said he would ask the government to meet the high street banks to
formulate a strategy for damage limitation. 'If interest rates are at this
level when we get to party conference, they will be in for a rough time.'

<TEXT>
PARLIAMENT has been recalled from recess on 10 occasions since the second
world war. Parliament is normally recalled in times of national emergency,
sudden political crisis or when approval is required for the despatch of
troops into possible conflict. The Tories have rejected requests from the
Labour leader for a recall of parliament at least five times since in 1979.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Labour pins blame on ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR acted swiftly yesterday to pin the blame for the interest rate rises
firmly on the government's refusal to stimulate the economy.
Mr John Smith, who is at the Socialist International conference in Berlin,
said: 'Mr Major and his government have failed not just their country but
the whole (European) Community.'
The Labour leader highlighted the opposition's consistent demands, dating
from well before the April election, for tax incentives for industry and
other measures to stimulate growth.
He added that yesterday's events represented 'an almost total defeat' for
the government's economic strategy. 'This is the result of the failure to
invest, of the failure to pay attention to the real economy. It's the
fundamental weakness of the economy after 13 years of Conservative
government that is at the heart of the matter.'
In London Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, pressed home Labour's
attack, pointing out that Tory election propaganda had consistently promised
sustained recovery and lower interest rates.
Labour will make the prime minister, not Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
the principal target for attack when parliament is recalled next Thursday.
Senior party sources said: 'We are not going to accept that Norman Lamont
might be the ultimate fall guy. For it was the prime minister who could not
have been more categoric about staking his reputation on the value of the
pound.'
The Labour leadership must nonetheless tread warily, knowing that a number
of its senior spokesmen are critical of the opposition of Mr Smith and Mr
Brown to a devaluation strategy.
The party leadership will keep a tight rein on its internal dissidents ahead
of Sunday's French referendum. It will then have three days to devise a
coherent position on the ERM, sterling and the Maastricht treaty that will
command the maximum support across the party.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM And Britain: Revived MLR employed sparingly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reintroduction yesterday of minimum lending rate (MLR) at 12 per cent,
signalling a 2-percentage-point rise in UK base rates, followed the general
pattern since 1981 when the rate was in effect made redundant.
Since then it has been used infrequently as an emergency measure to raise
rates during sterling crises, dealers said.
However, its most recent use - in October 1990 - was to signal a
1-percentage-point reduction in base rates to 14 per cent when sterling
joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
The Bank of England stopped announcing MLR in 1981 when it introduced a new
system for day-to-day market operations.
MLR, always set by the Bank of England, was once known as the Bank Rate. It
was renamed minimum lending rate to try to downgrade its significance.
MLR averaged 10.8 per cent in the 1970s and peaked at 17 per cent on
November 15 1979 when it was raised to protect the balance of payments and
control inflation.
UK base rates, in effect MLR's replacement, averaged 11.8 per cent in the
1980s.
Although seemingly abandoning MLR, the Bank retained the right in
appropriate circumstances to announce in advance the MLR which, for a short
period ahead, it would apply in any lending to UK discount houses.
Before its 1990 ERM outing, MLR was reintroduced for one day in January 1985
 -also at 12 per cent but up from a level of 10 1/2 per cent - when the Bank
of England was trying to prop up a pound moving close to parity with the US
dollar, dealers said.
At the time, the FT reported: 'The Bank has now returned to its more subtle
practice of influencing borrowing costs through its routine money market
operations.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM And Britain: No firm plans on return to ERM, says
Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOR the time being
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
after last night's dramatic announcement that the UK is suspending
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism - it is back to the old
days of running the economy.
Although the Treasury hopes the UK will be able to rejoin the ERM when
market conditions are more settled, officials made clear last night that
there were no firm plans about the pound.
The announcement means that for the moment decisions about interest rates
will be taken with regard to broad economic conditions including the need to
bear down on inflation, rather than the requirement to peg the currency to a
specific limit. How long this situation will last was a matter for intense
speculation last night. One option would be for Britain to rejoin the ERM as
early as Monday, after the result of the French referendum on Maastricht is
known.
If there was a Yes vote, a large flow of money into the weaker European
currencies, including the pound, could be expected, and sterling might be
able to rejoin at the central DM2.95 rate that applied before last night's
announcement.
Many in the currency markets believe that a No vote - or perhaps a
wafer-thin majority in favour of Maastricht - will scupper the timetable for
European economic and monetary union, dealing a blow to theories about a
convergence in European economies, and probably consigning Britain to the
second rank of a 'two-speed' ERM system.
A No vote might thus lead to Britain finding that it can gain re-entry to
the ERM club only on the basis of a formal devaluation of sterling against
the D-Mark and other relatively strong currencies such as the Dutch guilder
and the Belgian franc.
A third option which cannot be ruled out is that Britain gives up - at least
for the foreseeable future - any idea of linking its currency to the other
main European currencies. Such a decision would end the goal that started
with ERM entry in October 1990 of trying to bring down UK inflation by tying
UK monetary policy to the credit rates set by the Bundesbank. Such a step
would be a huge about-turn for the UK government. But it may decide, after
the humiliation of opting for an ERM suspension last night, that the
pressures of living with the system may be too large to cope with.
A crucial factor in the discussion is the state of the UK economy. From
today, base rates will be set at 12 per cent, up from 10 per cent on Tuesday
night, a level that many consider is far too high given that Britain is
still struggling to recover from its longest peacetime recession since the
1930s.
An important factor in the discussion will be whether it will be possible in
the foreseeable future to engineer lower base rates while Britain stays in a
fixed exchange rate system in which Bundesbank credit rates seem likely to
stay high for some months.
One important argument - which would be against all that Mr John Major's
government has stood for over the past 23 months - is that Britain might
find it easier to cut interest rates by continuing the policy of letting the
exchange rate float, the situation that prevailed last night when sterling
was quoted in New York trading at around DM2.70, some 8 pfennigs below its
formal ERM floor of DM2.778.
Linked to this question is whether the battered UK economy can withstand a
prolonged period of relatively high interest rates.
Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of economics at the stockbrokers Charterhouse
Jeffrey, said of yesterday's 2 percentage point rise in base rates: 'The UK
economy was already looking a bit like a wonky three-legged stool. Now one
of the legs has been kicked away.'
Last year UK output fell by 2.4 per cent, the biggest one-year drop since
government records started in 1948. Assuming the economy contracts this year
by a further 0.6 per cent - which was the consensus view of City economists
before yesterday's developments - the two-year decline will be the largest
recorded for any ERM country since the mid 1970s.
As for next year, the best guess of economists before yesterday was that
output would rise anaemically by about 1.6 per cent, far below the growth
rates of the mid 1980s.
On the economic front, a glimmer of hope came yesterday from the
announcement of a 0.8 per cent rise in retail sales volumes in August
compared with July. Many economists are sceptical about whether that trend
will continue.
Since the middle of last year, retail sales - which account for roughly a
quarter of UK economic output - have been virtually flat, providing little
sign that consumer demand is about to lift.
Consumer spending, totalling two thirds of gross domestic product, has
fallen much more steeply this time compared with the previous recession in
1980-81.
As for the state of government finances, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
faces further headaches. The public-sector borrowing requirement for 1992-93
 -in spite of a lower-than-expected PSBR for August announced yesterday of
Pounds 2.9bn - looks likely to climb this year to about Pounds 32bn and
perhaps reach Pounds 40bn in 1993-94 as a result of the recession eating
into tax income and pushing up social security spending.
If the recession spilled over to next year - which seems increasingly likely
 -the impact on revenues and spending would be still higher. That might make
it difficult for the government to meet guidelines agreed by European
Community nations at the end of last year to keep government borrowing below
3 per cent of gross domestic product as part of the move towards monetary
union.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Major faces the most serious test of
his career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor

<TEXT>
NOW Mr John Major must assess the cost of conviction.
During 22 frequently turbulent months in No 10 Downing Street the prime
minister has weathered his share of crises. But sterling's enforced
withdrawal from the ERM confronts him with the most serious test of his
career.
Mr Major had insisted that holding the pound's exchange rate against the
D-Mark was at the heart of his economic strategy. He believed it. At 5pm
yesterday the markets overwhelmed him, leaving the credibility of his
economic policy in shreds. One ministerial colleague described Mr Major as
'devastated'.
The damage was wider. As Mr Major blamed the Bundesbank for contributing to
the crisis a question mark hung over his ability to continue selling the
Maastricht treaty to his Conservative colleagues.
The recall of parliament next week will again expose his party's deep
divisions over Europe. Ministers may join the questioning of the prime
minister's pledge to keep Britain 'the heart of Europe'.
The first message from Downing Street yesterday was that Mr Major remained
determined to hold sterling at the rate at which he took it into the
Exchange Rate Mechanism two years ago. The speculators were unimpressed.
When the pound slid below its ERM floor the question asked in Whitehall  -
then answered in the negative - was whether Mr Major's determination would
be enough.
By late afternoon he was being told by Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, the
governor of the Bank of England, that sterling's position in the ERM was no
longer sustainable. The Bank was running out of money and unconvinced that
still higher interest rates would hold it.
Mr Major is committed to the defeat of inflation. He regarded the ERM as the
framework to achieve that. The constantly-repeated phrase was that he would
do 'whatever is necessary to defend the parity'.
Now he must start again. Downing Street insists that sterling had been
'suspended', not removed from the ERM. The expectation is that once calm
returns to the markets after Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht
treaty it will rejoin.
Even as the pound slumped well below its ERM floor last night Mr Major's
aides were not prepared to admit the reality that he had been forced into
the devaluation he always refused to contemplate.
He did not give in without a fight. As one minister said last night, Mr
Major did not readily seize the 'soft option' of devaluation. The markets,
always more powerful than the politicians, left him no option.
It will be difficult to pick up the pieces. Whatever his intentions now he
cannot simply start again with a different ERM rate. As one minister said:
'It will take us years to regain credibility . . . it is disastrous. It
undermines everything we have been trying to do for the past two years'.
The opposition against the ERM on the Conservative backbenches has been
mobilised. It will be given new impetus by the admission in Downing Street
that the prime minister believes the Bundesbank must bear much of the
responsibility for the crisis.
For the Tory Euro-sceptics the threat that higher borrowing costs will drive
the economy from recession into slump is an ideal recruiting ground in their
campaign against the Maastricht treaty.
Even before yesterday's drama the Euro-sceptics were promising that the
prime minister would meet a stormy reception at the party conference in
Brighton in two weeks' time. It was once supposed to be a celebration. Now
they are pledging open revolt.
A French Yes for Maastricht might ease some tensions on the financial
markets but it would still foreshadow a bitter struggle with the Tory
rebels. There was acknowledgement in Whitehall yesterday that even if the
treaty was endorsed by the French it might be some time before interest
rates fell again to 10 per cent.
With one or two MPs publicly calling for Mr Norman Lamont's resignation as
chancellor the possibility of a symbolic challenge to Mr Major's leadership
can no longer be dismissed as fantasy.
There has been no sign of revolt in the senior ranks of the government. When
the absolute commitment to sterling's parity was underlined by Mr Lamont at
last week's cabinet meeting, no one dissented. Mr Major was careful
yesterday to ensure that all the cabinet heavyweights - Mr Michael
Heseltine, Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Kenneth Clarke - shared in the decisions.
Officials insisted that Mr Lamont remained secure at the Treasury. But
inevitably the parallel was being drawn with 1967's resignation of Mr James
Callaghan as chancellor when he was forced into devaluation.
Mr Lamont may be forced to follow the Callaghan example. But this time it is
not that simple. Mr Harold Wilson, prime minister at the time, distanced
himself from his chancellor's handling of the crisis.
At last week's cabinet meeting and in a subsequent speech to Scottish
business Mr Major went out of his way to praise Mr Lamont and stress his
personal commitment to the policy. He referred to the Labour government's
experience in 1967 - but only to remark that subsequent events demonstrated
that Mr Wilson had been wrong to give in.
The strategy now is to try to hold the line until next week, hoping that a
Yes vote will bring a return to sanity.
Mr Major can claim with justice that no prime minister could have resisted
the pressures of the markets and of the apparent determination of the
Bundesbank to force a general ERM realignment.
The prize of victory against the markets would have been the credibility for
his anti-inflation strategy that had eluded every British post-war
government. But it was an enormous gamble. The markets are unimpressed by
conviction politics. Mr Major must now count the cost of losing.

NOW MR John Major must assess the cost of conviction. During 22 frequently
turbulent months in No 10 Downing Street, the prime minister has weathered
his share of crises, but yesterday's turmoil on financial markets confronts
him with the most serious test of his political career.
As the currency markets jeered his government, the official message was that
Mr Major remained determined to hold sterling at the rate at which he took
it into the Exchange Rate Mechanism two years ago.
The speculators were unimpressed. When the pound slid below its ERM floor,
the question asked in Whitehall - and left unanswered - was whether his
determination would be enough.
An emergency meeting of senior ministers called by Mr Major last night
intensified speculation that the government would be forced to admit that
sterling's position was no longer sustainable.
There was no such ambiguity in briefings from the prime minister's aides. Mr
Major was committed to the defeat of inflation, they said. In spite of
recent turbulence, he regarded the ERM as the framework to achieve that
objective. He would do 'whatever is necessary to defend the parity'.
But as Mr Major tied his government's future irrevocably to the fate of
sterling, criticism from the business community was matched by
recriminations from the Conservative back benches.
Some ministers were arguing privately that there had to be a point beyond
which even Mr Major could not take his commitment to sterling's DM2.95
central rate in the ERM. 'Will it be 25 per cent (base rates) by Friday?'
one asked.
For Tory Euro-sceptics, the threat that higher borrowing costs would drive
the economy from recession into slump is an ideal recruiting ground in the
campaign against the Maastricht treaty.
Even before yesterday's drama, the Euro-sceptics were promising that the
prime minister would receive a stormy reception at the party conference in
Brighton in two weeks. It was once supposed to be a celebration. Now they
are pledging open revolt.
A French Yes for Maastricht in Sunday's referendum would ease some tensions
on the financial markets but it would still foreshadow a bitter struggle
with the Tory rebels. There was acknowledgement in Whitehall yesterday that
even if the treaty was endorsed by the French, it would be some time before
interest rates fell again to 10 per cent.
With one or two MPs publicly calling for Mr Norman Lamont's resignation, the
possibility of a symbolic challenge to Mr Major's leadership can no longer
be dismissed as fantasy.
The Chancellor acknowledged the risk of a political backlash in the
statement that followed the first base rate rise. In an attempt to strike a
note of reassurance, he voiced hopes that the move would be short-lived. It
was a mistake. The markets took the comment as a sign of weakness.
There has been no sign of revolt in the senior ranks of the government. When
the absolute commitment to sterling's parity was underlined by Mr Lamont at
last week's cabinet meeting, no one voiced dissent.
As one senior minister said later, even the cabinet room is too public a
place to voice doubts about the chancellor's handling of the pound.
There was renewed speculation yesterday that if the government is defeated
by the markets Mr Lamont will have to leave the Treasury. Inevitably, the
parallel that was being drawn was with the resignation as chancellor of the
then Mr James Callaghan in 1967, when he was forced into devaluation.
This time it is not that simple. Mr Harold Wilson, then prime minister,
distanced himself from his chancellor's handling of the sterling crisis. Mr
Major has done the reverse.
The strategy now is to try to hold the line until Sunday, hoping that a Yes
vote will bring a return to sanity. Senior Downing Street officials pointed
out that even if Mr Major wanted to devalue - and he did not - Italy's
experience in the past few days demonstrated that that would not offer an
easy escape route.
The markets seemed disinclined to offer even that brief respite. There was a
real fear in Whitehall that the scale of speculation against the pound would
sweep away all the government's good intentions when the markets reopen
today.
There was also barely concealed fury at the Bundesbank's role. Two weeks
ago, Mr Lamont was winning plaudits for organising a co-ordinated EC assault
on the German central bank's refusal to cut interest rates. The view in
Downing Street now is that the Bundesbank has been wreaking its revenge with
persistent hints that it believes sterling should be devalued.
Mr Major's instinct is to tough it out. For him, the prize of victory
against the markets would be a credibility for his anti-inflation strategy
that has eluded every British post-war government.
It is an enormous gamble. The markets have been unimpressed by conviction
politics. If Mr Major wins against the odds, he will emerge as strong a
prime minister as any in recent history. But last night, speculation in
Whitehall was focused on the cost of losing.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Risk of further damage to confidence is
heightened - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS were yesterday crossing fingers in the hope that the rise in base
lending rates would be reversed in the near future.
Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster, the UK's
second-biggest bank, said confidence would be damaged and the risk of an
economic 'slump' that might seriously damage banks and building societies
had been increased.
British banks already had record levels of bad debt, mostly as a result of
small and medium-size companies running into financial difficulties. Most
banks believed losses on loans would continue at a high rate, even without
any increase in interest rates.
NatWest therefore wants the government to announce measures aimed at
stimulating particularly weak sectors of the economy. such as construction.
Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, the biggest UK bank, supported the
decision to raise interest rates rather than devalue the pound. 'Devaluation
would lead to a rise in interest rates and inflation,' he said. 'The pound
is not overvalued against European currencies.'
A senior executive at another bank said: 'We should have left the ERM and
floated. Fifteen 15 per cent base rates are not tenable for long.'
Mr Wanless said economic conditions might deteriorate rapidly if rates
remained at the increased level for more than a couple of months. He
predicted that consumers and businesses would be more cautious in their
spending plans whatever happened to interest rates.

FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Embattled Lamont may be impaled on a
sterling skewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont may join the ranks of British chancellors whose careers
have been impaled on the pound.
The rise in interest rates has the same whiff of personal disaster as Lord
Barber's forced exit from the European monetary 'snake' - forerunner of the
European Monetary System - after just six weeks in 1972 or Mr Denis (now
Lord) Healey's about-turn on the road to Heathrow in 1976 when he decided
against going to an International Monetary Fund meeting in Manila because of
a sterling crisis.
If Mr Lamont makes it to Washington for the IMF meeting at the end of the
week, it will be no consolation to know that Lady Thatcher will be
addressing an audience a couple of miles away. It would be uncharacteristic
for her not to reiterate her belief that 'fixed rates don't stay fixed'.
Nor will the chancellor find much sympathy in the G7 itself. Other G7
countries have watched with growing dismay how the UK has deprived itself of
room for manoeuvre by clinging limpet-like to the DM2.95 parity for the
pound. The UK has also attracted criticism for not acting fully in the
spirit of the EMS.
Non-UK monetary officials believe Britain bungled the weekend realignment by
refusing to shift sterling's D-Mark parity. Admittedly that would have been
politically very damaging, but the scale of intervention in recent days
shows how unexpectedly large speculative forces have become.
The Bundesbank and Bonn did not get the revaluation D-Mark they wanted. The
Germans sought a differentiated realignment that would have involved more
countries, in return for an interest rate cut. But the UK refused to make
concessions on sterling's parity in return for lower German interest rates.
The German line reflected a growing feeling that economic convergence in
Europe is not sufficiently developed for the EMS to be treated as a
fixed-rate system. While the Germans accept that the French franc should be
pinned to the D-Mark for political as much as economic reasons, they have
watched with disquiet how governments have aspired to fix currencies such as
the pound, Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo to the D-Mark.
There is a recognition of the huge sacrifices being made to stamp out
inflation, but some G7 officials ask whether that is not too rigorous an
approach, given that high-interest-rate policies are stifling business
activity and prolonging recession. There has also often been resentment
among the other ERM members at the way the UK has frequently appeared
reluctant to take the unpleasant medicine sometimes associated with EMS
membership.
The nature of Britain's entry into the ERM in October 1990 is still cited as
a case of the newcomer trying to bend the rules - the UK unilaterally
announced that it would enter the ERM with a DM2.95 central rate,
simultaneously cutting interest rates by a full percentage point, before
starting formal negotiations with its partners.
If Mr Lamont has in recent weeks frequently emphasised how Britain would
base its defence of sterling on the so-called 1987 Basle-Nyborg agreement,
he has until yesterday been unwilling to use the main weapon in the
Basle-Nyborg armory, which is to change domestic interest rates.
Those different approaches reflect the UK's long absence between 1979 and
1990 from a club in which other members were adapting to each other's ways.
With hindsight, the chancellor may have avoided yesterday's painful moves
with an earlier and smaller interest rate increase when pressure first began
to build.
Such speculation, though, ignores the politicised nature of UK economic and
monetary policymaking, which is a more high-profile activity than in
countries where technocrats or independent central banks hold sway.
Heightened public interest may reflect the frequent mess the UK has made of
economic management since the Second World War. Concentration of policy in
the Treasury also makes the chancellor a central political figure, in a way
that finance ministers elsewhere are not. In the UK, the chancellor
increasingly is seen as the man who wins or loses elections for the
government.

<TEXT>
MR Robert Abrams, attorney-general for New York state, yesterday claimed a
razor-thin win over Ms Geraldine Ferraro, former vice-presidential
candidate, in the hotly contested primary battle to become the Democratic
candidate for the New York Senate seat at stake in November.
Ms Ferraro, who was on the receiving end of a vitriolic television
advertising campaign in which Mr Abrams accused her of numerous ethics
violations, was refusing yesterday to concede defeat.
With 99 per cent of precincts having reported, Mr Abrams had 410,402 votes
(37 per cent), while Ms Ferraro had 399,410 votes (36 per cent). Two other
candidates split the rest.
Ms Ferraro, although clearly disheartened after she had spent millions of
dollars on the contest, argued that she might yet win when absentee votes
were counted.
The Democratic victor will run against Senator Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a
right-wing Republican who has himself been the target of ethics probes and
has been rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee. Mr Abrams, a liberal, has
argued that he is better placed than Ms Ferraro to challenge the senator
over ethics.
In a primary for a Manhattan seat in the House of Representatives, Democrats
elected the late Mr Ted Weiss, although the liberal incumbent had died on
Monday. Now Democratic party leaders will select a candidate to contest the
November election.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday attempted to defuse embarrassing industrial
disputes with prison officers and airline pilots to calm the political
climate before Sunday's referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
The justice ministry suspended more than 100 striking prison officers
following the breakdown of talks with the prison unions on Tuesday. Four
warders at Saint-Quentin-Fallavier jail in Isere started a hunger strike
outside the prison gate to protest against their suspension.
Conditions in many jails have deteriorated since the dispute started last
weekend after inmates murdered an officer at Clairvaux jail. The ministry
claimed the situation was improving, with 107 of France's 182 jails affected
by the dispute yesterday compared with 140 on Tuesday.
However, there were violent incidents at many prisons including a clash
between riot police and picketing officers outside Rodez jail.
Since the strike began the government has been haunted by television images
of rioting prisoners and warders complaining about inadequate security.
The government yesterday faced the additional blow of a 24-hour strike by
airline pilots protesting against proposed changes in working arrangements
which, they claim, will result in longer flight times and shorter
restbreaks.
Air France was forced to cancel a quarter of its European flights, but
managed to operate its long haul service. Air Inter, the domestic airline,
axed a third of its flights as did TAT, the European airline.

<TEXT>
MR Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, yesterday said that no big differences
remained between Washington and Paris on enforcing a no-fly zone over
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
But he said the US, France and Britain had reached no agreement on whether
to set up and enforce a proposed air exclusion zone to keep Serbian jets
from flying over Bosnia, following an increase in ethnic violence in the
former Yugoslav republic.
Mr Cheney stressed that the UN would have to make any final decision on such
a zone, but that the allies would have to agree how to police it.
Serb forces have launched a series of air attacks in western and northern
Bosnia, prompting calls from UN officials for the creation of a no-fly zone
over Bosnia.
Sarajevo radio, which is in Moslem hands, yesterday reported seven Serb air
attacks on Jajce in western Bosnia, after the UN had complained of air
strikes on the Moslem town of Bihac, further north.
Despite the fighting, international mediators who will head peace talks in
Geneva tomorrow said yesterday that there was a 'new mood' in Belgrade which
could provide a lift to prospects for peace.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, and Lord Owen, for the European Community,
said they would continue to talk to all sides, despite moves to oust
Yugoslavia from the UN. 'It would be foolish not to recognise that we are
dealing with a more helpful and progressive attitude in Belgrade than we had
in the past,' said Lord Owen.
Mr Vance said Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslav prime minister, and President Dobrica
Cosic had made 'very, very important commitments', including rejection of
'ethnic cleansing' and pledges to help reverse it.
In the breakaway Bosnian Serb parliament, the speaker, Mr Radoslav Brdjanin,
said: 'We are completing the job around Jajce which is about to be
liberated. Jajce was and will remain Serb and there will be no deals.'
Mr Panic proposed yesterday that the rump republic made up of Serbia and
Montenegro make a fresh application for UN membership, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported, after talks in Moscow with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian
foreign minister. The suggestion was aimed to defuse a dispute with the EC
over whether the Serb-dominated territory should keep Yugoslavia's UN seat.
An Italian relief aircraft taking supplies to Sarajevo, which crashed in
Bosnia this month, was shot down by a missile, an official report released
yesterday said. The report, by military experts from Italy, did not say who
fired the missile.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees quoted the report as
saying: 'The results obtained so far suggest that, without any doubt, the
G-222 aircraft had been struck at least by one missile that probably had
infra-red guidance.'
The European Community is preparing to agree to release Ecu120m (Pounds
87.2m) next week to help refugees in former Yugoslavia survive the winter.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, British foreign minister responsible for Europe,
told the European parliament yesterday that talks on the proposal - which
would cover the need for food, shelter and medicines from October to
December - were being held this week.

FT  17 SEP 92 / US voters seek fresher faces / Analysis of the results in
the congressional primaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN, non-incumbents and, probably, Mr Bill Clinton and the Democratic
party emerged yesterday as the principal beneficiaries of the final round of
congressional primaries held on Tuesday.
The victory in the Washington state Democratic primary of Ms Patty Murray
brings to 11 the number of women who will contest US Senate seats in
November - 10 of them Democrats. This beats the old record of 10, set in
1984, and this time at least five of the women candidates start the home
stretch favoured to win.
Other primary results across the country brought to 86 the number of
incumbents in the House of Representatives who will not be returning next
year. Of these, 19 have been defeated, 65 have retired, in some cases to
seek other offices, and two have died.
Given the vulnerability of some other incumbents who will be on the November
ballot, the probability is that next year's freshman class in the House will
be larger than the 118 new members returned in 1948. Although 57 of the now
vacant seats were held by Democrats, most of them will probably stay in the
party's hands.
In the Senate, with nine out of the 34 seats at stake in November vacated by
incumbents, it is now thought that the Democrats will add to their current
57-43 majority by three or four seats. In some states, like California,
Illinois and Pennsylvania, powerful local women candidates may help Mr
Clinton.
This week's polls, national and local, have brought good news for the
Democratic candidate, offsetting the continuing controversy over his
avoidance of military service 23 years ago.
Both the Newsweek and Washington Post/ABC surveys have him back up to a 15
point lead. The New York Times/CBS poll out yesterday gave him a 49-37 per
cent margin, up a little bit from its previous survey. The Los Angeles Times
poll in California had him 21 points up at 57-36. Of the bigger states, only
Florida, a Republican bastion, offered encouragement for President Bush with
a poll out yesterday showing him 7 points ahead.
The general message from all of them is Mr Clinton consolidating his lead,
mostly because of the parlous state of the economy and the lack of
confidence in Mr Bush's ability to fix it. Putting Mr Clinton on the
defensive over the draft issue has produced some tactical victories for Mr
Bush, but does not seem yet to have taken hold with the public.
Nevertheless, the Washington Post reported yesterday that the Bush campaign
had more or less decided to stop emphasising the positive.
It will go for the Clinton jugular. 'We're not going to start moving (in the
polls) until we rip the skin off the guy,' one official was quoted as
saying. It was also announced yesterday that the first debate between the US
presidential candidates, scheduled for East Lansing, Michigan, next Tuesday
had been cancelled because the Bush campaign had failed to agree on the
conditions under which it would be held.
Further complicating matters was the latest in a long line of hints from Mr
Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, that he might get back into the race if
both candidates failed to address the problem of the budget deficit. But he
also hinted in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that he might endorse
Mr Clinton if he took a tough stand on cutting federal spending.
Mr Marion Barry, the former mayor of Washington, DC, won election to the
city council on Tuesday. He had been forced out of office two years ago, and
subsequently into jail, on drugs charges.

FT  17 SEP 92 / No aid to unsafe N-reactors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRUMBLING nuclear reactors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are
unlikely to get financial aid from OECD countries this winter, following the
failure of the Brussels meeting on nuclear safety to commit itself to rescue
programmes.
Provisional pledges of aid from the Group of 24 industrial countries
amounted to Dollars 600m-Dollars 700m, delegates said yesterday, but the
meeting, which ended on Tuesday night, extracted no new firm commitments.
Although concern about a Chernobyl-type accident has been growing since the
extent of the disrepair of eastern power stations emerged, only Dollars 300m
in bilateral aid deals has so far been agreed.
The Brussels meeting was summoned when a G7 meeting in July failed to agree
an Dollars 800m emergency plan.
This week's packed meeting, which included representatives from over 100
countries and regulators, rejected the proposal of a central rescue fund in
favour of further bilateral agreements.
Mr David Kyd, spokesman of the International Atomic Energy Authority, the
nuclear watchdog, which will now have a Brussels-based representative, said:
'There was a distinct lack of specifics. Some eastern European countries
feel the committee's plans will begin to have an effect in 1993, but that
they will be left to muddle through the winter'.
Because of electricity shortages, many of the 58 reactors in the former
Soviet Union and eastern Europe will be run close to full capacity this
winter in spite of safety hazards.
The committee set up a working party on urgent improvements at Kozloduy, in
Bulgaria, which last year was called the most dangerous nuclear power
station in Europe, but the Bulgarian delegation said last night that the
Brussels meeting had committed no new funds.
A small amount of radioactive water leaked out at a Russian nuclear power
plant on the Kola peninsula at the weekend, according to an official at the
Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Reuter adds.
Mr Risto Paltemaa, a chief inspector, said the Centre had received
information about Saturday's leak from Russian authorities following local
radio reports.
He said the leak, at the Kola nuclear power plant close to the town of
Polyarnyye Zori, did not endanger the environment.
According to his information, there had not been any leaks outside the
building.
No increased radiation levels had been detected in the surrounding area and
no abnormal radiation levels had been recorded in Finland. Mr Paltemaa said
the water had leaked from a tank in a separate building to the reactor.

<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday urged a wider
international effort to deal with what he termed the horror of the conflict
in Bosnia, warning that the unfolding Balkans crisis might lead others in
similar situations to resort to war rather than negotiation.
Presenting his first annual report to the UN general assembly, which began a
new session on Tuesday, he stressed that even with 15,000 international
troops in former Yugoslavia and over 5,000 more soldiers now authorised to
join an existing 1,500 in Bosnia, the expectations placed on the world body
exceeded the resources and the capacity of the UN protection force.
He observed that the Yugoslav upheaval illustrated how the end of the cold
war had opened a Pandora's Box of causes and conflicts. In past years, these
would have been regarded as 'points of loss or gain in the calculations of
the bipolar powers'.
Without the cold war structure to deal with them, the UN must provide
approaches and answers, he said.
The Yugoslav conflict, with its international dimension, must lead those in
similar conditions of instability and confrontation to accept that the only
route for change was one that was legal, peaceful and contributed to
international peace and security, he added.

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Austrian government will raise its withholding tax on savings and
dividends next year to approximately 20 per cent, in a move that is intended
to clear the way for outlawing the country's controversial anonymous bank
accounts.
The accounts are an embarrassment to Austria, as they have been used for
laundering drug money. However, they are a politically sensitive issue
within the country where virtually everyone uses them to avoid paying high
rates of tax on their savings. The government has tolerated the situation by
claiming a flat 10 per cent withholding tax on all savings account balances.
Individuals are still supposed to declare their savings and, in cases where
the tax payable would be higher than the withholding tax, they remain liable
for it.
The government hopes the withholding tax on savings will gradually make
people less nervous about having to identify themselves as the owners of
savings accounts.
Negotiations on the fine points have not yet been completed. Some officials
believe that the higher withholding tax must also displace inheritance taxes
if it is to succeed in removing people's anxieties.
The country has to outlaw anonymous accounts as part of its obligations on
joining the European Economic Area next year.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Bundesbank warning on needs of east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday accused German public authorities and wage
negotiators of failing to take enough account of the continuing high
financing needs of east Germany.
It also warned the government against being too ready to seek fresh sources
of revenue to finance east German reconstruction, without first reining back
spending. Warnings against inflation, generous fiscal policies, and high pay
settlements have been a constant refrain of the Bundesbank since
unification, with currently high interest rates resulting from its attempt
to hammer home its message.
In its monthly report, written before the upheavals on currency markets, the
central bank said west Germany would have to get used to the fact that high
transfer payments to the east would be needed for longer than first thought.
The restructuring of east Germany's economy was proving more time-consuming
and costly than expected. While the west German economy had weakened, but
was not showing recessionary tendencies, that in the east had still not
begun a self-sustaining upswing.
Unemployment in east Germany was still the most severe problem, even though
incomes of most households had improved considerably since unity. The gap
between sinking output and rising incomes was being financed by high
transfers from the west.
The Bundesbank expressed continued concern about wage trends in east and
west Germany. It was especially worried about the planned rise in public
sector pay in the east to 80 per cent of west German levels next July. This
would add to the financial burdens of the east German states, already
striving to make new infrastructure investments.
The bank urged strict restraint on the public sector in view of the steady
flow of new proposals for raising extra finance. 'The tapping of new sources
of revenue cannot be a substitute for continued savings efforts.' This
applied also to new borrowing instruments.
The Bundesbank said the high wage rises of the past two years, as the gap
with west Germany has been narrowed, had harmed the competitiveness of many
east German companies. These were already suffering from the shift to the
free market, and from the collapse of eastern European markets.
However, the bank saw some hope for the east German economy in the fact that
unemployment had remained lower than feared. The figure of 1.2m jobless in
the east at the end of August was 175,000 less than at the start of 1992.
The number on short-time working fell by 235,000 to 285,000.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROMINENT Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists, including
several self-described 'life-long Republican voters', have endorsed Governor
Bill Clinton as their preferred candidate for president in an unprecedented
declaration of political allegiance.
'Bush has given up on California, and we have given up on him,' said one
industry executive at a gathering of newly declared Clinton supporters in
San Jose this week.
Mr John Young, president of Hewlett-Packard, praised Mr Clinton and his
campaign advisers for their responsiveness to high-tech industry and trade
issues.
'I have had hours of conversations with leaders of the Clinton campaign and
I have seen a response that I am not used to,' Mr Young said.
As a recognised Republican, one-time chairman of the Reagan-appointed
commission on industrial competitiveness and a member of the Bush
administration's advisory committee for trade policy, Mr Young's backing for
Mr Clinton demonstrates the level of dissatisfaction that high-technology
industry leaders feel toward the Bush administration.
Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, also
endorsed the Clinton campaign.
The Democratic candidate, he said, 'has shown the leadership and vision
needed to put this country back in the forefront of leading the world
again'.
'I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines and watching America lose its
competitiveness,' Mr Sculley added.
Mr Clinton, noting that the high-technology leaders who were lending him
their support represented companies with sales in excess of Dollars 25bn
(Pounds 12.6bn), said: 'I am excited, I am proud. This is unprecedented for
a candidate of my party. If the economy as a whole performed as well as
these companies. . . we would be in much much better shape than we are
today.'
Mr Clinton said that his 'national technology policy for America' would
stress joint ventures between government and industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Mauroy, the former French premier, today succeeds Mr Willy Brandt
as President of the Socialist International (SI) at the close of its
emotional three-day congress in Berlin.
Even in his absence the 79-year-old Mr Brandt, suffering from cancer and
confined to his home near Bonn, dominated the gathering of 800 delegates
from socialist and social democratic parties in 132 countries.
Delegates' eyes moistened as the former German Chancellor's welcoming speech
to the congress was slowly read by Mr Hans-Jochen Vogel, former chairman of
the Social Democratic Party (SPD) who succeeded Mr Brandt. It was given
thunderous, standing ovations.
'Dear friends, need I tell you how much I wanted to be with you especially
during these days? But it was not to be,' Mr Brandt's speech began. The
remainder of the address was a testament - summing up his life as a
political refugee from the Nazis, a leader of postwar Germany, the foremost
proponent of East-West detente and influential leader of the SI for 16
years.
He also warned that to tolerate injustice for long was to open the way for
more injustice and appealed to give the United Nations the means it needed
in order to achieve greater influence.
The delegates included noticeably fewer world leaders than in the heyday of
the socialist parties in the 1970s: Ms Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway and
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who called on Germany to regard
the wave of attacks on asylum-seekers as 'red warning signals' and to
prevent a recurrence of the past.
The most remarkable appearance at the congress was by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev,
the former Soviet leader, who addressed the gathering yesterday. He
announced that he would accept the freedom of Berlin on the third
anniversary of the fall of the wall in November along with former President
Ronald Reagan.

Petrol went up by more than 7 per cent, diesel by 21 per cent and bottled
gas, the most widely-used urban cooking fuel, by 22 per cent, from yesterday
morning. Only kerosene, cooking fuel for the poor, was exempt from the
increase.
'We have clearly shown our commitment to deal with the fiscal crisis,' Mr
Singh said, during a visit to Britain.
He said India's export performance was encouraging, if the drop in trade
with the former Soviet Union, which used to purchase half of India's
exports, was left out of account. Exports to convertible currency areas rose
by 6 per cent in dollar terms last year, despite a squeeze on imports, and
were now rising by 8 to 10 per cent.

ISRAELI and Syrian officials said last night they had made significant
progress during talks in Washington towards agreeing a joint statement of
principles that would form the basis of substantive peace negotiations
between them.
'We agreed on the general character of the settlement that we all want to
see in the Middle East, we agreed that we all want a peaceful solution, we
agreed on the mutual nature of the security problem and that security
arrangements need to take into account the security needs of both sides,'
said Mr Itamar Rabinovitch, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria.
The optimistic comments from both parties were the most positive so far
between Israel and Syria. If they achieve the aim of a joint statement by
the end of the present round of talks next week, it will be an unprecedented
breakthrough in four decades of enmity between them and would open the way
to substantive talks on the core issue of the Golan Heights, occupied by
Israel since 1967.
However, little progress was reported in the parallel talks between Israel
and the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Protests lodged with Russia

<TEXT>
JAPAN HAS made an official protest to Russia over a development project on
the island of Shikotan, part of the southern Kuriles chain seized by Soviet
troops at the end of the second world war but still claimed by Japan.
The row was at the heart of the abrupt cancellation last week of a visit to
Japan by President Boris Yeltsin. Relations between the two countries have
since grown icy as each side has hardened its position and sought to blame
the other over the cancellation.
The protest is over a decision by the Sakhalin provincial authorities to
grant a development contract for part of the island to Carlson &amp; Kaplan, a
Hong Kong company. The contract involves a 50-year lease on 278 hectares of
land, for which the company is to pay Dollars 125m (Pounds 63.4m). The
company plans to build a casino.
The protest, delivered to the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow and to the
Russian embassy in Tokyo, said that Japan could not tolerate the contract
because it covered Japanese territory, which the former Soviet government
had agreed in 1956 to return.
Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said yesterday that Japan was ready
to file a second protest if it was able to confirm reports that an Austrian
company might obtain a contract to build a golf course on Kunishir, another
of the disputed islands.

THE Hong Kong government yesterday appeared to reverse policy by accepting a
Chinese solution to a dispute over financing for the colony's new airport,
which would involve an increase in direct government funding.
It is understood that, at a meeting of a Sino-British committee yesterday,
the British side agreed to use part of the revenue raised from the sale of
land resulting from the construction of the airport and its connecting
railway to fund the project.
The Hong Kong government's position has been that the package it had devised
was the most cost-effective method of financing the project.
China is seeking to restore order to its stock markets after August's riots
in Shenzhen and a sharp fall in prices in Shanghai, Reuter reports from
Beijing.
Quoting reliable sources, the state-controlled China News Service said new
listings on the Shenzhen market had been postponed, plans for a third bourse
shelved and a regulatory committee would be created.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Zimbabwe pins hopes on the coming of rain: How drought has
hit the economy hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Zimbabwe slides inexorably into its deepest recession in 60 years,
recovery hopes are pinned entirely on above-average rains in the coming
season.
The economy is going into ever-steeper decline as the impact of last
season's catastrophic drought is exacerbated by social problems and water
and electricity shortages.
The government estimates that some 5m people, roughly half the population,
are receiving drought relief. Two weeks ago, the monthly drought relief
allocation was cut from 15 kilograms per person to 8 kg.
In Bulawayo, the country's second largest city which accounts for a quarter
of industrial production, local officials warn that water will 'run out' by
the end of next month unless good rains fall before then. However,
Bulawayo's rains do not normally start until mid-November.
The electricity crisis has its origins in prolonged official delays, first
in agreeing a programme for new generation capacity and subsequently in
imposing load-shedding.
Power cuts were first mooted in May, but then postponed in favour of
electricity imports from Zaire. In mid-September a new rationing scheme was
announced, but within 24 hours it had been temporarily postponed because of
'a technical hitch'.
The worst of the maize crisis too could have been averted had the government
heeded repeated warnings going back to the late 1980s that its 'cheap food'
policy would lead to under-production.
Farm production is expected to fall 40 per cent this year, with maize
deliveries at less than 30,000 tonnes compared with 1.8m tonnes in the
mid-1980s. Cotton production collapsed to 52,000 tonnes from 320,000 three
years ago, while sugar deliveries to mills were 3 per cent of normal levels.
Although production of the country's main export, flue-cured tobacco,
increased despite the drought, quality was seriously affected. With three
quarters of the crop, estimated at 180m kg now sold, the average price of
ZDollars 8.60 (90p) a kg is 25 per cent below last year's seasonal average
of ZDollars 11.57. On present trends, the signs are that the seasonal
average will be close to ZDollars 8, not far above the estimated break-even
level of ZDollars 7.50 a kg.
The fall in farm output will be partially cushioned by increased beef
production and prices - the result of high forced slaughter rates -
continued growth in horticulture, where exports have risen from ZDollars 5m
in the mid-1980s to the some ZDollars 200m this year and tobacco earnings of
about ZDollars 1.4bn, still down almost 30 per cent on last year.
Hopes of a powerful farm-led rebound in the economy next year look
increasingly fragile. Not only will 1992-1993 plantings be constrained by
lack of irrigation water, but worsening water and electricity supply for all
sectors of the economy will inhibit recovery.
Manufacturing output, which continued rising until May, is now falling
sharply and industrialists expect an output decline of around 5 per cent in
1992. No recovery is likely until the latter half of next year, and that
will be only modest given high nominal interest rates, falling investment
and employment at home and deteriorating sales in South Africa, which is the
country's main market for manufactured exports.
Drought - and the IMF - have forced the authorities to tighten both fiscal
and monetary policy. Despite angry criticism from some businessmen, money
market interest rates have been pushed above the inflation rate, currently
41 per cent, and further increases are inevitable before inflation peaks,
probably not far short of 50 per cent, later in the year.
Mr Bernard Chidzero, the finance minister, has come in for sharp criticism,
too, for his failure to cut public spending in his 1992 budget. This is
misplaced, however, since after adjusting for the ZDollars 2bn drought
relief provision, Mr Chidzero budgeted for only a 5 per cent rise in public
expenditure, which with forecast inflation of 35 per cent over the next
fiscal year, implies a huge reduction in real spending. Indeed, the share of
government spending in GDP will fall from close on 50 per cent last year to
40 per cent in 1992-1993.
All of this is predicated on the minister's ability to make his cuts stick.
The omens are not good; not only has government recently upgraded its
estimate of maize imports from 1.8m tonnes to 2.5m tonnes, but its 10 to 15
per cent civil service pay award exceeds the 7.3 per cent budgetary
provision. With the IMF breathing down his neck, Mr Chidzero may yet have to
make further swingeing cuts, with defence being everyone's preferred target.
If the minister fails to achieve his courageous spending targets and the
Reserve (central) Bank, which has stuck resolutely to its tight money
stance, is forced to back down in the face of vociferous business criticism,
then hopes of lower inflation and interest rates next year will come to
nought.
With good rains there should be a recovery in the latter half of 1993,
though only a modest one, while inflation will remain uncomfortably high and
renewed devaluation will be necessary. But another drought would add
Zimbabwe to the growing list of sub-Saharan countries requiring upwards of
Dollars 1bn a year in foreign assistance.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved an SDR315m (Pounds
233.73m) three-year loan to Zimbabwe, of which SDR200.6m may be drawn under
the enhanced structural adjustment facility. The balance comes under the
extended fund facility.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Guernsey managed funds up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL FUNDS under management in Guernsey rose 45 per cent last year to a
record Pounds 6.4bn by the year-end, according to the Guernsey Financial
Services Commission annual report.
It notes a continuing trend towards funds for institutions and
high-net-worth individuals. The commission says the rise has been caused by
'an accelerating trend of consolidation' with several small funds merging or
winding up and being replaced by schemes that have attracted substantial
investment.
Altogether, 20 licences were granted to institutions by the commission under
the Protection of Investors Law and licences were surrendered by 12 during
the year.
Total licensees at the end of last year stood at 141, the report says.
Fifty-nine of the 221 Guernsey managed funds are quoted on international
stock markets.
Guernsey's insurance industry also showed marked expansion during the year.
There was little growth in the early part of the year, and increased
competition from other centres is blamed. A change in tax laws for captive
insurance companies in July last year resulted in 17 new captives
registering by the end of the year, bringing the total of offshore insurance
companies in Guernsey to 204.
A captive is a wholly owned subsidiary that insures some or all of the risks
of its parent or can write third-party insurance, mainly reinsurance.
The tax change restored to captives a three-option taxation system - either
no tax, a sliding scale on investment income from shareholders' equity, or a
flat rate of 20 per cent.
Bank deposits in the island rose 5 per cent to Pounds 16.25bn. The report
says all but two banks attained the risk: asset ratio of 10 per cent by the
end of 1991. The ratio is set by the commission and is 2 percentage points
higher than that of the Basle committee of bankers which sets international
banking standards.
In the first six months of this year the amount of funds under management
has hardly changed. But there was a further increase in bank deposits of
Pounds 1.6bn, nearly a 10 per cent rise.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Retail sales grow but gloom remains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIGGER rise than expected in high street sales last month failed to lift
sentiment about prospects for the UK economy.
Hopes that consumer confidence was showing flickers of activity - after the
highest increase in retail sales since the beginning of the year - receded
when commercial banks raised their base lending rates to 12 per cent.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that the volume of sales
on Britain's high streets rose by 0.8 per cent during August after a small
fall in July. It was the biggest month-on-month increase since November last
year.
In the three months to August, the volume of sales was 0.5 per cent up on
the previous three-month period and 0.3 per cent higher than in the
corresponding period a year before.
Non-food retailers reported better sales than food and department stores.
Volumes rose by 1.1 per cent compared with the three months to the end of
May and were 0.8 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Within that, sales of clothing and footwear rose 2 per cent on the previous
three months, reflecting clothes retailers' summer discount sales.
Sales of household goods rose 1 per cent in the latest three months, but
were up 3 per cent on the corresponding period a year before.
Food retailers fared less well. Sales fell 0.2 per cent in the latest three
months but were 0.3 per cent up on a year ago.
The more promising state of retail sales last month is unlikely to be
repeated this month. The latest Confederation of British Industry
distributive trades survey suggests that retailers do not expect demand to
improve over the next three months.
Yesterday's increase in interest rates will dampen consumer confidence
further as mortgage rate rises reduce the amount of money people have to
spend.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland Montagu, the investment bank,
said: 'Had there not been the pressure on sterling this week, I think the
retail sales figures and better-than-expected news on government borrowing
would have been taken together as good news for economic prospects.'

FT  17 SEP 92 / InterCity to offer bistro-style service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL'S InterCity sector launched a vigorous campaign yesterday aimed
at luring back passengers lost because of the recession.
Innovations include cut-price first-class tickets for leisure travellers, a
bistro-style restaurant car service and the introduction of customer welcome
teams at main InterCity stations.
Mr Chris Green, InterCity's managing director, said revenues were heading
for a Pounds 50m shortfall in the present financial year because of a
downturn in business and leisure travel.
Costs had been cut and all non-essential investment postponed. But new
customers had to be attracted to rail if InterCity was to stay in the black
this year.
One part of the campaign will aim to tap the budget end of the travel market
with cut-price offers. Airline-style Apex tickets, which offer low-price
fares to those booking a week in advance, will be extended to all InterCity
journeys of more than 150 miles.
The new Leisure First ticket, aimed at the leisure market, will offer
half-price first-class travel provided the time away includes a Saturday
night. A London-Bristol return will cost Pounds 43.50 instead of Pounds 87.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Further press restrictions opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Newspaper Society yesterday backed the Press Complaints Commission and
said it would oppose any new laws to restrict freedom of the press further
in the UK.
The society, which represents about 260 publishers of local and regional
newspapers, was publishing its evidence to Sir David Calcutt QC, who is
conducting a review of of the workings of the press.
Mr Dugal Nisbet-Smith, director of the society, said he was perturbed about
the view of many MPs that the methods used by some journalists to obtain
stories were so unacceptable that they should be banned by law.
Any attempt to introduce special restrictions on journalists might lead to
registration of journalists and a state system of licences for publications.
'In the end it would surely not be acceptable to restrict the freedom of
expression of an author of an article in a newspaper to a greater extent
than an author of a book, or than a politician in an election pamphlet or on
a soapbox, or than an academic in a learned journal,' the society argued.
Mr David Newall, deputy director of the society, said that if there were any
suggestion of specific laws against journalists, there should be a wide
review of the whole business of bugging and covert surveillance whether
involving government officials, private investigators or industrial
espionage.
The society also appealed yesterday to Sir David to pay greater attention to
the views of its members than they were apparently receiving.
The regional newspaper industry on a per-issue basis had a total circulation
of 53.4m, compared with only 30.5m for the national press, it said.
It was not the conduct of either regional or local newspapers that was
responsible for calls for stronger controls.

FT  17 SEP 92 / Botnar's group wins Fiat deal: AFG gains further car
franchise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMOTIVE and Financial Group (AFG), the motor retailer controlled by Mr
Octav Botnar, has succeeded in gaining the Fiat group franchise for 25 of
its dealerships.
AFG is quickly becoming one of the top three multi-franchise UK dealer
groups and has gained franchises from at least seven leading carmakers.
The future of the group was placed at risk when Nissan UK, its sister
company, lost the lucrative Nissan importer/distributor franchise at the end
of last year as a consequence of the legal conflict between Mr Botnar and
Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker.
Mr Botnar, chairman and managing director of Automotive Financial Group
Holdings, the holding company for AFG, is in Switzerland. He was abroad when
a warrant was issued for his arrest by the Inland Revenue at the end of
January, and he has not since returned to the UK.
AFG was previously the largest UK motor retailer, with about 160 sites, but
sold exclusively Nissan new vehicles. The loss of Nissan forced it to
undertake drastic restructuring in an effort to find replacement franchises.
The group has succeeded in refranchising at least 68 of its UK dealerships
and it has emerged as the largest UK dealer group for three European
carmakers - Fiat, Renault and Citroen.
Under the Fiat franchise, the dealerships are largely dual franchises
consisting of either Fiat-Alfa Romeo or Fiat-Lancia.
AFG has also secured the Citroen franchise for 14 dealerships, Renault and
Peugeot for 11 each, Vauxhall for four (with one additional dealership under
discussion), Honda for two and Volkswagen/Audi for one.
The restructuring of the AFG network into a multi-franchise group and the
build-up by Nissan Motor of its own dealer network has caused a considerable
upheaval in the UK retail motor trade.
Nissan Motor's network of dealers was opened with 150 outlets at the
beginning of the year and is planned to expand to a total of 250 to 270
dealers by the end of the year.

FT  17 SEP 92 / PSBR figure better than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC-SECTOR finances deteriorated by less than expected last month,
although government tax receipts continued to be restrained by the
recession.
The public sector borrowing requirement in August was Pounds 2.9bn, more
than Pounds 500m lower than forecast. Privatisation proceeds in the month
were close to zero.
That brought the cumulative PSBR total since April - the beginning of the
financial year - to Pounds 14.3bn compared with Pounds 7.9bn in the same
period last year. Excluding privatisation proceeds, the cumulative total was
Pounds 17.8bn.
In the March Budget, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, forecast a PSBR of
Pounds 28bn, double the size of the previous year's deficit. However, with
the chances of an economic upturn this year looking increasingly remote, the
Treasury's forecast is likely to be exceeded as tax receipts fail to live up
to expectations and high unemployment keeps government spending high. The
latest view of forecasters is that the PSBR will reach Pounds 32bn this
financial year.
Last month's better-than-expected figure was helped by net repayments from
local authorities and public corporations.
