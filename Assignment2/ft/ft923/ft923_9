<TEXT>
SIR DENYS Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday
warned that the west must restructure its chemical industry to compete with
the Asian Pacific producers.
The warning follows indications last week that the European Commission
merger authorities may oppose an assets swap between ICI and Du Pont, the US
chemical giant. The swap, announced in April, involves ICI exchanging its
worldwide nylon interests for Du Pont's acrylic business and Pounds 250m
cash.
Sir Denys, speaking at the second world chemical congress at Newport,
California, warned that Asian Pacific manufacturers would become net
exporters by the end of the decade.
He urged western governments to adopt the level of partnership between
government and industry known in the Far East.

<TEXT>
Smith New Court, the UK securities house, is expanding its marketmaking
activities in shares of smaller companies.
The move comes only a week after SG Warburg Securities, one of the leading
marketmakers in London, said it was withdrawing from making markets in
shares of 362 companies. Warburg said it no longer made commercial sense to
trade such illiquid stocks.
Mr Derek Riches, a director at Smith New Court, said his company had
received a substantial response from companies faced with the transfer of
trading in their shares from the Stock Exchange Seaq system to the Company
Bulletin Board.
'We recognise the problems associated with trading in smaller company shares
and will endeavour to help,' said Mr Riches.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: EIS up 4% in hostile environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIS GROUP, the specialist engineer, reported a 4 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30.
Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said the rise in profits, from Pounds
7.06m to Pounds 7.34m, had taken place in the most hostile economic
environment the group had faced in its 21 years of continuous profits
growth.
Turnover rose to Pounds 95.5m (Pounds 92.1m) with more than half generated
from overseas activities.
Increased profitability enabled the group to re-hire up to 25 per cent of
the 200 employees it recently shed as part of a cost cutting exercise.
The group continued to make use of the Pounds 18.3m raised in last year's
rights issue, buying Fluidrive and Sime Industries, manufacturers of fluid
couplings and industrial disc brakes, for Pounds 4.7m.
Mr Haslehurst said: 'We will continue to make further acquisitions, although
we are not in any rush to buy companies.'
Capital expenditure is expected to remain at last year's high level of
Pounds 6.9m.
The interim dividend 3.225p (3.175p). Earnings per share fell from 14.211p
to 13.062p.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Foods' shares dive as interim is
cancelled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLARKE FOODS, Britain's second largest ice cream maker, yesterday saw two
thirds of its stock market value wiped out after announcing that a cash
shortage had led it to scrap plans to pay an interim dividend and open talks
with its bankers.
The company, which declared a 0.75p interim on August 3, said yesterday its
current difficulties made payment no longer appropriate. The shares fell 43p
to 21p.
Clarke blamed unexpectedly poor weather since late July, which had enabled
the company to achieve only 25 per cent of its planned ice cream sales. This
had resulted in a large build-up of unsold stocks and delays in payments to
suppliers and creditors.
Cash resources had dwindled because lower sales had prevented it from using
more than half its invoice discounting facility, its only external source of
working capital.
The facility was arranged with Lombard Invoice Discounting, part of National
Westminster Bank, after Clarke acquired the Lyons Maid ice cream business in
February. Under the arrangement, Lombard advances working capital only after
Clarke presents invoices from sales to retailers.
Though Lombard recently raised its working capital payments from 55 per cent
to 60 per cent of the value of invoices, Clarke had been unable to take
advantage of the increase.
Mr Manjit Sahni, finance director, said Clarke was discussing with NatWest
proposals to convert all or part of the cash discounting facility into a
conventional overdraft. He expected a decision from the bank in the next two
weeks.
Mr Sahni said some of Clarke's creditors and suppliers had threatened to
take legal action, though none had so far done so.
The cash shortage is the second setback this year for Clarke, which suffered
a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 168,000 on sales
of Pounds 10.4m in the six months to May 2.
The fall was blamed on problems in commissioning new production equipment,
which had prevented the company from meeting demand for ice cream in the
early summer. The company said yesterday that the problems had now been
solved.
Last March Mr Henry Clarke, chairman, announced ambitious plans to re-launch
the Lyons Maid brand and introduce a super-premium ice cream, backed by
Pounds 4.5m of advertising campaigns.

<TEXT>
THE RANK Organisation yesterday sold its screen advertising business to RSA
Advertising, a new company backed by Schroder Ventures, in a deal worth
about Pounds 21m.
Rank Screen Advertising, founded in 1938 as a subsidiary of Odeon Theatres,
is the dominant company in cinema advertising with an 85 per cent share of
the market.
In 1990 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that the company had a
monopoly position but that it did not operate against the public interest.
Rank decided that screen advertising did not fit in with its main film
distribution business.
The company will be run by Mr Keith Shepherd, a former senior executive of
Thorn-EMI.
Mr Peter Howard-Williams, managing director of Rank Screen Advertising,
decided not to stay.
Finance for the deal is being provided by a syndicate led by NM Rothschild
and including the Bank of Scotland.
Rank Screen Advertising has turnover of about Pounds 20m a year and revenues
have been increasing at an annual rate of 20 per cent partly because of
increasing cinema audiences.
Its only significant rival is Pearl &amp; Dean.

<TEXT>
FORD is restructuring the management of its worldwide technical operations,
placing responsibility for both product and manufacturing processes under
the control of one senior executive.
The job has gone to Mr Louis Ross, 60, currently executive vice-president,
International Automotive Operations. He will become Ford's executive
vice-president and chief technical officer from October 1.
Mr Ross's responsibilities are to include the final development and launch
of Ford's new mid-sized 'world car', code-named CDW27, which will replace
both Ford's Sierra in Europe early next year and the Topaz and Tempo ranges
in North America next autumn.
Mr Ross will also be responsible for the worldwide Automotive Components
Group. It operates 51 wholly owned or joint venture manufacturing facilities
in 13 countries.
In creating the new appointment, Ford, like other major car makers, is
adapting to swiftly-changing technology which is requiring much closer
collaboration between product and manufacturing process designers and
engineers.
The 'simultaneous engineering' allows manufacturers to make large cost and
other savings through much-reduced product development times.
Mr Ross, who joined Ford as a research engineer in 1955, will be succeeded
by Mr Wayne Booker, currently Tokyo-based vice-president of Asia Pacific
Operations. Mr Booker's successor will be Mr Robert Sparvero, formerly
general manager of Ford's export sales operations in North America.

SADIA, one of Brazil's largest publicly traded groups, and a leading
producer of foodstuffs for domestic and export markets, has announced
profits of Dollars 20.8m for the first half of 1992. For the whole of 1991,
it recorded profits of Dollars 45.8m.
Most of the profits this year came in the first three months, said Mr Luiz
Fernando Furlan, executive vice-president. The second three were dampened by
the continued domestic downturn. The group is Brazil's leading producer of
poultry, beef and pork products. It is second in soya output.
He has confidence in Sadia's ability to compete abroad, but complained about
subsidies, particularly in Europe, calling them 'the only thing we can't
compete with'. He said. 'The first world has a neo-liberal discourse, but it
is mercantile-protectionist in practice.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (6): Kimchi tops the menu - The South
Korean market is growing fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE Suginoi Hotel waitresses busily clean up after the vast number of
guests who have eaten at the dinner buffet in the great dining hall. Aside
from traditional Japanese dishes, the hotel serves a number of Korean stews
and plates of Kimchi, a red hot Korean cabbage pickle. For as well as
attracting local tourists, the hotel - in Beppu, famous for its hot springs
 -caters to large numbers of South Korean visitors.
Kyushu has been successfully competing for foreign tourists, especially
those from south-east Asian countries. Of the 40,000 South Koreans expected
to visit Oita this year, some 30,000 will stay at the Suginoi.
The area has become more accessible for South Koreans since Korean Air
recently launched direct flights from Seoul to Oita, three times a week.
gThe one-hour flight has brought Seoul and Oita so close that South Korean
politicians and leading businessmen come incognito to take a dip in Beppu's
hot springs for a few hours.
However, the Suginoi has not achieved its popularity overnight. After seeing
the rush of Taiwanese tourists to Kyushu after liberalisation of overseas
travelling in Taiwan in 1979, Mr Tatsufumi Watanabe, Suginoi's president,
predicted the South Korean market would hold the same potential.
When the South Korean government announced the gradual lifting of
restrictions on foreign travel in the early 1980s, Mr Watanabe decided to
start promoting Beppu to South Koreans. Mr Koichi Shudo, head of sales and
promotion, expects the hotel's revenues from South Korean tourists to total
Y2.5bn this year. While some hotels and ryokan - Japanese-style inns - are
reluctant to target foreign clients due to the lower sales per head, the
Suginoi is sticking to its strategy because of the South Korean market's
high potential.
The hotel has several Korean-speaking employees and plans to send staff to
South Korea for training. Mr Choi of Korean Air says that since meals mean a
lot to Korean tourists, buffets, which allow guests to eat as much as they
want, are ideal. 'They don't want to be bothered by being told how to eat a
raw egg for breakfast.'
Other prefectures have established strong links with south-east Asian
countries. Kagoshima prefecture, this year celebrates the 20th anniversary
of its ties - through trade, culture, and tourism - with Hong Kong. Last
year, Kagoshima attracted over 56,000 south-east Asian tourists.
A number of new theme parks have started to attract Japanese tourists to
Kyushu. Space World in Kita-Kyushu, set up by an affiliate of Nippon Steel,
saw a steady inflow of visitors this year.
Tours combining Space World and Huis Ten Bosch, a replica of a Dutch town
set up in Nagasaki which opened last March, have also been a great success.
At Huis Ten Bosch 20m bricks were imported from the Netherlands to construct
a Dutch town with buildings which include complete replicas of famous Dutch
cathedrals and city halls as well as original creations of Dutch architects.
But why a Dutch city in Nagasaki? From the mid-1640s to 1854, Nagasaki was
Japan's sole gateway to the rest of the world. The Dutch and Chinese were
the only trade partners permitted by the Tokugawa Shogunate, thus Japan's
exposure to western culture was through a little Dutch trading post in
Nagasaki Harbour.
However, Huis Ten Bosch, with its 6,000-meter canal network and an adjoining
Dutch-style residential area, is only a base for a future resort city, says
Mr Akira Kawada, managing director of Nagasaki Holland Village Corporation,
the creator of Huis Ten Bosch. In the future, Mr Kawada says it wants to
develop the area into a city of about 10,000 residents and hopes Japanese
companies will create satellite offices, so employees can work in an
environment close to nature.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (7): Drawn by clean air / Profile of Baxter
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Baxter International, the US medical products group, was seeking a site
for a factory in Japan, its consultant identified 1,500 possible locations.
A hillside outside Miyazaki city in south-eastern Kyushu was not among them.
Yet that is where Baxter ended up three years ago. The still expanding
operation, which now employs 130, is one of the island's smaller foreign
manufacturing enterprises. But it bears testimony to the determination of
regional authorities to land their chosen overseas investment catch.
The prefectural government, hearing of Baxter's search, obtained biographies
of the executives involved. Discovering that Mr Komatsu Kazutoyo, the head
of Japan Baxter, was a marine college graduate, officials put out feelers
until they found someone from the same academy who could arrange an
introduction. Through this circuitous route they were able to convince the
US company's directors to pay Miyazaki a visit.
For their part, aside from standard criteria such as labour availability and
infrastructure, Baxter executives had other, less tangible requirements. A
city with a good quality of life was one factor, even though the group was
not shipping out expatriates to run the plant. And it wanted to be the
flagship foreign enterprise in its area - a site elsewhere, neighbouring
another American plant, was rejected for that reason.
Miyazaki's ardour did not go unrequited. Board members who arrived at what
was being turned into a gleaming new airport and toured the estuary city of
some 290,000 people declared: 'This is a Baxter town,' according to Mr
Tokoyo Imai, a former Johnson and Johnson official who is now manufacturing
director at the Baxter Miyazaki site.
This July, Baxter added a second production line at the plant, which
supplies peritoneal dialysis bags to kidney patients. It saw a growth
opportunity in Japan where barely 5 per cent of such patients use the
system, which averts the need for thrice-weekly hospital visits and is
employed by a fifth of US and a third of British sufferers. The company now
claims 92 per cent of the Japanese peritoneal dialysis market.
Miyazaki, home to the first of 26 sites in Japan designated as a
'technopolis', saw its education and research facilities as a selling point.
Baxter now sends selected employees on six-month secondments to work with
doctors at the local medical university, from whose graduate output it also
recruits.
The prefecture says it cannot compete as an investment location primarily
through financial inducements. Incentives 'are not so high - they are
average, the government here is not so rich', acknowledges Mr Masayuki
Nakano, director general of its commerce, industry and labour department.
The main private sector employer has for decades been Asahi Chemical, but
its fibres plant has not expanded in recent years and the prefecture remains
anxious for new industries. The arrival in Kyushu of the big Japanese
automotive groups has brought several medium-sized components suppliers to
Miyazaki, 'but we want assembly lines', says Mr Nakano.
Baxter decided to live with the area's high transport costs for the sake of
the good labour and clean water and air its clinical product requires. But
the positive attitude of the regional authority was crucial.
The facility was up and running in the space of six months, with local
officials helping secure the necessary ministerial approvals. Staff were
hired by combing a prefectural 'human resource bank', a hit-list of local
graduates who had gone to work in other parts of Japan.
They were among the modest annual trail of 'U-turners' forsaking higher
metropolitan salaries and drawn, like their employer, to Kyushu's
environmental benefits.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (5): The island looks abroad - Many see
overseas investment as an advantage for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENFIELD sites in Kyushu are just that. In the lush and rolling terrain
towards the island's northern tip, surrounded by forests and rice fields,
the arrival next spring of Toyota is signalled by the vast pastel-coloured
corrugated barns which will house its plant.
For the country's biggest car maker, the facility will be its first domestic
production centre outside its Aichi home. When fully on stream it is
intending to produce 200,000 cars a year, assuming a revival in the
country's depressed automotive market.
This, with a near-doubling of capacity at Nissan nearby, will bring Kyushu's
annual car output to at least 700,000 units out of a total for Japan of
4.5m.
Although local demand was one consideration - Toyota is building a similar
facility in Hokkaido, northern Japan - the company thinks that at best 10
per cent of the vehicles built in Kyushu will stay on the island. A more
important factor was the availability of land.
The abundance and relative cheapness of industrial real estate in Kyushu, in
addition to a well-trained workforce, have helped draw manufacturers there
in the face of what Mr Jippei Mutoh, a director of the nascent Toyota
operation there, acknowledges is a below-par transport infrastructure.
Expressways and rail links on the island are being extended, and last
month's record central government package of public works spending may yield
funds for a further upgrading of ports.
Still, local business leaders at times show agitation that budgets disbursed
in Tokyo do not take enough account of the region's needs. 'We are saying a
share should be fairly given to local areas as well,' says Mr Ryoji Tsukuda,
president of Bank of Fukuoka, Kyushu's biggest home-grown bank. 'Whether it
works like that is questionable.'
The economic downturn in Japan has now begun to hit Kyushu, lagging about
six months behind the rest of the country and not yet so severely affected
by it.
Access to investment capital on the island has not altered markedly,
although the projects for which funds are intended are likely to receive
closer scrutiny.
'There is no credit crunch in Kyushu,' Mr Tsukuda maintains. His loan book
will grow some 3 to 4 per cent this year - sharply down from the usual 10
per cent, but most of the difference reflects curtailed lending through its
Tokyo and Osaka branches.
Prefectural governments meanwhile have become all the more anxious to secure
new investment commitments. Such keenness, however, has long been the case
for those regions away from the industrial north of the island, that seek
creative ways to target the limited funds and incentives they have on offer.
Kumamoto in western Kyushu, for example, has a 'foreigners first' policy
under which bigger grants, of up to Y50m, are available for companies from
overseas, whereas a Japanese group would get only Y40m. Better soft loans
are offered - a maximum of Y400m compared with Y300m and carrying interest
rates at a one percentage point discount to those available to domestic
investors.
Two foreign companies are siting themselves there this year - the Dutch ASM
group and Teradyne of the US, which will both be producing semiconductor
manufacturing equipment. Kumamoto has the world's largest integrated circuit
(IC) plant, owned by NEC.
Like other local administrations, Kumamoto is benefiting from the arrival of
Nissan and Toyota through the automotive component suppliers which are
springing up on the island as a result. A Kyushu-made Toyota will, however,
have only about 20 per cent local content, and the company will have some 30
suppliers from which to draw instead of the 180 in Aichi.
The 'car island' which Kyushu is beginning to call itself partially eclipses
its earlier status as 'silicon island'. It produces more than a third of ICs
made in Japan, approaching a tenth of the world output, and chip-making drew
foreign companies to Kyushu as early as two decades ago.
Texas Instruments (TI) opened its plant on the east of the island in 1973,
one of a handful it now has in Japan. Its nearly 1,600 employees include 100
working in research and development, unlike TI's Japanese rivals which
generally confine R&amp;D activities to their head offices.
The practice helps the US company attract skilled staff. Like other
manufacturers operating in Kyushu, it seeks to win back to the island those
who grew up and trained there but went on to metropolitan careers.
Prefectural governments make much of this 'U-turn' campaign, which they
co-ordinate. But some parts of Kyushu still lose 80 per cent of local
graduates to the big cities, a figure which has not changed since the drive
began in the early to mid-1980s.
Although the country's economic downturn this year has blunted the
previously acute labour shortage, key staff in some areas remain hard to
find. Mr Kiichiro Fukamoto, TI's personnel director for Kyushu, argues that
siting R&amp;D at the plant gives something for qualified electronics workers to
come back to.
'Getting the U-turn people is a problem for other companies - if they have
skills acquired in Tokyo, they can't bring them back,' he says.
Among other blandishments, TI offers its staff what it believes to be the
shortest working week in Japan - just three 12-hour days. The plant runs six
days a week, with Sunday overtime as needed. But as an indicator of the
decline in the world semiconductor market as well as in overall Japanese
industrial activity, few Sundays have been worked this year. 'Last year it
was nearly every week,' says Mr Fukamoto.
TI faces a further difficulty, unforeseen at the time it set up in Oita
prefecture. As the industry has moved in recent years from standard chips to
customised products, its physical distance from its customers has made
itself more felt. Online computer links provide only a partial solution.
Others see the island's geographical location as an advantage for the
future. Mr Tatsuo Kawai, chairman of the Kyushu Economic Federation, has his
eye on the adjacent regions of China, to which Hong Kong capital has not yet
rushed as it has in the south.
The large industrial groups in South Korea, which lies between southern
Japan and north China - and which last month established diplomatic
relations with Beijing - would also be likely to commit increasing funds
there.
According to Mr Kawai, the most desirable outcome would be a tripartite
relationship, 'a kind of job-sharing with Korea' which would give both other
countries access to Japanese technology and would draw on China's labour
resources.
Three-way trade flourished until a few generations ago, and Kyushu has been
internationally minded even in Japan's most isolated periods. Other local
business leaders share the expectation that the removal of the political
obstacles which have hampered such links in the second half of the 20th
century will restore what they see as the natural status quo ante.

floods

<TEXT>
THE COTTON crop in the Pakistan provinces of Punjab and Sindh has been badly
damaged by floods following last week's heavy rains.
According to initial government estimates, up to 10 per cent of the crop may
have been destroyed, though some officials believe losses may be up to 20
per cent. That would mean a sharp turnaround from a 35 per cent rise in
cotton production, last year.
Mr Zafar Altaf, chairman of Pakistan's Agricultural Research Council, said
production may decline by 1.5m bales from last year's output of 13m.
'The damage to the cotton crop is going to be quite extensive', he said,
adding 'You would have to shave off about 1.5 million bales'.
The Southern province of Sindh, expected to produce 1.5m bales, has so far
been worst hit. Punjab would have produced the rest.
Initial estimates show that up to 60 per cent of the Sindh crop there has
been destroyed. Officials fear further damage because flood water is
expected to reach Sindh tomorrow or Thursday.
The damage to cotton is expected to put pressure on Pakistan's economy. Up
to 58 per cent of last year's export earnings were from cotton related
products such as raw cotton, yarn, fabrics, garments, bed-wear and towels.
In addition, there are concerns that the floods have also damaged rice and
sugar-cane fields. The extent of the damage is not yet clear because
assessments are continuing. Other damaged crops include chillies, tomatoes
and onions in southern Sindh. That may raise the prices of vegetables for
consumers, some officials add.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather hits UK cereal harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD WEATHER last month has helped reduce this year's total UK cereals
harvest to 21.5m tonnes, worth about Pounds 3.2bn to the farming community,
according to two leading grain traders. This compares with 22.7m tonnes in
1991.
Most badly hit has been the wheat harvest. Dalgety Agriculture, the biggest
UK grain trader, estimates 1992 wheat production at 13.3m tonnes - 'a far
cry from the 15m tonnes plus many were predicting two months ago,' said Mr
Andrew Barnard, arable crop marketing manager.
Allied Grain, part of Associated British Foods, estimates the UK wheat
harvest at 13.4m tonnes. Mr Peter Crisford, an Allied director, said last
week that the wheat harvest in southern England was 75 per cent complete
'with the balance now in serious risk of major deterioration or total crop
loss'.
In contrast, barley was the crop of the year, according to Mr Crisford. Both
Allied and Dalgety put the barley harvest, mainly gathered before the bad
weather, at 7.6m tonnes.
Dalgety estimates UK barley demand for 1992-93 at 5.88m tonnes, but believes
that there are good export prospects for the surplus 1.72m tonnes 'in view
of the excellent quality'.
Wheat demand is put at 9.17m tonnes, leaving 4.14m tonnes for export or
intervention. 'The poorer quality available presents us with a major
challenge in locating overseas customers,' said Mr Barnard.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Growing
'green fuel' may be alternative to set-aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the ground floor of the building that houses the Austrian Ministry of
Agriculture in Vienna, there is a small display. Its backdrop is the
familiar 12-star blue flag of the European Community. Its purpose is to
promote among the administrators who work in what was formerly the War
Ministry the concept of Austrian membership of the EC. Detailed negotiations
with the EC are to begin in 1993.
I was there to talk to Dr Adolf Hanser, who is involved in strategic
planning of agricultural policies with responsibility for the promotion and
exploitation of fuel oil from vegetable sources.
Although other countries are planning or building their own bio-fuel
industries, it is Austria that leads the world in the development of the
technology to convert rape oil into diesel fuel. Since 1982 the country has
been seeking the best and cheapest method to produce a vegetable-based fuel
that will power conventional engines designed to run on fossil fuel.
The scientists have perfected a fuel which produces only marginally less
power per litre than fossil fuel, and which is much more environmentally
friendly. They believe they are ready to go into commercial production.
Indeed, a few days ago in Austria I visited the biggest bio-diesel fuel
production plant in the world, with an annual capacity of 15,000 tonnes. It
was in the final stages of being commissioned but will not hold the
production record for long. There are similar plants under construction in
other European countries, some of them scheduled to produce up to 100,000
tonnes per year. Most are based on Austrian technology.
Unlike many of our European partners, however, the British Ministry of
Agriculture appears to have little enthusiasm for oilseed rape-based
bio-fuel, in spite of the fact that growing the necessary crops on set-aside
land is specifically permitted under the terms of the CAP reform. Officials
cite the fact that the positive energy balance - after what is used in the
production process is accounted for - is small and that the cost in relation
to that for fossil fuel is high.
I wondered therefore why Austrian officials had reached a different
conclusion.
Dr Hanser told me that his country's interest in bio-fuel began in earnest
in 1982 when, like most other European countries, Austrian cereal production
became surplus to domestic consumption. The country was growing nearly 1m
tonnes a year more than it needed. The cost of exporting this, however, was
getting out of hand and ministry officials therefore sought alternative uses
for the surplus land.
Set-aside was considered but rejected. It would have been too expensive to
compensate farmers for lost income over the area that it would have been
necessary to take out of production, said Dr Hanser, and Austrian farmers
would have hated to grow nothing but weeds. I know the feeling.
It was decided to opt for what were calculated to be the cheaper
alternatives of other crops such as peas and beans for protein and of
developing a bio-fuel industry. This, it was judged, would at the same time
respond to the growing demands of Austrian citizens for 'greener' policies.
The basis of the bio-fuel initiative was that the government would forgo
excise duty on bio-fuel and make it possible for potential refiners to buy
raw rape oil at the world price by paying an area subsidy to farmers. This
was calculated to bring the farmers' income per hectare of rape grown up to
the level they would have received if they had grown wheat.
If they had grown wheat, they would have received the Austrian guaranteed
price of nearly Pounds 200 per tonne - almost twice as much as the present
EC guaranteed price, which is itself to fall by 30 per cent because of the
CAP reform.
'It is the government's responsibility,' Dr Hanser said, 'to ensure that the
6 per cent of the Austrian population who are farmers and farm workers are
as well off as other comparable members of society. Prosperous farms help to
keep our countryside beautiful and attract tourists. The people of Austria
are happy to pay our farmers this money to keep the country looking how we
and our guests want it.'
Remembering the EC exhibit downstairs, I asked how he thought such a policy
would fit in with Austria's proposed membership of the Community. 'We shall
have to negotiate special permission to continue our subsidising policies at
the same levels,' Dr Hanser replied, apparently oblivious to my raised
eyebrows.
However, the fact remains that Austria, which is paying more per hectare to
support its arable farmers than in the UK, has still found it more
economical and politically acceptable to support the production of
environmentally friendly renewable fuel than to allow vast areas to be set
aside.
The Austrian government accepts that bio-diesel from rape seed will never
produce more than about 5 per cent of its total fuel requirements. It even
accepts that farmers may not always be the most appropriate people to use
such fuel in their tractors.
Nevertheless, Austrian farmers use roughly the same quantity of fuel as that
produced from rape seed and the area is about the same as that used to grow
hay for the horses that provided farm power 50 or 60 years ago.
Austrian policy, because of the high cost of bio-fuel, is concentrating the
limited supplies of it available in areas where avoidance of air and water
pollution is important.
The low emissions of carbon and sulphur from bio-fuel, for instance, make it
ideal for powering snow-levelling machines on ski slopes. It can also be
employed beneficially in activities where vehicles come close to natural
water supplies, reducing the risk of pollution. Another use where the
payment of a premium for safer fuel would be justified is in public
transport in large towns, in order to reduce air pollution.
Indeed, Friends of the Earth were urging such action in the UK only last
week. I understand that the Reading bus company is about to begin running
its vehicles on bio-diesel for a trial period to assess benefits to air
quality. The fuel they will use, however, will be imported from Europe
through a subsidiary of Ferruzzi, the Italian company.
Good for Reading. Good for Ferruzzi. But British farmers and British
refiners could be producing bio-fuel here. Next year about 15 per cent of
our arable land will be set aside and growing little but weeds. Some could
be used to grow environmentally friendly fuel.
As in Austria, it would only provide a small percentage of total fuel needs.
But it could help to improve the environment and avoid the waste of land and
resources on farms.
All it would take would be modest encouragement from the British government,
which seems set on discouraging non-food crops on set-aside land. Other EC
countries where bio-fuel technology is well advanced include France,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Ireland. So why not in Britain too?

FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil exports warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN TRADERS have been warned to get used to a chronic shortage of
Russian oil products and prepare for a continuing reduction in exports
because of Moscow's squeeze on crude deliveries to former Soviet republics
with spare refining capacity.
Professor Yevgeny Khartukov, a leading oil analyst, described as
'uneducated' a statement by an official at Rosnefteprodukt, the state
organisation which collects refined products for export, that deliveries to
Japan and western Europe were being suspended because of a domestic need for
fuel to drive agriculture machinery during the harvest. The statement was
later withdrawn amid confusion on world markets.
'The trend should be made clear to traders: there is an excess supply of
crude hanging over the market and less and less oil products around,' said
Prof Khartukov, who heads the Moscow-based World Energy Analysis and
Forecasting Group. Exports of products from Russia would continue, but
exports from other former Soviet republics could come to a stop by the end
of the year, he said.
This was because Russia was starving republics such as Ukraine of cheap
crude deliveries in an attempt to prevent them re-exporting oil and refined
products for hard currency. But as a result it found itself with more crude
than it could cope with, while refineries in other republics had idle
capacity.
The break up of the Soviet Union has strained the old integrated system, in
which Russia automatically delivered excess crude to refineries in other
republics.
Asked about more efficient ways of discouraging the re-exports so that
Russia could meet export obligations outside the former Soviet Union, Prof
Khartukov said it was politically difficult to charge other republics world
prices to stop them importing more than they needed for domestic
consumption.
Moreover, politicians were too ignorant and industry managers too chaotic to
pursue standard crude processing arrangements between countries with excess
crude and those with excess refining capacity. Under that sort of ideal
solution, the oil would continue to belong to Russia even when it went to
refineries in other republics, which would receive a fee for refining
services.
Prof Khartukov said Russia's plan to centralise exports and limit the number
of enterprises which could become involved in foreign trade were also doomed
to fail. 'The shift from commercial to state run (export) structures have
nothing to do with the volume of products available.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec output rise set to
continue - Geneva meeting expected to add Dollars 1 a barrel to crude prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crude prices could rise by more than Dollars 1 a barrel after the meeting of
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries which begins tomorrow in
Geneva, analysts say. However, any agreement is likely to have little effect
on the organisation's real oil output.
Opec allocated each member a temporary production ceiling, adding up to
22.98m barrels, at its February meeting. But since it rolled this over at
its last meeting in May, albeit with the proviso that war-damaged Kuwait be
allowed to increase production at will, it has been pumping at close to its
capacity.
Observers believe Opec has good reason to reach an agreement that will allow
production to continue rising gradually from about 24.3m barrels a day in
the last quarter to between 24.5m and 24.8m b/d in the next. With demand in
the coming quarter forecast to be at least 25m b/d, the result would be a
healthy oil price.
Mr Mehdi Varzi, Opec-watcher at Kleinwort Benson in London, believes even
the traditional price 'doves', notably Saudi Arabia, will support a higher
price.
The fall in value of the dollar - the currency in which oil is traded - has
decreased oil revenues by more than 10 per cent to some Opec members. Even
wealthier members can no longer afford low prices, and are likely to push
the price towards the price hawks' target of Dollars 21 a barrel for the
Opec basket of crudes.
Opec has some potentially acrimonious battles ahead - principally over how
it will adjust present market shares to absorb Iraq when the United Nations
allows it to recommence oil exports. However, observers believe the
organisation will be anxious to avoid such battles until its next meeting in
November. Mr Vahan Zanoyan, consultant with the Petroleum Finance Company of
Washington, says many members are too preoccupied with their own domestic
politics to risk political clashes with their neighbours.
Analysts believe there are therefore two possible outcomes to the Geneva
meeting.
Mr Joe Stanislaw, of Paris-based consultancy Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, believes the 22.98m b/d quota will be rolled over for the second
quarter running. The assumption, however, would be that real output would be
around 24.6m b/d.
He feels that this is the most sensible solution, given that Opec may need
to incorporate Iraq by the first quarter of next year and could face lower
demand, meaning members would have to decrease output.
'Once you formally raise the quota for everyone it becomes much harder to
bring it down again,' he says.
However, Mr Zanoyan says Opec might make a 'meaningful' increase in its
production ceiling to a level slightly below its production capacity -
probably 24.5m to 24.7m b/d. This would give prices a boost as it might
restore faith among the world's oil markets that Opec was taking its
responsibility seriously and was likely to stick broadly to such a quota.
However, such a rise would have to be applied across the board, with a pro
rata increase in each member's temporary production ceiling, otherwise it
could precipitate the very row about market shares which members want to
avoid.
Either option would be likely to provoke a rise in the oil price of up to
Dollars 1 a barrel after the meeting, on expectations of tight demand.
Observers say the price could rise by another dollar or more depending on
the severity of winter weather. Nervousness about Opec's November meeting
could also put pressure on prices.
Most observers expect the net result to be the target price of Dollars 21
for the Opec basket of crudes (equivalent to around Dollars 23 for Brent
crude) being reached before the end of the year - good news for Opec's price
hawks and the oil companies.

GOLD eased in the afternoon from earlier highs, but spot metal was still
fixed at a five-week high of Dollars 346.25 a troy ounce. Some profit-taking
crept into the market, which touched levels above Dollars 348 at one stage
after New York opened higher than expected. Gold is looking to consolidate
above Dollars 345, before a test of Dollars 350, traders said. Dealers said
the morning cuts in German interest rates were the key supportive factor,
with the market ignoring dollar strength. There was little sign of heavy
producer selling, and intermediate resistance was brushed off. Most BASE
METALS on the LME ended the day higher in both dollar and sterling terms,
after nervousness caused by the currency market activity caused irregular
movements. Traders said the ERM realignment and German interest rate cuts,
although not likely to have any immediate impact on metals demand, were
expected to aid economic recovery in the longer term. A threat of renewed
industrial action by Polish COPPER miners came just as the kerb closed but
gave an early boost to the after-hours inter-office market. London's
sterling COCOA prices fell in spite of the dollar's sharp rise.

THE US yesterday brushed off concerns of Russian credit-worthiness and
extended Moscow Dollars 1.15bn in loan guarantees and aid for food purchases
through February.
The Agriculture Department, which has been providing generously for American
farmers as well in the run up to the November elections, yesterday said
Dollars 600m in credit guarantees would be made available to Moscow in the
next 3 1/2 months for grain and livestock feed with Dollars 300m extended in
January and February.
Another Dollars 250m in food aid for the purchase of processed or higher
value products will complete the package. This brings total US food credits
assistance to Moscow to Dollars 5.75bn since January 1991.
Canada last month suspended grain shipments to Russia when it ran more than
Dollars 80m behind in servicing its Dollars 1.5bn line of credit. That,
however, now has apparently been resolved.

THE future of Roquefort, one of France's most famous cheeses, should be

concludes negotiations to sell its majority stake in Roquefort.
Nestle, which earlier this year acquired a controlling 57 per cent stake in
Roquefort as part of its successful takeover bid for Perrier mineral water,
has been approached by a number of prospective purchasers including Besnier,
Bongrain, Entremont and Bel, four leading French cheese producers.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group which is already a leading

interest in acquiring control of Roquefort, which is valued at between
FFr1bn (Dollars 209m) and FFr1.5bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECTICEL, the Belgian manufacturer of polyurethane foam, is to sell most of
the rest of its 44 per cent stake in Foamex LP, its US subsidiary, for
Dollars 156m.
The Belgian company, which changed its name from Gechem in June, plans to
sell 33.6 per cent of Foamex to its US partner, 21 International Holdings,
at book value, in effect ending an ill-judged move into the US foam market.
Mr Luc Vansteenkiste, chief executive, revealed yesterday that 'due to some
new circumstances' the group was considering an increase in negative
provisions in its 1992 accounts. He hinted that the write-offs  - which
would be announced with interim results next week - might be linked to
environmental liabilities of companies which have since been sold.
The sale of the Foamex stake is conditional on 21 International raising the
money through bank finance and the issue of high-yield bonds on the US
capital markets.
The US group will also repay a Dollars 15m loan to Recticel, bringing the
Belgian group's debt down to 140 per cent from more than twice shareholders'
funds. A new capital injection of BFr3bn (Dollars 103m) promised by June
next year will reduce gearing still further, to about 60 per cent.
Mr Vansteenkiste, who inherited Foamex when he took over as Gechem chief
executive last year, said yesterday: 'The acquisition, as of last year, had
not brought any money into the company, and we had to make a decision
whether to continue or whether to stop.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: It Runs in the Family - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ray Cooney outdoes even Lord (Jeffrey) Archer in his versatility. Not only
has he bought the Playhouse Theatre from the former Tory MP and writer who
found it did not make money. Cooney has opened it with his own play, directs
it and acts in it as well. Indeed, his acting is so good that it helps to
explain why he writes such splendid farces.
It Runs in the Family may not be quite the best of them, but you would have
to be in the most churlish mood not to enjoy it. The piece ought to have
opened at Christmas, for it starts with 'Jingle Bells' and has the doctors
and nurses of St Andrew's Hospital, London rehearsing for the annual
pantomime. Snow is seen falling through the famous Cooney windows which, as
so often, are set centre stage and bound to play a prominent part in the
action.
Yet never mind that it is still only September. The coach parties have
already begun to arrive in force and although this may not be a play to
arouse gales of laughter, it is strong on the steady chuckle.
The pantomime is only a sideshow. The real business is the annual Ponsonby
lecture to be delivered by the neurologist, Dr David Mortimore (John Quayle)
before the junior health minister and neurologists from all over the world.
The trick, the hospital governor explains, is not to plead abject poverty,
as that would fail to impress the foreign visitors, but to persuade the
minister that the place needs more money.
In practice we never get that far. There are interruptions all along the
line, beginning with the arrival of Nurse Tate (Sandra Dickinson), an old
flame of 18 years ago, who reveals that she has Mortimore's son, a
distinctly punk youth demanding to meet his father for the first time.
From then on it is the customary fun and games. Mortimore has a wife from
whom the facts must be concealed. One of Cooney's techniques is to allow one
lie to lead to another until there is multiple confusion and nobody knows
who is who. He does this time and again, and the pace seldom flags.
The characters are stock: an old man in a wheel chair (perfectly played by
Henry McGee) who develops an astonishing new lease of life and has fun with
a soda syphon; Matron (Jacqueline Clarke), hard on the surface but soft
underneath, and an old fashioned police sergeant in Windsor Davis. There is
a part for the veteran Doris Hare.
The windows come in when it looks as if the punk youth (William Harry) is
about to fall from the outside ledge. Matron and doctors hang on to him. A
slight criticism: seen from the stalls, there is not much sense of vertigo.
The main pleasure of the evening comes from Cooney himself. He plays Dr
Bonney, not a high flyer and certainly not the sort of man to be invited to
give the Ponsonby lecture. Watch how he knows his deficiencies, the way he
wears his jacket, the expressions on his face even when he is not in the
forefront of the action. This is the performance of a man who knows that
farce is a very high art. Cooney enjoys every minute. By Christmas, the
production should be even better.

FT  15 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie rises strongly in good trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a buoyant res-ponse in the London stock market to Sunday night's
concerted moves by Italy and Germany to overcome the threatened crisis in
the European exchange rate mechanism. Although the equity market's opening
burst of enthusiasm proved well overdone, blue chip stocks overcame
disappointment with the Bundesbank's reduction of only 0.25 per cent in the
Lombard rate and 0.5 per cent in the discount rate and the FT-SE Index
closed 51.2 up at 2,422.1.
Strength in the US dollar and, after some early uncertainty, in the pound,
brought demand for the heavyweights of the Footsie list. Trading volume, as
measured by the Seaq network, increased but marketmakers warded off some
early buyers by marking prices higher before the official opening of
trading.
However, the German interest rate cuts were feared to be insufficient to
permit similar reductions in the UK in view of sterling's vulnerability in
the ERM following devaluation of the lira. Investors remained cautious ahead
of the French referendum next weekend on the Maastricht treaty.
At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall warned: 'It is at least as likely as it
was a week ago that UK rates will have to rise to defend sterling's ERM
parity.'
Similar views were expressed by Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull -
'sterling is not out of the woods yet' - and such views were emphasised when
the pound slipped below the DM2.80 mark before the Bank of England came to
its defence.
Marketmakers decided that the Footsie could well rise by around 50 points on
the dramatic overnight news and, without waiting for the size of the German
rate cuts, marked shares up before the Seaq system was switched on. But the
weight of early buying surprised them, and the Footsie jumped by 99.5 points
to 2,470.4 at the offical opening.
The running was taken up in stock index futures, where trading in the
Footsie September and December contracts was extremely heavy as dealers
struggled to take the increased demand into trading books purposely kept
tight.
As soon as share trading was under way, however, institutions began to sell
into strength, unloading lines of stock of which they had been unwilling
holders in the market's low volume days.
Selling was not heavy but it soon clipped the Footsie back to a 36.3 gain on
balance as strategists warned clients that, while the Bundesbank's action
was a welcome move in the right direction, it did not alter Britain's
currency/interest rate situation fundamentally, at least for the present.
London had sensed a strong opening on Wall Street, which came in with an
advance of 44 Dow points in UK hours, and the pound began to move up against
the D-Mark. Good two-way trading in UK equities restored the Footsie to a
rise of more than 56 points in the final hour of business. Seaq volume of
537.9m shares compared with Friday's 476.8m, worth Pounds 923.9m in retail,
or customer, business.
Once again the market was led higher by widespread gains in the
dollar-earning issues.

FT  15 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT activity prompted by the devaluation of the lira and cuts in
German interest rates inspired very heavy trading in the derivatives market
yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
In the Footsie September contract, which expires on Friday, volume had
exceeded 10,000 contracts by mid-morning and went on to reach more than
18,000 by the close.
At the opening, the September contract moved almost in tandem with the
underlying stock market and showed only a small premium. Traders struggled
to continue rolling over September contracts into the December future, the
latter also attracting heavy trade.
Aggressive sellers then caused a setback in the September future, which
dipped to around the 2,400 mark, showing a slight discount to cash. Renewed
buying interest, encouraged by the improvement in sterling, finally took the
contract to a close almost in line with the cash market.
Business in traded options expanded to 41,702 lots from Friday's 35,499.
Turnover in the FT-SE option increased from 16,529 to 17,560. The
Euro-Footsie option saw 3,558 contracts transacted.
In stock options, GEC topped the actives list with 4,650 contracts dealt.

FT  15 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Optimism among builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BATTERED and bruised in recent weeks by hefty downgradings and announcements
of trading losses and dividend cuts, the building materials and contracting
sectors were among the market's best performing areas yesterday after the
German interest rate reductions.
Redland and RMC, two of the most important companies in the building
materials sector and both heavily involved in the German market, surged
ahead as some industry analysts took the view that the reduction in German
rates could well mark a watershed in European interest rates.
A specialist commented: 'There is a modest groundswell of opinion that we
may have passed the worst of what has been a hideous period for the building
materials companies, but we still have the French referendum ahead of us and
it could still go horribly wrong.'
Redland shares, buffeted by recent profits downgrades and due to report
interims on October 1, jumped 24 to 357p. RMC, which last week suffered the
indignity of being dropped from the FT-SE 100 Index, advanced 23 to 436p.
The latter is expected to announce a modest increase in its interim dividend
on Thursday, along with a slight decline in half-year profits.
Utilities languish
The utilities sectors were among the handful of areas of the market not to
participate in the general upturn. 'They are simply not fashionable on a day
when the hint of interest rate cuts is in the air,' said one dealer.
He added that the stocks had performed well against the market during the
recent bout of currency-inspired turbulence and also amid hints of a new
five-year coal agreement between the generators and British Coal.
The generators were heavily traded, with National Power closing 7 down at
254p on 5.3m shares dealt and PowerGen 6 easier at 267p on 6.9m. Manweb was
the worst casualty in the electricity distribution stocks, sliding 20 to
426p. South West gave up 18 to 396p and London 13 to 385p.
The water issues had Anglian 7 cheaper at 425p, Severn Trent 6 down at 404p
and Thames 4 off at 439p.
Hints of a cut in UK interest rates were enough to send the housebuilders
sharply better. Tarmac moved forward 10 to 69p, Bryant 8 to 74p and George
Wimpey 6 to 80p.
The high street banks led the market charge at the outset of trading but
closed well below the day's best levels. Barclays attracted the heaviest
support and settled 9 up at 323p, after touching 336p, on turnover of 9.6m.
HSBC finished 8 1/2 stronger at 354p on 6.5m traded.
Hopes that the sharp rise in the market will trigger an increase in turnover
and more corporate activity boosted SG Warburg, finally 20 higher at 454p.
The prospect of a reduction in UK interest rates saw discount houses turn
upwards, Gerrard &amp; National gaining 16 at 276p.
United Friendly moved up 19 to 390p in response to the increased interim
profits and dividend. The latest steep rise in the dollar gave a strong
fillip to insurance brokers, CE Heath climbing 11 to 268p and Willis Corroon
7 to 173p.
Oil shares attracted a fresh burst of support from domestic and overseas
sources, notably the US, where buyers responded to the upswing in the
dollar. But a number of oil specialists said the sharp gain in the dollar
was needed to head off an expected series of substantial profits downgrades
in the sector.
Dividend growth in BP, an analyst said, remained a long way off. BP shares,
stimulated by US support, ran up 7 to 204 1/2 p on 8.4m traded, while Shell
appreciated 8 to 482p on 3.6m.
Calor put on 9 to 196p in front of Thursday's interim figures. The
exploration and production sub-sector performed well, notably Enterprise
Oil, which improved 11 to 339p.
Although closing well below their best levels after a session of erratic
movements, shares in the big international drug companies recorded
substantial gains on the back of their heavy dollar-earning capability.
Glaxo raced up to 815p before settling 22 1/2 ahead at 790p, SmithKline
Beecham advanced 13 to 502p and Wellcome 5 to 884p.
The 40 per cent-plus jump in interim profits and increased dividend left
British Polythene 24 stronger at 409p.
There were some stocks, however, that not even a strong market trend could
help yesterday. Food manufacturing group Hillsdown Holdings was among these,
easing 3 to 82p in heavy trade of 6.5m shares.
The group reported disappointing figures last week well below the market's
best estimates, which had precipitated a downward trend in the shares.
Sentiment in the stock was further weakened by reports that three
substantial lines of stock - one of between 7m and 8m shares - were trying
to find buyers in a reluctant market.
Shares in Granada Group ignored the market's upsurge and slipped 3 to 235p
in light trading. The damage appears to have been caused by the gloomy
outlook that analysts visiting the company yesterday came away with. Brokers
were particularly downbeat about the rental division, in which trading over
the last few months is said to have been poor.
The sentiment in Granada appeared to spill over into Thorn EMI, which also
has a rental division, and the shares ended a penny lighter at 670p. Volume
was 1.7m.
This year's poor summer weather in the UK has started taking its toll.
USM-quoted Clarke Foods plunged 43 to 21p after stating that it was no
'longer appropriate to pay an interim dividend' as previously intended,
because of the fall in ice cream sales which has had a severe effect on the
company's finances.
The view that UK interest rates are unlikely to be lowered in the short term
hurt business services group BET, a penny easier at 108p after 1.4m shares
traded.
Car repair group Kwik-Fit fell sharply after it surprised the market by
announcing a sharp fall in interim profits to Pounds 9.74m, from Pounds
16.75m at the same stage last year. Having dropped to 86p on the release of
the figures, the shares rallied to close 13 down at 96p.
Inchcape jumped 23 to 420p after reporting an improvement in interim
figures.
US investors were once again reported to be the day's main buyers of British
Steel. Turnover reached 13m as the shares hardened 3 to 54p.

FT  15 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Firmer dollar and bonds lift
US equities
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
SHARE prices on Wall Street rose strongly in the wake of the cut in German
interest rates. Shortly after midday, the scale of the rise triggered the
New York Stock Exchange's programme trading circuit breakers, and throughout
the afternoon the market clung on to the morning's gains, writes Nikki Tait
in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 70.52 at 3,376.22,
after opening more than 35 points up and reaching a level of 3,368.92 by
1pm. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was finally 5.69 ahead at 425.27 and the
Nasdaq composite 11.20 stronger at 594.21. Turnover on the NYSE amounted to
a heavy 252.7m shares, while rises outweighed declines by 1,287 to 573.
The market's surge came against the backdrop of a strengthening dollar and a
rising bond market. Traders quickly reasoned that these developments would
give the Federal Reserve more leeway to lower interest rates, thus helping
to shift the stagnant US economy on to a recovery path. Yesterday's advance
was said to result from steady demand for stocks by both institutional and
individual investors.
A number of leading US corporations were among the market's most actively
traded shares in the morning session - most of them showing solid gains.
Ford Motor advanced Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 42 7/8 , General Motors Dollars
1 1/4 to Dollars 34 7/8 and Chemical Bank Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32.
Tobacco and food group Philip Morris gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 85,
although its major rival, RJR Nabisco, eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 8 3/4 .
Merck, the drugs company, was also active, firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars
48 5/8 . Compaq Computer put on Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 on the back
of a new product launch and in the wake of IBM's delayed debut for its
low-cost PCs.
Weyerhaeuser, the forest products concern, climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 36.
At the end of last week the West Coast-based group said it was delaying the
flotation of its Paragon Trade Brands subsidiary because of the diaper price
war.
In the banking sector, plans by Shearson Lehman, a subsidiary of American
Express, to sell its Boston Company to Mellon Bank for Dollars 1.45bn left
Mellon shares down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 40 1/4 . American Express rose
Dollars 1 to Dollars 22 3/4 .
Maytag, the home appliances manufacturer, appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 14 3/4 on news that it is entering a co-operative alliance with
Germany's Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate.
The New York Times said it knew of no particular reason why its shares
should advance strongly yesterday: by lunchtime the class 'A' stock was
Dollars 1 1/2 ahead at Dollars 28 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks climbed throughout the day to end sharply higher in the wake
of the surprise cut in Germany's leading interest rates.
The TSE 300 index rose 29.8 to 3,470.4 and advances outscored declines by
365 to 205 after volume of 33.2m shares valued at CDollars 359.9m.
The German rates cut helped the Canadian dollar recover about a third of a
cent from last week's sell-off. The rally in the currency paves the way for
a hefty cut in the Bank of Canada's key rate on Thursday, money market
traders said.

FT  15 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Finnish message for devaluation pundits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For all the volatility on individual markets, what with the Finnish
devaluation, the Swedish response, privatisation hopes in Italy and
depressed sen-timent in Spain, the FT-Actuaries Europe index ended flat on
the week last Friday, ahead of Sunday's stirring events.
While the US managed a slightly positive performance, the prime mover,
within the 1.0 per cent decline in the World Index, was a 4.1 per cent drop
in Japan. Nearly all of this was seen last Friday, when the Nikkei average
fell 4 per cent after publication of the Bank of Japan's tankan, or
quarterly economic survey, which showed business confidence at its lowest
level since the mid-1970s.
Finland, meanwhile, is getting into the habit of producing gains more
apparent than real. Equities rose in markka terms after the devaluation of
November 1991; but that devaluation did not work.
Last week, a repeat process produced a rise of 6.7 per cent in local
currency terms; but in terms of the dollar Finland was 7.6 per cent down.
Perhaps there is a message there for politicians and pundits of other
nationalities.
Among the worst performing markets, in local currency terms, were Sweden and
South Africa. On Wednesday, after an initial fall on the Finnish
devaluation, the Swedish central bank raised its marginal lending rate to 75
per cent from 24 per cent, to reverse the capital outflow from the country
and to relieve pressure on the krona caused by Finland's currency crisis. In
addition, there was more disturbing news from the financial sector,
anticipating losses from Svenska Kredit and Gota.
South Africa dropped from Monday on news that Ciskei soldiers had opened
fire on ANC supporters. Fears of continued violence were sustained until
last Friday, when the market recovered on news that the ANC would hold talks
with the government.

FT  15 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average gains 2
per cent but in low volume

<TEXT>
FUTURES-LED trading left shares higher yesterday with the Nikkei average 2
per cent ahead, but volume was low ahead of today's public holiday, agencies
report from Tokyo.
The 225-share average gained 363.71 at 18,471.40 after recording a day's
high of 18,552,79 and low of 18,149.34. Advances outnumbered declines by 589
to 399, with 153 issues unchanged, although turnover was estimated at only
230m shares, compared with 700m on Friday.
The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 13.26 to 1,383.11, and
in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 5.50 to 1,113.48.
News that Germany was to cut interest rates spurred activity, with the
financial sector very active. Sumitomo Bank moved ahead Y30 to Y1,730 in
volume of 1.47m shares, and Mitsubishi Bank firmed Y10 to Y2,290 with some
1.28m shares traded. Nomura Securities advanced Y70 to Y1,700 and Nikko
Securities ended Y45 higher at Y786, both in heavy volume.
Blue chip electricals encountered bargain hunting. Hitachi rose Y9 to Y792,
Toshiba Y19 to Y629, Sony Y100 to Y4,210 and Pioneer Y140 to Y3,360, but NEC
slipped Y10 to Y802.
Cement companies were in demand on speculation that they will benefit from
government spending plans. Nihon Cement strengthened Y32 to Y790, Sumitomo
Cement Y13 to Y572 and Onoda Cement Y14 to Y563.
Bio-technology issues were mostly firmer, Green Cross adding Y10 at Y1,730
and Meiji Milk Y10 at Y1,180, but Nippon Zeon receded Y13 to Y723.
Roundup
GERMANY'S announcement that it was to reduce its interest rates lifted many
of the region's markets yesterday.
AUSTRALIA saw its largest one-day rise for five months. The All Ordinaries
index put on 35.50 to 1,536.70 in turnover of ADollars 249.8m. News Corp
fell 78 cents to ADollars 22.54 on news, after Friday's close, that it plans
to raise ADollars 2.27bn in fresh capital. Foster's Brewing climbed 11 cents
to ADollars 1.59 after Mr John Elliott and Mr Ken Biggins of International
Brewing Holdings resigned from the board.
TAIWAN, shut last Friday for a public holiday, dropped 2.7 per cent to a
20-month low after the detention of Oung Ta-ming, the textile tycoon whose
Hualon group is one of the largest in the market, in connection with a stock
scandal. The weighted index ended 100.46 lower at 3,685.04 in turnover of
TDollars 17.44bn (TDollars 15.77bn).
Hualon preferred weakened TDollars 7.50 to TDollars 102.50 and other
Hualon-related stocks, Chia Hsin Live and Min Shin Cotton, also fell
sharply.
HONG KONG remembered its link to the US dollar again as the Hang Seng index
appreciated 69.86 to 5,607.15, but turnover was down from HKDollars 1.82bn
to HKDollars 1.39bn.
HSBC was the most active issue, rising HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 55 on
European buying.
NEW ZEALAND closed 1.23 per cent ahead. The NZSE-40 index gained 17.92 at
1,479.09 in turnover of NZDollars 21m.
The breweries sector gained ground, Lion Nathan adding 16 cents at NZDollars
4.46 and Magnum putting on 5 cents at NZDollars 1.07, but volume remained
light.
Air New Zealand, which announces its annual figures soon, moved forward 6
cents to NZDollars 2.70.
BANGKOK remained positive following Sunday's general election. The SET index
rose 16.05, or 2 per cent, to 817.95 in turnover of Bt14.73bn. It was the
largest daily turnover since February 13.
SINGAPORE saw late buying of blue chips, which left the Straits Times
Industrial index 11.16 stronger at 1,380.40.
MALAYSIA's composite index advanced 2.95 to 583.74 in turnover of MDollars
133.5m.

FT  15 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weekend package receives
qualified approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ERM realignment and the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts, welcome as they
were, were seen as only part of the prescription yesterday for keeping Italy
straight, and putting the D-Mark out of speculative reach, writes Our
Markets Staff.
Mr David Roche, global strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that the package
probably did enough for the US dollar. But in Europe, a French No vote on
Maastricht could revive monetary tensions, and there was still the
possibility of upward pressure on the D-Mark.
For equities, Mr David Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, was happy
but cautious. 'Bourses may find a new level because the news has changed,
but in the short term they are unlikely to head off into the blue on a new
bull tack,' he said.
Markets might now be on the lookout for more encouraging news, and to place
German economic slowdown in that category; but they also may have to face
more corporate earnings downgrades.
FRANKFURT decided that the Buba cuts were the beginning of an interest rate
downtrend, and the DAX index climbed 67.24 to 1,595.04 after a 23.07 rise to
623.34 in the FAZ at midsession.
Turnover more than doubled, from DM3.6bn to DM7.4bn. Within that, there was
a dive into the senior international blue chips, Deutsche Bank (interest
rate sensitive), Siemens and Daimler-Benz, an obvious dollar stock, turning
over more than DM1bn each as they rose DM35.80 to DM647.50, DM33.90 to
DM658.50 and DM23.20 to DM617.50 respectively.
Ms Barbara Altmann of B Metzler in Frankfurt said that the scale of the rise
in the DAX reflected the fact that traders were short of stock last week,
and nervous about the French Maastricht referendum.
Bund futures had stayed strong in the afternoon, following a drop of 20
basis points to 8.01 per cent in the Buba average bond yield yesterday;
this, and the strong opening on Wall Street were seen to bode well for
German equities today.
PARIS indicated its pleasure with a 71.61 rise in the CAC-40 to 1,873.60.
Volume was also strongly ahead at FFr4.7bn against Friday's FFr2.4bn.
However, the government reaffirmed that French interest rates will only be
cut if Sunday's Maastricht referendum shows a Yes vote.
The financial sector put up the day's best performance, with Bancaire
suspended limit up after gaining FFr35.10 or 10.3 per cent at FFr377.00.
Other performers included Suez, up FFr19 at FFr268 in heavy volume, Societe
Generale FFr27 higher at FFr561 and Paribas gaining FFr20.50 at FFr362.50.
MILAN responded to devaluation with an 11.95 rise in the Comit index to
379.04 in turnover substantially higher than Friday's L78.2bn. Profit-taking
after an early run-up pulled the market off its highs.
Credito Italiano, which resumed trade after being suspended last week after
plans for its privatisation were announced, was fixed at L1,600, up 15 per
cent. It then rose further on the kerb to L1,799, an overall gain of 29 per
cent.
Nuovo Pignone, halted for the same reason, was quoted L310, or 10 per cent
higher at L3,410. Other leading shares rose steeply. Fiat gained 6.3 per
cent, Mediobanca 6 per cent and Montedison 7 per cent.
BASLE and Geneva fielded the trading of Swiss shares with Zurich closed for
a local holiday. The SMI index closed 59.9 up at 1,871.1 as lower interest
rates lifted the market.
Interest rate and dollar sensitivity ranked highly, banks and insurers
making strong gains with CS Holding SFr95 higher at SFr1,815, and Ciba-Geigy
bearers SFr28 better at SFr646.
BRUSSELS was boosted by the German news and the Bel-20 index closed up 40.67
to 1,120.25. Companies which rely heavily on exports to the US performed
well with Delhaize rising BFr70 to BFr1,580 while Petrofina added BFr350 to
BFr8,590 and Solvay BFr375 to BFr12,100.
AMSTERDAM followed other markets higher after the Dutch central bank cut
three key interest rates. The CBS Tendency index closed 3.9 higher at 113.1
One of the main stories of the day was the decision by the steelmaker,
Hoogovens, to cut 2,300 jobs in a cost-cutting programme. The shares rose Fl
5.90 to the day's high of Fl 43.80 before slipping back to close up Fl 2.80
at Fl 40.70.
MADRID was helped not only by the general advance among senior European
markets but also positive August CPI data which was slightly better than
expected. The general index closed up 6.13 at 214.94 in good turnover of
Pta13bn.
The financial and construction sectors were among the day's best movers with
Popular up Pta350 at Pta9,900 and Valderrivas up Pta260 at Pta7,360.
STOCKHOLM reacted positively to news that the country's central bank was
reducing its key marginal lending rate, raised last Wednesday, from 75 per
cent to 20 per cent. The Affarsvarlden Index gained 39.6 to 759.9.
Volvo made one of the day's main advances, assisted by the stronger dollar.
Its B shares put on SKr40 or 15.6 per cent to SKr295. In the forestry sector
Stora B shares rose SKr14 to SKr206. HELSINKI's share prices were firmer and
the HEX index rose 15.38 to 589.37, mainly due to gains in the forestry
sector.
VIENNA rose strongly after the central bank cut its interest rates. The ATX
index rose 58.19 to 804.04, just below the day's high of 804.45.
In the financial sector, Erste Allgemeine, the insurer, rose by its daily
maximum, adding Sch247 to Sch2,717. OMV put on Sch67 to Sch739, and Lenzing,
the textile manufacturer, rose Sch59 to Sch654.
ISTANBUL saw its highest close for more than seven months as the 75-share
index advanced 192.14 to 4,514.24 in turnover of TL330bn. Some analysts said
that the rise was led by expectations of good third quarter earnings.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures move wildly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in both the sterling cash and futures markets gyrated wildly
yesterday as the market tried to interpret what Germany's cut in interest
rates implied for UK base rates. By the end of the day, the market had taken
no firm view of whether UK base rates would rise or fall, and assumed that
10 per cent base rate would be unchanged.
Sterling futures soared at the start of London trading yesterday as dealers
waited for the promised cut in the Bundesbank's official interest rates.
However, the announcement of a 0.25 percentage point reduction in the
Lombard rate and a 0.5 percentage point lowering of the discount rate
immediately depressed sterling contracts. 'The market had been expecting 75
basis points off the discount rate and was disappointed,' said one
commercial bank dealer in London.
After rising 82 basis points from its previous close in the early morning,
the December contract continued to fall from a high of 89.95 throughout the
day. It closed at 89.69.
There was a similar trajectory to cash rates. Three-month money dipped as
low as 10 1/16 per cent in the early morning, but crept right back to close
at 10 5/16 per cent on the offered side as sterling dithered. The closing
rate was  1/4 per cent lower than Friday's finish.
The market will remain jittery before Sunday's French vote on the Maastricht
referendum. A clearing bank dealer said that by this time next week the
market could still be dealing with 12 per cent base rates if the French vote
No.
Against this background, he believed that the shorter-dated sterling futures
would gradually sink below the 89.50 level as the week continues.
The Bank of England acted decisively to calm the market, dashing all hope of
a base rate cut by offering a repurchase agreement in the early round at the
established rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The market purchased Pounds 900m of
the 'repo', instantly removing the shortage forecast by the Bank.
Sentiment was improved by the Bundesbank's decision to set a floor for
repurchase agreements at a fixed 9.20 per cent. Dealers said this
effectively implied that money market rates had been cut by 0.5 of a
percentage point.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Realignment weakens D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REALIGNMENT of the European Monetary System weakened the D-Mark against
most currencies yesterday, but the market remained uncertain about the
immediate future for exchange rates, writes James Blitz.
The devaluation of the Italian lira and the cut in the Bundesbank's interest
rates were intended to convince dealers that the EMS is a fixed system that
will not disappear, whatever the outcome of this weekend's referendum in
France on the Maastricht treaty.
The Bundesbank showed that it was prepared to bow to international pressure
to lower interest rates if that would help a realignment of the ERM. Mr Jim
O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corp in London, said: 'Although the
rate cuts were small, the principle of bowing to int-ernational pressure was
significant. What we saw yesterday may even be the birth of the new European
Central Bank.'
Three factors could still upset the EMS structure in the short term. The
first is Sunday's referendum, the shadow of which is now fully over the
market. Sterling's performance against the D-Mark yesterday reflected the
uncertainty, with the currency peaking at DM2.8250 overnight, but closing in
London at DM2.8125, up more than 2 pfennigs from Friday's close. If the
French vote No, the pressure on sterling will be intense on Monday morning,
and a rise in UK base rates may be unavoidable.
The second pressure will come if the Germans do not reduce interest rates
again. The best interpretation of the Bundesbank's move yesterday was that
rates had peaked. Probably the worst came from Mr Norbert Walter, chief
economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, who said there will not be another
rate cut before mid-1993. Countries seeking interest rate reductions, such
as the UK, Spain and Portugal, may question the validity of a German-led
system again.
The third pressure would come if the US dollar weakens again, forcing a new
flight into D-Marks. The dollar peaked at DM1.5155 overnight and ended in
London at DM1.4855, up 3 1/2 pfennigs from Friday's London close. In New
York it closed mildly below the London finish at DM1.4821. The narrower
interest rate differential between the US and Germany caused Mr Julian
Simmonds, head of foreign exchange at Citibank, to declare that the dollar's
fall has bottomed out. But the US economy remains fundamentally weak and, in
the run-up to the US election, there could be pressure on the currency
again.
The one European currency that was actively bought was the lira. But it
closed in London at L793 per D-Mark, having opened at L784.62, raising fears
that the devaluation had been too small.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (4): Old habits dying fast - Rural villages
now grow their own products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY years ago, when the government was encouraging the increase in rice
crops, the farmers of Oyama - a small town in northern Oita prefecture -
sacrificed their rice paddies for chestnut and plum fields. As a result, and
under the strong leadership of the village mayor, Oyama transformed itself
from a poor rural village to one of the richest farming communities in the
country.
Oyama's plum and chestnut campaign was initially received with scepticism,
even among the farmers in the town. 'People thought we were crazy, telling
people to stop growing rice,' says Mr Kinji Yahata, present mayor of Oyama.
But after Mr Yahata's father, then village mayor, explaining to the farmers
that Oyama - surrounded by mountains with little flat land - was not a place
for raising cattle or for rice farming, those who initially opposed gave in
and Oyama started cultivating fruit, which grows easily in mountainous areas
and would suit Oyama's climate.
The Japanese government's 'double income campaign', encouraging people to
work harder to increase their income, also predicted a change in the eating
habits of the Japanese. 'If people earn more money, it doesn't mean that
they'll eat more rice. Instead they'll try to eat an assortment of foods in
small portions,' says Mr Yahata.
Thus, a small impoverished village grew into a town producing 130 different
fruits and smaller scale produce, such as mushrooms, cress and herbs.
Mr Yahata also points out that the government is not aware of the speed at
which the eating habits of the Japanese are changing. He says small-lot
production of high-quality goods represents Oyama's means of survival,
especially when overseas pressure to increase imports of agricultural goods
is rising.
Oyama's strategy also changed the image of farming and curbed the outflow of
the younger generation into cities. Mr Seijiro Yano, a 53-year-old farmer
from Oyama who owns plum fields and grows mushrooms, was 23 when the village
began its restructuring. 'I wanted to go to university and I was keen on
leaving Oyama when I had the chance, but the new campaign to change Oyama
gave me an incentive to stay,' he says.
Mr Yano says going against the trend of mass production was what led to
Oyama's success. 'Just following the government's agricultural policy is not
good enough.'
Oyama's enthusiasm spread throughout Oita with the 'one village one product'
campaign, launched by Mr Morihiko Hiramatsu, the governor of Oita, in 1979.
Oyama's effort to establish an identity among its populace and inspire local
pride through the production of special products coincided with Mr
Hiramatsu's aim to rescue Oita's ailing economy and faltering self-image.
Mr Hiramatsu urged local communities to develop at least one original
product which they could call their own. 'Only something truly local can be
global and I didn't want copies of what people could buy in Tokyo,' he says.
His efforts resulted in the Oita shiitake mushroom, which holds 20 per cent
of the country's market, and Himeshima prawns, which, at Y6,000 per batch,
raise an annual Y1.9bn for the prawn farmers of Himeshima island. Oita
mandarin oranges sell at Y300 to Y500 per 100g. This compares favourably to
car production, since a 1.5-tonne car, selling at Y3m will mean sales of
only Y200 per 100 grams.
No subsidies are provided for the production of the local specialities.
However, the prefectural government provides aid for research and
development of the products, as Mr Hiramatsu believes that truly beneficial
products can not emerge through government subsidies.
While the success of the 'one village, one product' has prompted other
regions in Japan and overseas to follow Oita's example, Mr Hiramatsu admits
that the hardest challenge Oita faces is the departure of the younger
generation to larger cities.
'It's a problem that any small region in any country in the world faces,'
says Mr Hiramatsu. 'For that, Oita needs to be a base for information and
culture.'
Even Oyama is finding it harder to prevent de-population. Mr Yano of Oyama
says that while the town has managed to build a reputation for its high
quality agricultural goods, life is still hard and the short sightedness of
the government's agricultural policy is discouraging Japan's farmers.
Although Mr Yano's son has returned to the farm after graduating from
university in Tokyo, 'it's really hard to tell him to work with high hopes
for the future', says Mr Yano.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (2): Locals weather the storm - The city
banks licking their wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE international banking community had reservations about the rapid
spread of Japanese commercial banks' influence in the 1980s, Japan's smaller
regional banks had real reason for concern about the tougher domestic
competition that would flow from financial liberalisation.
In the late 1980s, the regional banks could see that the commercial, or city
banks as they are known in Japan, were courting their customers, bolstering
networks outside Tokyo and preparing to take advantage of interest rate
deregulation, due to be completed by 1994.
But, in Kyushu, while the Tokyo and Osaka-based city banks are counting the
costs of expansion during late 1980s and still calculating the problem loans
arising from their exposure to the troubled property market, the regional
banks are now more relaxed.
Instead of taking Kyushu banks' customers, the city banks are selling loans
to the regional banks in an attempt to trim assets. And Bank of Japan
research shows that while city bank lending in Kyushu fell by 4.2 per cent
in June and 3.9 per cent in July, compared to a year earlier, local bank
lending rose by 5.4 per cent and 6.9 per cent during the same two months.
Mr Tatsuta Goto, president of the Nishi-Nippon Bank, based in Fukuoka,
smiled as he contemplated the waning potential threat from the big city
heavyweights: 'We have no problems with the city banks here. There are too
many banks in Fukuoka, but it is the city banks which are weaker.'
Fukuoka prefecture has Japan's largest number of regional bank branches  -
442, almost 50 per cent more than the next largest collection in Shizuoka
prefecture, near Tokyo, and double the number in most prefectures. As a
result, the area's smaller banks are ripe for the mergers that the Ministry
of Finance presumes will come with liberalisation, but city banks, too, have
faced tougher than usual competition.
With Fukuoka city rapidly becoming the Tokyo of Kyushu, smaller banks in
other areas on the island have attempted to expand their operations in the
city, adding to the forest of signs in the already overcrowded banking
district.
Like the city banks, some of those regional institutions have found that the
ebbing financial tide of the early 1990s has exposed unwise expansion made
during the 1980s.
The newcomers, large and small, were also willing to lend to local companies
that had exhausted their credit with the established banks. One side-effect
of the increased lending is the 3,000 vacant apartments in Fukuoka city
built by property developers who, along with the banks, got the market
wrong.
Mr Goto insists, apartments aside, that Fukuoka has avoided the extreme
excesses seen in Tokyo and Osaka. He admits that some companies have been
forced to restructure their loans but says that, for Nishi-Nippon,
non-performing loans are not a particularly heavy burden.
'We have always looked at the quality of our assets. If we are evaluating a
troubled company, we will look at the policies of the management and, for
example, whether they have a good stock of land. If their long-term
prospects are good, we will assist them,' Mr Goto said.
The Nagasaki-based Eighteenth Bank also appears to have weathered the 1980s
successfully by concentrating on its local banking network. It has 125
branches, 110 of them in Nagasaki prefecture and another 10 in Fukuoka
prefecture, and new branches are planned for the northern Kyushu area.
Mr Genji Nozaki, the bank's president, said that his institution had bought
about 'six or seven loans' from city banks that were trimming their assets,
although he sensed that, in the longer-term, these banks would pose a threat
to the regional banks' profits.
'Real liberalisation has yet to come. If interest rates are actually
liberalised, we really can't say what will happen. It would certainly be
more difficult for the smaller banks to compete,' Mr Nozaki said.
'It is also true that the city banks are not as strong as they were three
years ago,' he added.
Both Mr Nozaki and Mr Goto at Nishi-Nippon are former finance ministry
officials, a common background for regional bank heads.
Both are determined to keep their banks above the 8 per cent
capital-to-assets ratio that was established through the Bank for
International Settlements.
The BIS ratio at Nishi-Nippon was 8.18 at the end of March, compared to 8.66
a year earlier, while Eighteenth Bank was at around 9 per cent in March 1991
and 8.65 per cent last March.
Mr Nozaki said that the best way to safeguard the bank's financial standing
was to concentrate on the local community.
With this in mind, it launched a corporate identity campaign with a
three-pronged slogan - banking, together with the community, in the
interests of the customer, and with sincerity. The slogan is somewhat
snappier in the original Japanese.
The Kyushu banking community need only turn to the Fukuoka stock exchange
for a lesson on how large financial institutions can quickly consume the
local competition. Mr Fubito Shimomura, president of the exchange, lamented
that in 1949, there were 24 local brokers, of which only one remains.
'It's really a bit unfortunate. The brokers here these days are Nomura
Securities and Yamaichi Securities and so on. The others no longer exist,'
Mr Shimomura said.
He said Fukuoka was really 'just one floor' in the one Japanese market, with
25 of 252 stocks listed only on his exchange and the others based in Tokyo
or elsewhere.
About 62 Kyushu companies are interested in listing, but the stock market
weakness over the past two years has forced companies waiting for better
times.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (3): Washlet creator tries new tricks /
Profile of Toto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLAY soil of Kyushu has for centuries yielded the raw material used to
produce ceramics and to this day it is turned by the craftsmen of Arita into
exquisitely fashioned bowls and ornaments.
More recently, Kyushu's status as 'silicon island' derived in part from the
availability of the ceramics which went into semiconductors.
But in between high art and high-tech, for the past 75 years one Kyushu
company has been supplying the nation with a more prosaic form of ceramic
and its products are used almost every day by almost every Japanese.
Toto, based in Kita-Kyushu, is the country's biggest manufacturer of
toilets, with annual sales of Y417.5bn and a domestic market share of more
than 60 per cent. It was the creator 12 years ago of the Washlet, a
microcomputer-controlled combination toilet-bidet which has been featured on
numerous western television shows.
Tied closely to the domestic economy, its profits dipped last year, amid the
downturn in construction activity, to Y30.2bn before tax, down 13 per cent.
But it has been expanding in Asia, Europe and this year the US, and analysts
argue that its dominant position at home means it can set the industry's
pricing terms and will be well placed for a revival in housing starts.
Japanese take their bathrooms and kitchens (units for which the company also
supplies) seriously. And Toto takes its products seriously - the executive
washroom next to the office of Mr Shigeru Ezoe, who took over as president
in June, is ripped out every year to accommodate its latest models.
He says that Japan's ageing society, putting a greater emphasis on living
standards, is prompting new demand. Business comes two thirds from new homes
and the rest from renovations. 'In the US the reverse is true, and we
foresee the same happening here,' he adds.
Toto has just opened a Y17bn factory near its head office which came fully
on stream in June. It employs just 380 of Toto's nearly 11,000 staff. A
fleet of unmanned vehicles whisks units from the end of the production line,
while robots methodically lift and lower toilet seats while they put the
final touches in place.
In spite of the less than glamorous nature of the work, Mr Ezoe says the
company did not suffer from Japan's labour shortage of the early 1990s,
'thanks to our Kyushu base' where good quality labour has remained in ready
supply.
While Toto has plants elsewhere in Japan, the island remains its main
production centre. Abroad, meanwhile, it has stakes in sanitary ware
producers in South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia as well as in Allia
of France and Keramag in Germany.
Overseas sales account for over 10 per cent of total revenues, of which
direct exports form barely 2 per cent. After opening a California sales
outlet, US manufacturing will begin this autumn from a plant in Atlanta.
American sanitary ware makers may baulk at the arrival of a competitor from
a country where the sector's three biggest producers together account for
more than 90 per cent of the market.
But Mr Ezoe stresses that Toto does not intend to take US makers of
conventional toilets head-on: rather, the Atlanta facility, which will
initially employ just 65, will make only those using water-saving flushing
systems.
Toto has some 1,200 employees engaged in research and development and is
seeking to expand into related areas. 'Our business is to do with water,'
says Mr Ezoe, who rose through the company's technological division and now
has several dozen people working in purely biological research. The number
of technical staff overall has trebled in the last seven years.
This has enabled it to put into production, for example, ceramic parts for
optical fibre connectors. But the product for which it is best known is not
being neglected.
Next year's low-noise Washlet will have an ozone-friendly deodorant
dispenser built in, while the company has been working with Omron and NTT,
the electronics and telecommunications groups, to produce a 'health
management toilet system' which measures glucose and protein levels and can
take the user's pulse and blood pressure too.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (1): Defying the downturn? - As growth
slows in most of Japan, Kyushu is still experiencing patchy progress. While
the pessimists argue that national trends eventually filter down to the
island, others hope it will escape unbruised
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN a local banker in Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's four main
islands, explained the region's ability to avoid the worst of the economic
downturn which is afflicting the country, he alluded to a chapter in
history.
In the late 13th century, Japan was under threat of invasion from the Mongol
army. Initial landings were made and battles were fought in Kyushu. Defeat
seemed imminent in the face of the all-conquering Mongols until a sudden
storm, or kamikaze (divine wind), wreaked havoc among their vessels, forcing
a retreat.
Kyushu now hopes that a divine wind of a different kind will enable the
island to avoid the damage which has been seen in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's
two largest cities. There is a general sense that the emergency economic
package of Y10,700bn, announced in late August by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, has come in time to make sure that Kyushu will maintain its
momentum.
The island, which is about the size of the Netherlands, has a long list of
public works projects, such as 'Bullet' train lines and motorways, which
will provide an important source of stimulation for an are that accounts for
about 10 per cent of the national economy. The investment average for Japan
is 80 per cent private to 20 per cent public, while the ratio in Kyushu is
70:30.
However, the island's prefectural governments have attempted to lessen their
reliance on Tokyo money and have been highly successful in luring in new car
and electronics factories over the past few years.
Mr Hachiji Okuda, the governor of Fukuoka prefecture in the north, says that
capital spending has continued to expand in the region, while contracting
elsewhere - investment in manufacturing industry rose by 39.9 per cent in
1990 and by 6.9 per cent last year, after a rise of 31 per cent in 1988.
'Compared with the rest of Japan, we are in a good condition. There has been
a decline in land prices in Fukuoka, but no abrupt fall. The economic
package will have a good psychological impact here, but we are still
catching up. Our economy took off only 10 years ago and we have room for
growth,' Mr Okuda said.
Fukuoka city is fast becoming the Tokyo of Kyushu, sucking in investment and
attracting young workers from rural areas. It has an urban dynamism absent
from most of the island, with interesting indulgences in post-modern
architecture. Its stance is that of an Asian regional centre rather than
simply the biggest city on the island.
The bright lights and rapid expansion have also attracted speculative
property investment, leaving the city with around 3,000 empty apartments and
several troubled developers.
However, the locals argue that Fukuoka's financial 'bubble' was never pumped
up to the daunting proportions of that of Tokyo and say that the banks which
are now suffering most are the larger Tokyo-based banks.
Lending patterns in Kyushu provide evidence of the difficulties facing Tokyo
and Osaka-based banks in Kyushu. It was presumed that the deregulation of
Japan's financial system would allow the bigger banks to grab regional
market share, but lending by these banks in Kyushu for the first half was
about 3 per cent lower than a year earlier, while that of locally-based
banks was 6 per cent higher.
Mr Tatsuta Goto, president of Nishi-Nippon Bank, insists the region's own
banks are very strong. Fukuoka-based banks have certainly profited from the
city's growth. Nevertheless, there are concerns that other Kyushu banks were
overly ambitious during the easy money era of the late 1980s and that
mergers and takeovers will be inevitable.
And less optimistic forecasts argue that trends take their time to trickle
down to Kyushu and that the pain of recession will be felt before the year
is out.
But Kyushu has benefited from the rapid expansion of manufacturing during
the late 1980s, as has been reflected in the capital spending surge. Toyota
Motor is building a new car plant on the island and Nissan has an assembly
facility, while the two makers' suppliers are establishing local bases.
NEC has a liquid crystal display panel factory in Kyushu and most
semiconductor makers have established a presence on the 'silicon island',
which offered cheap land and a supply of workers when companies were worried
about labour shortages.
The investment has quickened the transition of the Kyushu economy, heavily
reliant on coal and agricultural output during the 1950s and 1960s. Coal
production fell from 26m tonnes in 1960 to 6.6m tonnes in 1985, while
integrated circuit output quadrupled between 1980 and 1985 and almost
doubled between 1985 and 1990.
And while other countries' shipbuilding industries have collapsed, Kyushu's
industry, highlighted by the huge Mitsubishi Heavy Industries facility in
Nagasaki harbour, is now prospering from an upturn in orders and from a lack
of international competition. Having weathered the South Korean challenge,
Japanese builders are now expected to take more than 50 per cent of all
orders over the next decade.
The increase in manufacturing capacity, combined with the slowdown in the
domestic economy, has prompted a more embarrassing change. Kyushu once
boasted that it was Japan's import base, playing an important role in
reducing the politically-sensitive trade surplus. But, confronted by weak
domestic demand and the need to justify recently completed plants,
manufacturers are sharply increasing their exports.
Exports rose 10.2 per cent in the first half of this year, while imports
fell by 4.2 per cent. Local trade officials said the increase was a natural
result of Kyushu's proximity to thriving Asian economies, yet exports to
Asia fell 3.3 per cent during the first half and those to the EC rose 25.9
per cent. Most significantly, car exports rose 23.4 per cent, a not
surprising outcome given the 6.5 per cent fall in domestic car sales during
the second quarter.
In the longer-term, Asia will be the focus of Kyushu's attention, a point
made clear by Mr Okuda, who points out that Fukuoka is closer to Seoul and
the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Dalian than it is to Tokyo. This week,
Fukuoka is hosting an Asian film festival, with works from Vietnam, China
and, appropriately enough, Mongolia, while other prefectural governments are
gradually expanding their network of offices in the region.
In Nagasaki, the government is trying to cultivate an image beyond that of a
memorial to atomic bomb victims. The governor, Mr Isamu Takada, has reached
deeper into the city's history, highlighting its traditional role as Japan's
gateway to western and Chinese culture. 'We see ourselves as a good base for
the software industry. We must find more jobs for our young people because
they are still being lured to Tokyo,' Mr Takada says.
But he is not expecting much help from the central government, seen by the
prefectures as a hindrance to their grand ambitions - ambitions which are
yet to feel the effects of a recession.
'There has been a lot of talk about decentralising government functions, but
we have received nothing in the past decade and we are unlikely to get
anything in the future. It's too convenient for the bureaucrats and
politicians to keep everything bottled up in Tokyo.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate cuts buoy German bond
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets proved more sensitive to the Bundesbank's decision to
lower the rate on its weekly securities repurchase tender to 9.20 per cent
from 9.70 per cent, than to the  1/4 point cut in the Lombard rate.
However, the Bundesbank's actions left the market in no doubt that it would
put money market rates back up again if it felt the need to rein in
inflation or money supply growth over the short term.
The German bond market set the tone for the day, with futures jumping 150
basis points at one stage and cash bonds rising about 100 basis points.
There was also buying interest in the Dutch market, which had lagged behind
Bunds at the start.
However, the markets lost their momentum as the day progressed.
Investors were unwilling to chase the higher levels, preferring to keep
their powder dry until after the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty
on Sunday.
The devaluation of the lira prompted some buying of Italian bonds in the
morning, but selling by retail and institutional clients gathered momentum
in the afternoon.
FRENCH bonds opened 1 1/2 points higher and short-term paper went limit-up
at the opening. But bond prices came off their highs on profit-taking, as
investors reflected on the political motivation behind the Bundesbank's
interest rate cuts.
The September future jumped 1.04 to 107.56 with 180,596 lots traded. The
French 2002 OAT was yielding 8.66 per cent against 8.82 per cent on Friday.
DUTCH bonds attracted investors' attention as the market's slow start
resulted in a widening of the spread between Dutch and German 10-year paper
to 50 basis points. This prompted buying of the Dutch paper and by the close
the spread had narrowed to 43 1/2 points. Dealers also reported a large buy
order for the Dutch 15-year bond, which rose 1 3/4 points.
The market was also boosted by the  1/4 point reduction in the Dutch
official rates.
The 8.25 per cent Dutch government bond due June 2002 ended 1.14 points
higher at 101.35, while its yield fell to 8.04 per cent from 8.22 per cent.
GILTS finished with gains of around 1 1/2 points, but were below the day's
highs on profit-taking.
Dealers said trading was orderly, though sterling's drop below DM2.80 at one
point caused some doubts.
Short sterling futures jumped in active trading. The December contract ended
at 89.74 against a previous 89.13 and in a turnover of some 58,300 lots.
Long gilt futures closed at 98 1/2 after 96 7/8 on Friday and after an early
high of 98 15/16 . Volume was equally active at 61,600 lots.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent Treasury bond due 2003/07 was 116 5/16 ,
yielding 9.25 per cent, after the last close at 114 7/16 .
ITALIAN bonds made early gains of up to 3 points, in the wake of the
devaluation of the lira and lower money market rates, but drifted back on
profit-taking by midday.
Selling pressure increased in the afternoon as foreign investors decided to
liquidate their positions and take their currency losses.
IN New York, US government securities also moved higher on news of the
Bundesbank's easing, although by lunchtime they were well below levels
reached overnight in foreign trading.
The benchmark 30-year long bond - which had reached 100 13/32 in overseas
markets - closed at 99 7/8 , up   13/32 from Friday's close.
At the end of last week, the US bond market was held back by technical
considerations, as underwriting investment firms coped with a surfeit of new
corporate debt issues.
Yesterday, dealers suggested that the desire for some speedy profit-taking
had capped the bond market rally, pushing Treasuries off the peak levels
seen overnight.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Traders digest factors behind latest
pulled issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST an upheaval in Scandinavian financial markets; then a change in
Italian tax rules; now a possible change in a borrower's credit rating: the
Eurobond market was yesterday digesting the latest reason for abandoning an
underwritten bond issue.
The news of the third issue to be withdrawn in recent days emerged late on
Friday night when NatWest Capital Markets issued a joint statement with
Spintab, a Scandinavian borrower, that Pounds 150m (Dollars 295.5m) of
floating rate notes launched as recently as three weeks ago were to be
pulled.
The disarray in Scandinavian financial markets was partly blamed for the
move, although a decision by Moody's Investors' Service, the US rating
agency, to put the company under review for a possible downgrade seemed to
have been a more important factor.
The subscription agreement for the issue was due to be signed today. Ahead
of a signing, said one bank in the syndicate, the underwriting arrangement
had no legal force - although there was an obvious moral obligation on the
underwriters, who were to be paid 20 basis points for taking on the risk.
All trades that have taken place in the three weeks are now void.
The decision to pull the issue left banks divided, with some claiming that
NatWest should have gone ahead at so late a stage.
Another bank in the syndicate, however, said that on balance it was better
to have abandoned the issue when a fundamental question about the borrower's
credit standing had arisen.
The circumstances prompted some to make comparisons with a NatWest bond
issue for Hammerson, the UK property company, earlier in the year, which had
been made shortly before the company's credit rating had been cut.
'That caused a bit of a row and raised questions about how well NatWest had
done their due diligence,' said one banker.
NatWest said yesterday: 'We felt that in the interests of investors, it was
the right thing to have done.'
It added that a 'substantial' proportion of the bonds had been sold.
The rash of underwritten issues to be pulled since the middle of last week -
more than most bankers can remember in the past six years put together - has
thrown into question the value of underwriting, and the circumstances in
which bond issues should properly be abandoned.
Most bankers agree, though, that it is not in a borrower's interests to
proceed with an issue which will flop.
Meanwhile, against the background of turbulence in the European government
bond markets, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch ventured to launch a Dollars
2bn global offering for the province of Ontario - a move that puzzled many
bankers.
'It was sprung on the market when something more important was occupying the
minds of investors,' said one bank involved in the deal. 'It has taken the
wind out of Ontario's sails.'
At an indicated 46-48 basis points over US Treasuries, the bonds, to be
priced today, were generally thought to be fairly priced.
While most banks reported little interest, however, the joint lead managers
said that they had managed between them to place more than Dollars 1bn of
the bonds by the end of the day in Europe.
With another day to sell in the Far East (although the Tokyo market will be
shut today for a holiday) and the morning in Europe, the managers said they
were confident the issue would be a success.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Grand Met looks to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan, the British leisure group, yesterday joined the flood of
companies taking advantage of low US interest rates to raise money in the
domestic US bond market as it moved to refinance Dollars 800m of its
short-term debt.
Grand Met issued seven, 12-and 30-year bonds to repay some of the commercial
paper it has issued to launch acquisitions in recent years, including its
takeover of US group Pillsbury in 1989.
Corporate borrowers have benefited from the falling differential between the
rates paid by borrowers and the US government. Last summer, Grand Met
launched 20-year bonds at a spread of more than 90 basis points over US
Treasuries, compared with a spread now of 77 basis points on its 30-year
bonds.
Due to falling US rates, the company had been able to issue longer-dated
bonds at an all-in yield of around 1 percentage point less than a year ago.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Cut greeted with less of a
fanfare than anticipated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER all the waiting, Germany's interest rate cut yesterday was greeted
with less of a fanfare in the country's government bond market than might
have been expected from confirmation that the peak of the interest rate
cycle has been passed.
The Bundesbank's actions yesterday at least killed off fears that rates
would be forced up this autumn. But any further cuts are widely expected to
be long in coming. Yesterday's announcement of a 9.2 per rate at this week's
repurchase agreement (or repo) tender left few observers seeing much room
for money market rates to fall below 9 per cent by the end of the year.
Mr Klaus Baader, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, summed up
the mood. 'They've brought forward a rate cut. But the scenario hasn't
fundamentally changed.'
With the main monetary indicator, M3, still well outside the Bundesbank's
target range, and with inflation still to be brought fully under control,
the German monetary authorities are not expected to abandon their recent
policy stance.
The repo rate, which has been bumping up against the key Lombard rate in
recent months as the Bundesbank has applied the monetary squeeze, will fall
to 30 basis points below the Lombard rate at this week's repo tender, the
authorities said.
That was less than the market had hoped for. From now on the repo rate will
become a more important indicator, as the rate moves in a range between the
Lombard and discount rates, said Ms Alison Cottrell, of Midland Montagu in
London.
The signs that the Bundesbank intends to retain a stringent stance helped to
offset some of the loss of face it suffered in the markets over the hasty
rate cut. Typical of the comments was one from a bond trader in London, who
said: 'We're not used to having a German interest rate cut announced by the
Italian prime minister. It's very worrying.'
However, yesterday's revelation that the German authorities had spent DM26bn
last week alone in intervening in the currency markets - way ahead of market
estimates - helped the rate cut to be passed off as a reaction to extreme
upheaval in financial markets, rather than a response to political pressure.
Yesterday's announcement furthered the flattening of the German yield curve,
which had already begun to lose some of its sharp inversion in response to
clear signs of economic easing. The yield between five and ten-year bonds
fell to around 35 basis points, from 45 basis points at the end of last
week, partly in response to a move by German investors into longer-dated
bonds.
International investors, meanwhile, were reported to have moved heavily into
medium-maturity bonds yesterday.
The rally, however, is expected to be restrained. With the Treuhand
privatisation agency to launch bonds for the first time this week, and
further hefty issuance due from the federal government, the longer end of
the market faces faces considerable supply.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Thais look to their neighbours
as peace breaks out - Investing in China and Indochina is a response to
fears of western protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAI companies, lured by business opportunities in southern China and
Indochina, are increasingly investing abroad in an attempt to boost turnover
and profits.
Fearful of trade protectionism in north America and Europe, they are also
contemplating further investments in the West to safeguard their overseas
markets.
Mr Anand Panyarachun, the Thai prime minister, recently identified the
expansion of Thai investments overseas as one of the most important ways of
ensuring the country's future economic prosperity.
Recognising the emerging role of Thai investments abroad, the Bank of
Thailand, the central bank, began to publish figures on the subject at the
start of this year. They show net flows of Thai equity investment abroad
rising to Bt4.47bn (Dollars 177.38m) in 1991 from only Bt615m in 1988.
Hong Kong's share rose to Bt1.34bn last year from almost nothing three years
earlier, one indication of the growing interest in southern China's boom
being shown by Bangkok's Thai-Chinese business community.
Among the companies increasing their exposure to China are the multinational
Charoen Pokphand or CP group - long established in Hong Kong and China
itself - Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, and property developers such
as the Somprasong group.
CP's varied interests in China include a motorcycle factory, a brewery and a
growing number of animal feed mill plants and chicken farms.
For ethnic Chinese investors in China, political risk is more than offset by
the cheapness of land and labour, profit margins twice as high as those in
Thailand and the huge potential market. 'If we can increase consumption by
one chicken per person per year, we are thinking 1.2bn chickens. That's a
lot,' says Mr Prasertsak Ongwattanakul, the CP group's spokesman in Bangkok.
Bangkok Bank, meanwhile, has announced plans to spend at least Dollars 80m
on a dozen new overseas branches, most of them in China, as part of its
drive to become a regional bank concentrating on cross-border business in
south-east Asia and China.
Bangkok Bank has noticed that its overseas business is growing much faster
in Asia than in the saturated markets of the US and Europe, and it is
targeting its new investments accordingly.
Thai Military Bank is also expanding on the Pacific rim, and is doubling its
share capital to Bt7bn to finance new branches in China, Indochina, Burma
and on the US west coast; Krung Thai Bank is moving into Cambodia, Vietnam
and China; The Bangkok Bank of Commerce, a smaller bank, is planning to open
a branch in China and a subsidiary in Canada.
Mr Prasong Panichpakdee, managing director of Somprasong Land Development,
is typical of the energetic Thai-Chinese businessmen who are now turning
their attention to China. He sees an almost insatiable demand for houses in
southern China and says Guangzhou is 'like Bangkok in China'.
Somprasong has interests in Bt12bn worth of residential property
developments in China, which will form a substantial part of the company's
turnover in the years ahead. Mr Prasong was educated in Hong Kong and has
gone into partnership with a Hong Kong businessman for the Chinese projects.
'For us to move to China is quite easy because of the language, and we all
have the Chinese mentality,' he says at his headquarters overlooking
Bangkok's Chao Phraya river. 'We'll be one of the early people to move from
Thailand into China, and we think we'll perform very well.'
Mr Prasong is less enthusiastic about Vietnam, although his company may
consider investing there in the future. 'I personally feel it's a little too
early to get involved in Vietnam,' he says. 'You have to go somewhere where
there's buying power.'
But following the end of the Cold war and the signing of the 1991 Cambodian
peace accord, many Thai banks, industrial companies and entrepreneurs have
started moving into Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
Hua Thai Manufacturing, a textile company, has two operations in Vietnam,
but businessmen say other Thai companies have been slow to respond to
opportunities in Vietnam and have lost out to their rivals from Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.
Labour in Indochina is cheap and public awareness of the need to preserve
the environment is lower than in increasingly prosperous south-east Asian
countries such as Malaysia and Thailand; this is drawing investment in pulp
and paper projects, cement plants, asbestos factories and prawn farms into
Indochina.
Another deciding factor in Thai investments abroad is the fear that exports
to world markets will be restricted by protectionism in the European
Community and the new North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta),
comprising the US, Canada and Mexico.
In 1989, Thailand's Unicord, a tuna processor, bought the canned tuna
company Bumble Bee Seafoods of San Diego for Dollars 269m. More recently
Siam Cement, in a joint venture with Finfloor of Italy, has invested in a
new ceramic tile factory in Tennessee. Several Thai companies, anxious to
gain a foothold in Nafta, are now considering investing in Mexico.
Some stockbrokers in Bangkok believe that Thai companies are merely dabbling
in overseas investments or copying - perhaps too late - Hong Kong's
excitement about southern China. Others say Thai companies' foreign
investments will continue to grow.
'In China it's still fairly new, and with the exception of CP it's still
fairly seat-of-the-pants,' says one broker. 'But companies like Bangkok
Bank, CP and Siam Cement have quite simply outgrown Thailand, so it's time
to start looking offshore.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Write-downs may force Foster's
to launch ADollars 1bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S, the Australian-based international brewing group, is today
expected to reveal asset write-downs of between ADollars 600m and ADollars
1bn (Dollars 431.6m-Dollars 719.4m), forcing it to raise up to ADollars 1bn
with a share issue.
The group was due yesterday to report its results for the year to June.
Postponement of the figures is believed to have been caused by last-minute
delays in underwriting arrangements for the share issue.
Meanwhile, Mr John Elliott, the former chairman and chief executive of
Foster's, yesterday announced his resignation from the company's board.
In an anti-climactic announcement - considering Mr Elliott's status as one
of Australia's best-known businessmen - Mr Nobby Clark, Foster's current
chairman, said Mr Elliott had made a 'significant contribution' to the
company.
The resignation has been seen as inevitable since early June, when Broken
Hill Proprietary (BHP), the Australian resources group, appointed receivers
to Mr Elliott's private company, International Brewing Investments (IBI), in
which BHP has a significant stake. IBI, in turn, holds a near-controlling 38
per cent stake in Foster's.
BHP is expected to support the share issue, but the attitude of Asahi, the
Japanese brewer which holds 19.9 per cent of Foster's shares, is less
certain.
Since June, a banking syndicate has appointed its own receivers to IBI, and
BHP has made a bid valued at ADollars 2.39 a share for IBI's stake in
Foster's. These events have demonstrably removed Mr Elliott's influence over
Foster's shares, and thus the rationale for him to sit on the board.
Announcing Mr Elliott's resignation yesterday, the Foster's board also
announced that Mr Ken Biggins, another IBI representative on the Foster's
board, would retire, but no statement was made about the future of another
of Mr Elliott's 'associates' at Foster's, Mr Geoffrey Lord.
Mr Elliott has influenced the group that is now Foster's since the early
1970s, when he began the transformation of what was then a small Melbourne
jam maker.
Through a series of audacious takeovers, he fashioned the Elders group, then
Australia's largest agribusiness company, and the Carlton &amp; United Brewing
operation, into the conglomerate that is now the world's fourth largest
brewer.
But the seeds of yesterday's exit were sown in 1989 when Mr Elliott tried to
take control of Foster's through a privately-owned vehicle. The debt
required proved unserviceable and IBI's problems have kept Foster's in
crisis ever since.
Mr Elliott's power base at Foster's has been severely diminished since 1990
when, amid concern over the company's future, he stood aside as chairman and
chief executive.
Mr Elliott retains some rural interests, mainly in Victoria, and has a
high-profile position as president of the Carlton Football Club, one of the
most successful clubs in the Victoria-based Australian Football League.
Foster's shares rose 11 cents from a near low point for the year to ADollars
1.59 on Australian stock exchanges yesterday following news of Mr Elliott's
exit.
News Corporation shares fell 78 cents to ADollars 22.54 on Australian stock
exchanges following Friday night's announcement in New York of a USDollars
1.7bn combined international debt and equity issue.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hoogovens to cut 15% of jobs at
steel plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOOGOVENS, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, is to shed more than 15 per
cent of the workforce at its main steel production site in the Netherlands
as part of a Fl 300m (Dollars 182m) cost-cutting programme to return the
company to profitability in 1993.
The measures would produce 'several hundred million guilders' of
extraordinary charges in Hoogovens's 1992 accounts but should bring about a
return to profitability next year, even if the company faces the poor market
conditions that helped tip its results into the red so far in 1992, the
company said.
By the end of next year, Hoogovens expected to have cut 2,300 jobs at its
plant in Ijmuiden on the Dutch North Sea coast, reducing the integrated
steel plant's overall workforce to 11,500 people.
The job cuts would be concentrated in non-production departments. The
Hoogovens group employed a total of 26,875 people in 1991.
Approximately 1,000 of the job losses will represent compulsory
redundancies, the first in Hoogovens's 74-year history. Yesterday's
announcement comes on top of an existing streamlining operation aimed at
cutting 2,500 jobs through natural wastage between 1990 and 1995.
Hoogovens, the seventh-largest steel producer in Europe, blamed the latest
measures on the drop in prices for steel products, which it attributed to
the low dollar, increased steel capacity in western Europe, higher imports
from eastern Europe and indirect government aid to competitor steel works in
other parts of Europe. Sales of eastern European steel in western Europe are
often the result of dumping prices, it said.
Hoogovens posted a Fl 49m net loss in the 1992 first half and has predicted
that results in the second half would be considerably lower than they were
in the first six months of the year.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: USAF contract will boost Zenith
Data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the largest computer contracts ever awarded by the US federal
government has been won by Zenith Data Systems (ZDS), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Groupe Bull, France's largest computer manufacturer.
The contract, for administrative computer systems, is known as 'Desktop 4'
and involves the supply of up to 300,000 personal computers worth
potentially Dollars 740m over three years.
The award should prove a substantial boost to the fortunes of Zenith and its
parent. Bull has had several years of losses because of falling prices,
narrowing profit margins and stagnant sales.
The 'Desktop' contracts are awarded by the US Air Force. Zenith was awarded
Desktops 1 and 2 between 1983 and 1989 when it was the computer arm of the
US-owned Zenith Electronics. It failed to win Desktop 3 in 1990 after its
acquisition by Groupe Bull, sparking fears that the US government was
unwilling to place large orders with foreign-owned suppliers.
Mr Enrico Pesatori, Zenith chief executive, said he was relieved and
surprised that ZDS had been given the whole contract; awards of that size
were usually split between several suppliers. He said the award was
significant because:
It would boost ZDS revenues and provide substantial extra volume, enabling
the company to offer keener prices.
It was a strong endorsement of the quality of the company's products.
Earlier this year ZDS completely revamped its product line, announcing some
40 new models.
It indicated that foreign ownership was no longer a barrier to the award of
big contracts.
Sources close to the deal say that although the ZDS price was not the
lowest, the air force had been impressed with the quality and reliability of
the systems supplied during Desktop 1 and 2. In particular, the company
supplied at short notice thousands of systems for military use during Desert
Storm in Iraq.
ZDS' success will be a big relief to Bull, which is relying on the
Chicago-based manufacturer for growth as the market for traditional
mainframe and mini computers slackens. It expects ZDS to provide 40 per cent
of revenues by 1994. Companies in the fiercely competitive personal computer
industry are now critically dependant on large product volumes, which
enables them to work on lower margins and offer lower prices.
Earlier this year Bull announced a tie-up with International Business
Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, involving the
manufacture and supply of 150,000 portable computers annually. It is
understood that Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, has already visited Bull's Mr
Bernard Pache, Bull's newly appointed chief, to cement the relationship.
Mr Pache, formerly head of the French coal board, was controversially
appointed earlier this year when the French government decided against
reappointing Mr Francis Lorentz, architect of Bull's transformation plan. Mr
Pache has already won a reputation for openness and approachability. 'It is
a case of so far, so good,' said one senior Bull executive.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Buoyant start for Italian
futures market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY's government bond futures market, the Mercato Italiano dei Futures
(Mif), inaugurated last Friday, could not have got off to a more dramatic
start following Sunday's devaluation of the lira.
After a successful first day's trading, when volume reached almost 10,000
contracts, yesterday proved to be just as buoyant. Turnover reached 10,900
against a background of wild gyrations in the cash market as dealers
digested the implications of the EMS realignment.
As expected, cash market yields dropped. The gross yield on the most
actively traded 10-year bond fell to 13.7 per cent from 14.34 per cent on
Friday. Meanwhile, rates for securities repurchase agreements be-tween the
Bank of Italy and commercial banks fell to 16.06 per cent from the level of
20.81 per cent reached last Tuesday.
Mif's opening day was widely viewed as a success. With systems working well,
the market traded more than half as many 10-year Italian bond futures
contracts as on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe).
Moreover, the average size so far of the Milan contract, at L250m, compares
with L200m on Liffe. Competition between the two markets is likely to be
tough. Liffe has created a family of lira products, including options on
bond futures and futures on 90-day Eurolira deposits.
While Liffe, with its wide variety of products, will continue to appeal to
international banks and fund managers wanting to play sophisticated hedging
and arbitrage strategies, the Mif looks set to develop a strong following
among domestic banks.
Only two of the 138 participants in the new market are not Italian. Morgan
Stanley is acting as a local, while JP Morgan in Milan has broker status.
While the new market has acquitted itself well so far, dealers warn that it
is early days yet. 'We hope that some of the pressure on the lira and the
Italian market have now been decoupled from the French referendum,' says Mr
Riccardo Barbieri, chief economist at JP Morgan in Milan. 'The lira should
now to some extent be shielded from these pressures.'
However, with the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty taking place on
Sunday, this week could still offer a bumpy ride for the infant Mif.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: First Chicago to make Dollars
625m special provision
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST Chicago, the large Chicago-based banking company, is to take a Dollars
625m special provision under a plan to reduce its exposure to the troubled
US commercial property market through the sale of some Dollars 2.1bn of its
portfolio.
Mr Richard Thomas, chairman, said it was cutting its assets because 'we have
looked closely at the US commercial property market and see no recovery in
the near term.'
First Chicago, the 10th largest bank holding company in the US and the
parent of First National Bank of Chicago, has been increasingly focusing on
serving the retail and middle commercial markets and has been disposing of
assets which do not fit this strategy.
The commercial property move had been expected, but details helped push
First Chicago shares Dollars 2 3/8 higher yesterday to close at Dollars 33
on the New York Stock Exchange.
The bank also said it would be adopting fair value accounting for its
Dollars 1.1bn venture capital portfolio, with a cumulative pre-tax
appreciation conservatively estimated at Dollars 300m.
In commercial property, the bank will segregate Dollars 2.1bn of its lowest
rated assets into a separate 'held for sale' category and try to dispose of
them quickly.
The pool includes Dollars 700m of non-performing property and Dollars 1.4bn
of performing property loans. In addition to the Dollars 625m provision, to
be taken in the third quarter, the bank will allocate Dollars 150m of
existing reserves to the 'held for sale' pool.
The bank said that after yesterday's action the carrying value of the pool
was about 54 per cent of contractual exposure. Before the special reserve,
write-downs and existing reserves for the portfolio totalled 20 per cent of
contractual exposure.

PLN, Indonesia's state-owned electricity utility, is to raise Rp300bn
(Dollars 148m) on the local capital market, the first time the company has
turned to the private sector for finance.
The five-year, floating rate bonds, expected to be issued by the end of the
month, will carry values ranging from Rp100,000 to Rp100m each. The interest
rate for the first six months will be 19.5 per cent, about 100 basis points
above average bank deposit rates. The rate will then be set at 95 basis
points with interest payments every three months.
Indonesia requires about Dollars 30bn of investment in the power sector
before the end of the decade if it is to keep pace with demand. Much of the
funding is expected to be on concessional terms from the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank.
The decision to raise finance domestically has been been prompted by the
government's concern at Indonesia's international debt estimated at Dollars
80bn, PLN officials say.

UNIVA, Canada's second biggest food distributor - formerly called Provigo -
continued to feel the impact of price wars, higher franchise costs and flat
consumer demand in the second quarter ended August 8.
Before special items, net profits fell 82 per cent to CDollars 3.8m
(USDollars 3.2m) from the same quarter in 1991, on near steady sales of
CDollars 2.1bn.
The results reflected special gains on asset disposals, partly offset by
restructuring charges.
After these items, earnings per share came to 21 cents, compared with 24
cents.
First-half net profits amounted to CDollars 24.5m, or 26 cents a share, down
27 per cent from CDollars 33.7m, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
were little changed at CDollars 3.6bn. Central Capital, a troubled financial
services group placed under court supervision on June 15, will be 90 per
cent controlled by creditors through a new holding company when
restructuring of the group is completed.
The remaining 10 per cent will be held by preferred and common shareholders,
including Mr Leonard Ellen and his associates, who previously had 60 per
cent control.

MAYTAG, one of the five large US home appliance manufacturers and owner of
the Hoover brand in Europe, said yesterday that it was forming a 'business
alliance' with Germany's Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, Europe's second-largest
household appliance group after the Swedish Electrolux group.
The two companies said the aim was to explore possibilities for marketing
each other's products. They would also examine opportunities for combining
customer service activities; for sourcing of components and materials; and
research and development work.
However, although a 'joint senior executive committee' will draw up
agreements, no ownership tie - via the purchase of shares - is expected.
The move is the latest in a series of alliances and acquisitions struck
between US and European domestic appliance manufacturers, as the industry
consolidates. Whirlpool, the biggest manufacturer of home appliances in the
US, recently took over Philips's domestic appliance business, based in
Holland; General Electric of the US linked in a joint venture with its UK
namesake; Maytag itself acquired the Hoover business four years ago.
Since 1988, however, Maytag has encountered problems in Europe, incurring a
Dollars 22.9m operating loss there in 1990, and a reduced Dollars 865,000
deficit last year on sales of about Dollars 500m. Last month, the US
manufacturer - which ranks fourth in its home market after Whirlpool,
General Electric and Electrolux - announced it was taking a Dollars 95m
charge against profits, mainly to cover a 'downsizing' of its European
operations.
Maytag's turnover worldwide in 1991 was Dollars 2.97bn, and net profits,
Dollars 79m. Its shares closed in New York yesterday up Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 14 3/4.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Partners reap the fruits of
reconciliation - The uneasy marriage that created Europe's largest packaging
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The brief history of CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging company,
has always been presented in terms of matrimonial analogies.
So it was three years ago when, after a brief flirtation, a marriage was
announced between the packaging interests of Metal Box of the UK and Carnaud
of France creating the biggest packaging company in Europe.
The doting parents claimed it was the fashion to get hitched in the
rapidly-unifying European market place and held out great promise for the
merger. But, sadly, it was not long before the two partners indulged in a
series of tiffs culminating in last November's departure of Mr Jean-Marie
Descarpentries, the chief executive, amid much national acrimony.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, a neutral German-American reared in the Procter &amp; Gamble
marketing school, was called upon to become chief executive. And less than a
year into his job, the disarmingly open Mr Hintz appears to be making sense
of the alliance having encouraged the two sides to make up.
The early fruits of the reconciliation became apparent last week when
CarnaudMetalbox, initially known as CMB Packaging, posted a reassuring 9 per
cent increase in interim net earnings to FFr549m (Dollars 115m) with
operating margins widening from 9.1 per cent to 9.8 per cent.
Mr Hintz argues that, barring unforeseen economic difficulties, the company
will continue its progress this year and finally begin to fulfil its early
dreams.
Mr Philippe Lubineau, analyst at stockbrokers BZW Puget Mahe in Paris,
believes he may be right and has upgraded his profits forecast to FFr1bn for
the full year representing a 17 per cent improvement.
'CarnaudMetalbox has been one of the very few companies providing good news
recently. But you have to pay for it in the price,' he says, observing that
the company stands on a multiple of 14 times next year's forecast earnings -
a 30 per cent premium to the French market.
In spite of the progress that has been made, Mr Hintz argues that further
financial benefits can still be squeezed from the integration process.
'Frankly the company did not work very well when we merged. But the logic of
the merger was absolutely right. Business is globalising faster in reality
than perception,' he says.
Although the media emphasised the national frictions between the two
partners, Mr Hintz argues that greater problems stemmed from organisational
differences. 'On the one hand there was MB which was over-centralised in the
classic British fashion. On the other, was the wild-eyed naively
decentralised Carnaud. The difference in corporate culture was bigger than
that between Frenchmen and Englishmen,' he says.
'This issue has never been fully settled. But there is now a sense in the
organisation that there has to be a better way of doing things than when we
were like the old Carnaud or the old MB,' he adds.
Greater financial benefits should stem from the further rationalisation of
operational systems, he argues, as the disparate Carnaud operations are
brought under central control. 'We have 33 banks in France and have to go
through books of figures on a Friday night with a well-chewed pencil,' Mr
Hintz says exasperatedly.
Quick to demonstrate his impartiality, he also points out deficiencies in
MB's former operations which spent 90 per cent of their research and
development budget on plastics while 90 per cent of their business was still
in metals.
CarnaudMetalbox highlights three strategic imperatives: to strengthen its
European steel business through reaping further economies of scale; to
bolster its position in the beverage cans and plastics markets; and to grow
its health and beauty business, making products such as lipsticks, compacts
and mascara cases - by acquisition, if necessary.
The company believes it has great scope for geographical expansion. Although
western Europe accounts for 85 per cent of sales, CarnaudMetalbox believes
it can increase sales in Turkey, Asia, and particularly eastern Europe.
However, the main worry niggling investors is the long-term uncertainty
concerning its shareholding arrangements with MB-Caradon, the company's
original parents, and the French investment group CGIP, still retaining
their 25.5 per cent stakes.
Analysts suggest it would come as little surprise if CGIP were to increase
its holding while MB-Caradon reduced its exposure confirming the
increasingly Frenchwards tilt in the company's outlook.
Any such move is likely to wait until the grim economic outlook desists. In
the meantime, Mr Hintz will just keep on trying to improve the company's
operational performance.
'I think the packaging industry is in a state of metamorphosis. In
management and technological terms this industry feels to me like the 1970s.
It is going to become a lot more sophisticated. We just have to hunker down
and do the professional thing,' he says.

joint venture

<TEXT>
FOUR of Europe's biggest construction groups are to form a joint venture to
bid for European infrastructure projects, they said yesterday.
It is the latest in a series of cross-border acquisitions and joint ventures
involving European contractors forming strategic alliances before the
removal of EC trade barriers at the end of this year.
The four companies, GTM-Entrepose of France, John Laing of the UK, NCC of
Sweden and Strabag Bau of Germany, will form Societe Europeenne de
Construction, a joint venture company based in Brussels. The four groups
have a combined annual turnover of more than Dollars 11.8bn and employ about
90,000 workers.
Mr John Armitt, joint managing director of John Laing Construction, who will
chair the new company, said individually the companies might find it
difficult to take on some large high-risk road and rail projects planned in
Europe. 'By pooling our resources we will provide a more secure financial
and technical base to bid for infrastructure contracts,' he said.
'This will become even more important with governments increasingly looking
to the private sector to finance and operate some of these developments -
particularly if construction companies promoting these schemes are to be
expected to take an equity stake in the projects.'
Mr Armitt said he hoped the venture would generate at least one Pounds 100m
project within the next 12 months. It would pursue contracts anywhere in the
world but was mainly looking at eastern and western Europe.
It was investigating building and perhaps financing part of the improved
road network for eastern Germany. The company was also examining schemes to
build privately financed toll motorways in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Laing and GTM-Entrepose are already partners for a privately financed Pounds
350m toll bridge being built across the River Severn. Strabag and Laing have
bid jointly for commercial projects in Germany.
The new company would be expected to identify other opportunities for joint
ventures, said Mr Armitt.
Mr Torsten Eriksson, NCC's managing director, said the alliance would allow
the Swedish-based company to become involved in foreign projects, which
would compensate for the downturn of demand in the domestic construction
market.

STENA LINE, the Swedish shipping and ferry group, said it was on course to
make a profit of more than SKr250m (Dollars 48.8m) in 1992, marking a
recovery from last year's loss of SKr302m.
Mr Bo Lerenius, chief executive of Stena Line, said he expected profits
(after net financial items) to exceed SKr250m 'provided the economic
situation does not worsen still further during the autumn'.
Stena Line swung to a loss of SKr302m in 1991 partly due to losses incurred
by Sealink, its UK ferry operations. The group was forced to carry out a
number of cost-cutting measures which included a pay freeze for Sealink
employees in 1992 and the closure of its Folkestone-Boulogne ferry route.
Stena Line said the recovery in profits was due to the combination of the
cost-cutting measures in its international operations and 'the continued
increase in volume so far this year for the entire group'. The number of
passengers travelling on Stena Line ferries has risen by 2 per cent during
the first eight months of this year, and freight volume has increased by 8
per cent.

FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand moves to bolster
solvency of units

<TEXT>
UNI Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian insurer, yesterday announced a
series of measures to restore confidence in the group and strengthen the
solvency of subsidiaries. The group's holding company was last month put
into the hands of state administrators following its inability to repay
NKr3.8bn (Dollars 664m) in short-term debt.
Mr Oeystein Eskeland, chairman of Uni Storebrand New, the group's
recently-formed holding company, said Uni Storebrand New would increase its
stake in Skandia, the Swedish insurer, to 28.3 per cent by paying NKr200
each for 13m Skandia shares from the group's non-life, life and
international subsidiaries, in a deal to strengthen the entities' solvency
ratios.
However, Mr Eskeland said the Skandia stake would be written down according
to its market valuation as of August 31, when eight-month accounts of Uni
Storebrand New were closed. At that time Skandia's shares were traded at
SKr68 each on the Stockholm bourse, which implies the acquisition will be
written down by an estimated NKr3.3bn against eight-month accounts.
Mr Eskeland explained that Uni's holding company would transfer an estimated
NKr360m in assets to the group's life insurance business in a move to
bolster the entity's capital adequacy to 8 per cent.
The group's international business, comprised of reinsurance and direct
insurance, will also be reorganised.
Direct insurance - which handles marine and oil industry business - will
become a separate subsidiary, making it the group's fourth operational unit
alongside life, non-life, and international businesses.
The Oslo bourse yesterday delisted Uni Storebrand's shares until November
14. Uni's shares were suspended on August 24.
Mr Eirik Keiserud, last month appointed by the state as chairman of the old
Uni, which is in talks to hammer out an agreement with the company's
creditors, said that an international brokerage firm would soon be named to
undertake a thorough examination of the group.

FT  15 SEP 92 / White House accused of Iraq loan 'cover-up'
</HEADLINE>

   ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration sought to 'suppress the truth' about US government
knowledge of more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) in illegal loans made to
Iraq by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), an
Atlanta court was told yesterday.
Mr Bobby Lee Cooke, a prominent Georgia lawyer who is representing Mr
Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta branch manager, also began
naming senior BNL executives in Rome who, he alleged, helped to orchestrate
the loans.
BNL has in the past denied that anyone in its Rome headquarters knew about
the Iraqi loans.
Mr Cooke, seeking to transform what was to have been a sentencing hearing
for Mr Drogoul into an impromptu trial, said he would provide evidence in
court to explain how the US government 'from the very onset has tried to
suppress the truth and mislead this court'.
He called the BNL case 'the mother of all cover-ups' and said the position
of the Department of Justice 'denies all logic and Socratic reasoning and,
most importantly, is not the truth'.
In a 55-page sentencing memorandum the Justice Department had accused Mr
Drogoul of being the sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans, more than Dollars
2bn of which went to help President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical
weapons, cluster bomb and ballistic missile projects.
Mr Drogoul admitted his guilt in June and reached a co-operation agreement
with US prosecutors. However, Mr Cooke said he cancelled the agreement as
the government was trying to put words into his client's mouth.
Judge Marvin Shoob, presiding over the BNL case, appears sympathetic to Mr
Cooke's argument. The judge told prosecutors yesterday their theory that Mr
Drogoul orchestrated the entire loan scheme was 'difficult to believe'.
In court yesterday Mr Cooke said he would introduce evidence to show that:
US intelligence officials working for the National Security Agency (NSA)
made regular visits to Mr Drogoul in Atlanta and were briefed on the
BNL-Iraqi loans.
Mr Giacomo Pedde, the former director general of BNL, was among those aware
of the Atlanta loan.
A senior US government official and the Iraqi ambassador met Mr Drogoul in
Washington in the autumn of 1988 and encouraged him to provide Iraq with US
government loan guarantees.
Senior White House and State Department officials interfered in the BNL case
by telephoning prosecutors in Atlanta.
Aides to Judge Shoob said they expected the unusual Atlanta court hearing to
continue all week as the government and Mr Cooke provided evidence and
questioned witnesses.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Angel Chuan must prove strength / Assessing the future for
the soft star of Thailand's anti-military camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLIKE his immediate predecessors, Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat party
leader who expects to become prime minister of Thailand following Sunday's
general election, is neither an army general nor a western-educated
aristocrat.
His father was a teacher and his mother a vegetable seller. 'I am an
ordinary man who came from a rather poor family,' he said recently. 'During
my younger days I had to collect rubber from the trees before going to
school.'
And, unlike some of its rivals, the Democrat party was not formed on the eve
of the election for the convenience of a few influential politicians with
short-term common interests; it was founded 46 years ago and is Thailand's
oldest.
The rise to prominence this week of Mr Chuan and the Democrats is an
important but still tentative change of direction for contemporary Thai
politics.
The Democrats impressed many voters by their cautious handling of the
clashes between the armed forces and pro-democracy demonstrators, which
culminated in the killing of at least 50 protestors in May. They opposed
military interference in politics and business, but attempted to resolve the
dispute in parliament, warning of the dangers of street confrontations.
They were rewarded with the largest bloc of seats in the 360-seat House of
Representatives, increasing the number of their MPs to 79 from the 44 they
won in the previous election and winning several Bangkok seats from the
Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party of Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the fervent
Buddhist who led the street protests.
Just as Bangkok intellectuals have grown suspicious of what they regard as
Mr Chamlong's political posturing, so have Thai entrepreneurs begun to
distrust what they see as his idealistic egalitarianism.
Foreign and local businessimmediately welcomed the probability that Mr Chuan
would head a coalition centred on the parties that opposed the military in
May.
Yesterday, the Stock Exchange of Thailand gave a warm welcome to the
results, with the SET index rising 2 per cent, to reach 817.95 points.
The 54-year-old Mr Chuan, a lawyer by training, lacks economic expertise,
but he has promised to reinforce existing policies aimed at liberalising
trade; improving the competitiveness of Thailand's export industries; and
diverting more resources to neglected regions.
He will attempt to construct a coalition this week, and may choose a private
sector technocrat - the names of several senior bankers are being bandied
about - as finance minister.
Mr Chuan, however, will need to overcome some formidable obstacles. He has
been an elected MP for 23 years, and has held portfolios in nine previous
governments, but his critics say he lacks initiative and has failed to shine
in any of his ministerial posts. One western diplomat described him
yesterday as a 'wimp'.
Mr Chuan acknowledged the accusations in a campaign speech this month when
he said he might be 'too soft and not aggressive', although he declared that
'when it comes to making decisions, I am resolute and strong.' In an earlier
interview with The Nation newspaper, he said: 'Politeness is unfortunately
seen sometimes as a weakness.'
The Democrat party itself, although strengthened by popular and energetic
activists such as Mr Apisit Vejjajiva, the Bangkok MP, is as prone to splits
as other Thai parties and has never been a clear-cut success in government.
Even more worrying for advocates of stable government will be the fragility
of any coalition the Democrats are likely to create in their negotiations
this week.
The loose alliance of the four so-called 'angel parties', which opposed the
military in May - the Democrats, Palang Dharma, the New Aspiration party and
Solidarity - together has only 185 seats, or a majority of five, and the NAP
is regarded as a weak link in the group.
Mr Chuan is likely to bring in at least one smaller party, and possibly the
Chart Pattana (National Development) party of Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, the
former prime minister overthrown by the armed forces in the February 1991
coup d'etat.
The reality is that the Democrats made many of their gains at the expense of
their alliance partners, while Chart Thai (Thai Nation), a 'devil party'
which supported the army, won 77 seats.
The level of violence and vote-buying in the election campaign, in keeping
with Thai tradition, also suggests that it will be some time before
politicians such as Mr Chuan can safely claim to have consigned corruption
and military coups to the history books.

FT  15 SEP 92 / US spending row risks new agency shutdowns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US government agencies are once again threatened with shutdown as President
George Bush and Congress prepare for a confrontation over Washington's most
sensitive issue - spending.
Mr Bush promised his cheering supporters at last month's Republican
convention that he would veto any spending bills passed by Congress that
went above his budget requests.
At least five, and possibly as many as seven, of the 13 appropriations bills
which allot money to government agencies appear to be heading for a
presidential veto, but Democratic leaders in Congress say they are in no
mood to compromise.
The government cannot continue to spend money after the new fiscal year
begins on October 1 unless new appropriations legislation is passed. Several
times in the 1980s, federal agencies had to send staff home for a few hours
in symbolic confrontations between the White House and Congress. But usually
a shutdown has been avoided by an omnibus bill to continue funding of
agencies at current levels.
The Democrats' congressional leadership says it has no interest in resorting
to this kind of stop-gap bill.
The president's veto strategy is designed to highlight his battle with
Congress, and paint the Democratic-controlled legislature as relentless
spendthrifts.
The strategy is risky, however. Although several individual appropriations
bills would spend more than Mr Bush asked for in his January budget request,
others underbid him significantly.
Bills covering the labour, health and human services, treasury,
transportation and interior departments appear to exceed the president's
budget requests, and the inclusion of funding for abortion counselling makes
some other bills look like veto-bait.
But bills covering defence, foreign aid and space come in well under budget
and Congress has even cut its own operating budget below the president's
request. Overall, the 13 appropriations bills would spend over Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.3bn) less than Mr Bush asked for. And on all the biggest battles
to cut government outlays - the space station, the super-collider, the
Strategic Defence Initiative - the administration has been on the side of
increased spending.
The only appropriations bill to pass Congress before the Republican
convention, covering agriculture, exceeded the budget request but Mr Bush
signed it with no visible qualms.
The Office of Management and Budget is referring questions on the veto
threat to the Bush-Quayle campaign headquarters.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Indian liberalisation defended
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister and chief architect of a
far-reaching economic liberalisation plan, yesterday rejected suggestions
that his programme is running out of steam.
'There is no basis in such complaints. We have done all that we promised,'
said Mr Singh in an interview with the Financial Times. He was speaking on
the eve of his departure on a visit to the UK and the US, during which he
will take part in the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
Mr Singh, a Harvard-trained economist and former bureaucrat, won widespread
praise for guiding India out of a balance-of-payments crisis and into a
World Bank-approved programme of radical reforms last year, including the
easing of decades-old government economic controls and the partial floating
of the rupee.
But delays in implementing important measures, such as cutting the
government's deficit, has exposed Mr Singh to growing criticism. The
government has also run into trouble over the alleged involvement of some
junior ministers in the Bombay stock market scandal.
Only last week, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, warned Mr Singh
and his ministers of the risk of the reforms getting bogged down. 'There is
still a hiatus between policy formulation and implementation at the ground
level,' the bank said in a report. He said implementation took time because
decision-making involved consulting many different interests.
Mr Singh said the economy was progressing along lines agreed with the World
Bank and IMF, with growth likely to be in the 3-4 per cent range in real
terms in the financial year which started in March 1992, compared with 2-2.5
per cent last year.
He was disappointed that a sharp devaluation in the rupee since last year
had not as yet produced a significant increase in exports. Nevertheless, Mr
Singh said, export growth shortfalls had been matched by improvements in
other elements in the current account, such as a sharp decline in gold
smuggling.
He welcomed the increase in planned foreign investment which his reforms
have stimulated. The total of Dollars 1.4bn in the year to March, far
exceeded the previous annual level of Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m.
India opened its stock markets to approved foreign institutional investors
(FIIs) yesterday, setting out rules under which they would operate, the
Finance Ministry announced, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
Approved FIIs will be able to buy up to 24 per cent of shares in an Indian
company and repatriate profits net of concessional tax rates with no lock-in
period. Investors will pay a flat rate of 20 per cent on dividend and
interest income and a flat 10 per cent capital gains on shares held for more
than one year.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Peru parades captured rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLABBY, middle-aged and bespectacled, wearing an identification tag like a
common criminal, the leader of Peru's feared Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)
guerrillas has been paraded before the Peruvian people on television in a
bid to destroy the aura that has built up around him during 13 years in
hiding.
President Alberto Fujimori personally presented the television images of
Latin America's most wanted and feared insurgent.
Mr Abimael Guzman Reynoso - alias 'Presidente Gonzalo' - had been captured
in a counter-terrorist police raid on a Lima suburban house 24 hours
earlier. His detention, along with several other high-ranking Sendero
officials, is a big success for the Fujimori government, and one of the few
bits of good news for Peru since the April 5 institutional coup when Mr
Fujimori dissolved Congress and suspended the constitution.
Mr Guzman's capture allowed the Peruvian president to justify his tough and
much-criticised counter-insurgency policy and to repeat his determination to
defeat Peru's terrorist groups before 1995, when his term of office
officially ends.
Popular mythology had attributed Mr Guzman with almost magical powers to
move around Peru unseen. A home-made video, shot more than three years ago,
had provided the only previous dent in the guerrilla leader's image - it
showed him inebriated, carousing with sycophantic followers and dancing to
the music of Zorba the Greek. In Sunday's broadcast he appeared fumbling
with his trouser buttons after being told to take off his shirt, apparently
meekly obeying police instructions.
'This is not the revolutionary hero fabricated by myth,' scoffed Mr Fujimori
in his Sunday night address. 'What we are seeing here is a monster.' He
dubbed Mr Guzman 'sinister, malevolent. . . a diabolic genius. . . the
henchman of the drugs trade'.
The president accused Sendero of accumulating vast funds through the cocaine
trade with which to finance 'Sendero ambassadors' in a number of European
countries, including Britain, France, Belgium, Spain and Sweden. And he
charged Mr Guzman with 'genocide', citing massacres in shanty-towns and
rural communities. 'He is just as much a war criminal as the second world
war fascists,' Mr Fujimori said.
Sendero's leader, like other Peruvians now under arrest on charges of
terrorism, will face summary trial by military tribunal. Modifications to
the penal code in the wake of Sendero's car-bomb attacks in July mean
terrorists are now considered 'traitors to the fatherland'.
Although the death penalty for terrorism has wide popular support, it has
not yet been enshrined in government policy. At a news conference yesterday,
however, Mr Fujimori said: 'The law establishes at this time that the
maximum penalty in this case is life imprisonment. But we must also listen
to what the public demands.' When pressed, he said his personal opinion was
that Mr Guzman deserved the death penalty and that he 'would study' its
application.
The capture of their leader, widely recognised as a brilliant military
strategist, is a heavy blow for Sendero. But the organisation, according to
Mr Enrique Bernales, former president of the Peruvian Senate commission on
violence, is 'a Maoist, clandestine party with a quasi-military structure.
They must already be activating contingency plans of tactical retreat and
reconstruction'.
The armed forces and police are braced for a violent response from the
guerrillas. Security has been stepped up in the capital.
An encouraging aspect of Mr Guzman's capture is that it seems, however
briefly, to have created some desire for unity in a nation still deeply
divided by racial, class and income differences. Some prominent politicians
previously hostile to Mr Fujimori's de facto regime are now calling for
'national reconciliation'.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Candidates take tactical fight to timber heartland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton both appeared in Oregon
yesterday in an attempt to wrest some tactical advantage from a corner of
the country riven by the debate over economic development versus the
environment.
Mr Bush was expected to use his visit to portray the Clinton-Gore
presidential ticket as being in the pocket of ecological extremists. As a
prelude last week he issued a federal edict making possible the logging of
more dead timber.
While the president tours the small towns at the heart of the timber
industry, Mr Clinton's appearances are concentrated more on urban areas,
where his message on the need to combat general economic deprivation is
likely to be better received.
He has also promised to mediate in the long-running dispute between the
industry and environmentalists, at its most bitter in the controversy over
preservation of the Northern Spotted Owl.
But the candidates' twin focus on the west coast in the first part of this
week illustrates a broader tactical purpose. For Mr Clinton it is to
consolidate his strong position in the region, while for Mr Bush it is to
tie his opponent down in a part of the country which is probably going to
vote for the Democrats in any case.
State polls show Mr Clinton ahead by wide margins in California, Oregon and
Washington. Indeed, his lead in national polls - by 53-38 per cent in the
latest Newsweek survey - in good part reflects his edge in California and
New York, the biggest states.
However, some analysts suggest this means Mr Clinton's potential vote in
November is 'inefficiently' allocated and implies that the race in great
swathes of the country, especially the industrial midwest and some of the
border southern states, are closer than might appear to be the case.
Both campaigns concede that these states, along with Florida and Texas, are
more critical battlegrounds than the far west. But it would be hard for Mr
Bush to write off California, in particular.
According to the Los Angeles Times newspaper, former president Richard
Nixon, a Californian himself, is urging Mr Bush to forget about the state,
concentrate on the midwest, and stop associating with extreme conservatives.
Mr Nixon, the newspaper reported, thinks the president's chances of
re-election are 'about 30 per cent'.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to brief China on plans for conducting Hong Kong's 1995 elections
before Mr Chris Patten unveils them next month in his first key policy
speech as governor.
Mr Patten is due in London today to seek the personal endorsement of Mr John
Major, the British prime minister, for his programme for the last five years
of British rule in Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
He will also give a preview to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who
will brief Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, when they meet in New York
at the United Nations General Assembly next week.
Mr Patten will make public his programme for Hong Kong's constitutional and
social development when he opens the Legislative Council session on October
7. He will visit Beijing soon afterwards.
China will scrutinise with particular anxiety the proposals for the 1995
elections, which will be decisive for Hong Kong's political stability in the
run-up to and beyond 1997.
Mr Patten is likely to tell the Chinese that they must accept a substantial
degree of democracy in Hong Kong if they want a successful takeover of the
colony.
He is expected to stand firm against pressure to form a cabinet composed of
representatives from the legislature.
He is expected to encourage the development of a more independent and
effective legislature by which the government would need to win its consent
for its legislation but would not depend on a parliamentary majority.
This could mean an increase in the number of democratically elected members
above the 20 already agreed, or - if China prefers - a broader base for the
so-called 'functional constituencies', representing mostly professional and
business interest groups, which choose 30 members. The governor has the
power to make these constituencies more representative of the population at
large.
He also has discretion to decide the electoral system for the direct
elections. The liberals favour first-past-the-post, while China and its
conservative supporters in Hong Kong prefer a proportional system.
Mr Patten is expected to announce government spending proposals for housing,
education, the environment and other social policies as well as far-reaching
constitutional reforms which he hopes will lay the foundation for a smooth
transition to Chinese sovereignty in mid-1997.
Today, Mr Patten will also brief the UK government on his proposals for
solving the impasse with China about funding Hong Kong's new airport. This
will be presented to China's representatives at a meeting in Hong Kong
tomorrow

FT  15 SEP 92 / Arabs back UAE in island row with Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN yesterday responded angrily to a claim by Arab League foreign ministers
that its presence on the disputed island of Abu Musa threatened peace in the
region, Our Middle East Staff reports.
Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said after a meeting of the
21-member Arab League that Iran's continued presence on the island in the
Gulf was a 'dangerous development' and urged Iran to review its position
there.
But Mr Morteza Sarmadi, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said the Arab
stance was irresponsible.
The Abu Musa dispute flared last month when Iran, which maintains a garrison
on the island and shares its oil revenues with Sharjah, one of the UAE's
seven emirates, turned back a boatload of foreigners, most employed by the
UAE.
Abu Musa and two nearby islands, the Greater and Lesser Tumbs, have been in
Iranian hands since 1971 but are claimed by Ras al-Khaimah, another of the
UAE's constituent emirates.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Schroder Ventures apologises to CINVen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHRODER Ventures yesterday made a highly unusual public apology to a
competitor, CINVen, the venture capital arm of the Coal Board's in-house
fund manager.
The venture capital arm of Schroders Plc in a press statement admitted that
one of its executives had circulated a document saying that CINVen managers
'received exceptional and unfair returns'.
Schroder Ventures said yesterday it 'unreservedly repudiates this document
which contains major errors of fact'. It said the document was the source of
press articles criticising the way CINVen managers are paid. CINVen also
manages the venture capital portion of the British Rail and Barclays Bank
pension funds.
The move comes amid rising competition between fund managers following the
sharp shrinkage of new investment in venture capital. An agreement between
Schroders and CINVen meant neither party would make any comment beyond a
limited press statement. However, CINVen had made it clear it would take
legal action if a public apology were not forthcoming.
An article in the Financial Times on August 27, which CINVen said was 'fair
and accurate', pointed out that CINVen fund managers are able to profit from
a co-investment scheme which allows them to purchase a portion of the 'sweet
equity' used to finance management buy-outs without having to invest in the
less risky but lower-yielding loan stock.
However, the Schroder document contained further allegations, not printed by
the Financial Times, which were yesterday withdrawn.
Sweet equity is the highest-risk but potentially most profitable security
issued in connection with venture capital.
The practice of allowing managers to co-invest in sweet equity is not
uncommon in the fund management industry but many investors' advisers frown
on the practice. However, CINVen's structure does not allow it to offer the
most common alternative, known as carried interest, in which managers earn
roughly 20 per cent of all the venture pool's profits. This can be more
lucrative than co-investment schemes limited to sweet equity.
Remuneration structures in the venture capital industry have recently been
under pressure from investors who argue that some fund managers rewards are
not tied closely enough to performance or the skills to do the job. Several
of the latest venture capital pooled funds have had to promise higher
returns to investors before fund managers could share in the profits.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Stakes are raised in the card game / Analysis of two moves
into a saturated market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US credit card market is gearing itself for a season of stiff
competition, spurred by the arrival over the past two weeks of two non-bank
contenders with potentially enormous financial and marketing clout.
General Motors, the leading US carmaker, and General Electric Capital, the
conglomerate's financial services arm, have jumped into the credit card
market with specially tailored MasterCards aimed at stimulating their
product sales and competing with bank issuers of plastic cards.
Credit card industry analysts say the market is taking seriously the
challenge from companies such as GM and GE, respectively the first and fifth
ranking Fortune 500 US corporations. However, the decision to join a fairly
saturated national market with already more than 1bn cards in circulation is
a curious move, especially in light of the US economy.
Given the crisis of American consumer confidence - caused partly by
recession and partly by the indebtedness of many individuals - it would seem
at first glance there has rarely been a worse time for entrants in the
crowded and competitive US credit card market.
The reason is summed up by Mr David Robertson, president of The Nilson
Report, a leading credit card industry newsletter: 'What you have in a
nutshell is the realisation that the market in the US is saturated. There
aren't that many new customers coming in who are creditworthy. Issuers
therefore have to identify what will be successful in marketing, what will
make consumers change cards. The answer is the offering of value by way of
incentives, discounts and partnerships.'
The GE Rewards card, launched two weeks ago, offers discounts on GE
appliance purchases and rebates from 24 retailers, airlines, hotel chains
and other corporate partners. But it comes with a Dollars 25 (Pounds 12.60)
annual fee and an interest rate a percentage point higher than the national
average of 17.5 per cent.
The GM Card is potentially more attractive to the middle market because it
carries no fee and is priced with an adjustable interest rate of 10.4
percentage points above the prime, which means the present rate is 16.4 per
cent. Like the GE card there are also airline and hotel partners.
The GM card's most important feature, however, is that it offers consumers a
5 per cent rebate on purchases - for use against the purchase of a new GM
car or truck - that could total Dollars 3,500 over seven years. 'The credit
card we are unveiling,' said Mr Ron Zebeck, GM's head of card operations,
'is designed to put people into new GM vehicles.'
Nor is GM sparing any cost. It is mailing to some 30m consumers pre-approved
card applications and is expected to spend tens of millions of dollars on
advertising.
Mr Robertson says GM may generate up to 2m card accounts over the next 18
months, while GE, which already has a card business with Dollars 2.4bn of
receivables through its outstanding Visa and MasterCard base, should get
about 500,000 accounts.
These are big numbers, but then so is the number of cards achieved by
another non-bank - American Telephone &amp; Telegraph - since launching its
Universal credit card in March 1990: AT&amp;T now has 14m cardholders, with
Dollars 4.7bn of receivables outstanding.
So what is behind the new surge in non-bank credit cards? One answer is
that, saturated or not, the US credit card market remains profitable. The
average return on assets on credit card operations is 2 per cent to 3 per
cent, better than the average 1 per cent return most banks achieve on their
primary lending business. Another question raised by the arrival of groups
such as AT&amp;T, GM and GE is the impact on bank issuers.
Mr Don McWhorter, president of Banc One, the Ohio-based bank with several
million card-holders around the US, says more competitors will mean
increasing consolidation of the market. Marginal players will lose out and
the biggest issuers will do best.
As for the GM and GE cards, Mr McWhorter admits they could garner market
share: 'Clearly, when somebody like GM or GE decides they want to get into
the business, they will have an impact because of their size. We ourselves
had many discussions with General Motors and we opted not to do the card
with them.'
At Salomon Brothers, Ms Diane Glossman, a vice-president and banking
analyst, forecasts lower fees and lower interest rates in future, leading to
a narrowing of margins for issuers.
At American Express, whose Optima credit card division has struggled with
heavy losses over the past year, Mr Ken Chenault, president of the consumer
card business, says GM-style cards will cause cost-conscious customers to
switch away from bank issuers.
The bottom line comes from Nilson's Mr Robertson: 'The more cards you dump
into the market the more you affect the usage of existing cards. So the
existing players will have to add new incentives to their cards. The name of
the game will be to add bells and whistles to cards.'
It is not clear, however, how much the US consumer will be motivated by the
incentives, rebates and discounts. If nothing else, the GM and GE cards will
offer an acid test of the degree to which Americans are prepared to switch
in search of value.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Mellon buys The Boston Co for Dollars 1.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street securities firm owned by American
Express, is selling The Boston Company, a private banking and investment
services company, to Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank for Dollars 1.45bn (Pounds
730m).
Yesterday's announcement triggered fresh speculation on Wall Street that the
disposal might be the prelude to the sale by American Express of Shearson
itself or an offer of its stock to the public. American Express has
repeatedly denied any such plan.
Shearson announced in early August it planned to sell The Boston Company,
which has loans and other assets of around Dollars 9bn and is involved in
mutual fund administration, trust and custody services for institutional
investors, institutional investment management and private banking for
wealthy individuals.
The acquisition expands Mellon's sizeable position in these fields. It will
become a leading US provider of mutual fund administration services.
The deal reinforces Mellon's strategy of focusing on revenues from the
provision of services as much as on lending activities.
The strategy was put in place in the late 1980s after Mellon, suffered
serious loan problems in the property and energy markets.
The Dollars 1.45bn Shearson will get for The Boston Company is higher than
market expectations and underscores the premium prices commanded by fund
management and investment services companies.
Shearson expects to book an after-tax gain of about Dollars 150m from the
sale, which would reduce goodwill around Dollars 100m, increasing tangible
equity Dollars 250m.
The sale will cut Shearson's assets, boosting its equity-to-assets ratio
towards the level analysts say is necessary for American Express to sell the
company or float a tranche of its stock.
Mellon will pay Dollars 1.301bn in cash, Dollars 115m in the bank's common
stock and Dollars 37m in share warrants. It will fund the deal by issuing a
further Dollars 150m in common stock, Dollars 150m in perpetual preferred
stock and Dollars 815m in senior debt.
The bank said it expected to book a one-time after-tax charge of Dollars
112m for consolidation expenses.
Mellon shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to close at Dollars 40 1/4 in New York.
American Express rose Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 22 3/4.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Dalgety profits rise to Pounds 116.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from its consumer foods division helped Dalgety to
increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 110.9m to Pounds 116.8m in the year to
June 30. Dalgety shares rose 10p to 395p.
Mr Maurice Warren, chief executive, said trading conditions were still
tough, though he did not think they were worsening, as some food
manufacturers have reported. He said the group was 'set fair for 1993'.
The group is seeking acquisitions in Europe, but Mr Warren said these were
proving difficult to find at realistic prices.
He said the group had benefited from selling its 'commodity' businesses such
as eggs and meat last year, and backing its branded goods with a 10 per cent
increase in promotional spending to Pounds 36m and rationalisation. Market
share gains had been made in snacks and petfoods.
Group sales rose 8.8 per cent to Pounds 3.98bn, and trading profits were 4.9
per cent higher at Pounds 122.8m. Trading profits from continuing businesses
rose 7.8 per cent to Pounds 121.4m, with Sooner Snacks, acquired in February
for Pounds 43m, contributing Pounds 2.5m, although related interest charges
were more than Pounds 2m.
Interest cost Pounds 9.7m, up from Pounds 8.7m, and pre-tax profits included
Pounds 3.7m of profits on property and business disposals, compared with
Pounds 2.5m a year ago.
The consumer foods division, including Spillers petfoods, Golden Wonder
snacks, Homepride grocery products and produce, increased trading profits
from Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 59.8m.
Food ingredients, which include milling and baking, suffered a fall in
profits from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 21.5m, as overcapacity in the industry
caused pricing problems. A poor quality harvest this autumn increased wheat
prices, though flour prices had yet to follow.
The food distribution division, which supplies McDonald's and other
fast-food chains in North America, increased volumes by 10 per cent. But
extra costs involved in servicing new accounts cut profits from Pounds 12.4m
to Pounds 12m.
Profits from agribusiness, which includes animal feeds, seeds and pig
breeding, increased from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 28.1m.
Net debt fell from Pounds 70m to Pounds 56m, cutting gearing from 18 per
cent to 15 per cent, with Pounds 56m of cash generated from operations.
Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 38.6p, and a final dividend of 12p, up
from 11.35p, is proposed to give a total of 19.5p, a rise of 5.4 per cent.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Inchcape advances 28% as sales grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, yesterday showed resilience
in the face of tough economic conditions in many of its markets by reporting
a 28 per cent increase in interim profits.
Sir David Orr, Inchcape chairman until today when Sir David Plastow takes
over, said the group had benefited from its wide geographical spread, sound
finances and prudent acquisition policy in difficult times.
The acquisition last March of TKM, which controls one of the largest UK
retailing networks, meant that in spite of the gloom in the domestic motor
industry, profits from the division rose 41 per cent.
Group pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 117.1m from Pounds 91.3m on sales up 33
per cent at Pounds 2.33bn in the six months to end-June. Earnings per share
rose 7.4 per cent to 14.6p and the group is to increase its dividend from 5p
to 5.4p.
Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, said that without last December's Pounds
370m rights issue and the TKM acquisition, earnings per share would have
grown 5.5 per cent. The group achieved a 20 per cent sales growth before the
acquisition.
The motor division, which had sales of Pounds 1.54bn, was supported by
strong performance in Asia even though it had to bear the start-up costs of
operations in Korea and Japan. In the UK, Mr Mackay said the group was not
looking for much improvement next year.
UK motor sales account for only 26 per cent of Inchcape's global motor sales
and only 15 per cent of group sales.
Marketing services boosted profits, from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds 32.8m, in
spite of a cyclical downturn in the brewing business in Japan and some
weakness in Thailand.
The black spots in the group performance included shipping, which suffered
from the break-up of the Scandutch consortium hitting profits in Japan and
the US. Profits fell from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 3.7m. Operating profits from
insurance fell from Pounds 16m to Pounds 12m with three quarters of the
decline due to a collapse in the reinsurance market.
Gearing at the half-year was 40 per cent, up from 30 per cent last year
after including borrowings within TKM. However, interest cover increased
from 8.5 times to an underlying 10 times. Lex, Page 20

FT  15 SEP 92 / Core Treasury tasks may be contracted out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S drive to contract out Civil Service operations to the
private sector is closing in on core Treasury functions including
recruitment, training and economic-model building.
The Treasury has said it intends to start market testing - the testing
ground for contracting out - on the TSG (the Treasury Security Guard), the
internal audit, the library and several other areas.
The main controversy surrounds economic-model building, which has an
important input into economic forecasting. The Treasury said yesterday that
outside companies would not have access to sensitive information and that
the modelling function to be market tested was 'a technical matter'.
But critics believe that model-building does have implications for
forecasting that are unavoidably political and market sensitive. Ms
Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of FDA top civil servants' union, said:
'It is extraordinary that the government has chosen to market test areas
that are crucial to what should be politically neutral advice given by civil
servants to government ministers.'
She also said that the government had not made clear whether companies
tendering for the work would have to prove a freedom from political bias.
The Treasury's computerised economic model contains hundreds of variables
that simulate how the economy works. It is central to Treasury forecasts,
published twice a year.
The job of updating the model is currently the work of the Treasury's
80-strong team of economists. But partly because of mistakes in forecasting
the Treasury has been looking at ways of contracting out more development
work on the model.
It has already given contracts to update parts of its model to Strathclyde
University, Warwick University and the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research. Similar groups would probably win contracts if the
modelling function was contracted out.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Bonn claims support for halting Eurofighter project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has persuaded Italy and Spain to support a halt to development
spending on the European Fighter Aircraft, according to government officials
in Bonn.
An official, who acknowledged that approval was still needed from Britain to
stop the project, said: 'We are aiming at a switch in the remaining
development funds, which are committed but not yet spent, from the present
EFA to a new, cheaper and lighter aircraft.'
He was speaking after talks between Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence
minister, and Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, his Spanish counterpart, at which, he
said, Spain had agreed to back the German line.
The German official said that Italy had also agreed to support the German
line, after talks in Italy last week between Mr Ruhe and his Italian
opposite number.
The position of the British government, which is still strongly committed to
the EFA, looks increasingly isolated, with Spain and Italy, under budgetary
pressures, siding with Germany.
No action can be taken unless Britain, the fourth partner in the project,
agrees, because all are contractually committed to the entire Pounds 8bn
development phase of the fighter aircraft. It is estimated that some Pounds
5bn of the total has been spent so far.
According to the Munich-based Eurofighter consortium, 270 of the 280 main
equipment contracts for EFA development have been awarded, and contractors
for most of the remainder have already been chosen.
Bonn decided in June not to go ahead with production of the current EFA
aircraft, arguing that it was too expensive and designed for an outdated
cold war threat.
Defence chiefs from the four countries are reviewing the operational
requirements on which the EFA project was originally based.
The four governments have agreed to investigate the possibility of using the
development work done for EFA to design a cheaper fighter aircraft. A
decision on that should be reached by the end of the year.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Labour's Maastricht dissidents pull back from clash with
Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S deep-rooted internal divisions over Maastricht were patched over
yesterday when critics of the treaty shied away from a direct confrontation
with Mr John Smith, the new party leader.
The party's national executive committee postponed a debate on European
policy until after the French referendum on Sunday. The leadership will then
draw up a formal position to present to the shadow cabinet and NEC the
following Wednesday.
The decision by senior shadow cabinet ministers not to press for immediate
policy changes is likely to defuse the row in the short-term. However,
profound differences between Labour's keen Europeans and those determined to
see substantial changes in the Maastricht treaty are unlikely to dissolve.
Mr Bryan Gould, the senior frontbencher who challenged Mr Smith for the
leadership, made clear before the meeting that he viewed the weekend
realignment in the exchange rate mechanism as likely to exacerbate rather
than relieve economic tensions in the longer term.
In interviews with broadcasters after the meeting, Mr Smith made clear that
he expected the three members of the shadow cabinet who have criticised his
strategy over Maastricht and sterling to toe the line once a formal policy
position is agreed.
Dismissing the likelihood of a confrontation with Mr Gould, he nonetheless
signalled that he will act firmly to enforce a common stance. 'I don't think
there will be a case of any of my colleagues not accepting the collective
responsibility they have been living with for years,' he said.
Officials also said the leader would not cede to pressure for a referendum
on the treaty and continued to oppose any suggestion of a sterling
devaluation.
The truce came after a personal appeal from Mr Smith at the national
executive meeting, called to approve a new document - Agenda for Change -
setting out Labour's post-election goals.
In consequence, Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, agreed to
withdraw amendments to the document's section on Europe which aimed to keep
open the policy option of devaluation and which required democratic
constraints on a European central bank.
Describing the meeting as constructive, Mr Blunkett said there was a case
for a breathing space until the French referendum was completed. 'It seemed
sensible to heal wounds and ensure we have a positive way forward,' he said.
Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwinger, mocked the shadow cabinet
dissidents, however, claiming they were merely adopting leftwing postures
before the NEC elections at the party conference later this month.
The Agenda for Change document, agreed yesterday, intends to address the
causes of Labour's election defeat by presenting the party as the champion
of ordinary people's goals and ambitions.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In these tough times it is rare to see a company in the car business
increasing profits. True, the 28 per cent rise in Inchcape's interim pre-tax
profits was largely due to the newly-acquired Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn
motor distributor, bought after a rights issue at the turn of the year. Also
the earnings per share rise of 7.4 per cent is not as good as it looks
because the TKM purchase was at a lower earnings multiple than the Inchcape
rights. Sceptics might also point out that distributing cars is likely to
remain a tough business for a while, and not just in the UK. Indeed,
Inchcape's figures clearly show the booming Hong Kong economy has helped
cover for difficulties elsewhere.
That said, the strong management team appears to be absorbing TKM well, and
savings should flow as TKM and existing distributors are rationalised. At
the end of the year the start of production at Toyota's Derby plant should
increase sales through Toyota (GB), even though Inchcape's share of the
joint venture will drop to 49 per cent by 1998 as Toyota takes control.
While these developments will help profits, the market may remain cautious.
The trend for car manufacturers to repossess their valuable distribution
businesses - as Volvo did with Lex - must be worrying. The conundrum for
business services firms, particularly those like Inchcape on a premium
rating, is that as soon as they make a success of contracts, companies are
tempted to do it themselves. That can make it a little hard to shine.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Dalgety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrary to the uglier market rumours, Britain's food manufacturing sector
does not appear to have collapsed in recent months. Like Cadbury and United
Biscuits before it, Dalgety yesterday painted a picture of undeniably tough
trading conditions - growing retailer power, choosy consumers and the like -
but not of an environment in which good companies with decent brands and low
costs cannot continue to thrive.
A 5 per cent increase in profits and dividends for the 12 months to June
certainly underlines Dalgety's growing claim to a place in that league. Most
impressive is the progress in consumer foods, where solid gains in market
share more than offset a slight dip in petfood demand and Golden Wonder
asserted its position as the number two in crisps. The difficulties in
milling and baking are hardly of Dalgety's making, while the lower gearing
figure should be seen in the context of a net Pounds 42m outflow for
acquisitions. Better working capital controls saved Pounds 23m - and there
is the promise of more to come.
Dalgety's shares have outperformed the sector by 15 per cent this year, an
achievement which can largely be justified on superior earnings. The
question is whether the stock deserves better than a forward multiple of
just over 10 and a 6.7 per cent historic yield. Having approved the
transformation from erratic, commodity trader to reliable plodder with
predictable profits growth, the market remains rightly cautious.
But once the management succession is sorted out and the strategic direction
refined, the shares should attract new support.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's 51-point rise in the London market looks odd if it is true that
sterling is not yet out of the woods. The FT-SE obviously derives benefit
from the presence of some large overseas-earners which are basking in the
disappearance of the two-dollar pound. Curiously, the All-Share index forged
a gain of 1.9 per cent, nearly as strong as that recorded by the FT-SE. So
yesterday's advance was pretty broadly based. Moreover there were some
impressive gains in interest rate sensitive stocks, like RMC, and cyclical
issues like British Steel, both of which gained over 5 per cent.
The market may also have been reluctant to ignore the positive signals from
both continental markets and from Wall Street. To be sure, thinnish trading
volume suggests the higher prices lack conviction. But the implication is
that equities are discounting a Yes vote in the French referendum. Price
movements such as these hardly make sense while there is still a risk of a
different outcome, and when some pretty grim domestic economic news looms
later in the week.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Quarter measures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So there it is. A quarter point cut in the German Lombard rate was less than
many in the financial markets had hoped. The Bundesbank's move looks a
little less niggardly when the half point cut in the discount rate is taken
into account - not to mention the repurchase operation announcement which
has taken a similar amount off short-term money market rates. But the
overriding impression is that it acted only with considerable reluctance. In
the end, the rate cut may have been the inevitable price for a deal to stop
the run on the lira which had cost it DM24bn in intervention last week
alone. Had intervention continued at that rate, it was bound to knock money
supply growth further off course.
By announcing Germany's intention to cut rates in advance, however, European
finance ministers have made the Bundesbank vulnerable to suggestions that it
has forfeited its political independence. That alone means the central bank
will almost certainly want to restore its credibility. Barring a serious
crisis in exchange markets, there seems little chance that it will cut rates
again in the short run. Though the manufacturing side of the German economy
is slowing, this is less true of the services sector. Money supply growth
remains well over 8 per cent, and the government in Bonn still lacks firm
control over its finances.
It is thus too early to declare a definitive end to strains in the ERM. The
lira closed last night well below its new ceiling against the D-Mark.
Sterling climbed only 2.5 pfennigs despite support from the Bank of England.
There still seems considerable risk of turmoil if this weekend's French
referendum does go against the Maastricht treaty. Sterling might then turn
out to be the exchange dealers' next victim. Doubtless the Bundesbank will
then expect the UK to follow Italy's example in raising domestic interest
rates before it looks to any help from Germany.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Why mortgage rates and pasta might be cheaper: Peter Martin
answers questions about the impact on the UK of Italy's devaluation and
Germany's interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q. What does this mean for my mortgage?
A. UK interest rates are now less likely to go up than they were before the
weekend. But only a little bit less likely; sterling still remains weak and
interest rates have to be kept up to protect it. The chances of a UK
interest-rate cut in the immediate future do not look high - but the next
move in mortgage rates is now more likely to be down rather than up, and
there's an outside chance that they'll be lower before Christmas.
Does Italy's devaluation make it more or less likely that Britain will
follow suit?
By itself, Italy's devaluation would have made it more likely that sterling
would eventually have followed the lira down within the ERM. Once the
markets scent blood, they are merciless. Germany's interest rate cut,
though, more than offsets that psychological impact. The direct effect of
lower German rates is to make holding sterling marginally more attractive
than it was before. The indirect effect is more powerful; by signalling that
German interest rates are now past their peak, it breaks a vicious cycle of
expectations.
Why was the Bundesbank rate cut so small?
It was a grudging gesture by a group of men under pressure. The Bundesbank
had made it clear that it wanted to wait until German inflation was really
beaten, some time next year, before cutting interest rates. Mounting
political pressures - from Bonn, from Brussels, and from the other 11
capitals of the community - would probably not have been enough to make Buba
budge.
But by Friday, with the Bank of Italy running out of reserves and the onus
increasingly shifting to Germany to prop up the lira, the Bundesbank was
running out of options. It could have pressed for a lira devaluation without
an accompanying cut in D-Mark interest rates, but that would have given
fresh ammunition to the No camp in the French referendum debate.
It would also have left the lira (and sterling) exposed to further selling
pressure by speculators who thought the Italian gesture wasn't enough, and
that would have left the Bundesbank back where it started. What is the
outlook for sterling?
It closed yesterday at just about DM2.81, two pfennigs lower than it was
before people learned how small the German interest-rate cut was, two
pfennigs higher than it was on Friday. It's now three pfennigs above its ERM
floor.
That's a comfortable margin, but another bout of bad news about the UK
economy, or any indication that the Bundesbank is having second thoughts
about lower interest rates, could nail it to the floor once more.
Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, is likely to want a period of
stability at or above the pound's current levels before cutting interest
rates - and he may let other countries, such as France, take the plunge
first. France has indicated that a cut is likely after the Maastricht
referendum.
Is this going to help the recession end?
The UK recession will end when consumers start buying again, when companies
recover their nerve about investing, and when world demand picks up. All
those need lower interest rates. Germany's cut yesterday morning helps - but
much bigger cuts, closer to home, may be necessary to kindle a real
recovery.
If Italy can devalue, why can't we?
For two reasons: John Major is now publicly committed to zero inflation,
which devaluation would make harder to achieve; and the Treasury doesn't
think devaluing would make it easier to cut interest rates, which is its
immediate objective. Should I hope for a Yes or No vote in France on Sunday?
Politics aside, that depends whether you think Britain would be better off
outside the ERM. A No vote would make it much harder for the UK to maintain
its current ERM exchange rates, and perhaps for the system to survive in its
current form. A Yes vote would make the ERM more robust, and increase the
likelihood of eventual European monetary union. It might also ease
short-term pressure on the pound. In the end, though, politics are what
count. If you want a closer, Maastricht-style European union, hope France
says Yes; if you want to go slower, and are prepared to take the risk of a
breakdown of the EC, hope for a No vote.
If the French vote No, will any of the weekend's events matter? Even if the
French vote Yes, will we be back in the same situation in a few weeks?
If France votes No, this weekend's excitement won't help much. The lira will
again come under pressure, and so will other weaker currencies such as
sterling. Ministers and central bankers will find themselves back in the
same weekend crises. If France votes Yes, the underlying problems won't go
away. Italy will still have to cope with its budget deficit; the UK will
still have to find a way out of recession; the tension between the dollar
and the D-Mark will still spill over into the ERM. And everyone will be
waiting for the next German interest rate move.
Who has made money out of recent events?
Anyone who had a short position in the lira will have made a profit. That
includes anyone who's been delaying paying a bill in lira to an Italian
company, and it includes Italian companies that had shifted any spare funds
into D-Marks or Swiss francs. Of course, it also includes the big players in
the currency markets, the banks. Other winners include investors whose
portfolios of shares or bonds are worth a bit more after yesterday's
lukewarm rally. In the UK, that mostly means the funds in which our pension
money is invested, and the insurance companies that invest our endowment
policy premiums.
Should I take a winter break in Italy? Will pasta be cheaper in the
supermarket, Fiats cheaper at the garage?
Because Italy's inflation rate has been higher than that of its neighbours,
it's been a very expensive place for holidays. It's now a bit less costly -
but economists reckon a 15 per cent devaluation would have been needed to
bring Italy's costs in line with those of other European countries. That
means it's half as over-expensive as it was. The cost of Italian goods in
British shops will depend on the pricing policies adopted by the people who
make and import them. Over time, they'll probably be less expensive than
they might otherwise have been. Do events mean that the Dollars 2 pound was
with us as fleetingly as the English summer?
The pound/dollar exchange rate is now the result of two calculations: the
pound/D-Mark rate and the D-Mark/dollar rate. In the first of those, the
pound has strengthened very slightly. In the second, the D-Mark has weakened
noticeably, and will drop a lot more once the markets think German interest
rates are really moving down a long way. Given the Bundesbank's view of the
world, that will not happen for some time. The Dollars 2 pound may have gone
for the moment; but the bargain-basement dollar is with us for some time to
come.
Was this a success for the ERM or a failure?
It was a success for the way the ERM was originally supposed to operate  - a
relatively smooth downward adjustment of a currency under pressure. It was a
failure for the recent view of the ERM as a sort of dress rehearsal for
monetary union, in which parity changes were to be avoided at all costs.

It is, to say the least, unusual for a head of state to issue a videofilm of
his private garden. But then gardens are rarely as controversial as those of
beleaguered Brazilian President Fernando Collor whose press department
yesterday distributed a three minute snippet to surprised journalists,
government ministers and opposition leaders.
Collor's gardens have been at the centre of his fight to withstand an
impeachment process; his landscaper revealed that he had received Dollars
2.5m for his work on the president's garden which, he claimed, 'makes the
hanging gardens of Babylon look shabby'.
Veja, Brazil's leading news-magazine, published photos of the 'Maharajah's
Gardens' last week showing a series of waterfalls, a rubber-lined lake full
of ornamental Japanese carp, swimming pool, exotic imported trees and
night-time illumination.
It went on to claim that, while many Brazilians have no access to clean
water, the water supplying the president's gardens passes through special
filters and oxygenating equipment.
However, the presidential video puts the case that the gardens are modest;
they had been distorted in the Veja report by special lenses, it claims. The
narration ends: 'The president has the right to live well.'
However, the waterfalls had been switched off when the video was filmed.
Surely a more convincing case for the modesty of the president's lifestyle
could have been made had journalists been offered a little liquid
refreshment to see for themselves.

Would you call Arnold Schwarzenegger a gym shoe or Tom Cruise a snapper?
Leo Burnett wouldn't advise it. The American advertising agency has just
carried out a coast-to-coast survey into the mood and idioms of America's
children.
As a result, it reckons it is better placed to help manufacturers wanting to
sell their wares to the nation's teens and sub-teens. Information is power,
it says, and language unlocks information.
Hence it seems that the celebrities kids most want to meet are (in
descending order) Arnold Schwarzenegger; Luke Perry (who he?); Tom Cruise;
and joint fourth, Kevin Costner and Cindy Crawford.
Ross Perot gets a 'notable mention' but there is no sign of George Bush or
his rival Bill Clinton.
No doubt they come into the snapper category. Although by no means
universal, terms for anyone considered odd proliferate: in Chicago a strange
person is a 'gym shoe'; in New York, a 'nad' or 'skeezer', and a 'snapper'
in LA.
But the longer these kids stay in celebrity-adulation mode probably the
better for them; they have already considered the 'worst things about being
an adult'.
Of the surveyed children aged 11 to 17, 43 per cent thought 'financial
responsibility' was the worst aspect of adulthood; 27 per cent thought
'having/finding a job' rated the lowest marks, but 19 per cent thought
'taxes' were the most depressing thing.
Old heads on young shoulders.

For Britain's struggling industrialists who are inclined to feel the present
government is insufficiently attuned to the urgency of their plight, here is
more bad news.
Howard Davies, the high-profile new director general of the Confederation of
British Industry, recently received a letter in which the author overlooked
the change at the top of the CBI, and addressed the missive to Davies'
predecessor Sir John Banham.
The similarity in the biographies of the two men (both previously from the
Audit Commission) was cause for comment at the time of the appointment, and
Davies has only been warming the seat since July.
But shouldn't some people know better? Especially a 'middle to high level'
civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry?

Still dancing on the deck of the Titanic are the heads of Italy's
state-owned companies. Although many may be heading for extinction under the
government's privatisation plans, the signs are they are enjoying themselves
as they go under.
Earlier this year, UK merchant banks and advisers were selling their
services to a large group of Italian public-sector bosses by hosting a
one-day jamboree on the royal yacht, Britannia.
Last week, it was the turn of the Germans. Deutsche Bank showed its
determination to jump onto Italy's privatisation bandwagon by sending almost
a quarter of its managing board to Rome.
It was a two-pronged attack. While the higher echelons - like the chairmen
of the biggest state-owned companies - were wined and dined at a dinner at
the German embassy, the triumvirate of John Craven, Ronaldo Schmitz and
Ulrich Weiss, Deutsche's board members responsible for mergers and
acquisitions, corporate finance and Italy respectively, hosted a lavish meal
for other executives and the heads of major subsidiaries on the roof terrace
of the Hassler hotel.
With the Vatican illuminated in the background and the Spanish Steps just a
stone's throw away, the atmosphere was hardly conducive to discussing deals.
But as far as banking diplomacy went, it could hardly have been bettered,
according to Observer's man on the spot - who opines that the food was much
better than that on the royal yacht.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARLO DE BENEDETTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an entrepreneur who has always sought to contribute to the construction
of an integrated, competitive Europe, I am alarmed by the current crisis in
the process of European unification.
I am chairman of an industrial group that has always taken a European and
international perspective in conducting its activities. I have made great
efforts to help remove the many barriers that divide European markets and
create a truly integrated European system.
The process of Europe's integration now seems to be grinding to a halt. The
enthusiasm generated by the drive for European economic and monetary union,
the fall of the Berlin wall and the opening-up of east European markets has
been overtaken by a wave of Euro-pessimism.
The change in mood is reflected in Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht
treaty, the uncertainty over the French referendum on Sunday and in the
growing conflicts of interest among Community members, which have been
aggravated by the recession in many economies.
A Yes vote in the French referendum could restore faith in the process of
integration. If I were a Frenchman I would vote Yes. A truly European
entity, supported by a common political structure, is essential if the
Community's member states are to play an active role in today's increasingly
unstable world.
A No for Maastricht would be an enormous setback. But we have to make Europe
possible. This means facing the fact that some of the conditions of the
treaty actually make Europe impossible.
No one would deny that significant changes have taken place in the economic
and political climate this year, not just in Europe, but throughout the
world. The guidelines and timetables for monetary and economic convergence
laid down by the treaty have to be adjusted accordingly, or the whole
edifice could collapse.
First, the world economic situation has changed. For years, our main worries
were recession or an inflationary explosion. But the problems have changed.
With the prices of property, shares and many industrial goods falling,
deflation - not inflation - has become the real enemy, and this could lead
Europe into depression.
The US has thus been applying reflationary monetary and foreign currency
policies for months. But recovery is still a long way off. US deflation has
deep economic and social roots, and will be difficult to eradicate because
the range of cures available is limited. Expansionary fiscal policies are
not an option because the budget deficit is at an all-time high.
A second big change is in Germany. The costs of reunification are rising
daily. The 1990-91 consumer boom awakened fears of inflation, something that
has always terrified the German authorities. They responded in July by
raising the discount rate, a move designed to brake internal demand, attract
foreign capital and unload some of the costs of reunification on to
Germany's neighbours.
Only now are many distinguished voices, both inside and outside Germany,
beginning to realise that the country has gone into recession, that
deflation and depression are the real dangers, and that the rigid monetarist
approach of the Bundesbank has actually harmed the Germany economy.
Weak international economic conditions and the slide of the dollar - with
its impact on European competitiveness - have made German policy an
unbearable burden for the rest of Europe. An urgent review of German and
European monetary policy is therefore necessary. The immediate goal is to
avoid depression, not to bring about a quick return to growth.
This weekend's realignment of the European Monetary System - and
specifically, the devaluation of the lira - in part reflects the severe
problems which have plagued the Italian economy for years. While there is no
doubt that Italy is the weakest link in the EMS chain, the high level of
real interest rates, imposed as a consequence of German unification, will
soon become unsustainable for other European countries as well.
The small cut in interest rates which the Bundesbank made yesterday is far
from consistent with the deflationary environment which the world currently
faces and far from consistent with the recession which is quickly spreading
throughout Europe, including Germany.
A third significant change in the economic climate has been the dramatic
situation in eastern Europe. The slowdown in growth in the west has clearly
amplified the crisis in the east. Shrinking markets for eastern exports have
slowed the flow of western capital (direct investments and loans) to the
east, and have exacerbated political disruption, particularly in the
Balkans.
We cannot ignore these changes. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty is
vital to keep the idea of European union alive and prevent a return to
national chauvinism. But adjustments reflecting the changes in the
international climate must be made if the treaty is to become an instrument
for growth and a project which the governments and citizens of Europe can
regard as their own.
The treaty was geared to an economic growth scenario which assumed the
persistent threat of inflation and a strong dollar. This is why its
guidelines for convergence basically require a deflationary approach.
Last year the treaty, as it stands, offered an effective means for
stimulating growth. In the current conditions, it has become a perverse
mechanism pushing Europe towards depression. The convergence guidelines have
to be rethought; they must provide greater flexibility and cater for
national differences. A drastic deflationary policy in one country must not
be allowed to limit growth in the whole of Europe.
The launch of the treaty's second phase, which would create the European
Monetary Institute - a forerunner of the European Central Bank - should be
brought forward. The institute should also be given greater powers to
monitor monetary harmonisation and review convergence targets.
Finding the technical solutions to make convergence a more flexible process
is a job for the experts. But the solutions they define should not
underestimate the difficulties of reviving the European economies nor cause
an uncontrollable acceleration in current deflationary trends.
The rise in European tensions in the wake of the dollar's recent slide shows
that the process of European monetary integration must be part of a wider
co-operation agreement between the Community and the US. In the past few
months, co-operation on monetary policy has been nearly non-existent.
Finally, the process of European integration cannot ignore the problems of
the east. The issue here is not so much to negotiate the future EC
membership of the east European countries as to take decisive action to open
up western markets to eastern goods.
This step is bound to create difficulties, but it is necessary to slow down
immigration from the east and break away from the narrow political vision of
European Union as an elite club for top performers.
For all these reasons, it is my belief that while ratification of the
Maastricht treaty by all the EC countries is necessary, a review of certain
conditions for union is equally vital. We must approve Maastricht if we want
to modify it.
Ratification and modification are not incompatible; on the contrary, they
are two essential steps for the relaunching of Europe.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Letter: How to stop Italy's debt pile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G K MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Italy's national debt now amounts to more than Dollars 25,000 per
inhabitant. Other countries are not far behind, including the Irish republic
and Belgium, perhaps.
In days of inflation of a good 10 per cent or so, the national debt could be
halved in value or purchasing power in less than seven years, if not
increased meanwhile; but if we are now to expect 3 per cent inflation then
23 years will be needed to halve the real debt in the unlikely event of debt
stability.
Italy is exceptional in that the country's savers themselves fund almost all
the burden of debt. In effect, the Italian Treasury bonds lead to a vast
exchange of lire between taxpayers and bondholders - the same individuals.
What I ask is whether this piling of debts on top of each other can be
stopped. If around 40 per cent of gross national product is about the
maximum that an electorate is prepared to pay in taxes to prop up the state,
how can debt payment of 12 per cent and more in interest be supported? G K

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('CBI economics', September 9) argues that I should have
told the Trades Union Congress that British industry has a productivity and
profitability problem driven by high wage costs. I rather thought I had; and
so did my hosts. You also take issue with the notion that we do not have a
fundamental exchange rate problem; quoting, in support, my own argument that
while manufacturing industry is leaner and fitter, there is not enough of
it.
My point is that the route out of the problem is not devaluation; rather it
is holding down pay rises while investing in the supply side, notably the
transport infrastructure and training. My impression is the TUC buys the
second part of the prescription. In my speech I was hoping to sell it the
first.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Letter: Floating exchange rates only rational economic
choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER WHALEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan is correct ('Economic Viewpoint', September 10) when he
notes that politicians may, at their discretion, choose fixed rather than
floating exchange rate regimes. But the fact of political expediency does
not mean that fixed rates are a valid or advisable choice]
What will be so different about the economy in a few months when the
billions of Ecus borrowed to finance the sterling support effort are
exhausted? His justification of this silly exercise, namely the short-term
goal of the French referendum and the longer-term hope for lower interest
rates in Germany, begs the real argument: unless and until UK residents are
willing to live and work and export like Germans, there is no hope of
pegging sterling (or the lira and franc) to the D-Mark.
Floating exchange rates are the only rational choice economically because
they reflect the perception of a given country by investors and markets. In
the case of the UK, the view remains negative because Britain is not
competitive commercially. And floating rates are the only moral choice in a
political sense because they allow a nation's citizens fairly to judge the
policies of the current government.
Efforts to support 'pegged' currencies are by their very terms
anti-democratic, particularly in the case of situations such as Russia and
Mexico where the International Monetary Fund and G7 are busily supporting
artificial exchange rates - and the government's attached to them.
Margaret Thatcher and the Danes are right: to hell with bureaucrats in
Brussels and elsewhere; up the free market]

Sir, Flushed with the success of funding part of the public sector borrowing
requirement and supporting sterling in one manoeuvre the Treasury has dreamt
up another two bird, one stone trick: the new insider dealing proposals
would appear to be an attempt to convert the stock market into the national
lottery.
By outlawing information gathering and dissemination, the Treasury wants to
create a market where luck is the only determinant of returns. The grit on
the roulette wheel is that the stock exchange has failed to get its new
computerised system, Taurus, ready in time. I assume from their silence on
the matter that quoted companies are happy to go along with this plan to use
ther share certificates as lottery tickets.

Sir, If legislation is to ban private meetings between investors and
companies, information flow to the market will slow down and pricing
inaccuracies will result.
Real inside information is then very valuable and tempting to act upon. As
consummate insiders, directors should not deal in their companies' shares at
all, under the Treasury's logic.
Insider trading is perhaps best curbed by improving transparency for
analysts and investors, to reflect business value consistently in market
price. Shareholders also need regular access to directors to evaluate their
progress, if the Cadbury code is to be enacted.
The Treasury's proposals will have the perverse effect of encouraging smart
insiders who can cover their tracks. Markets will become less
price-efficient, hopes for corporate accountability and governance dashed,
the honest majority worse off.
And why should capitalist acts between consenting adults in private be
banned in a free society? How this government has changed its spots since
associating with liberal marketeers in its earlier terms]

FT  15 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Regulating the monopolies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRYAN Carsberg, the new director general of Fair Trading, has proposed a
more radical approach for UK competition policy. The former
telecommunications regulator believes that lessons could be learnt from the
regulation of privatised utilities. These lessons may, however, be more
limited than Sir Bryan suggests, given the range of instruments already
available to deal with anti-competitive behaviour.
For the UK regulatory regime has already made good use of the flexibility it
enjoys for dealing with simple or complex monopolies. In most cases, the aim
is to promote competition, the consumer's best guarantee against excessive
prices and poor quality goods and services. Anti-competitive practices can
be forbidden, with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) enforcing undertakings.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) can recommend divestment by a
company under investigation to improve competition. Occasionally, as in the
investigation of the brewers, the MMC report may propose restructuring the
industry - though rarely on the scale of anti-trust actions in the US, where
large companies have been divided into several smaller companies.
These remedies often work slowly, especially where the aim is to reduce
barriers to entry - attracting new competitors can take time. It is this
which has led Sir Bryan to ponder whether lessons could be learnt from the
experience of regulating the newly privatised utilities, where regulators
have taken an increasingly tough stance to curb abuses of monopoly power.
Past successes
For example, British Telecom was until privatisation a monopolist in the
provision of UK telephone services. Rather than go for divestment, Sir Bryan
as regulator forced BT to open up its network to competitors such as
Mercury. He also required the company to disaggregate its various businesses
to eliminate cross-subsidy. Similar approaches have been taken by other
regulators. British Gas has had to make it easier for independent suppliers
to sell gas, for example. And the electricity industry was restructured
before privatisation to create competition in generation between existing
generators and to encourage new entrants.
Sir Bryan particularly highlights the lessons which can be learnt from the
experience of price capping the utilities. Their price rises are limited to
a percentage each year related to the retail price index (RPI). Thus from
next year, BT is to be limited to RPI minus 7.5 per cent which, with
inflation at present rates, means price cuts. Water companies have more
complex formulae which allow for real price increases, with the scale
related to the amount of investment required by each company to meet
environmental and other objectives. Where it was difficult to encourage
competition, such controls offered an alternative option to hold down prices
and force up efficiency for the consumer's benefit.
Last resort
Regulation of prices by the competition authorities is nothing new, however.
As Sir Bryan points out, seven cases referred to the MMC since 1970 have led
to direct price controls, including the price cuts on tranquillisers in 1973
and on contraceptive sheaths in 1975. More recently, Swedish Match was
required to freeze match prices for two years, in addition to giving other
undertakings.
Nonetheless such remedies should be used only when there is very little hope
of encouraging competition, not least because they may make it harder for
competitors to enter the market. Sir Bryan's success in capping BT prices
has undoubtedly been welcomed by the consumer. But lower prices make it
harder to tempt new entrants into the market, especially when they must
compete against BT with all the economies of scale which the former
nationalised company enjoys.
Sir Bryan is to be commended for highlighting the innovative approach taken
by the utility regulators. But the regulators have not yet succeeded in
breaking the effective monopolies of the former nationalised industries. The
promotion of competition is the most powerful weapon at his disposal at the
OFT, and there is little so far to learn on this from the experience of the
utilities.

FT  15 SEP 92 / What makes Paddy run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When there is no obvious difference between parties, voters are moved by the
personalities of the politicians who lead them. That at least is the theory.
It is the great hope of the Liberal Democrats. Their leader knows how to get
his name in the papers. Yes, I refer to Mr Paddy Ashdown. The Liberal
Democrats would not have attracted nearly a fifth of the vote in April
without him. He is the nearest thing contemporary British politics has to a
character, a bit of a card, a likely lad. He obliges us to watch him, if
only out of the corner of an eye. He has little choice. If he were to
vanish, his party, which he hauled up from nowhere when he became leader,
might vanish too.
Much the same was said about most of his predecessors. Lord Grimond had an
attractive, no-nonsense appearance, although it did not do the Liberals much
good. We will pass over Mr Jeremy Thorpe. Sir David Steel understood how to
make himself well-known. So did Lord Owen. The history of the latter pair
makes my point. Their unwillingness to share the limelight was a principal
cause of their failure to capitalise on their capture of it. As the Green
party discovered last week, small parties cannot hope to prosper without
leaders who can attract attention by the force of their individuality.
You may say that this has always been true, but today it matters more than
ever. The three national parties in Britain all favour broadly the same
economic strategies. They support membership of the European Community and,
if it ever comes into being, the European monetary union. All stand by the
parity of the pound selected by Mr John Major when Britain joined the
exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. Just at the moment all are uttering
similar platitudes in response to the weekend devaluation of the lira and
yesterday's reduction in German interest rates. All are impaled on the hook
of waiting to see what the French voters do next weekend.
As to ideology, all embrace capitalism, albeit with varying degrees of
enthusiasm. Not one of them proposes an extension of state ownership of
industry. Labour leans mildly towards support of the dwindling working
class, while the Conservatives lean the other way, but with every year that
passes there is less in it. The Liberal Democrats, gathered in Harrogate
this week, are seeking new, non-aligned voters. They are devoted to the
process of non-aligning themselves. They are iron filings waiting for a
magnet to attract them.
Which party should the voters pick? The personality of the prime minister
must have had a great deal to do with his election victory in April. The
electorate rather likes the straightforward, unassuming Mr Major. He may be
a raving fanatic about the exchange rate, but it hardly shows. The new
leader of the Labour party, Mr John Smith, appears to have taken a vow of
silence. We must give him time in which to work himself into his job -
perhaps until the party conference at the end of the month or, possibly,
until next year's conference. He will have to do something about Mr Brian
Gould and other dissidents within his ranks, but the answer to the big
question - what on earth is Labour for? - is not one he is going to hurry
over. Yesterday's meeting of his party, at which a first-look paper on
policy was to be debated, was but a beginning.
Thus the stage has been left empty, and Mr Ashdown has characteristically
seized the opportunity to prance about on it. His is an act that depends
upon energy. He is like the music-hall performer who never stops buzzing. He
sings, dances, plays musical instruments, turns cartwheels, juggles, tells
jokes, performs magic tricks. During the summer he captured the headlines,
over Bosnia, the recall of parliament, the state of the economy and much
else. Over the next few months he will make forays into city centres and
elsewhere, to live a few days at a time with 'ordinary people'. No press, no
photo-opportunities, he says - but we all know that the experience will
become part of his curriculum vitae. He will be able to speak of Sarajevo
and Solihull with 'direct knowledge'.
What he cannot bear to do is what he knows he must: sit and wait for Mr
Smith. When Labour is ready it will be time to establish whether there is at
last to be a pre-election Lib-Lab pact, or whether the two opposition
parties will, once again, knock one another out. What is meant by 'ready' is
the subject of constant debate behind the scenes in Harrogate. At the least
Mr Smith is expected to favour proportional representation for election to
the Commons; at the most joint positions on a wide range of policies would
be demanded. Alternatively, Labour might start, albeit slowly, to fade away.
The Liberal Democratic viewpoint is that there is still all to play for.
Thus all Mr Ashdown wants this week is for his party to put itself 'in a
state of grace,' under an unfettered leader, so that he may take such
chances as crop up. He will have that. It is what makes him run so hard.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Bloodied, but not too bowed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK has given virtually the smallest possible interest rate cut
in return for devaluation of the lira. Unless soon followed by more, such a
cut is unlikely to make the fate of other participants in the ERM
significantly easier. Nor is it likely to do much for the German economy.
Yet this cut is being hailed, and condemned, as a sign of rot in the
Bundesbank. For that reason, further German interest rate cuts are, in the
absence of another foreign exchange crisis, likely to be postponed. The
quarter-point cut in the Lombard rate and half-point cut in the discount
rate may be the last for a long time.
Those who do view the bargain as showing that the Bundesbank is crumbling
are right only up to a point. The Bundesbank has re-established a principle
it has always believed in - that the ERM allows for exchange rate
adjustment. Only the lira was shaken off this time, but the game is not yet
over, however many times British officials may state that the chances of a
sterling devaluation are zero.
In any case, the notion that the Bundesbank is entirely independent of
politics is a fantasy. A political decision put the D-Mark in the European
Monetary System; political pressure forced the Bundesbank to cut the
discount rate to its all time low of 2 1/2 per cent soon after the stock
market collapse of October 1987; politicians decided the terms of German
monetary union and may, depending on the fate of the Maastricht treaty,
consign the D-Mark to oblivion.
Appearances matter
Exchange rate policy is the Achilles heel of an independent central bank.
That has always been true for the Bundesbank, just as it would be true for a
European central bank. Anything, certainly a small interest rate cut, had to
be better than continuation of intervention which had already cost the
Bundesbank DM24bn (Pounds 8.5bn) last week. As the Bundesbank's chief
economist, Mr Otmar Issing, remarked yesterday, 'you can forget all about
things like M3 (broad money) if a situation such as we had last week were to
continue. We are much better off now than we were last Thursday.'
Domestic economic circumstances could also be called in aid. Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's doughty president, insists that the Germany
economy is not in recession, but it is far from blooming. The collapse of
the east German economy makes prolonged stagnation unacceptable.
Yet even if there are good reasons for these decisions, appearances matter
too. The Bundesbank appears to have bowed to political pressure and not even
from domestic politicians, but from France, the UK and Italy. Its dented
image will make the Bundesbank even more determined to nurture the
credibility it retains.
Question of time
It may take either another currency crisis or a steep decline in German
monetary growth to persuade the Bundesbank to lower interest rates again.
German interest rates may have passed their peak. But they are likely to be
cut slowly, leaving German short term interest rates rate close to their all
time highs for quite a while.
The question now is for how long the ERM will stay out of the crisis zone.
Sterling managed a 2 1/2 pfennig gain on the day, helped by the soaring
dollar, but it is in the firing line. Ultimately, its fate will be decided
by whether the present parity seems compatible with recovery. If the
prospect remains remote, a downward spiral of credibility could force a
larger yield gap over the D-Mark, further undermining chances of recovery.
More imminent still is the French referendum. A No vote is bound to
encourage speculators, especially after the huge gains that have been made
in speculation against the lira. But a marginal Yes might not settle the
matter. The prospect of a long, doubtful and controversial journey to
economic and monetary union would hardly ensure the stability of the ERM.
The Bundesbank has been seen to blink. That is bound to be costly to its
credibility. But the Bundesbank will not pay the price alone. Other
Europeans will pay too, as it struggles to restore what has been weakened in
recent years - its reputation for preserving the value of German money.
Governments have also blinked. With the ERM adjustable once more, lira
devaluation is not the end of the excitement in the European currency
markets.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Helping others help themselves: The weekend's currency
manoeuvres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community's exercise in monetary crisis management clears up
some of the short-term obstacles on the road to economic and monetary union
(Emu). But, underlined by the nervous mood on the foreign exchanges after
yesterday's Bundesbank interest rate cuts, the breathing space may prove
limited.
In acting decisively to arrange the European currency realignment, the EC
has tried to surmount the present period of doubt over its political and
economic objectives. Germany took the initiative, with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl personally involved in crucial talks with the Bundesbank last Friday.
The outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty - and the
course of European co-operation - remains on a knife-edge.
The adjustment in the European Monetary System (EMS) was an attempt to show
that European governments can still co-operate - and not drift apart in the
face of political and economic instability in both halves of the continent.
By explicitly forcing the Bundesbank to look beyond its borders in framing
monetary policies, Europe's finance ministers have chalked up a sizeable
victory - and have also set an intriguing precedent for the development of
Emu.
Europe's economy is weathering a phase of slow growth, high interest rates
and mounting unemployment, adding up to one of the most exacting challenges
for economic management since 1945. Yet governments are trying to win
support for a treaty on political and monetary union which seems likely to
impose further economic sacrifices in pursuit of the Maastricht goal of
irrevocably fixed exchange rates by the end of the decade.
The weekend EMS bargaining, under which the Bundesbank traded a cut in
interest rates for a lira devaluation, was hailed in Brussels yesterday,
perhaps optimistically, as the first step towards a new European economic
order. An alternative view came from a leading banker in Frankfurt who said
that, in orchestrating the lira devaluation, the Bundesbank had been a
victim of 'hysteria' engendered by unprecedented currency inflows of DM 24bn
into Germany last week.
The statutorily independent Bundesbank normally takes international factors
into account in framing its monetary policies. But never has it bowed so
dramatically and so overtly to pressure from European governments for lower
borrowing costs.
One leading Commission official claimed that the Community had now moved
into a new phase of monetary collaboration which put it firmly on track for
Emu. 'The road will be very difficult,' he said, 'but this shows that
governments can co-operate.'
The German government, which has been increasingly irritated during the past
two months by the central bank's tight monetary policies, played a
significant part in steering through the weekend move.
Bonn took the initiative for two reasons. Relaxing the Bundesbank's credit
reins counters the risk that the present period of German economic
stagnation will turn into full-scale recession. Additionally, Mr Kohl,
worried about the consequences of a No vote next weekend, badly wanted a
signal that his country fully backed the cause of European integration.
Yesterday's reduction of only  1/4 point in the Bundesbank's internationally
significant Lombard rate underlined the grudging nature of its response. Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, strained credibility at the
Bundesbank's press conference yesterday by insisting that the bank's move
was a sovereign decision. More important, German financial markets are now
convinced that further Bundesbank rate cuts will be in store in coming
months.
As the debate intensified yesterday on the reasons for the Bundesbank's
volte face, the foreign exchange market was struggling to make up its mind
about the longer-term impact of the move. Four principal questions arise,
both on the immediate future of the EMS, and on the prospects for Emu.
First, now that the most pressing source of EMS instability - the weakness
of the lira - has been defused, there is a risk that speculative pressure
will turn to other vulnerable currencies.
Sterling, still jittery yesterday, is the most likely focus of attack,
followed by the escudo and peseta. These are all currencies which have
become full members of the EMS during the past three years. They benefit
from wider 6 per cent fluctuation margins and have not yet gained the
policymaking credibility accruing to the members of the system's 'hard
core'.
The Bundesbank has made little secret of its feeling that sterling could be
a devaluation candidate. One 'hard core' European central banker argued
yesterday that the realignment has done little to correct basic EMS
disequilibrium. Britain, he said, might still have to take tough interest
rate action to win the trust of the markets. 'The Germans have gone out of
their way to help others. But now the others must help themselves.'
Second, doubts over whether the EC can generate the economic growth
necessary to forge a political consensus for Emu remain as strong as ever.
The  1/4 point cut in German interest rates, by itself, represents no more
than a weak ray of light in Europe's gloom.
All EC governments are trapped in an economic vicious circle under which
faltering growth drives up budget deficits through reducing tax revenues and
increasing social security outlays. The strict budget deficit targets laid
down at the Maastricht summit as conditions for Emu membership looked
difficult to meet nine months ago for most EC countries. Now, with EC growth
this year forecast by the Commission at only 1 1/4 per cent, fulfilling the
targets will be impossible unless the EC rediscovers 3 per cent growth.
Significantly, most European governments and central banks were taking a
highly cautious line yesterday following the Bundesbank's interest rate
reduction. Dashing expectations that the Bank of France would lower rates
this week to rally support for a Yes vote, Mr Michel Sapin, the French
finance minister, made clear that any credit easing would have to wait until
after the referendum.
Third, even assuming France approves the Maastricht treaty, considerable
hurdles remain along the Emu path. The imbroglio caused by Denmark's
rejection of the treaty in June still has to be solved. In addition, during
the period before the target date of 1997-99 for the final stage of Emu,
considerable tensions are likely over interpretation of the Maastricht
criteria for economic performance, according to a European ambassador in
Brussels.
This official predicts aggressive German insistence that there is no 'fudge'
on convergence. This process could lead to Italy, as well as other countries
outside the 'hard core', being left out. Inevitably, this creates the risk
not simply that European integration will proceed at two speeds. Europe
itself could divide between a prosperous north and a poorer south.
Fourth, the spectacle of the Bundesbank being subjected to overt political
arm-twisting could have an important impact on the German debate over the
Maastricht treaty. Chancellor Kohl has declared himself ready to abandon the
D-Mark in return for European union. But the strains of unification have
made the public wary about ceding control over the currency which has served
as the bedrock of post-war stability.
Mr Kohl has insisted that the planned single European currency must be run
by a European central bank as independent as the Bundesbank. President
Francois Mitterrand outlined a contrasting view 12 days ago, by affirming
that the European central bank would execute policies laid down by European
governments, not the independent 'technicians' on its council.
The weekend manoeuvrings, heavily criticised by many commentators in Germany
yesterday, are likely to heighten fears that politicians will run the bank -
and that German voters will be swapping the D-Mark for inflationary
'Esperanto money'.
These concerns are bound to influence the conditions likely to be applied by
the German parliament to the treaty as part of the ratification process
later this year. Already, the two German chambers appear likely to demand a
right of approval for the final stage of Emu before exchange rates can be
finally fixed - a condition which could torpedo the Emu timetable.
In the financial markets, timing is everything. This axiom takes on
particular significance when applied to a process as fraught with
complications as the march towards Emu. The weekend move came at a crucial
time to influence the French vote - but it could also misfire.
One risk is that the realignment did not go far enough. Critics on the
financial markets yesterday argued that the weekend deal will probably leave
nobody happy. The Bundesbank, they argue, has lost domestic credibility,
while the interest rate cut will not be sufficient to restore European
growth.
German officials have hinted that the Bundesbank could have decided a
greater rate cut if more countries had devalued. But the insistence of
France and, above all, Britain, to keep their currencies unchanged against
the D-Mark made this impossible. 'Europe missed the opportunity for a much
further-reaching realignment which would have provided the growth needed to
fulfil the Maastricht targets,' said a London currency analyst.
The currency pact may indeed vindicate Mr Mitterrand's decision to call a
referendum. But officials in Brussels, and in chancelleries around Europe,
yesterday were still highly cautious about predicting which way the French
would vote. If the result is Yes, the governments and central banks which
stage-managed the weekend changes will congratulate themselves on a coup
which tipped the scales in favour of European union.
If the French reject the treaty, the Emu timetable will be dead - but Europe
will still face the challenge of managing an exchange rate system prone to
disorder. That system is at present effectively run by the Bundesbank - a
position which Germany itself concedes is politically untenable.
Finding a form of monetary power-sharing between the Bundesbank and the rest
of Europe will remain a central preoccupation, whatever happens on Sunday.
The currency accord, for all its imperfections, could provide a glimpse of
how Europe could struggle towards that difficult goal.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena - Opera in Innsbruck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several of the most dashing recent recordings of baroque opera have come out
of Rene Jacobs's summer performances in Innsbruck: Handel's Flavio and
Giulio Cesare, Monteverdi's Poppea, works by Cavalli and Cesti. This year Mr
Jacobs was looking for something Spanish, since in Austria 1492 is being
remembered for Spain's eastward rather than its westward expansion. Hence
the happy choice of the considerably obscure Francesco Conti (1682-1732),
since he was responsible for one of the earliest Don Quixote operas, Don
Chisciotte in Sierra Morena.
This was one of two dozen stage works Conti wrote for the Viennese court. It
was played at the 1719 carnival, and three years later reached Hamburg, with
the recitatives translated into German by Mattheson, who recorded that it
was 'impossible to forebear laughing even at a first reading through the
score.' Innsbruck's Landestheatre production let the piece smile once more.
Mr Jacobs has a way of brushing accompaniment under the voices, so that
although the reproduction instruments of his Concerto Koln can sound brisk
and characterful, the projection is fundamentally vocal and from the stage.
Even with a number of big da capo arias and a playing time of close to four
and a half hours, the opera fairly slipped along on the skid of pathos and
humour which the librettists Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati ably conveyed
from their source.
Of course, Conti helped. Unlike the contemporary operas of Handel, Don
Chisciotte has a great variety of vocal types: alto castrati (here
counter-tenors) for the rival swains Cardenio and Fernando, sopranos for the
girls Dorotea and Lucinda, another male alto for the frenetic barber whose
bowl Don Quixote takes for a magic helmet, a treble for a page, inevitably a
buffo bass for Sancho Panza, and an aptly erratic tenor-baritone for Quixote
himself.
There is also great variety of characterisation. Cardenio and Lucinda are
paragons of the sweetly amorous-lyrical: parted by the plot for most of the
opera, they naturally have their centres in plaintive ardour and patience
respectively, though even in their cases cliche is skipped by creative
enthusiasm: the piece is full of melodic bravado, bursting towards the
reckless simplicity of a later age of Italian opera. Fernando is an angrier
sort (Jeffrey Gall was a responsive contrast with Derek Lee Ragin as
Cardenio). Dorotea is an interesting variant, in that much of her part is
sung tongue-in-cheek as she leads Don Quixote a dance, pretending to be an
exotic queen dispossessed by a giant: the role requires - and got from
Jennifer Smith - grandeur for a first aria of minor-key siciliana lament,
and bold-faced comic irony for much of the rest. Again there was a suitable
contrast with the sustainedly beautiful performance of Audrey Michael as
Lucinda. Michael Schopper and Isabelle Poulenard romped through the vigorous
duets for Sancho and a maid at the inn. Dominique Visse, as the barber,
added to his repertory of high-register hysterics. Nicolas Rivenq kept up a
wild thrust as Don Quixote, tottering on the edge of absurdity: it is hard
to know whether it was just his performance that revealed so much
Quixote-ish mad extravagance and absorbed self-pity in the part. Gerd Turk
had the luckless task of representing normality in the person of Lope.
Judith Vindevogel was his bright boy attendant.
Nobody was much helped by the production. Roland Topor's designs had
adventitious jokes on the wrong scale - like Quixote's costuming in sheets
torn from romances, barely discernible even from the third row of the
stalls. And the singers seemed to be moving and reacting without much
guidance from the director, Jean-Louis Jacopin. But the musical distinction
and energy were captivating, and the piece came up as something rather
remarkable, well worth revival again before another 270 years have gone by.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Anzacs over England - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Death haunts the skies over Stroud, Gloucestershire in David Goodland's
vivid Anzacs Over England at the Swan, Worcester. This theatre is beginning
to specialise in local social history with wider appeal. Goodland has
already adapted the rural writers Winnifred Foley and John Moore for the
stage; with Anzacs he uses social history leavened with imagination.
Anzacs represents an increasingly popular kind of drama, where families and
individuals are the crucible for larger social reactions. Arthur Miller's
plays set the modern type, and its best exponents now are Ronnie Harwood and
Brian Friel. Here, David Goodland charts the impact of 1,000 Australian
Flying Corps volunteer airmen on two Cotswold villages during 1918-19.
In Stroud, the Pope family represents English feudal life at its most
static. They work on the local estate, and feel the pain of war when one son
is lost and another gassed in France. But it is the daughter, Annie (Miranda
Pleasance, making her debut), in love with Australian airman Jeff (Richard
S. Huggett of Neighbours) who encapsulates the tension between the hierarchy
of the old world and the democracy of the new. She marries Jeff, and leaves
when the Australians ship out in 1919.
Goodland finds 'fair dinkum' humour in the meeting of Oz and Blighty; he
tempers this by recounting the deaths of 35 airmen who crashed their Sopwith
Camels in training. So far, the pace is slack, and the inset 'revue' scenes,
where the Aussies perform for the locals, should be cut down. However, Pat
Trueman's direction gives scope to good performances in the Pope household,
with Vivienne Moore as the mother offering sympathy or stew, and Owen John
O'Mahony as the outraged father clutching his newspaper in crumpled
irascibility.
Anzacs will shortly be recorded by BBC Radio, and should be sharper when
cut. The question it tackles but never answers is about loyalty: why did so
many men volunteer to fight and die for a far-off country? By the end of the
war, Australian casualties numbered over a quarter of a million, at two
thirds of those who volunteered, the highest proportion among combatants.
They deserve this tribute.
Anzacs Over England, Swan Theatre, Worcester until October 3 (0905 27322)

FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Les Six, street music and Sinopoli - Lucerne Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the woolly choice of 'Europe' as its theme, Lucerne emerged from
this year's festival with its reputation for resourceful programming intact.
The Columbus anniversary was celebrated in two concerts - one pairing
grandiose tributes to the explorer by the youthful Wagner and Honegger, the
other devoted to Renaissance music and directed by Jordi Savall, who seems
to be doing for early and classical Spanish music what Hogwood, Pinnock and
others have done for Bach and Handel.
The other subsidiary theme was Les Six, three of whom - Honegger, Milhaud
and Tailleferre - were born 100 years ago. The festival laid on an admirable
series of lunch concerts to explore the chamber music, but the centrepiece
was a surrealist double bill in the city theatre - the Cocteau ballet Les
maries de la tour Eiffel, to which five members of Les Six contributed, and
Poulenc's opera-bouffe Les mamelles de Tiresias.
The ballet describes the bizarre characters and events at a bourgeois
wedding party on the Eiffel Tower. It may no longer shock audiences in the
way Cocteau intended in 1921, and its structure and content are slight; but
it adds up to a fast and mischievous entertainment, with an authentic Gallic
levity deriving as much from Cocteau's spoken commentary as from the music.
Auric wrote the explosive overture, Tailleferre a cheeky 'waltz of the
telegrammes', Honegger a parody of a funeral march and Milhaud the raucous,
pompous finale.
There are ten short numbers in all, of which only Poulenc's charming
'Bathing-girl of Trouville' is ever heard independently. As Ronald Crichton
points out in an illuminating essay on Milhaud in this month's Opera, Les
Six were bound more by personal friendship than by similar musical tastes -
and yet this work, premiered a year after they were christened as a group,
shows a distinct compatibility of style. It should be less of a rarity.
Thorsten Kreissig's choreography was fussy, but the conductor, Olaf Henzold,
captured the wit and scintillating colour of the music.
The double-bill with Les mamelles made sense on paper, but after the
farcical goings-on of the ballet, the opera was an anti-climax. Something of
greater contrast - perhaps La voix humaine - was needed, and the dialogue of
Poulenc's domestic allegory, based on a play by Apollinaire, lost its spice
in German translation. But the biggest handicap was the staging. Instead of
trusting the natural comic irony of the piece, the producer Philipp
Himmelmann loaded each scene with an extra layer of surrealist production
baggage, reducing the work to the level of cheap pantomime. The cast, led by
Eileen Hulse's spunky Therese, struggled nobly but unsuccessfully to achieve
the necessary fluency. Only the poignant lyricism and sincerity of Poulenc's
instrumental music emerged unscathed.
Lucerne this summer broke with tradition by laying on some high-risk
experimental events, including an official street music competition. The
question posed by the new festival director Matthias Bamert was: does street
music exist as an original art form? The answer - at the end of a noisy,
hectic and controversial week of eliminating rounds at selected sites around
the city - was 'yes, probably'. But some awkward lessons were learned in the
process. The competition, which had the laudable aim of breaking barriers
between tourists, townsfolk and the snobby aura of the festival, gelled with
the formal events like oil and water, and should in future have a separate
slot in Lucerne's summer calendar. Given the bohemian egalitarianism of
street musicians and the variety of skills they present, it seemed invidious
to single out one group or individual for a big cash prize - especially when
the winner turned out to be the daughter of one of the judges. Small wonder
this left a bad aftertaste.
Lucerne's visiting orchestras offered plenty of high-brow glamour but
varying degrees of satisfaction. Claudio Abbado's rapturous Daphnis et Chloe
with the Berlin Philharmonic, which I heard on the radio, was billed as
complete but in fact was subjected to all sorts of inexplicable cuts. The St
Petersburg Philharmonic (with Yuri Temirkanov) followed their glorious
Tchaikovsky Manfred Symphony with the Musorgsky/Ravel Pictures from an
Exhibition, which exposed weaknesses in the orchestra's brass section and
proved how un-Russian this piece really is.
The Dresden Staatskapelle's golden-toned, echt-Straussian instrumental solos
distinguished their performance of Ein Heldenleben, but their new chief
conductor, Giuseppe Sinopoli, laid bare his lack of repertoire with a lumpy,
shapeless Schumann Third Symphony. The old way of doing things was for a
conductor to build his repertoire slowly and steadily, presenting his
interpretations to an international public only when he had lived with the
piece, and was properly inside it. Not so today: with Sinopoli and this
great German orchestra, the recording contract came first, then the
high-profile tours - and the mainstream repertoire is apparently digested
somewhere along the way.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Faced with a view - London Galleries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tai-Shan Schierenberg, now 30, first came to general notice as winner of the
National Portrait Gallery's John Player Portrait Award of 1989. That
interest was sustained by the accession to the collections early this year
of the portrait of the writer and barrister, John Mortimer, that had been
commissioned as part of the Award. Now he is having his first substantial
exhibition at a London gallery.
Such progress is not unusual, but it is deserved. The much-vaunted revival
of figure painting has all too often been honoured more in the breach than
the observance, the enthusiasm of young artists for the idea of the figure
out-running all sense of technique, analysis and understanding of the
subject. Schierenberg is nothing if not enthusiastic, as much for the medium
and stuff of oil paint and the act of painting itself as for his subject,
and yet his natural expressionist ebullience is never out of hand. The
figure is invariably well established in a coherent pictorial space,
formally complete, an active presence and credible likeness, no matter how
cursory the statement.
The point is only that such formal strength never springs entire from the
artist's own head, but must depend on the essentially disinterested study of
the external reality and truth, the truly creative imagination necessarily
responsive and unself-conscious. Schierenberg may leave off at the judicious
moment - even a moment too soon, with a hand or face or foot as yet
unresolved - but in all these paintings, the small landscape and portrait
studies and the larger, ambitious conversation-pieces alike, it is clear
that he sits in front of his chosen subject and immediate pre-occupation,
and looks at it long and hard.
In any sensible world 66 year old Peter Coker should by now be enjoying the
fruits of reputation and distinction won over a long career. Yet, such is
the English penchant for putting artists into safe and certain categories
that he is by no means so well known and supported as he deserves to be - a
situation made all the more poignant by illness that has prevented him
working these two years past.
Oh yes, he enjoyed an early success with the new social realism, the
'kitchen sink' painting of the 1950s that has now been given a room to
itself in this year's hang at the Tate; and, yes, he was elected to the
Royal Academy remarkably young. But that was more than 30 years ago, and the
subsequent quasi-official support, the British Council tours abroad, the
inclusion in the definitive exhibitions at home, the regular monitoring of
the work and, in due course, perhaps, the retrospective at the Tate, have
not been for him. The received opinion was always that, with the kitchen
sink's moment, so too his had slipped away. A representative Coker 1950s
butcher's shop was in the Tate, and that was that: what more could he want?
It only takes a sight of this current retrospective, small as it is in its
London showing, and the barest consideration of those artists who have
received consistent support across the years - the Hamiltons and Hockneys,
the Longs and Dennys and now the Hursts and Whitereads - to reveal such an
attitude for the partial, self-serving, myopic nonsense it really is. Coker
might not be an important artist in quite such terms as pass for importance
in the curator's or modern art-historian's eyes, but how often do we find
such 'importance' trotted out to mask manifest ineptitude or affectation?
All the time. And the actual quality of the work? Ah, well, hmm, yes, quite.
Coker's essential subject is the landscape, wild and windswept in the
Hebrides, hot and domestic in France, close and intimate in Epping Forest.
To mark the transition from those old sides of beef of the 1950s to the
trunks and clumps of trees that followed soon after, and so on to the later
cliffs and fields and hillsides, is to see no arbitrary shift and
readjustment, but a natural, ordered and consistent development. Those
butcher's still-lifes, controversial in their time, seem now a kind of
landscape, those trees still-life of sorts, and the landscapes down the
years drawn ever with the firm hand and close attention that were the
character of those quietly obsessive, monumental early images. We can only
pray that Peter Coker is at work again before too long.
Stephen Finer, now with Bernard Jacobson, is having his fourth London show.
He is a painter principally of the human head, worked for the most part on a
fairly small scale. He works from the model, yet it would be misleading to
describe his paintings as portraits, for any conventional likeness is
shadowy, obscure and fleeting. Yet, in these densely overlaid and reworked
surfaces, the marks buried and obliterated and insistently re-established,
the sense of a real and particular human presence remains curiously strong -
likeness as experience and sensation rather than obvious record. So it is
that he stands with such mentors as Auerbach and Bacon in the tradition of a
disciplined and objective expressionism.
Also showing at Flowers East and London Fields are Trevor Sutton, with his
new monotypes; John Loker, with recent water-colours; and Carole Hodgson,
with a most impressive group of her latest sculptures and works on paper,
ambiguously redolent of landscape, and the landscape implicit in the human
figure.
Tai-Shan Schierenberg: Angela Flowers at London Fields, 282 Richmond Road
E8, until October 11. Peter Coker: Abbot Hall, Kendal, until October 25, &amp;
The Friends Room, Royal Academy, until October 11; the two shows combine for

FT  15 SEP 92 / Technology: Raising a glass to computerised gin - London's
first new white spirit distillery for 84 years opens today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to judging the quality of neutral white spirit - used in
making premium gin and vodka - no technology can yet entirely replace a
sensitive nostril.
So London's first new white spirit distillery for 84 years, which comes into
production today , will have its output monitored by four men with
highly-tuned noses as well as by such analytical aids as gas chromatography.
'We have tried to produce a scientific 'fingerprint' of the perfect
distillation but without success,' says John Reagan, distillery manager.
'The nose, and particularly the customer's nose, is still the final arbiter
of quality. It can sometimes pick up things which more scientific analysis
does not detect.'
The Pounds 10m joint venture at Greenwich between Invergordon Distillers,
the Scotch whisky company, and Tunnel Refineries, a member of the Tate &amp;
Lyle group, will be capable of producing 10m litres of grain spirit a year.
Invergordon has been producing white spirit at its distillery on the
Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, since 1979. Sales last year amounted to
about 5 per cent of the company's Pounds 92.4m turnover.
'The location of the Greenwich distillery, close to the major markets in
London and south-east England, and in continental Europe, should see us well
placed to expand sales,' says Chris Greig, Invergordon's managing director.
Britain's gin and vodka makers use about 58m litres of potable spirit a
year. Total European Community demand amounts to more than 400m litres.
The Greenwich venture marries the skills of the two companies. Tunnel's
expertise is in grain processing. It produces glucose syrups and starches
for the food, soft drinks and brewing industries.
Invergordon has more than 30 years' experience in distilling. It is the
fifth largest Scotch whisky producer, supplying several multiple retailers
in the UK and continental Europe with own-label brands.
Though the basic distillation process has not changed for centuries, the
Greenwich distillery incorporates the most up-to-date technology to ensure
low-cost quality production.
The distillery employs only 13 men. Two technicians per shift control the
round-the-clock operation with the help of a Texas Programmable Login
Control system. The computerised system allows continuous monitoring and
on-line control of the process and operating costs.
Liquid wheat starch is supplied from Tunnel's adjacent processing plant. It
is cooked and converted into a syrup before transfer to six 180-tonne
fermenters, each with an automatic cleaning-in-place system to maintain
sterility.
A traditional yeast is added to the fermenters to convert the syrup into
alcohol. The wash produced at the end of his process is fed into a
six-column distillation plant into which Invergordon's own engineers have
designed a number of heat recovery techniques to reduce energy consumption.
Separate columns remove fusel oils, methyl alcohol and other impurities to
produce a high-grade neutral spirit.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Technology: Tug of war in the rope industry - Stronger,
lighter and more wear-resistant fibres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rope-making must be one of the few industries where modern-day manufacturers
can put a sample of their latest product development on a table and compare
it with what their forbears were making 4,000 years ago.
At Bridon Marine in Charlton, south-east London, a piece of Egyptian rope
from the days of the Pharaohs is exhibited proudly in John Yeardley's
office.
But the technical director of sister company Bridon Fibres gives pride of
place to a new product with which he and Ian Hosea, director and general
manager of Bridon Marine, are hoping to give the marine rope industry a firm
shake.
Bridon Marine, part of Doncaster-based Bridon, the world's leading
rope-making group, has just launched TQ12, a completely new polyolefin rope
which is intended to answer the hard-pressed shipping industry's ever
growing demands for stronger, lighter and more wear-resistant rope.
It is perhaps because rope-making has been around for so long that its
modern-day technical achievements rarely merit much attention. But the
demands made on modern synthetic-fibre-based ropes would stretch the talents
even of an early 20th century rope-maker, let alone an Egyptian craftsman
using natural fibres.
Yet the industry retains strong links with its past. Bridon's factory
illustrates the transformation in manufacturing over the past 30 years, with
giant mechanical bobbins encircling each other in an industrial version of
the maypole dance. When a fibre rope is completed it still requires craft
skills to splice the loop at each end, a process which has long been
mechanised in steel rope.
The rope itself has changed too, because of the possibilities offered by
synthetic fibres. The 1960s brought rope plaited from eight separate strands
 -twisted lengths of fibre - then some 10 years later came double-braid rope
 -basically a rope within a rope. More recently, Bridon has been making
special oceanographic cables using Kevlar, the Du Pont composite material,
as a low-stretch strength member to protect the electrical circuits.
Its latest product, the first to emerge from a reorganised technical centre
at Charlton, has a unique 12-strand construction. The aim, says Yeardley, is
a much rounder, less lumpy rope than the eight-strand, cutting down wear but
retaining the ability to make a single splice.
The main advantage of TQ12, however, is a 50 per cent increase in strength
for the same size of rope. A mid-sized 7 1/2 -inch rope made of TQ12 will
hold a 63-tonne load before breaking, compared with 41.2 tonnes for a
standard eight-strand rope.
According to Yeardley, about half the extra strength comes from the way the
raw material polymer chips are extruded into fibres, and the proprietary
combination of water inhibitors and additives included at this stage. The
rest comes from the 12-strand design, the angle of lay, and the method of
termination.
For Hosea, the new rope is a welcome addition to Bridon Marine's range when
conditions are tough in the shipping industry. 'It's a good thing to do now
because customers will see the benefits,' he says.
The rope is aimed at the marine market - moorings for ferries, cruise ships,
cargo ships - which is important for Bridon as it balances the peaks and
troughs caused by big contracts from the offshore industry. 'We're going
after business that is currently eight-strand,' he says, and is looking
first at the UK, Scandinavian and US markets.
So who said British industry is on the ropes?

FT  15 SEP 92 / Technically Speaking: Keeping tabs on benchmarking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS and share price are simple measures of overall corporate
competitiveness. Individual departments, however, find it more difficult to
put up hard numbers to show how they compare with the opposition -
especially if they are service organisations rather than profit centres.
These days, data centres and management information systems departments have
urgent need of a reliable benchmarking technique. They are under attack from
senior management, anxious to get better value for the money spent on
information technology.
Installed computer power is rising by an average of 40 per cent a year in
large data centres, yet there is heavy pressure on IT budgets and an
increasing tendency to look at the possibility of 'outsourcing' - turning
over the company's entire data processing operations to a computing services
company for a fee against an agreed level of service.
With this background, it is easy to see why IT departments from large
organisations are keen to take part in projects such as the 'Impact'
programme, initiated by the National Computing Centre and now managed by
consultants Peat Marwick. Impact is sponsoring a number of studies designed
to measure the effectiveness of IT investment.
As one of the participants remarked: 'It helps to give us an ideas of where
we are in the spectrum.'
It seems likely that most companies could make substantial reductions in
their data centre costs. Compass, a Scandinavian company which has developed
a technique for measuring the efficiency of data centres, reckons that
savings of between 5 per cent and 40 per cent can be immediately identified
for most IT operations.
Compass's data are particularly interesting because the company now has
records for many of the largest UK businesses stretching back to 1987. Its
method is to measure some 800 variables in data centre performance. It is
then able to combine them into an overall picture, not only of the
efficiency of the centre but also of how it compares with competing
organisations.
Compass has followed a fixed group of UK companies since 1987. Its results
suggest that although total IT costs for the group rose by 14 per cent
annually, overall unit costs fell 31 per cent each year. In other words,
although the members of the groups were increasing their investment in IT,
they were getting better value for money.
Now, as managing director Theo Sahlsberg is happy to admit, there is no
magic in the Compass approach or that of its competitors, Real Decisions
Corporation or Nolan Norton.
The benefits come from the detailed way in which the data are collected,
which forces companies to think hard about every aspect of the data
processing department.
The level of measurement involved seems to be new to many companies. IT
spending decisions are too often taken on inadequate data.
Outsourcing, for example, may for all its fashionability produce a more
expensive solution. One company which quoted a minimum Dollars 13.4m (Pounds
6.8m) a year for a seven-year facilities management deal found that by
following Compass's recommendations it saved more than Dollars 46m in four
years. Over the entire period, concentration on internal efficiencies
resulted in lower costs than outsourcing.
For maximum benefits, however, data centre costs have to be measured
regularly. In the five years Compass has been investigating UK companies it
has seen the use of its technique change from a one-off 'health-check' to a
continuous method for monitoring performance.
Ford of Europe, for example, has carried out a study each year and acted on
the results. Production capacity has been doubled with lower staff levels
and without increasing overall costs.
Once the cost base has been established through measurement, it is possible
to set targets with a real chance of achieving them.

FT  15 SEP 92 / People: BT and Mercury set for gridlock?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two former top executives at Cable and Wireless and British
Telecommunications have joined forces to spearhead a challenge by the
National Grid Company to the telecommunications duopoly operated by their
erstwhile employers.
Gordon Owen, group managing director of C and W until last year, became
special adviser to the project, called Telecom Electric, at the beginning of
the month. Previously he was in charge of C and W's subsidiary, Mercury
Communications, which is BT's main rival in the UK market.
David Dey, managing director of BT's business communications division until
last year, has joined as Telecom Electric's project leader. Before working
for BT, he was in charge of Plessey's telecommunications business.
If a pilot project is successful, the intention is that Owen will become
chairman and Dey chief executive.
The appointment of such senior figures in the telecommunications industry is
being interpreted as evidence that the National Grid intends to make a big
push into the newly liberalised telecommunications market.

Tokio Katayama has arrived as the new director general in London of the
Japan External Trade Organisation, JETRO's largest overseas office.
Like all appointees to this post, Katayama comes from the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (Miti). Since 1990 he has been director of
the electric power administration division of the Agency of Natural
Resources and Energy. Before that he had picked up experience of trade
relations as a director of the North Asia division of Miti, dealing with
Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. At Miti since 1969, he spent three years
as first secretary in the Japanese embassy in Singapore, where he was
concerned with Japan/Singapore trade relations.
He succeeds Shun-ichi Nakao, who is returning to Japan after two years in
the UK - which included the Japan Festival, a 'highlight' of his tour,
according to an official. Nakao becomes executive director of the New Office
Promotion Society, which is aiming to improve conditions for the country's
office workers.
While JETRO these days concentrates on promoting foreign imports, rather
than Japanese exports, Katayama is giving nothing away as to precise plans
for his UK sojourn.
The statement that emerged from his office read: 'It is most gratifying that
as a result of mutual effort over many years, Anglo-Japanese relations are
so good. Although there have been some problems between the two countries,
we have always been able to iron these out, and I believe that the most
important thing is our continuing will to deepen and widen this good
relationship for the future.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / Business Law: One-stop shopping in Czech privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL ARBESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the former Czechoslovakia, the 'velvet divorce' of the Czech lands and
Slovakia has preoccupied the outside world in recent months. Behind the
scenes, however, the Czech Republic is quietly forging ahead with a
programme of economic reform and privatisation that is already serving as a
model for the region.
One of the most important developments in the reform programme is the
creation of an overnight capital market for thousands of companies
participating in the voucher privatisation scheme. The initial wave of
privatisation involves five 'rounds' of bidding. In the first three, more
than 120 companies have identified their new shareholders, and by the end of
the year, nearly 1,500 companies will be trading.
The majority of these will be controlled by a handful of closed-end mutual
funds. Fund managers have induced individual holders of voucher books to
invest with them by promising guaranteed returns. The funds will soon be
under pressure to sell to satisfy these put obligations.
They will also want to maximise their investments, restructuring the old
state enterprises by raising capital and negotiating for foreign management,
technology and marketing commitments.
All of this should spell opportunity for many strategic and financial
investors who have been waiting on the sidelines to see how the reform
programme developed.
A new Securities Act will come into force on January 1. It will feature
standard disclosure and trading rules and set the stage for efficient
capital markets which will be open to foreign investors without the
complexities inherent in the previous 'deal path' of buying from the
government.
Direct foreign investment in the Czech privatisation programme has so far
been limited to just 41 deals, with total investment falling significantly
shy of the anticipated level of several billion US dollars.
While not discouraging foreign investment, government policy has generally
favoured letting the new shareholders sort things out with willing buyers
after voucher privatisation. As a result, investors pursuing deals with the
government have complained about the ad hoc character of the process,
especially the lack of co-ordination among reviewing ministries and the
absence of review criteria.
The government has tried to address these problems and generally accelerate
the process by creating a new inter-ministerial privatisation commission as
the deciding authority to replace the cabinet-level economic counsel. All
key ministries will be represented on the commission, opening the door for
the first time to the possibility of one-stop shopping as an welcome
alternative to renegotiating with different ministries along the way.
The privatisation commission is even talking about publishing criteria for
foreign deals; these have long been applied quietly by investment bankers to
the Czech Ministry of Privatisation. The move would improve the transparency
of the process by giving foreign investors (and reviewing bureaucrats) a set
of benchmarks around which to structure their proposals.
The government has also published a resolution dealing with environmental
liabilities. Foreign investors are understandably nervous about such
liabilities in light of the poor environmental record of previous state
enterprises, and the stated intention of the Czech government to enforce
European Community standards during the next few years.
The new resolution will apply to companies due to be privatised in the
second wave. The resolution indemnifies foreign buyers completely against
off-site environmental liabilities associated with the assets being
privatised.
Foreign investors will have to assume liability for on-site environmental
conditions. However, the resolution establishes a procedure under which up
to 50 per cent of the purchase price paid for the privatised assets will be
held in escrow and made available by the government for necessary
environmental investments.
Escrow fund payouts will be based on an audit of environmental conditions at
the date the deal is completed, and on performance of a remediation
programme which is to be agreed between the purchaser and local and federal
environmental officials.
The audit and remediation programme do not need to be finalised before
completion of the transaction, although it is clearly in the best interests
of the foreign investor to see that they are.
The Czech government has also clarified the role of the Czech Office for
Economic Competition (COEC), which was created by anti-trust legislation
early in 1991. This body will now review all privatisation transactions
involving foreign investment.
The COEC will initially analyse the target company to determine whether it
has a 'dominant' market position, defined as holding more than 30 per cent
of the market for the relevant product. If the company was judged to be
dominant, COEC would analyse the potential for abuse of its position.
The COEC will seek to determine if 'any detriment which may arise from
limited competition will be outweighed by the economic benefits produced by
the merger'.
The factors that will be considered in this balancing test are still
emerging. Initial rulings do indicate, however, that the COEC will consider
access to foreign technology and markets that will prolong the life of the
Czech target company as a public benefit that may compensate for the
detriment caused by a dominant market position.
The COEC is currently promising to grant preliminary opinions on
transactions already in the pipeline within a few days. However, after the
completion of a transaction the COEC reserves the right to re-evaluate the
project and revoke its preliminary approval if it finds evidence that the
foreign buyer intends to engage in predatory practices. Foreign investors
would be well advised to plan against this contingency with appropriate
contractual escape clauses.
A final warning for the foreign investor is the caveat emptor principle. The
National Property Fund, which is the selling entity in direct foreign
investment privatisations, is taking a very tough stand on representations
and warranties that will be made to foreign buyers.
The fund's standard form contract provides only for limited representations
as to the organisation and standing of the target company; due authorisation
and execution of the purchase contract; valid ownership title to, and
absence of litigation affecting, the assets being privatised; and all
necessary consents having been obtained.
Standard balance sheet and other representations should not be expected,
although these have been granted in selected cases where they are
contemplated in the privatisation project submitted for government approval.

Pharos, a computerised advisory service launched earlier this year by
National Westminster Bank to provide information on the single European
market has been expanded to include information on environmental issues.
Pharos, a program which can be used on IBM-compatible machines, builds a
profile of the user's business by asking a series of questions. It then
identifies issues in these two areas which may impinge on the company.
The weakness of most advice booklets is that they provide answers but give
no guidance on the relevant questions, according to NatWest. Pharos,
believed to be the most widely used personal computer-based expert system in
the world, helps users to ask the right questions.
More than 150,000 businesses applied for free copies of the Pharos program
when it was launched. The system is now available for Pounds 40 (plus VAT),
including an update in March 1993, to NatWest customers, clients of
accountants Ernst &amp; Young and CBI members, and for Pounds 125 to others.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to make sure your
company is not sold down the river
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Selling your business is no easy task, particularly in a recession, and many
vendors call in a merchant bank, accountant or specialist broker to help,
writes Charles Batchelor.
But vendors have in the past complained they were given an exaggerated idea
of the price their business might fetch and that the adviser was not active
enough in looking for prospects. To ensure you deal with a competent firm
you should meet and compare at least three advisers, suggests Tim Lyle, a
director of Livingstone Fisher,* an acquisitions and disposals specialist.
Ask who will be leading the assignment and make sure that he or she will
actually be available when needed. This avoids having junior staff learn at
your expense.
Quiz the adviser on what similar deals he has handled successfully. This
ensures that he has the capability and that the deal will be important
enough for him to devote time to.
Find out if the firm has any experience of your sector.
Obtain names of other clients you can contact for a reference.
The adviser should be able to say:
When it would be best to sell. It may make sense not to do a deal
immediately but to turn the company round or expand it further to maximise
the sale price.
How it is proposed to find potential buyers from around the world.
How confidentiality will be maintained.
Whether the adviser has handled sales to management teams as well as to
corporate buyers. A buy-out may make more sense.
How the deal would be structured to minimise capital gains tax.
It is important to discuss fees before going any further.
Avoid a fee structure based on an hourly charge which does not set a maximum
figure.
Insist that the adviser shares the risk of failure by agreeing a much lower
maximum fee if no deal results, including a decision on your part not to go
ahead.
Do not pay any fee in advance.
Expect to be invoiced, say, quarterly in arrears but to pay a 'success fee'
immediately on legal completion.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): We can't go on meeting
like this - Charles Batchelor offers advice on how to avoid the pitfalls
when organising a conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You've probably been there too. The seminar where the presentations bore
only a tenuous relationship to the advertised theme. The training session
where the overhead projections were too detailed to read from the second row
back. The hotel at the other end of town from the conference centre.
Companies spend large sums of money on meetings, seminars and conferences
and their executives and staff devote equally prodigious amounts of time to
attending them. Some are in-house sessions designed to motivate the sales
force or keep managers up to date; others are intended to promote the
company's image to the outside world.
How can they make sure they get value for their money, that they do not
waste their time and they do not damage their image? It probably makes sense
to call on professional help for the more elaborate event, although the
conference field can be confusing.
You will probably encounter four main types of adviser: production companies
which will arrange the visuals and stage sets; venue search companies;
convention bureaux which promote facilities in their town; and project
managers who will run the whole show. Some production companies and venue
finders have also attempted to move into project management.
Companies frequently turn to conferences and seminars as part of their
marketing effort, to boost their image. 'But the first thing to ask yourself
is why you are doing it,' says Vanessa Cotton, managing director of the
Event Organisation Company. 'The outside world will not be interested if a
company just wants to say how good it is. People are even more time
conscious than they are cash conscious. Put yourself in the delegate's place
and ask if he will feel cheated.'
Some of the most effective promotional conferences are those where the
organiser picks a broader management theme of genuine interest to its target
audience.
Cotton recently organised a conference for a computer company on the subject
of managing change within organisations. By sponsoring the debate, the
company was able to project itself in a favourable light without appearing
to be selling its own products.
The current recession has made companies opt for simpler events - even if
they can afford it, they may not wish to be seen to be putting on too lavish
a show - but presentations must still be exciting if they are to be
effective.
'We would dissuade a client from just putting on talking heads,' says
Cotton. 'People won't be able to concentrate on them for long and you can't
communicate with people who have fallen asleep.'
Even if the meeting is low-key, people have become accustomed to high
standards of presentation from television, pop concerts and opera and will
expect the same at a business presentation. While most conference venues
have skilled technicians who can help to ensure that the slide projector
works, it is often harder to get the speakers themselves to perform
effectively.
Cotton says she insists on briefing speakers, however eminent, on the theme
of the conference. She asks for a one-page synopsis of what they are going
to say and later a copy of the complete speech.
'Speakers can shoot off in different directions. There has to be a
progression in the speeches,' she says. If a speaker is unsure about his
ability to speak in public, then he must be persuaded to go on a course of
presentational skills.
But for many companies planning a meeting or a conference, the venue is the
first consideration. Venues may be functional or spectacular depending on
whether the intention is a straightforward discussion of some aspect of
business or to reward the sales team for a good performance, says Steven
Foulkes-Murray, founder of Meeting Places, a conference organiser. Country
house hotels, castles in Ireland and even cross-Channel ferries have been
used for meetings with a 'reward' element to them.
'You can pay a lot of money for a prestigious hotel on Park Lane but you
won't get value for money if you are holding a functional meeting. You might
be better off in a more modest venue.'
Whichever style of venue you choose make sure that it is accessible to the
people who are coming. If the sales team will all be turning up in their
company cars, do not choose a hotel or conference centre with no nearby
parking. If people will be flying in from around the world, make it central.
If most delegates will be using public transport, do not choose somewhere in
the middle of the country.
A hotel may be more convenient if the conference is to last longer than one
day because delegates will not need to travel to their accommodation. But
hotels, despite their attempts to improve the quality of their conference
service in recent years are not always the best venues.
Cotton says she prefers to use conference centres where the staff are
specialists in organising meetings rather than hotels which often regard
conference business as an adjunct to catering. An advantage of hotels is
that they can often provide smaller rooms but they frequently do not have
purpose-built facilities.
'You don't want to hold your meeting in a converted, L-shaped bedroom,' says
Foulkes-Murray.
If a company uses a professional events organiser, it may leave the details
to them. But if it deals directly with a conference centre, the company must
carry out its own checks.
It is less common now but still not unknown for companies to book a venue
without even visiting to see if it is suitable, says Jenny Lazell,
conference manager at the Sedgwick Centre in east London. 'People still
prepare their audio-visual aids without checking whether they are suitable
for the venue,' she says.
Whoever is responsible for organising the meeting should discuss all the
details with the centre, she advises. 'What looks good on paper often
doesn't work in practice.' It is unrealistic to expect delegates who have
arrived from all over the country to pitch straight into the conference
without a tea or a coffee or to sit through a morning of presentations
without a break.
Do not attempt to squeeze too much into a day, the experts advise. It is
unlikely that 300 people will be able to eat lunch in an hour. Not only are
they unlikely to taste their food, they will not have had time to chat to
old friends and contacts or go to the lavatory, says Gill Price, business
manager of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster.
Dietary requirements have become increasingly complex and conference
organisers need to take into account that some of their delegates may have
medical, philosophical or religious reasons for not eating certain menus,
says Price.
The details of a conference are best dealt with by one person at the
company, whether it is the managing director's secretary or a specialist
meetings organiser, says Lazell.
With the more ambitious conferences costing hundreds of thousands of pounds,
the cost of getting it wrong can be very high. The damage to a company's
image of a poorly handled event can also be considerable.
'There is a risk,' says Cotton. 'This is why you need to plan ahead rather
than fight fires.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Leadership defends
free-market strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG commitment to market economics espoused by the Liberal Democrat
leadership faced sustained attack from activists yesterday as the party
began to set the basis of its policymaking over the next three or four
years.
After a succession of speakers questioned the ability of market mechanisms
to deliver social welfare and adequate employment levels, the party's policy
committee said it would reconsider whether it had moved too far in a
free-market direction.
Amid a mood on the floor of the conference that the party risked shifting
too far to the right, Mr Alan Beith, the party's economics spokesman,
insisted that it maintain its unequivocal refusal to support devaluation of
the pound as a route out of the recession.
Echoing the government's argument that a realignment of sterling within the
exchange rate mechanism would lead to higher rather than lower interest
rates, he dismissed as 'dangerous nonsense' the idea that devaluation would
resolve underlying economic problems.
Mr Beith coupled the commitment to the present ERM parity with a demand that
the government adopt a package of measures both to bolster confidence on
financial markets and to stimulate economic growth. He suggested that a move
to the narrow band of the ERM and independence for the Bank of England be
coupled with a bold programme of spending on public infrastructure projects.
But during two fractious debates on the economy and on the party's broader
policy objectives, the party leadership faced a succession of calls for
policy to be directed towards economic growth and employment creation rather
than reassurance of the financial markets.
Mr Michael Smart, a delegate from London, caught the mood of the activists
with his comment that: 'The market is incapable of ending the growing evil
of mass unemployment, with all the human waste and misery it entails'.
The grassroots concern over a perceived shift to the right was reflected
also in an attempt by activists to throw out a paper that Mr Paddy Ashdown
had billed as the centrepiece of policymaking in the approach to the next
election.
The attempt was defeated by only a handful of votes and Lord Holme,
vice-president of the policy committee that had drawn up the consultation
document, conceded that the leadership would have to look again at the
balance the document struck between the role of free markets and the state.
Entitled Challenge, Opportunity and Responsibility, the document seeks to
reposition the party's policymaking on the themes of opportunity and
responsible individualism. It underlines a commitment to the market as 'the
best basis for providing opportunity and prosperity' alongside a drive to
create a high-skill economy through better education and training. It also
calls for environmental policy to be 'integrated' into the market through
taxation and environmental 'pricing'.
The emphasis on individual opportunity is designed to fill what the party
sees as a gap between Labour's domination by vested interests and the
'selfishness' promoted by the Conservatives.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Alton may quit in
abortion vote row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Alton, the party's MP for Mossley Hill said yesterday he would be
unable to stand again as a Liberal Democrat in any future election because
of yesterday's conference decision to develop a policy on abortion.
Mr Alton, who has been an MP since 1979, said: 'While this party policy
remains intact, I will not be able to fight for or recommend people to vote
for the Liberal Democrats.'
'It is sad that he feels he cannot stand again,' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
Liberal Democrat leader, said, 'but he has played no part in either the
building of the party or campaigning for it for four years now. His
departure, though sad, will not in any way alter the effectiveness of our
party or our capacity to put our message across.'
The conference overwhelmingly passed a motion - proposed by the Women's
Liberal Democrats - acknowledging that the area was one for the conscience
of the individual but regretting that the issue had been excluded from
discussion in the party's white paper on health.
The motion called for the National Health Service to give all women access
to an abortion within 14 days of one being sought.
NHS staff would still be able to refuse on ethical grounds to participate
directly, but would have to refer patients to colleagues who were willing to
participate.
Abortion has conventionally been an issue of conscience in political
parties, but both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have come under some
pressure to establish a party line in favour of more liberal abortion laws.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Wilson rejects pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VIGOROUS warning that the Liberal Democrats should resist 'siren calls'
for any form of political realignment came yesterday from Mr Des Wilson, who
was the party's campaigns co-ordinator during the April general election,
Alison Smith writes.
At a party rally last night, Mr Wilson said that it was politically
unrealistic to discuss deals with other parties, given the Labour party's
present attitude.
It represented a destructive waste of time that should be spent discussing
policies that were important, and also denied the party's historic role as
'the upholder of principle in politics.'
'What's the point of compromising so much to get power that you haven't the
freedom to do what's right when you've got it?' he asked.
He condemned the Labour party for reacting too readily to election defeats
by trying to become an even safer option to the electorate than the
Conservatives.
Mr Wilson hinted that the speech after the general election in which Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, raised the possibility of dialogue with
other parties, might have been an error.
He rejected the idea that disappointment with the election result might have
given rise to talk about co-operation with other organisations.
Instead, Mr Wilson - who left his unpaid post with the party after the
election - insisted that the party's 'success' in winning 20 seats and just
under 20 per cent of the popular vote across the country was consistent with
the 'outside hope' throughout the planning and carrying out of the campaign.
He urged the party to retain its independence and ability to face up to
difficult questions.
Much like a pressure group, he said, having a platform and organisation from
which to campaign could lead to changes even without conventional political
power.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Danish minister hopes
for French 'yes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S determination to keep control of social security policy and fears
that the Maastricht treaty would undermine Nato are concerns that would have
to be addressed at the Edinburgh EC summit, the Danish foreign minister said
at the conference yesterday.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said he hoped for a Yes vote in the French
referendum on Sunday, but that the Maastricht agreement would have to be
modified in some way - 'Maastricht-plus' - before the Danish government
would consider putting it to a second referendum for ratification.
A white paper from the Danish government is expected within the next few
weeks, and the Danes hope that the summit in early December will provide the
basis for an agreement, perhaps through new declarations or protocols, so
they will be able to hold a further referendum in the spring.
'There is a common interest in finding solutions. We're interested in
finding a solution that does as little harm as possible to European
integration,' he said at a press conference after his speech.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen refused to be drawn on whether it would be helpful for
the British to press ahead with ratification before a second Danish
referendum, but at the same time made clear that there was no prospect of
the Danish government trying to rush a referendum through to suit the
convenience of other member states or to meet the original timetable of
ratification by the end of this year.
Opposition to the treaty had come from across the political spectrum, he
added: some on the left had not wanted to give up control of the Danes'
generous social security arrangements, while others had been concerned that
the role envisaged for the Western European Union would cut across
transatlantic co-operation, or had not liked the idea of European
citizenship.
He said that the Danish result had shown how EC governments had been running
ahead of public opinion, and that it had given them a chance to put that
right before it was too late.
The Community must become more open and accountable and less bureaucratic;
critically through developing subsidiarity as a counter to centralising
tendencies.
'Unless the Community is able to convince the European populations that we
mean what we say when we talk about subsidiarity, the European integration
will be brought to an abrupt halt,' he warned.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Door to dialogue still
open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats are set to leave open the door to a dialogue with the
Labour party on issues such as electoral reform and social policy in spite
of the clear opposition at this week's conference to any form of electoral
pact, Philip Stephens writes.
Senior party strategists said that a formal motion on the issue of
co-operation with other political parties would bow to the fierce antagonism
among grassroots activists to a deal with Labour.
Mr Paddy Ashdown and his colleagues in the leadership acknowledge that any
attempt in the short term to open up formal discussions with Mr John Smith,
the Labour leader, would prompt a backlash among large sections of the
party. So the motion, due for debate by the conference tomorrow, will
explicitly rule out pacts.
It is understood, however, that Mr Ashdown is confident that the motion will
be sufficiently ambiguous to provide scope for informal contacts. The
Liberal Democrat leader has little expectation that Mr Smith will move in
the immediate future to explore the scope for an anti-government coalition.
But Mr Ashdown remains convinced that a loose alliance - probably short of
an electoral pact - is likely to provide the only convincing option for the
two opposition parties up to the general election due by mid 1997.
One suggestion is that the conclusions next year of Labour's commission on
electoral reform - which may recommend PR-based elections to the House of
Commons - may provide the catalyst for talks.
The judgment being made of the Labour leader's likely response is that for
the moment his preoccupation with internal reforms will preclude any public
nods in the direction of co-operation with the Liberal Democrats. But Mr
Ashdown expects Labour, like the Liberal Democrats, to keep its options
open.

capital industry.
Previous attempts by clearing banks to provide equity directly to banking
customers have failed, although all have venture capital subsidiaries.
National Westminster Bank merged its direct equity department with County
NatWest Ventures, its venture capital arm, last year after failing to
establish a viable operation.
Midland says it will employ venture capitalists rather than bankers to
assess and monitor investments. Bank managers will be briefed on the type of
customer best suited for equity finance.
The bank will provide ordinary and preference equity as well as loans to
established, profitable small businesses. It will normally appoint a
non-executive director to the company's board.
Mr David McMeekin, corporate finance director of Midland corporate banking,
said Midland expected to invest in between 12 and 20 companies a year.
The bank previously failed to raise outside finance for 11 regional venture
capital funds it hoped to create.
The recession and doubts about the returns from venture capital made it
difficult for Midland to raise the money from local investors. It will now
launch just two funds, covering the east Midlands and the Yorkshire and
Humberside area, providing amounts between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 250,000.
For its nationwide network of enterprise funds, Midland established links
with 700 professional firms in the regions that offered services below
normal rates to the investee companies. Those firms are expected to advise
and monitor the companies that which receive funding under the growth
capital scheme.
The creation of that scheme and of the enterprise funds is intended to give
Midland complete coverage of the venture capital spectrum.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Water watchdog hits back at 'alarmist' Greenpeace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Rivers Auth-ority, the water industry's environmental watchdog,
yesterday accused Greenpeace, the campaigning group, of issuing 'alarmist
propaganda' over river and sea pollution. It said Greenpeace had tried to
'force the world back through time'.
The attack by Lord Crickhowell, the former Cons-ervative cabinet minister
who chairs the authority, was a response to a month-long Greenpeace campaign
against the authority's system of issuing permits for discharging waste into
rivers. Greenpeace calls the system 'legal pollution'.
Tomorrow Greenpeace will publish a report called Filthy Fifty, listing what
it says are the 50 industrial plants licensed to discharge the most toxic
pollution into rivers and estuaries.
Lord Crickhowell's remarks also come a week before environment ministers
from the UK and 13 other countries meet in Paris to sign a treaty on marine
pollution.
He accused Greenpeace of treating the authority as an enemy. 'Alarmist
propaganda and publicity stunts may grab the headlines, but it is pressure
through the pollution-control system that is forcing the industry to clean
up its act,' he said.
The discharge permits issued by the authority were 'licences to protect' and
enabled industry to operate without polluting, he added.
The authority has also been attacked by water and sewerage companies that
have claimed that some of its standards have been unnecessarily and
expensively too high. Ofwat, the water industry's economic watchdog, in last
months's report on increases in water bills, also put pressure on the
authority to examine whether its interpretation of some environmental
legislation is too stringent.
Mr Paul Horsman, Greenpeace's waste campaigner, said: 'We are simply calling
for the elimination of substances that the Paris Commission (an
international conference on discharging waste at sea) called for in 1974.
The Thames now supports fish mainly because the removal of sewage has
improved the oxygen content, but you still can't eat the fish.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / 'We're yuppie miners - we're well paid': British Coal is
close to extensive restructuring, coal supply contracts that will pave the
way for privatisation are almost complete. The corporation has already
undergone radical change since the miners' strike of the mid 1980s / In
coalfield communities, miners are well accustomed to change and have
surprisingly few worries about the coming upheavals

<TEXT>
David and Paul, in their early 30s, have been with British Coal since they
left school at 15 and work at Rufford colliery, Nottinghamshire.
David: We're all yuppie miners - we're well paid. The big change came after
the strike.
Paul: It's what MacGregor (Lord MacGregor, former British Coal chairman)
said: there would be fewer men, earning more money.
David: That's what it's all about now, getting as much as possible for the
job. We basically work what hours we can work. We've all bought Coal Board
houses; bought them then sold them. You sell it, you improve yourself, then
you move again.
I vote Labour, but I can accept that they've had to change with the times.
You do get Conservatives - you don't get the attitude that we're
working-class - we'll vote Labour.
Paul: You lose before you start if you have the attitude of fighting the
management; we're all on the same side. There is a young and good management
here.
When the new manager arrived, we'd had two review meetings, we were losing a
lot of money, we'd failed to invest. Morale fell, overtime dried up. but now
with these new machines we can earn enough to get new cars, pay our
mortgages off.
David: British Coal at this pit listens to our advice about how to work the
mine.
Paul: We're the experts, we'll have a discussion and we'll resolve it.
Paul: Some people have left and now they're low-paid taxi drivers on Pounds
130 a week. They're sorry they left. When we were 16 it was Pounds 31 a week
and that was a good wage, it was Pounds 12 to Pounds 15 anywhere else. It's
always been a good wage. I hope we'll get some shares. Most of us have
Telecoms.
David: We've got to produce cheap coal, but its still too much. You get
firms like PowerGen - they buy our coal and say they want it cheaper. You
never get a reduction in your electricity bill - they'll keep the
difference.
Tom Watson manages Westoe colliery in South Shields.
I've always been in the north-east and always with British Coal.
We've produced at considerably less than Pounds 1.50 per gigajoule, and
that's our target this year. But we are at a disadvantage because of the
transport costs of coal to the south-east.
No, the costs won't significantly reduce now, we're on the hard part. We'll
have to work hard to get any further. But there are still efficiency schemes
to introduce - and bigger and better machines that will give better
performance.
In recent years, each colliery has had to buy its own machinery, so we could
only buy what we could afford.
People in the north-east are generally concerned about the state of the
industry and don't know if they have a future. The media hype gets through
to a young person who may have moved two to three times already.
I share their concerns. We don't have a power station on our doorstep, and
that makes it harder.
But I want to be in the frame, I want to be the manager of a pit that's
privatised. I need to meet my target, I want to be top of the league.
What you've got now in this industry is people who are committed and want to
see it go on - the disenchanted people are the older ones. There are
actually people here in the older age bracket who want to go but I can't let
them go because I need the men.
But it's much the same culture as it always was - the characteristic
dialogue, humour, sharing problems. I don't see that any different than when
I was a lad.
Clive Ponder, manager at Markham colliery, Derbyshire. Joined British Coal
in 1974 after gaining a degree in mining engineering.
My father was in mining. He said 'don't go into it', because the Robens era
in the 1960s had closed a lot of pits. Also, it's hard work and long hours.
But I never thought of doing anything else; I loved it.
I joined for life. That had always been the way. The colliery used to
revolve round the pit village. They went on the bus to Blackpool and
Skegness for their holidays; probably rented accommodation from the Coal
Board. It's totally different now. They probably have massive mortgages.
They want all the perks their neighbours have.
Of course we've had problems. You can't come down from 2,500 men to near
1,250 without problems, but the men are realistic. They have done what was
necessary to do to keep the pit going.
It's a very young workforce. The average age is 32, they have a couple of
children, they can't afford to be off work. About 99 per cent of miners here
have worked at another pit that closed, and they don't want that to happen.
Everybody is here because they want to stop here. Everyone who wanted to go
has taken voluntary redundancy. There is a very honest and friendly
environment between me and the men. They'll say 'not like that, gaffer' if
they disagree, but they won't not do it. We're not fighting for Pounds 10
more a week now, we're fighting to survive.'
Privatisation holds no concern for me. But I wish they'd get the size of the
market agreed.'
Bill Cook, Glen Hardy and Keith Harris, union officials at Markham,
Derbyshire. Keith joined in 1965, Glen in 1962 and Bill in 1966.
Glen: This industry has been the ruination of itself. We weren't answerable
to anyone, and it was unbelievable the amount of money that was wasted. It
was never realised by either the workforce or the industry that it had to be
managed the way you would your own company. Now people feel they have
responsibility.
Keith: We can never compete with foreign coal, and if we did they'd just
drop the price.
Bill: When oil was cheap we never knew the real price of coal; and now it's
gas. The EC thinks it's madness to close pits and madness to buy imported
coal - then there's the risk to the balance of payments. If I could buy my
electricity elsewhere I would.
David Moult, manager of Welbeck colliery, Nottinghamshire. In his early 30s,
he is one of the youngest British Coal managers.
People used to treat this like an institution which provided them with
something to do; somewhere to live. The Coal Board owned all the shops and
houses - the pubs - so all the money the men earned went back into the Coal
Board.
Now, they're in their early 30s with a high percentage of homeowners. A lot
live outside the local villages, have nice cars - maybe two. Every village
still has a miners' welfare, but they struggle because they don't get
custom. A lot of the men don't want to mix with miners out of work.
Change has been forced on the men. They know they have to keep the cheapest
coal in the industry as well as the cheapest coal overall to survive.
Of course there are still hardliners. But no matter who you talk to they all
have the same aim - to make sure they have a job.
Privatisation doesn't worry me either way. Even as a nationalised industry
we are striving to be competitive. But somebody has to decide what they
want. We can't be left to close a few pits every year.
The trouble is that nobody really has an energy policy. Let's know where we
stand. If the government wants to burn gas, that's fine, but there should be
a stated policy.
Jane Jones helps redundant miners find new jobs at the job shop run by
British Coal Enterprise in Dawdon, Newcastle.
We've gone down from 15 to five collieries in the region, so a lot of men
are looking for jobs. They end up doing all sorts of things - one had a
ballroom dancing business, someone did antique restoration, we even had a
priest. One miner went to drama school: we saw him recently, and he said he
wakes up in the morning and can't believe it's him.
It usually takes about two months to re-employ them. Only about 1 per cent
are impossible to place, but we don't give up even after two years. Miners
are very resilient people; they will survive. A lot of younger ones go and
work offshore, so they don't take salary cuts.

The Ministry of Defence has said a decision on who will build the aviation

But Mr Clark, visiting Swan Hunter on the Tyne, said the government should

shedding jobs and are in need of more orders, are both bidding for the

THE MARKET in health and slimming foods has more than doubled over five
years, a report from Euromonitor says.
The report suggests that sales of health foods such as vitamins, organic
produce, slimming and dietetic aids have grown at an average annual rate of
30 per cent since 1986 to Pounds 492m last year.
Germans spend an average of Dollars 32 (Pounds 16.20) a year on such foods,
buying more than twice as much as Britons (Dollars 15). Italians buy less
than half as much as people in the UK (Dollars 6).

FRAUD LOSSES on gold cards have reached the point where banks could be
forced to consider withdrawing them from the market, according to Mr Barry
Fergus, head of fraud prevention at Barclaycard.
Speaking on Channel 4 television today, Mr Fergus warns that gold cards have
suffered counterfeiting of epidemic proportions. He says that much of the
counterfeiting takes place in the Far East.
'If the losses are not brought under control, you have to question how much
longer the products can be sustained,' Mr Fergus said. Losses on card fraud
cost the banks Pounds 165m last year.

FT  15 SEP 92 / End to N Ireland broadcast ban urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Michael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, yesterday demanded an
end to the ban on broadcasting the voices of people representing
organisations in Northern Ireland considered to be extremist, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
The call from Sir Michael follows the controversy created by a BBC decision
to subtitle many of the comments made by Mrs Bernadette McAlisky, a former
Northern Ireland MP, in a recorded programme on Ulster's troubles.
The BBC director-general said yesterday that the broadcasting ban introduced
in 1988 was a 'totally unacceptable interference' with the editorial
process. He said he would appeal strongly to ministers for an end to the
ban.
Mr Peter Bottomley, a former Conservative Northern Ireland minister,
complained to the BBC about the subtitles. Mr Bottomley said Mrs McAliskey
was not a member of any violent organisation. He said the BBC's action had
put her life at risk.

FT  15 SEP 92 / ITC defends proposed arrangements for ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE independent Television Commission yesterday defended proposed
arrangements for the ITV network yesterday in spite of implicit criticism of
some of the suggestions by the Office of Fair Trading.
The commission emphasised in its formal response to the OFT that the 1990
Broadcasting Act allows ITV companies both to broadcast and to make
programmes, and that licences have been granted on that basis.
'The competition test should not therefore be interpreted in a way which
treats vertical integration of this kind as either undesirable in practice
or unacceptable in principle,' the ITC says.
The OFT has a statutory responsibility to ensure that arrangements for the
ITV network are fair, including fair access for independent producers to the
commissioning system.
Last month the OFT said it had identified a number of potentially
anti-competitive elements in the new ITV networking arrangements. They
included proposals that prevent independent producers contracting directly
with the ITV network, and ITV insistence that it wants to buy programme
rights for 10 years with a further five-year option.
On contracting, the ITC says responsibility for compliance with regulatory
requirements must rest with ITV companies because the ITC can impose
sanctions only on its licensees.
The ITC also says that when a broadcaster fully funds a programme 'there
should be a period in which it alone can benefit without the programme being
available to UK broadcasting competitors'. The ITC does not, however,
suggest that period should be 15 years.
The OFT made clear in last month's consultative document that it would not
reach firm conclusions until the outcome of further discussions had been
fully analysed. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, will
make a full report on networking arrangements by December.
At least 100 jobs are to go at the recently merged Yorkshire and Tyne-Tees
Television. At present, the group employs about 1,400 people. The job losses
will remove duplication in administration and programme-making.

FT  15 SEP 92 / NVQs criticised as too restrictive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the new National Vocational Qualifications are too narrow and
job-specific, an Institute of Manpower Studies report said yesterday.
The report - which the institute said was produced under contract with the
Department of Employment - draws particularly on experience of NVQs in the
construction industry.
NVQs, the new national system of assessment based on competence in the
workplace, are being introduced across the whole spectrum of employment.
Employer-led bodies, called industry lead bodies, advised on the contents of
the new qualifications which were drawn up by the National Council for
Vocational Qualifications.
There are several criticisms of the qualifications in the report, including
the view that they suffer from poor general recognition and a lack of
information to employers, employees and training providers. 'As yet, most
people cannot even conceptualise what owning an NVQ means,' the report says.
'Many NVQs are limited and too mechanistic and restrictive,' it says. 'Often
their educational content has been squeezed out along with pedagogic
concerns.'
The study says the narrowness of employer-defined competence training
highlights the conflict between the short-term needs of employers for very
specific skills and the long-term interests and training needs of trainees,
the industry, and the economy. 'It brings into question whether it is in the
interests of individuals to have such narrow and partial training.'
The report adds that in their present form NVQs are unlikely to change
either the incentive for employers to train people or the take-up of
vocational training.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Ministers delay Ulster electricity sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLETION of the privatisation of Northern Ireland's electricity industry
was postponed last night.
Unexpectedly Mr Robert Atkins, the province's economy minister, said a
number of outstanding matters needed to be resolved. 'The most important of
these relates to the funding of the proposed interconnector to Scotland and
an application which the government has made to the European Commission for
assistance towards its costs,' he explained.
'The government strongly supports the application and hopes for its success,
but recognises the need for the Commission to undertake a thorough
evaluation of it.
'Consequently, although one option for the flotation of Northern Ireland
Electricity (NIE) was November 1992, it will not be possible to complete the
sale this autumn.'
NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector
project earlier this year, and the government is believed to be seeking
about Pounds 70m from the Commission towards the cost of construction.
The first part of the sell-off took place in April when Ulster's four power
stations went into private hands.
British Gas bought the biggest station, Ballylumford near Larne; Nigen, an
American-Belgian consortium, acquired Kilroot and Belfast West; and a
management-employee buy-out team bought the Coolkeeragh plant at
Londonderry. The sales grossed about Pounds 300m for the Treasury's coffers.
It had been anticipated that the transmission, distribution and supply
business would raise another Pounds 350m for the government. Advertisements
have been running almost nightly on Ulster Television. NIE is the last UK
electricity company to be privatised and is small and isolated in comparison
with the distribution companies on the mainland, David Lascelles writes.
The government is keen to create an interconnector with Scotland to improve
sources of supply and sharpen competition. A link with the Irish Republic
has also been proposed.
The Scottish link, rated at 250MW, would be capable of supplying 20 per cent
of Northern Ireland's electricity demand, although as the province's own
generation capacity expands it might begin exporting power to Scotland.
There are also plans to connect Northern Ireland to the UK gas pipeline
network.
The delay means that NIE will now probably have to wait for the completion
of the sale of British Coal.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Rail's InterCity sector is to launch a vigorous marketing campaign
tomorrow to try to counteract a decline in revenues caused by the recession,
Richard Tomkins writes.
InterCity, which receives no government subsidy, reported operating profits
of just Pounds 2m in the year to March. It has since taken steps to cut its
cost base, notably through the ending of services to Shrewsbury, Shropshire;
Cleethorpes, Humberside; and Blackpool, Lancashire.
The marketing campaign is believed to include a relaunch of the scheme
offering free travel to shoppers collecting vouchers from Boots stores, and
a revamp of the Silver Standard service for holders of full-fare standard
class tickets.

FT  15 SEP 92 / TUC-Labour linkage forecast to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO MEMBER of the body set up to review the links between the Labour party
and the trade unions wants to break those links, according to Ms Diana
Jeuda, an official with the shopworkers union Usdaw and a leading member of
the body.
The review body. which met yesterday, is not due to produce a report until
the middle of next year, for full debate at next year's Labour Party
conference, but already the private debate is in full swing.
Last week's TUC Congress in Blackpool did not formally debate the link, but
it was the subject of one of the best attended fringe meetings.
Ms Jeuda's view that 'nobody on the body supports divorce' would certainly
be welcomed by most of the leaders of affiliated unions assembled in
Blackpool. But several are keen on a radical loosening of the link and
realise that to have any effective national voice they require a broader
political strategy.
The congress was remarkably free of mournful references to Labour's fourth
consecutive election defeat. The high point was an address from Mr Howard
Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, and after
the congress there was talk of inviting a cabinet minister to next year's
TUC.
The TUC provided an example of why some people believe the link is bad for
both sides. Mr John Edmonds set off a stampede of calls for the devaluation
of sterling. He was, arguably, just saying what union leaders should have
been saying for months, but they have not done so because they feared
undermining the Labour party and its anti-inflationary credibility.
Now that they have cast that constraint aside, they will either succeed in
changing Labour's policy, thus undermining the party's claim to speak for
the country as a whole, or at least create a row between the two 'wings' of
the labour movement.
Most union leaders recognise the limits of being tied to a declining
political force, which a large proportion of their members vote against. But
few of those leaders can contemplate an end to all direct influence in the
party.
The argument as to how far to go is wide open. The idea of converting the 5m
political levy payers in the unions, most of whom are unaware that they pay
the levy, into 'associate members' of the party is widely regarded as too
complex and a recipe for bankrupting the party.
The best guess is that the union block vote at the Labour conference, the
key element of the link, will continue to decline to below 50 per cent and
will not be cast as a block.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Engineering faces decline in orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORDERS TO engineering companies in the West Midlands, traditionally the
heart of UK manufacturing, have slowed again after a brief surge in the
spring, dissipating the belief that economic recovery has started.
The Engineering Employers Federation in the West Midlands, which surveyed
520 companies, reported yesterday that, in the three months to August, 39
per cent of companies had seen orders decline, compared with 25 per cent in
the three months to May.
The proportion of companies receiving more orders shrank to 31 per cent in
the August quarter from 46 per cent in the May quarter.
Mr David Botterill, the federation's regional chief executive, said:
'Similarly, more companies are now experiencing a reduction in the
utilisation of their manufacturing capacity than was the case in the spring.
More plans for capital investment appear to have been shelved for the time
being as cashflows worsen.'
Evidence of the retarded recovery from recession has dented business
confidence. More than half the companies in the federation's West Midlands
May survey had expected an improvement in orders - now the proportion has
fallen to 30 per cent.

disciplinary body for breaches of investment business regulations.
RA McLeod of Windsor, was fined Pounds 500 and ordered to pay Pounds 250 in
costs by the disciplinary committee of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales following hearings last month.
The firm failed to give adequate warnings of the risks involved to a client
relating to certain investments, failed to send engagement letters and
failed to keep proper records in accordance with regulations.
Sowerbutts &amp; Co, based in Camberley, Surrey, was fined Pounds 500 and
ordered to pay Pounds 250 costs for a series of breaches of regulations
including failing to keep adequate records.
Bygott Burn of Grimsby, Humberside, was reprimanded and ordered to pay
Pounds 250 costs for handling a money from an investment business client
when not authorised to do so.
In addition, Mr Peter Downey of Horner, Downey &amp; Co in Bromborough,
Merseyside, was reprimanded, fined Pounds 1,000 and ordered to pay Pounds
500 costs for 13 issues surrounding the audit of a limited company since
1986.
He failed to prepare the accounts in accordance with the format laid down in
the Companies Acts, statements of standard accounting practice and auditing
standards.

FOOTBALL sponsorship on a different scale arrived yesterday. John
Waddington, the Leeds-based games maker, announced that its table-top
Subbuteo football players will display on their shirts the logos of some of
the companies that sponsor real-life soccer teams.
Around 250,000 Subbuteo sets are sold in 50 countries each year, with about
15m miniature players involved. But no money is changing hands in this
particular 'transfer' deal; Sharp (shirt sponsor of Manchester United), JVC
(Arsenal) and leisure-wear manufacturer Admiral (Leeds United) will have
their names appear on the little men for free.
Not all sponsored teams will feature; those involving alcohol will be
excluded, as unsuitable for a children's toy.
'Sponsorship is playing an increasingly important role and we thought it
only right that Subbuteo players should be kitted out in the same strip as
their larger counterparts,' said Waddington.
Subbuteo has been paid for sponsorships in the past; Cadbury and Rowntree
each paid about Pounds 4,000 to have their logos printed on perimeter fence
advertising in the special edition 1990 World Cup sets.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Civil servants accept pay terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION AMONG unions to widespread reform of Civil Service pay bargaining
ended yesterday when the NUCPS union agreed to accept this year's pay deal.
The NUCPS had been the last of four Civil Service unions to resist deals
that couple this year's pay offers - worth about 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent
 -to the acceptance of increased use of performance-related pay and
devolution of pay bargaining, in some cases to departments.
A fifth union, the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, has negotiated a deal
with the Inland Revenue that does not include a specific commitment to
performance-related pay, but tacitly accepts that it will happen in the next
year.
The government announced last year that it wanted changes to pay agreements,
but all five unions expressed scepticism and, in some cases, opposition.
The NUCPS balloted its members, then told the government it would accept the
pay offer, which added 4.1 per cent to basic rates, but rejected the pay
bargaining changes. The government withdrew the offer, but is likely to
renew it after the union's change of stance.
Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, is understood to have told his
union's executive yesterday that the government was likely to impose a lower
deal on civil servants unless the deal was accepted.
The NUCPS might also lose its negotiating rights and a long-term agreement
that guarantees members a pay deal each year falling in the middle 50 per
cent of private-sector settlements in the previous 12 months.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Single-person households rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGLE people living alone will make up more than 30 per cent of all UK
households by the end of the decade, the biggest growth being in single-male
households.
By the year 2000, 40 per cent of all British households will be either
single-person or single-parent, according to a study published yesterday by
Mintel, the international research agency.
The UK now has 6m single-person households - 26 per cent of the total -
compared with 12 per cent in 1961.
Increased life expectancy, higher divorce rates and people marrying at a
later age have put the notion of UK family life under pressure, Mintel says.
The average life expectancy from birth is now 73 years for men and 78.5
years for women. The number of divorces has increased from 158,000 in 1981
to 170,000 last year.
The mean age for first marriages has risen from 25.7 for men in 1983 to 27.2
last year, and from 23.5 to 25 for women in the same period.
Mintel says those demographic shifts will mean that by the year 2000 a
quarter of purchasing decisions will be made by a person living alone.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Unions cool on fresh Tube deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Underground has failed to win over rail union negotiators in spite of
an 11th-hour improvement in an offer of compensation to staff for the
biggest shake-up in working practices and pay for 40 years.
The offer of an additional 1 per cent means that the compensation would add
5.8 per cent to the pay bill.
London Underground is one of the few public utilities to have escaped
radical reform of working practices in recent years. Previous attempts have
failed partly because the workforce is highly unionised and industrial
action causes chaos for the capital's workforce.
The offer came on the last day of a week of negotiations during which the
two sides met from morning until night at the Watford Hilton in an attempt
to kick-start talks that have been stalled for months.
The package aims to improve productivity through more flexible work
practices and simplified pay and grading structures. It means the loss of
5,000 jobs over five years.
All three rail unions say they still have reservations about the deal, which
means 21 per cent of staff face pay cuts while 71 per cent would gain.
The employment package includes some improved benefits such as travel
concessions for gay and lesbian partners of London Underground staff.
Aslef, the train drivers' union, said it believed the package was
unacceptable but it would consult members.
The RMT, the biggest rail union, said: 'Even with the extra 1 per cent,
there are still too many losers.'
The TSSA white-collar rail union said it had found the week disappointing,
but was still studying the proposals.
London Underground said there was no prospect of the plan failing.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Fewer firms do more audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUDIT of quoted com-panies is becoming increasingly concentrated in the
hands of a few accountancy firms, according to an academic study published
yesterday.
The top eight firms audited 79 per cent of the market last year, compared
with 64 per cent in 1987, according to an analysis by Ms Vivien Beattie and
Ms Stella Fearnley of the University of Southampton.
The top four firms alone audited 59 per cent of quoted companies last year,
compared with 43 per cent in 1987. The top 20 firms audited 90 per cent of
the market last year.
The study was based on 2,079 companies quoted on the Stock Exchange main
market or unlisted securities market over the past four years.
More than 100 firms have just one listed company as their sole audit client,
and 39 firms - or 18 per cent of the total - have dropped out of the listed
client audit market in the period.
Just over 16 per cent of companies voluntarily changed their auditors during
the period, most changing only once. Those who switched moved to a larger
audit firm.
The study shows that the rate of change of auditors slowed last year to 3.8
per cent of companies, compared with 5.2 per cent in 1990 and 6.1 per cent
in 1988.

THE RECESSION is continuing to depress domestic air travel, although
international traffic is showing further signs of recovery.
The latest traffic figures released yesterday by BAA, the airports operator,
showed a disappointing increase last month of just under 2 per cent in
domestic traffic at its UK airports compared with August last year.
'Although we are now starting to see the end of the Gulf war effect on our
business, we are now seeing the full effect of the recession on our domestic
business,' BAA said.
A recovery in international traffic turned last month into the busiest on
record for BAA, whose airports handled a total of 8.2m passengers. That was
a 9 per cent increase on August last year.

A GROUP of 12 former managers and staff of Land Travel, which collapsed in
July, have set up a new holiday company selling coach trips on the
Continent, Michael Skapinker writes.
Tours Direct says it will be based on ethical principles and will apply for
membership of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). Land Travel
was not a member of Abta and had no bonding, which meant that more than
40,000 customers lost their money.
It is likely that the new company will have to demonstrate to Abta that its
managers were not directly involved in the events that led to Land Travel's
demise.
Two former senior Land Travel managers, Ms Elke Jantzen and Mrs Diana
Kenning, are joint senior managers of the new company. Mr David Kenning, a
Tours Direct non-executive director and Mrs Kenning's husband, said that
neither woman had been a director of Land Travel.

FT  15 SEP 92 / R-R Power offshoot wins Singapore contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEI PARSONS, part of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, has won a
Pounds 100m order, against international competition to supply three 250MW
steam turbine generators for the Pulau Seraya power station in Singapore.
The order, placed by the Public Utilities Board of Singapore, will mean
recruitment next year of more than 100 shopfloor employees at Parsons'
Newcastle upon Tyne plant, which has halved its workforce to 2,500 since the
mid 1980s. A few design engineers will be recruited immediately.
The new contract, coupled with a Pounds 70m Indian order won in May for two
turbine generators, means security of employment for Parsons' existing
workforce for several years.
The first of the three turbine generators for Singapore will be installed
and fully operative by October 1995. The other two will follow at
six-monthly intervals.
NEI Parsons beat six European and Japanese companies to win the order, which
also includes condensing and feed heating plant and associated equipment.
'We have beaten the Japanese in the Far East,' the company said.
Mr Trevor Murch, Parsons managing director, said the order would provide
'very valuable work' for the company over the next four years. He said it
could also strengthen prospects by proving that it was world-competitive.
Mr Barney McGill, convener, said: 'In the last few years there has certainly
been a very good pulling together. It's been rewarded all round.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / BCCI secrets 'put on sale: Accountants accused of seeking
documents deal with lawyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACCOUNTANT seconded to the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into the
collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International offered to sell highly
confidential information from the inquiry and doctor evidence to help
prevent the prosecutions of suspects, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.
Mr Mark Braley, 25, of Hayes, west London, and Mr Bernard Lynch, 28, an
accountant of Forest Hill, south London, denied conspiring to pervert the
course of justice. The men are accused of plotting between September and
October last year to 'remove, substitute, destroy, deface or copy documents
or provide information relating to the investigation into BCCI, Syed
Ziauddin Ali Akbar, Sushma Puri and Christopher Williams'.
Mr Timothy Langdale QC, prosecuting, said: 'The authorities in this country
and the US were concerned that criminal offences appeared to have been
committed by individuals involved in the administration of the bank (BCCI)
and by other individuals associated with the bank.
'The SFO investigation was one that was and is - because it is still
continuing - large-scale and wide-ranging. The banks and individuals whose
activities merit inquiry are numerous.' Mr Akbar, a former BCCI official,
was one of the individuals.
Mr Langdale said the allegation was that Mr Braley and Mr Lynch put their
heads together to supply documents and other confidential and sensitive
information to Mr Michael Barratt, Mr Akbar's solicitor. 'They thought he
would be bound to be interested in such material and would be ready to pay
good money because it would assist his client in avoiding prosecution or, if
prosecuted, would substantially reduce the effectiveness of the case against
him.'
He said the plan was frustrated because Mr Barratt went to the police after
the initial approach, made by Mr Lynch. Mr Barratt was fitted with a
concealed recording device and taped subsequent meetings.
The jury, said Mr Langdale, would hear the tapes of meetings between the
three men.
'Once Mr Braley's identity and purpose were revealed to the police
investigators, he and Mr Lynch were arrested at the London hotel where the
final meeting took place,' said Mr Langdale.
He told the jury that the trial did not prejudge issues in the SFO inquiry.
'You will hear numbers of names mentioned of those in whom SFO had an
interest,' he said. 'This trial does not in any way involve any
consideration as to whether any of those people are guilty of any offences.'
The SFO had assembled a large investigation team including lawyers, police
and accountants, and Mr Braley had been on it.
Mr Lynch had met Mr Barratt through their membership of the Barbican health
and fitness centre in London. Mr Lynch had boasted that his clients included
cabinet ministers and that he had contacts on the legal and surveillance
teams at the SFO.
In fact, the jury heard, he worked for a dairy firm and his only contact was
Mr Braley. He told Mr Barratt he could have 'copies of almost anything
within reason', but his contacts were not in it for 'peanuts'.
Mr Braley had worked for Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm,
and was drafted into the BCCI investigation after failing his proficiency
exams, the jury heard.
The jury was also told that both men had pleaded guilty to conspiring
corruptly to obtain a consideration from Mr Barratt and that Mr Braley had
admitted the theft of four share certificates from HM Customs.
The trial was adjourned until today.

<TEXT>
TEXTRON Lycoming, the aero-engine division of the US Textron group, has
reached a long term collaboration agreement with the Yakovlev Design Bureau
to re-engine Russian YAK-40 regional jetliners.
The US company also plans to provide engines for a proposed Russian widebody
business jet, the YAK-48.
The agreement reflects increasing Russian efforts to upgrade their existing
aerospace products and future programmes to western standards.
Rolls-Royce of the UK and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US are already involved in
Russian aircraft re-engining programmes as Russian manufacturers step up
their drive to try to market their products in western markets to earn hard
currency.
Textron Lycoming will be working with Yakovlev on plans to replace the three
Russian engines powering the YAK-40 regional jet with two Lycoming LF507
turbofans.
The YAK-40 is a 27-32 passenger regional jetliner specifically designed to
fly in and out of smaller airports throughout the Commonwealth of
Independent States and eastern Europe where runway conditions can be rough.
Depending on the needs of airlines in the Russian federation, all or a part
of the current YAK-40 fleet of about 1,000 aircraft could be candidates for
the re-engining programme.

THE US and the EC this week are starting fresh talks in Geneva in the hopes
of averting Dollars 1bn in US sanctions and a ruinous trade war over the
Community's oilseeds subsidies.
Both sides have sent signals that they are ready to find grounds for
settlement. EC officials have hinted they may be able to modify their
subsidies to cut production when they implement new acreage reduction
provisions of the Common Agriculture Policy.
The American Soyabean Association (ASA) has won two cases against the EC in
the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), and has
urged tough action by the US. Now it is showing signs that it is ready to
compromise on a proposal which is 'meaningful, real and enforceable.'
An ASA spokesman said it was 'important that the EC bring forth a proposal
that is a solid step towards addressing the injury suffered by US soyabean
producers'.
If the talks fail to reach agreement, the US has until Friday to notify the
Gatt Council that it wants the issue on its September 29 agenda. At that
time it could announce its intention to impose sanctions.

<TEXT>
THE future of a small Caribbean airline is being threatened by the dispute
between the US and the UK over liberalising air services between the two
countries and the proposed British Airways acquisition of a 44 per cent
stake in USAir.
Cayman Airways, the national carrier of the UK Caribbean dependency, has
warned it risks going out of business unless it secures relief from what it
regards as excessive competition from US airlines on the Miami-Grand Cayman
route.
It wants the UK to resume negotiations with the US to limit US flights from
Miami to Grand Cayman from four to three services a day.
Negotiations between the two countries broke down this year after the UK
rejected US demands for greater access to the UK market in return for
dropping one daily service to Grand Cayman.
The UK dependency is now urging the UK government to offer new concessions
to US airlines to clear the way for an agreement on limiting US flights to
the Cayman Islands and safeguarding the future of Cayman Airways.
US carriers have recently intensified pressure on their government to
negotiate new rights for more US airline services to London and regional UK
airports.
They have asked their government to block BA's proposed alliance with USAir
unless they can secure these additional rights. In turn, the UK has defended
the BA-USAir deal and refused to grant US airlines greater access into the
UK unless UK carriers gain more access to the US.
Cayman Airways has complained that the UK appears to feel a giant carrier
like BA needs more protection from US competition than the tiny Cayman
Airways, which operates a fleet of four Boeing 737 jets.
After showing a small operating profit in 1989, Cayman Airways has seen its
losses grow as US airlines have stepped up competition on the Miami-Grand
Cayman route.
The airline lost Dollars 2.6m (Pounds 1.31m) in 1990, Dollars 8.6m last year
and Dollars 9.2m for the 12 months ended last June. Price Waterhouse has
declared the airline insolvent.
It has continued to be propped up by large cash infusions from the Cayman
Islands government with a subsidy, in the latest year, equivalent to 10 per
cent of the Cayman Islands government's entire budget. The government says
it can no longer sustain such support. Ansett, the domestic Australian
airline owned jointly by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and
Australia-based transportation company TNT, has forged marketing links with
British Airways, United Airlines, Cathay Pacific and All Nippon Airways,
AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
The arrangements replace a marketing agreement between Ansett and Qantas
Australia's government-owned international carrier.

FT  15 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Unctad reverts to Keynes for reflation
recipe - More government investment and interest rate cuts top UN forum's
priority list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) could be
excused for feeling a bit upstaged by yesterday's cut in German interest
rates. Its annual report, prepared in July but only published today,*
advocates just that.
Unctad wants 1980s monetarism abandoned and a return to Keynesian policies
on an international scale in an effort to pull the world out of recession.
Higher government investment spending and a big cut in German interest rates
top its list of recommendations.
Without such measures, Unctad says, the 'debt deflation' afflicting the
world's leading economies, notably those of the US, Japan and Britain, could
ensure another 'lost decade' in the 1990s. Unctad, a forum for north-south
dialogue, emphasises that third world development depends on the economic
health of the industrialised world.
Timing the publication of its report ahead of the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank later this month, Unctad
challenges the IMF orthodoxy that cutting budget deficits is the key to
world economic well-being. Unctad believes that, without a radical change of
course, recovery from the most severe global recession since the second
world war will be feeble at best.
Its economists argue that standard economic models have failed to capture
the impact of debt on spending behaviour, causing policy advisers repeatedly
to be over-optimistic about the timing and strength of the upturn.
Where asset prices are tumbling and interest rates are at high levels,
households and businesses are scrambling to cut indebtedness. Banks,
constrained by tougher capital requirements and bruised by bad loans, are
equally reluctant to lend. In these circumstances, Unctad argues, the
private sector cannot lead the way out of recession.
Governments must 'resume their responsibilities by acting to foster a return
to financial stability and to stimulate the level of economic activity'.
Unctad's prescriptions sound less iconoclastic today than only two months
ago when the report went to press. The report calls for higher government
spending to boost incomes, focused on investment and designed to be
withdrawn once expansion is under way to minimise the impact on inflation
and interest rates.
Last month, Japan announced a massive Dollars 87bn package to boost the
Japanese economy, the bulk of which comprises public spending on investment
projects. Even in the US, where the budget deficit is running at more than
Dollars 300bn a year, pressure is growing for a short-term fiscal stimulus
to jump-start the economy.
The report urges reductions in German short-term interest rates to Japanese
and US levels, to permit a general cut in rates throughout Europe and ease
tensions within the European Monetary System.
It also calls on the US Federal Reserve Board to revert to pre-1979 policies
of targeting interest rates instead of the money supply. Moves by the Fed to
cut short-term rates - with no fewer than two dozen cuts since mid-1990 -
have left long-term rates high because investors fear rates will rise again
once the recovery begins, it says.
The world economy is in a 'danger zone,' in which recovery is threatened by
financial fragility 'brought about by a combination of financial
liberalisation, tight monetary policies and bank deregulation' in the 1980s.
Financial deregulation encouraged households and businesses to go deeper
(and more riskily) into debt, in the expectation that asset prices and
incomes would continue to rise.
Debtors now face not only falling real incomes but falling asset values at a
time of historically high interest rates.
Attempts by the private sector to reduce debt, for instance, by trying to
sell their houses or other assets, simply reduces asset values further,
lowers incomes and prolongs the recession.
Mr Kenneth Dadzie, Unctad's secretary-general, says: 'If the 1980s were
dominated by the debt crisis in the developing world, the 1990s have started
under the shadow of one in the developed.'
Lowering short-term interest rates has averted full-scale debt deflation in
the US and Japan, the report says. But it is not sufficient to stimulate
recovery because no one wants to borrow more while incomes and asset prices
remain depressed.
With no single country strong enough to act as locomotive for a global
recovery, Unctad harks back to the 1970s with a plea for co-ordinated
reflation by the leading economic powers.
The report predicts that present policies will lead to only a sluggish
revival of the world economy. Its forecasts of 3 per cent output growth next
year after 1.5 per cent this year already look over-optimistic. World trade
is expected to rise by 6.2 per cent in 1993 from 5.2 per cent in 1992.
Long-term projections for the 1990s suggest little improvement on 1980s
growth rates for the industrialised world, while higher growth rates in
developing countries will be largely offset by a rapidly increasing
population.
Unctad says most of the increase in per capita incomes will be in Asia (2.7
per cent a year), while in Latin America they could rise by 1.4 per cent. In
Africa, per capita incomes will again stagnate or fall.

THE Philippines' foreign secretary, Mr Roberto Romulo, has made a plea for
more investment in his country by the countries of the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (Asean). Speaking on a visit to Malaysia, he
described the present level of intra-Asean trade as lamentable.
At present only 2 per cent of total Philippines trade is with Malaysia,
while under one per cent of Malaysia's total trade is with the Philippines.
Mr Romulo said that Asean - which groups the Philippines, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Brunei, Thailand and Singapore - would never be credible to
others if it did not make serious moves towards better trade relations.
Trade relations in the region has been much discussed since the announcement
of the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Several
countries in the region say that Nafta could become a trade bloc and
seriously affect export performance.
Malaysia is advocating the formation of an East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC)
to combat what it sees as the division of the world into competitive trading
groups.

THE United Nations Security Council last night approved plans to send about
5,000 more peacekeeping troops - including British soldiers - to the former
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The UN vote came after heavy fighting flared up again yesterday in the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, which has been besieged by Serb forces since
April. The upsurge in fighting cast further doubts on plans for
international peace talks to resume in Geneva on Friday.
The extra UN troops - already offered by Britain, other European countries
and Canada - are being sent to help protect relief convoys and ensure the
safety of Moslem and Croat detainees freed by Serb captors from prison
camps. The UK has offered up to 1,800 soldiers.
The UN already has 15,000 peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia,
including 1,500 in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The Security Council voted 12-0 to increase the size of the force, with
three member countries abstaining - China, India and Zimbabwe.
The resolution also stressed the importance of air security measures, such
as a ban on military flights over Bosnia by the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav
federal air force. Rapid implementation of such measures could 'reinforce
the security' of international humanitarian operations in Bosnia, it said.
Meanwhile Serbs and Moslems blamed each other for the latest violence in
Sarajevo - the worst outbreak for several weeks - and for attempting to
torpedo the peace talks due to be held in Geneva.
At least four people were killed and 50 wounded, and reports from the city
said heavy artillery had been used despite last weekend's agreement to put
it under UN supervision to determine who was firing first.
Mr Rusmir Jahic, commander of units loyal to the Bosnian government, said
the old part of the city was shelled, and mortars had fallen on the Holiday
Inn, where many journalists are staying.
Bosnian commanders also reported that the suburbs of Hrasno, Breka and
Bjelava were under fire.
Mr Ermin Taric, a Serb, and one of the Bosnian commanders in Hrasno, said
Serb irregulars were trying to gain control of the suburbs by using tanks.
He added that the local childrens' hospital was also shelled.
Before the upsurge in violence, the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic,
wrote to Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, to say his government would not
attend the peace talks because of continued fighting. Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb leader, has also threatened to pull out of the talks if an
air exclusion zone over Bosnia is imposed.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the international peace conference,
are insisting that leaders of the three Bosnian communities attend the
Geneva talks.
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the two co-chairmen, said that on their visit
to the region last week Mr Vance and Lord Owen had got 'solemn, personal and
unconditional commitments' from all the warring parties that they would go
to Geneva. Mr Vance, who represents the UN, and Lord Owen, the European
Community representative, 'expect all sides to be present at senior level on
Friday', Mr Eckhard said.
Representatives of the three communities are due to meet UN officials in
Geneva today to agree security and confidence-building measures that would
permit resumption of a UN airlift into Sarajevo. The airlift was suspended
nearly a fortnight ago after the downing of an Italian transport aircraft,
apparently by missiles, and food stocks in Sarajevo are dwindling.
Mr Eckhard, briefing reporters, said UN monitors were now based at 11 heavy
weapons sites controlled by Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo. This was in
accordance with the agreement between Mr Karadzic and the conference
chairmen which puts heavy weapons around four Bosnian cities under UN
supervision.
There had been 'some resistance' by local Serb commanders at Bihac and Jajce
to inclusion of 82mm mortars, as the accord stipulates.
This, and the status of heavy weapons near Gorazde, where Serb forces have
lifted their siege, are now the subject of negotiations with UNPROFOR, the
UN monitoring force.
UNPROFOR was also negotiate with Bosnian government forces in Sarajevo to
put their heavy weapons under UN observation, Mr Eckhard said.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Russia warned of crisis over hyper-inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Russian government official yesterday predicted a
hyper-inflationary crisis by the end of the year because of the credit
policies of the country's central bank. Vast sums, he said, were now being
paid to sustain production - while up to 10 per cent of Russia's GNP was
being advanced to other former Soviet republics.
Mr Sergei Vassiliev, the head of the government's Centre for Economic
Reform, said that 'in practice, the leaders of the central bank are acting
to discredit not only the government but the entire course of reform'.
He admitted that, if there were no change in the Bank's credit policy, it
would be impossible to meet the targets agreed between the government and
the International Monetary Fund for this year - that is, of a budget deficit
of no more than 5 per cent of GNP and inflation at no more than 10 per cent
a month.
Instead, he said that inflation was now running at a weekly basis of 4.4 per
cent, or more than 20 per cent a month, and was expected to accelerate next
month. The budget deficit now stood around 7 per cent of GNP, he added.
Mr Vassiliev's sombre picture was in sharp contrast to the optimism
expressed by Mr Richard Erb, the IMF assistant managing director, on a visit
to Moscow last week.
Mr Vassiliev's charge is the most serious of a rising chorus of ministerial
complaints about the actions of Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the former Soviet
State Bank chairman, who was appointed acting chairman of the Russian bank
in July.
It also foreshadows a clash between the government and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian president, on one side and the bank and the Russian parliament, to
which the bank is responsible, on the other. The Russian parliament begins
its new session in a week's time.
Mr Vassiliev, introducing the first in a quarterly series of 'Russian
Economic Trends', refused to be drawn into what actions would be taken to
avoid hyper-inflation - but said that the government would not 'give up'.
Parliament will not easily give up control over the bank - while both Mr
Yeltsin and government ministers have called in recent days for bringing it
under government control, or making it completely independent.
His comments are a further signal of a gathering political, as well as
economic, showdown between the shifting forces within Russia.
Mr Yeltsin, accused of populism in the past, has so far remained strongly in
support of the reform cabinet under Mr Yegor Gaidar - whose job as prime
minister is, like Mr Gerashchenko's, only an 'acting' title.
Mr Vassiliev said that the president had 'no choice but to support the
reform - otherwise he would have to rely on conservative forces. He cannot
change his political base'.
According to Mr Vassiliev, who was supported by Mr Marek Dombrowski, a
government adviser who had previously advised the Polish government, credits
to enterprises in July had increased to Rbs550bn, with a similar advance
expected next month.
The Russian Information Agency reported last night that the central bank's
Moscow department proposed issuing further credits of between
Rbs500bn-Rbs1,000bn to regulate the debts owed by enterprises in the Moscow
region.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Germans boost new car sales: West Europe's auto market shows
3 per cent increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe rose by an estimated 3 per cent in August to
1.043m as registrations recovered in Germany, the single biggest European
market, following July's sharp fall.
According to industry estimates, new car sales in the first 8 months of the
year at 9.56m were 2.2 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a
year ago, however. Sales have fallen year-on-year in four of the last six
months
August sales in both Italy and Spain were sharply lower than a year ago, and
demand also fell in many of the smaller west European markets.
Overall new car sales in August were lower than a year ago in 12 of 17 west
European markets, while in the first 8 months sales fell in only 7 markets.
The trend in European new car sales in the last two months has been
distorted by the pattern of demand in Germany.
New car registrations in Germany were inflated to a record level in July
last year, as the demand generated by unification peaked.
Sales were also lifted by the expiry of tax incentives on cars equipped with
catalytic converters. Sales in August last year fell heavily, however.
The reverse has happened this year.
German new car sales in July fell by 36 per cent from last year's record
level but rose last month by an estimated 39 per cent to some 229,000 from
last year's low level of 165,000.
In the first 8 months of the year, however, German new car sales are
estimated to have fallen by 11.5 per cent to 2.77m from last year's record
level of 3.13m.
Most importantly the immediate prospects for new car demand in Europe were
clouded last month by the falls in Italy and Spain.
These two markets had previously been two of the most buoyant in Europe
during the past year.
New car sales in Spain in August fell by 14.8 per cent from a year ago.
Sales in the Italian market dropped by 8 per cent.
The Fiat group of Italy, which includes Alfa Romeo and Lancia, continues to
lose ground.
It has now fallen from second to fourth place in the west European new car
sales league - behind the VW group of Germany, General Motors of the US and
the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen.
Fiat group sales have fallen by an estimated 7.1 per cent to 1.15m in the
first eight months, which has depressed its market share to 12 per cent from
12.7 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago.
Renault, the French car maker, has made the strongest gains among the big
six volume car makers in Europe, with a 5 per cent jump in sales volume
thanks most importantly to the success of its Clio small car range.
Renault's market share has jumped to 10.5 per cent from 9.8 per cent a year
ago.
Japanese new car sales in west Europe have fallen by an estimated 8.5 per
cent this year, most importantly under the impact of the decline in the
German market, where they have a 14 per cent market share.
The Japanese share in the overall west European market in the first 8 months
fell to 11.8 per cent from 12.6 per cent in the same period a year ago.

A police investigation is to be launched into Ireland's latest political
scandal - the tapping of the telephone of Mr John Bruton, the leader of the
main opposition party, Fine Gael, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
Mr Patrick Culligan, the Irish police commissioner, ordered the inquiry
yesterday after a Sunday newspaper published transcripts of three alleged
conversations between Mr Bruton and senior party colleagues that took place
last January.
The conversations related to revelations by a former justice minister about
telephone tapping that occurred 10 years earlier. The January incident led
to the resignation of Mr Charles Haughey, the prime minister, who was
replaced by Mr Albert Reynolds.
During the leadership contest, Mr Reynolds complained that he suspected he
was under surveillance. Mr Padraig Flynn, appointed justice minister by Mr
Reynolds, said yesterday: 'As far as my information is concerned, certainly
there was no authorisation by the minister insofar as any illegal tapping of
this kind.'

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE extradition from Venezuela over the weekend of the three Cuntrera
brothers, regarded as key figures in an international network of drugs and
money-laundering, has added to a string of recent successes by the Italian
authorities in arresting suspected bosses of organised crime.
Over the past two weeks the bosses of six leading families running large
crime syndicates have been arrested or extradited, as in the case of the
Cuntreras.
These arrests attest to a tougher attitude by the Italian government
following the brutal assassinations of the country's two principal
anti-mafia magistrates, Mr Giovane Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino. This
tougher attitude has led to many an ironic comment about the authorities'
previous complicity in allowing them to be free. But it is also the result
of increased use of 'super-grass' testimony from former mafia members.
Another factor is believed to be increased rivalry between clans operating
organised crime syndicates. Some press commentaries have also speculated
that those being caught after being on the wanted list for up to 10 years
are no longer significant figures and have been pushed aside by new clans.
The Italian government had previously submitted three extradition requests
to the Venezuelan government - in 1983, 1985 and 1990 - for Pasquale, Paolo
and Gaspare Cuntrera. All were denied.
In the final days before his assassination in June, Mr Borsellino had been
on their trail, while the late Mr Falcone had always insisted on the
importance of bringing them to justice.

MR Henri Emmanuelli, president of the French national assembly, was
yesterday charged with complicity in illicit trafficking of influence.
The move was expected, but is likely to embarrass the Socialist party in the
run-up to next Sunday's finely balanced referendum on European union. It is
the latest twist in a long-running judicial campaign against political
corruption which has focused on the Socialists and contributed to the
decline of their popularity. Ironically, this comes just a week after the
government tabled its own proposals to curb corruption, including a ban on
business donations to party funds.
Mr Emmanuelli, former Socialist party treasurer, denied the charges, which
he described as 'artificial' and claimed yesterday that they were
politically motivated. President Francois Mitterrand has repeatedly defended
Mr Emmanuelli's honesty.

<TEXT>
FORMAL agreement on the European energy charter - aimed at boosting energy
investment in central and eastern Europe - is being held up by differences
over certain 'basic questions of principle', according to an EC official.
Representatives of the 47 signatories of the charter - which is aimed at
boosting energy investment in central and eastern Europe - met last week to
prepare for next month's full session of the energy charter conference.
But they were unable to reach agreement on the crucial questions which would
allow members to sign a legally binding treaty before the end of the year.
The principles of the charter, agreed last December, cannot be put into
practice until the treaty is signed.
Mr Clive Jones, secretary general of the charter conference, said yesterday
that outstanding problems included:
Non-discrimination - the charter would force signatories to treat foreign
energy investors in exactly the same way as domestic investors. But Norway,
for example, wants to retain the right to give preference to its own oil
companies;
The environment - there is disagreement about which conclusions of this
year's Rio summit on the environment should be included in the treaty;
Transit rights;
The length and conditions of transition periods for east European countries
to implement the charter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday tried to quell
unrest in the country's jails by urging striking prison officers to return
to work and promising that the government would take action to improve
prison security.
The French prison system yesterday came close to chaos as 137 of the
country's 182 penal institutions were affected by the industrial dispute
which flared up on Friday following the murder of a prison officer at the
Clairvaux high security jail when seven inmates tried to shoot their way
out.
The government has suspended 39 striking officers in an attempt to end the
stoppage.
The killing of the warder at Clairvaux followed the murder of an officer at
Rouen earlier this month.
The Rouen killing prompted a wave of industrial action by prison officers
which was only called off when the government promised to take action. The
current strike started on Saturday and by yesterday had spread to 137
prisons, with riot police moving into a number of jails to restore order.
One riot squad broke into Ajaccio prison after inmates set fire to cells.
Police scuffled with warders at a jail near Le Mans when the staff blocked
the entry to the institution.
Mr Beregovoy, who is anxious to create a picture of political stability
before next Sunday's crucial referendum on the Maastricht treaty, appealed
to prison officers to end their strike. 'The government will act
responsibly, ' he said on French radio. 'It has understood your message. Now
you must go back to work.'
The government has already begun an investigation into the illegal traffic
of arms in French jails following the Clairvaux shoot-out. The ruling
Socialist party yesterday suggested that next year's national budget should
make extra provision for the prison system.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Gibraltar talks seek to break EC borders deadlock

<TEXT>
BRITISH and Spanish diplomats meet in London today to resume negotiations on
Gibraltar, amid fears that failure to achieve common ground over the future
of the British crown colony could block European Community hopes to allow
free movement of EC nationals in the 1993 Single Market.
Spanish objections to EC nationals freely entering the Spanish mainland from
Gibraltar next year prevented agreement on the Community's External
Frontiers Convention, EFC, at both the Maastricht and the Lisbon summits.
The Madrid government is likely to implement its boycott again at the
December summit in Edinburgh unless it perceives substantial progress on the
long-standing dispute.
Today's meeting of Gibraltar co-ordinators, representing the two foreign
ministries and the governor of the colony, is the first for 18 months and
will seek to prepare an overdue ministerial meeting to discuss the future of
the Rock. A 1985 agreement between London and Madrid, which lifted Spain's
blockade on Gibraltar, established periodic meetings of co-ordinators and
annual talks of foreign ministers, but the last bilateral meeting was held
in February last year.
During the interval, Spain has used the expectation of free movement for EC
nationals to press its Gibraltar claims. The Madrid government argues that
if the colony is to be considered a European entry point, under the terms of
the EFC, then Spanish immigration authorities should also be present on the
Rock to monitor incoming travellers.
Madrid successfully used the EC framework to put pressure on Britain in 1987
when a threatened Spanish veto to the Community's air traffic liberalisation
programme forced the exclusion of Gibraltar airport from the agreement.
Similar Spanish obduracy now could either exclude Gibraltar from the EFC, a
move which the UK opposes, or delay the 1993 convention indefinitely.
At the centre of the Gibraltar dispute is Spain's demand for territorial
sovereignty over the Rock, the UK's commitment not to change the status of
the colony against the wishes of the people of Gibraltar, and the adamant
hostility among the 20,000-odd Gibraltarians to any deal with Madrid.
Diplomats hold out little hope of progress at today's meeting, bar an
agreement to a November date for the ministerial meeting. The UK could,
however, be pressed to review proposals tabled by Spain at the time of the
1985 accord which suggested a leaseback formula or power-sharing to break
the deadlock.
The proposals, which were tied to Spain regaining territorial sovereignty
after an unspecified period, have never been formally answered by Britain.

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, the French president of the European Commission, pleaded
with his countrymen yesterday to prevent the European Community from
breaking up, pointing to yesterday's German interest rate cut as evidence
that the Twelve defend common interests. He described the cut as 'a
reassuring example, which shows that the Community is a body where unwritten
rules are applied by everyone', adding: 'Please let's not break that up.'
Implying that Germany took its time in making this gesture, only a week
before the Maastricht treaty stands or falls in France's referendum, he
evoked 'a Community spirit where, ultimately, member states have a bad
conscience if they defend their own interests against common interests'.
Replying to questions on Italy's devaluation, he recalled 'the victory of
civic spirit over what I would call obscure forces' in France, when as
French finance minister in 1983 he had devalued the franc. 'I hope I will be
able to take off my hat (to French civic spirit) next Monday for a different
reason,' he added.
Speaking after negotiations with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on a
trade and co-operation agreement with the former Soviet republic, Mr Delors
warned that the EC's ability to take in new members would be badly damaged
if the French voted No to Maastricht.
Admitting that people blamed the EC for the recession, and feared the
deflationary criteria Maastricht sets for economic and monetary union (Emu),
Mr Delors defended his controversial plans to raise Community spending by a
third as an antidote.
These would double fiscal transfers to the poorer member states, and sharply
raise spending on research and retraining, but are in effect being blocked
by the EC's main paymasters, Germany, the UK and France.
The package 'enables us to meet the objectives of Emu without its
deflationary effects', Mr Delors claimed.

THE BUNDESBANK'S decision to cut its lending rates yesterday was swiftly
followed by rate cuts in some other European countries.
Reductions were mainly confined to countries whose currencies form the hard
core of the European exchange rate mechanism, while others, wary that the
German move was too small to allow much room for manoeuvre, chose to wait at
least until after the French referendum.
The Bank of Belgium said it would cut its discount rate to 8.25 per cent
from 8.5 per cent. Its emergency lending rate - equivalent to Germany's
Lombard rate - was cut from 11.5 to 11 per cent. In the Netherlands, the
central bank lowered its three key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.
In Austria, whose schilling is informally linked to the D-Mark although not
part of the ERM, the central bank cut its lending rates to the same level as
in Germany. The Swiss, whose currency is also informally associated with the
D-Mark, cut the discount rate to 6.5 per cent.
Denmark, which usually follows German rates closely, had not decided
yesterday how to react.
In Norway, analysts reckoned the central bank was unlikely to cut interest
rates soon, partly because the German move was too small to influence
Norway.
Japanese officials dismissed suggestions that Tokyo should cut interest
rates but welcomed the realignment of European currencies. Mr Tsutomu Hata,
finance minister, said Japanese interest rates were already low.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS yesterday welcomed the German interest rate cut and the
devaluation of the lira, which immediately took pressure off the dollar in
foreign exchange markets, hailing the twin actions as 'a pretty good example
of successful policy co-ordination.'
'They set a new direction, they send an extremely important message to the
markets, which the markets have clearly received,' a senior US Treasury
official said.
The reduction in German rates is expected to ease the atmosphere of next
Saturday's meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations in
Washington.
'A lot of the tension not only in the EMS but also within the G7 over a
matter of great importance to the world economy has effectively been
defused,' the official said.
The US has for some time complained that German interest rates were too high
and imperilled the prospects for world growth, but officials argued,
nevertheless, that the Bundesbank was reacting more to signals from the
slowing German economy than to international pressure.
The dollar's recovery yesterday follows a period in which it slipped to
historic lows against the D-Mark, and Treasury officials have had to counter
the effect of remarks from President George Bush suggesting that he welcomed
the US currency's weakness as a stimulus to exports.
'The movement of the dollar in this case was a residual effect of the
tensions in Europe and not a judgment of any kind on the fundamentals of the
US economy. We are not seeking a depreciation of the dollar,' the official
said.

THE French government yesterday warned that France was unlikely to follow
the German drop in interest rates unless the electorate backed monetary and
political union in next Sunday's referendum.
'Only a Yes to Europe, a Yes to Maastricht, can open firm prospects of a
fall in interest rates for France,' said Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister.
A French decision on rates would be taken on the Monday or Wednesday
following the referendum, he said.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, denied that the government was
blackmailing voters by linking a possible rate cut to their decision on
Maastricht. It would simply be more responsible to decide in the light of
the referendum result, given the fact that the close race between pro- and
anti-Maastricht factions, shown in the final public opinion surveys before
polls closed at the weekend, clearly weighed on currency and equity markets.
If the Noes win, there would be 'a monetary shock and a stock market shock',
he said. 'It has to be said, that from then on, everyone must take their
responsibilities.'
The government would stay on, whatever the result, Mr Beregovoy confirmed.
He believed the political fall-out of a vote against the treaty would be
worse for the deeply divided opposition than for the Socialists. President
Francois Mitterrand was planning to stay in power until his mandate ran out
in early 1995, he added.
Both Mr Beregovoy and Mr Sapin denied that the Bundesbank cracked under
international pressure. 'I don't see it like that at all, and I don't say
that for diplomatic reasons,' said Mr Sapin. 'The Bundesbank does not
surrender to pressure. It has enlarged its reflection to include more
general considerations.'
The French stock market, like others across Europe, was yesterday cheered by
the German rate cut and the European Monetary System realignment, even
though analysts said the fall in borrowing costs was so small as to be
merely symbolic. By mid afternoon, the CAC 40 index had risen nearly 3.8 per
cent, with companies sensitive to interest rate changes, such as banks and
leasing houses, showing the strongest gains.
Another optimistic sign came from the latest inflation results, showing a
0.1 per cent rise in consumer prices last month, down from 0.3 per cent in
July. This brings the prices rise over the previous 12 months to 2.7 per
cent, putting France on track to hit the 2.8 per cent annual inflation
target for 1992 on which the state budget is based, said the Finance
Ministry.
The latest result widens the gap between French and German inflation rates,
with the latter 0.8 percentage points higher over the year to August.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: UK stifles disappointment at German
cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government hinted yesterday that a cut in interest rates had
moved closer, as it put on a brave face in response to what is seen as a
disappointingly small reduction in German rates.
With several European countries following the Bundesbank's lead and lowering
their rates, Downing Street said the cut had 'probably brought forward the
time when British interest rates will move'. While admitting the German move
might be 'a one-off', officials sought to portray it as the start of a trend
towards lower interest rates throughout Europe and said there had been 'a
significant change of mood'.
But they reiterated Prime Minister John Major's uncompromising message last
week that he would not allow sterling's value in the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism to be undermined. British interest rates would be set with a view
to 'maintaining our position in the ERM,' they said. The probability of a
realignment of the pound's ERM parity was 'zero'.
Privately, officials suggested that the British government had succeeded in
undermining the consensus view held in the markets a few weeks ago that the
next move in British interest rates would be up.
The 0.25 percentage point cut in Germany's trend-setting Lombard rate was
criticised as too small by British MPs.
Mr John Carlisle, a Tory Euro-sceptic, described it as 'derisory'. 'It shows
that we should be free of the ERM and able to set our own levels and float
the pound in the currency markets,' he said. Mr John Townend, outspoken
chairman of the influential Tory backbench finance committee, said the size
of the reduction was 'very disappointing'. He said he was 'more than ever
convinced' that the move had been motivated by the need to get a Yes vote in
the French referendum.
For the Labour party, Mr Alistair Darling, a shadow Treasury spokesman, said
the cut was 'a lot less than people hoped'. He urged Britain and other
European countries to 'reduce interest rates to try and stimulate the
economy and to bring back confidence'.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary who is also an outspoken
critic of official Labour policy over Maastricht and the pound, said the
reduction was 'so small it can only be regarded as a gesture'. A wider
realignment of ERM currencies involving sterling was still 'desirable'.
This view was refuted by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who said he did
not regard devaluation as the best way of bringing British interest rates
down.
In Harrogate, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, also described the
move as 'disappointing'. He urged the government to 'grit its teeth' and to
permit a reduction in UK rates only when sustainable in the longer term.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, called the cut as 'small
but welcome'. 'We have always argued that there was a great strength in the
co-ordination of the Exchange Rate Mechanism,' he said.
Downing Street sought to counter this disappointment by pointing out that
yesterday's move represented the first cut in German interest rates for five
years and arguing that any reduction, however small, was 'significant'. It
said the move showed 'the benefits of international co-operation' and argued
that hopes of anything other than a 'modest' cut were unrealistic. The
weekend's developments had also been 'useful' in dispelling the notion that
sterling would have to be devalued at the same time as the lira.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, had been involved in
discussions to formulate a strategy for addressing the crisis in the
European Monetary System but the exact size of the interest rate cut had
been determined within the Bundesbank.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Sweden cuts marginal rate to 20%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S central bank cut its marginal lending rate to the banks to 20 per
cent from 75 per cent yesterday and the country's centre-right government
announced SKr20bn (Pounds 1.96bn) of spending cuts to nearly halve the
structural budget deficit and calm the foreign exchange markets.
The central bank's action was taken in response partly to the small drop in
German interest rates but also to the strong inflow of capital into Sweden
over the past few days. The lending rate was increased last Wednesday to 75
per cent in reaction to the floating of the Finnish markka.
'We have re-established credibility in the krona and eliminated doubt about
our ability to maintain a fixed exchange rate,' said Mr Thomas Franzen, the
bank's deputy governor.
The Stockholm bourse bounced back yesterday with a 5.6 per cent increase in
its general index to 757.6, the largest rise in one day since January last
year. Manufacturing sector shares rose 6.7 per cent and banks and insurance
companies 7.1 per cent. There were falls in a wide range of short term
market rates as well.
Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, said his centre-right coalition intended to
take a firm grip on its expenditure programmes. The proposed reduction in
government spending promises to be the most drastic ever carried out by a
modern Swedish government. It will involve many painful decisions and focus
on large cuts in the value of welfare transfer payments.
The full details will be announced on October 6 when parliament returns from
recess and Mr Bildt makes his state of the nation address.
Mr Bildt and his finance minister, Mrs Anne Wibble, said the government
wanted to eliminate Sweden's structural deficit, which makes up an estimated
SKr50bn of the SKr160bn-Skr180bn budget deficit expected this year. The rest
is cyclical, caused by the country's current recession.
The prime minister said the government was open for unconditional talks on
the contents of the cuts package with the opposition Social Democrats. But
that party's finance spokesman, Mr Allan Larsson, rejected any discussions
with the government unless it abandoned plans for unfinanced tax reductions.

</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fate of the historic agreement between the Italian government, employers
and the trade unions abolishing the system of indexed wages on July 31 has
been called in question by devaluation of the lira.
All sides yesterday pledged their willingness to respect the agreement.
However, the employers and unions now expect the government of Mr Giuliano
Amato to provide quick evidence of its ability to hold down prices and carry
out credible reforms.
Confindustria, the employers' confederation, is concerned that the
government might make concessions to labour in order to retain the unions'
support at a time when the economy is stagnant and unemployment rising.
The unions fear inflation will rise, undermining the basis of the outline
agreement achieved in July. In addition, the trade union leadership is
worried that rising unemployment in the autumn, coupled with inflation
fears, will radicalise members whose disaffection may not be easy to
control.
The July agreement abolished the scala mobile which for 47 years indexed
wages to inflation.
The old system will be replaced by a limited form of compensation in wage
packages for 13 months as of January 1993. This will consist of an extra
L20,000 (Pounds 9.40) a month - well below the 3.5 per cent rate of
inflation projected in July for next year.
Wages in July were rising at 4.3 per cent against annualised inflation then
at 5.5 per cent. Thus the absence of the scala mobile, combined with a 4.5
per cent cap on public sector wages, has proved effective until now.
The main inflationary element has been the continued high cost of cartelised
and uncompetitive services.
Confindustria estimated yesterday that devaluation would add an extra
half-point to inflation during the rest of the year - if the government kept
its promise to freeze utility prices and clamp down on those who sought to
take advantage of devaluation. Inflation in August was running at 5.3 per
cent and before the devaluation was due to be below 5 per cent at year-end.
Both the unions and Confindustria have been supportive of the government,
largely because they are the two groups most aware of the parlous state of
the economy and the need for concrete measures to prevent the financial
crisis deteriorating. The government can still build on this support but
only by satisfying both sides, which may prove much harder.
The business community was dismayed last Wednesday by the way Mr Nino
Cristofori, the Christian Democrat labour minister, refused to accept in
cabinet proposals for immediate cuts in the costly state pension scheme for
fear of offending his own constituency.
In retrospect, this cabinet meeting, which produced Mr Amato's surprise call
for special emergency powers to handle the economy but failed to give a
coherent signal of decisive action, was instrumental in accelerating
devaluation. It was the first time in two months of office that the prime
minister appeared unsure of his touch.
Mr Amato has a small breathing space provided by devaluation to claw back
the initiative. But the political establishment is now slowly reasserting
itself after virtually two months' tolerance of his astute exploitation of
what at the outset appeared limited authority, constrained by a weak
four-party coalition.
His greatest weakness now is the position of Mr Bettino Craxi, the leader of
Mr Amato's Socialist party and his backer. The party risks being split by
the growing discredit of Mr Craxi as a result of the Milan corruption
scandal and the aspirations of Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister and
one-time party heir apparent.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Europe bond prices surge - Italy and
Spain out-perform market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German rate cut yesterday was seen as a turning point for European bond
prices which surged on hopes that European interest rates had peaked.
The Bundesbank move, which followed Sunday's 7 per cent devaluation of the
lira, appeared to have mitigated fears of a No vote in French referendum on
the Maastricht treaty.
Italian and Spanish bond prices out-performed the rest of Europe, ending 2
percentage points higher. Prices of UK gilts and Ecu bonds gained 1 1/2
points, while 10-year French and German government bonds lost some earlier
gains to end a point higher.
'The market believes that the down cycle in German interest rates has
started,' said Mr George Magnus, a director of fixed-interest research at SG
Warburg Securities.
Although a No vote in the French referendum would test the markets severely,
the apparent peaking of European interest rates, three months' ahead of most
analysts' expectations, should help to underpin Europe's bond markets.
'The main problem has been to plough ahead (with European monetary union) in
a climate of slow growth in Europe, with high German interest rates,' said
Mr Jeremy Yeats-Edwards, a senior portfolio manager of Baring's
international bond fund. With some of the interest rate pressure alleviated,
a No vote 'does not have quite the same seriousness'.
However, it remains to be seen how quickly hopes of further drops in
European interest rates are realised.
'This may be the start of a new interest cycle, but the question is how long
it will be before the next easing (in German rates),' said Mr Adam Greshin,
assistant portfolio manager of Scudder's international bond fund.
The German bond market may be the safest European market, in the run-up to
the French referendum.
With that hurdle still to be cleared, some analysts said that
higher-yielding markets should still be treated with some caution. Following
the latest gains, a Yes vote is substantially priced into the market,
reducing the chances of a massive rally next week if the French ratify the
Maastricht treaty.
Furthermore, investors might decide that the potential gains in
higher-yielding markets do not outweigh the greater degree of risk, such as
a further devaluation of the lira.
Despite a 1 1/2 point recovery yesterday, there are no signs of any return
to favour for the Ecu bond market, where liquidity has dried up since the
Danish referendum on June 2. 'If there is a No vote, the Ecu may never be a
single European currency,' one trader said.
'There will have to be a substantial Yes vote to attract investors back.'
However, a number of trading houses have been investing heavily in
high-yielding bonds. Yesterday's rally encouraged expectations of a Yes
vote, and, with some heavy losses to recoup since the Danish referendum,
some traders are taking a 'double or quits' view of the referendum.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Victory claimed for Maastricht - Cut
could slice both ways in poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bowing of the Bundesbank to international pressure to cut German
interest rates could slice both ways in the French referendum campaign on
the Maastricht treaty, now entering its final week.
The treaty ratifiers were yesterday swift in putting their gloss on the
German move. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, claimed that 'the
spirit of Maastricht had won out over purely national considerations'. He
went on to forecast that 'this gesture of European solidarity will continue
provided that the construction of Europe stays on track'.
It is reading too much into yesterday's decision, taken at a time of
instability on world financial markets, to suggest that if the Maastricht
pact is ratified, it will become the norm for Germany's central bank to pay
real heed to its EC partners' monetary desires.
'Maastricht will be a step forward in monetary co-operation', said Mr
Francois Hollande, a leading socialist member of the National Assembly's
finance committee, 'especially because there will be no need  - as today -
to ask the Germans to lower their rates so that others' rates can follow.'
Yet collective action on rates would only come once a single currency and
bank existed. Maastricht provides for an interim European Monetary
Institute, representing all 12 EC states, but still leaving monetary policy
in individual central banks' hands.
But the Frankfurt rate reduction provided welcome ammunition for the Yes
campaign to counter the argument that the treaty would insulate the planned
European Central Bank from all political control. This was where Mr Philippe
Seguin, champion of the No campaign, pushed President Francois Mitterrand
onto very weak ground in their TV encounter 10 days ago.
Mrs Simone Veil, the centrist UDF deputy, argued that yesterday's financial
moves showed 'that it is the politicians who are able to bring pressure to
bear on interest rates', contrary to the anti-Maastricht arguments that 'it
is the monetary authorities who will dictate to the politicians once there
exists a (European) central bank'.
Mr Beregovoy yesterday stressed the same line. But he also hit out at
right-wing politicians, who were now campaigning against Maastricht but who
had called in the mid-1980s for the Banque de France to get the same type of
independence from the French government as Maastricht proposes for the
European central bank.
This highlights the French government's awareness of the awkward ambiguity
in the EC treaty. Maastricht clearly leaves EC governments control over the
'broad outlines' of their economic policies, but equally forbids them to
influence the directors of the future central bank, whose highest priority
in setting monetary policy is to be 'price stability'.
The No campaign may yet seek to exploit the fact that the Bundesbank has
cracked, even if ever so slightly, under EC-wide political pressure.

PRESSURE for more changes in the European exchange mechanism seems unlikely
to disappear, in spite of the lira's devaluation and the cut in interest
rates in Germany.
Speculation about other currencies that could be affected by future
devaluations centred yesterday on sterling, the Spanish peseta and the
Portuguese escudo, all of which have traded weakly in recent weeks.
Much depends on next Sunday's referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty.
If that delivers a No vote, holding up moves to economic and monetary union,
investors may step up selling of the weaker ERM currencies, causing new
strains in the mechanism.
There are two ways of assessing how the ERM realignment will affect the
outlook for the mechanism. The more sanguine view stresses the special
nature of the lira's problems, stemming from a weakening of international
confidence in the Rome government.
According to this view, the 7 per cent devaluation of the Italian currency
has demonstrated the capability of Europe's leaders to adjust the ERM to
take into account unique circumstances of member countries.
The fact that European politicians collectively persuaded the Bundesbank to
cut borrowing rates is also seen as a hopeful sign. The move led yesterday
to a weakening in the D-Mark against the dollar, and so eased pressures in
the ERM on the weaker currencies.
Even though the easing in German monetary policy was slight, the important
factor, according to this school of thought, is that it almost certainly
marks the start of further reductions in Bundesbank rates over the coming
months, as the German economy starts to slow.
Mr David Cocker, chief currency economist at Chemical Bank in London, said:
'The ERM will stay intact, whatever the result of the Maastricht vote. There
will be no further realignment after next week.'
The second way of analysing the realignment inclines to the view that the
ERM has deep- seated problems which cannot be solved by one quick fix.
Mr David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank,
said: 'The lira devaluation has raised questions about whether the ERM can
be sustained in its present form.'
Sterling, so this argument runs, is a candidate for a devaluation on the
grounds that, without one, the UK will be unable to institute the large cuts
in domestic borrowing rates that are needed to revive its battered economy.
That would be especially the case if - as seems likely - the Bundesbank
takes its time over further cuts in interest rates.
Meanwhile, the position in the system of the peseta and the escudo can be
maintained only with the help of high Spanish and Portuguese credit rates
which cannot be sustained in the long run.
As for the lira, some believe the devaluation may not have been sufficient
to stop further weakening.
Perhaps the strongest argument for further realignments is a psychological
one. Last month, the European Community's finance ministers ruled out a
devaluation of any of the 10 currencies in the grid, on the grounds that a
change in rates would not be 'the appropriate response'.
With this promise having lasted just two weeks in the case of the lira, the
financial markets cannot be blamed for wondering whether the commitment to
keep other weak ERM currencies at their central rates may turn out to be
less than total.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastriht: Only dealers won in lira support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTRUMENTAL in the Bundesbank and Bank of Italy's decision that the lira
should be devalued was the failure of last week's huge intervention to
support the currency.
The attempt to prop up the Italian currency appeared to result only in
bringing huge profits to interbank speculators.
Operators were reported on Friday to be buying the Italian currency when it
dropped below the official floor in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and
then selling the lira back to the Bundesbank at a guaranteed profit when the
lira rose back to the floor of L765.4 against the D-Mark.
One interbank dealer said yesterday that the Bundesbank's intervention
provided the market with 'a one-off opportunity' to make big profits. 'A lot
of Italian corporates, fund managers and pension funds were in on the act,'
he said.
One European official suggested that the Italian government is the principal
loser in the operation because it will probably have to buy back the lire
from the Bundesbank at the old rate.
The Bundesbank spent more than DM24bn (Pounds 8.6bn) last week buying the
lira to keep it above its floor against the D-Mark.
'The intervention was on an extraordinary scale,' said Mr Paul Chertkow,
global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London. 'It must rank
as the largest intervention in a concentrated period of time by a central
bank for two decades. When you consider that the Italian lira is a marginal
currency, the scale of last week's operation seems all the greater.'
On Friday, the lira barely moved off its floor of L765.40 against the
D-Mark, and was below it at several points in European trading.
However, the purchase of lire pushed billions of D-Marks into the money
system, upsetting the German central bank's strict money supply targets.
Analysts said the 7 per cent devaluation of the lira may seem small when the
scale of the Bundesbank's intervention is taken into account.
The lira was overvalued against the D-Mark by about 20 per cent on a
trade-weighted basis before the weekend realignment.
The size of the intervention may also worry the Bank of England, which took
out a Pounds 1.7bn loan from international banks two weeks ago to support
sterling.
'If the Bundesbank's intervention last week failed to support the lira, why
should anyone believe that the pound will be supported by a loan of that
size,' said Mr Chertkow.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Grid shows tensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Monetary System grid is a good indicator of where tensions lie
in the exchange rate mechanism and has changed markedly since Friday night.
Following its devaluation over the weekend, the Italian lira is at the top
of the grid because it is the strongest EMS currency when measured by its
central rate against the Ecu.
The D-Mark is back at the centre of the grid, having been at the top for
most of the last fortnight.
As the hard currency of Europe, it should be at the centre when the system
is operating properly, allowing the exchange rates and monetary policies of
other countries to be altered around it.
Sterling, at the bottom of the grid, seems increasingly under pressure. It
is 81 percentage points below its central Ecu rate.
A rule of thumb among EMS nations is that when a currency diverges more than
75 points from its central Ecu rate, its central bank should take measures
to redress the balance.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Relief and anxiety jostle for
supremacy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRASTING reactions of shock, relief and anxiety were apparent yesterday
from the German business, banking and economics communities to the
Bundesbank's modest interest rate reduction.
It was clear that the size of the cut was not in question, so much as its
manner and direction.
On the one hand, there was obvious relief from the business community, and
from economists who have been warning of imminent recession in Germany, that
for the first time in four years the central bank has cut its leading
interest rates, however marginally.
On the other, many bankers expressed the fear that the Bundesbank had
seriously damaged its credibility, by being seen to bow to political
pressure and relax its monetary targets, at a moment when the German economy
did not justify the move.
Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler Benz, Germany's largest
industrial company, said the cut would provide welcome relief at the current
stage of feeble economic growth in Germany.
It was a necessary correction in terms of interest rate policy, he said,
which should give the other European economies 'significant room for
man-oeuvre'.
He warned, however, that further cuts in interest rates would depend on
consolidation of public sector spending, and responsible behaviour by
industry and trade unions in future wage negotiations.
Mr Peter Pietsch of Commerzbank said that the move was 'a good message from
Germany for Europe', pointing out that this was the first time that the
German central bank had taken the financial and economic considerations of
another country into account. 'But if you want to assess the situation
properly, you must realise that we still have very high interest rates in
Germany - and we will have them for a long, long time.'
In Bonn the mood was divided. While politicians, from the government and
opposition benches, welcomed the move as a boost to the ailing economy - and
a help for investment in east Germany - spokesmen for the savings banks, and
for German industry, were more doubtful.
Mr Helmut Geiger, chairman of the savings bank federation, said the move was
premature in domestic economic terms. The Bundesbank had raised interest
rates in July because of the deteriorating budget deficit, and that
situation had not changed.
Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, said the move was impossible to understand, because the
inflationary tendency in the German economy was still apparent.
The August figure for the cost of living index rose 3.5 per cent compared
with the previous August, against only 3.3 per cent in July.
Mr Stihl said that German industry must watch acutely 'to see if the
independence of the Bundesbank is properly protected'.
A number of economists also claimed that the cut - and the way in which the
bank appeared to have been bounced into the decision in the wake of
political pressures - had dealt a serious blow to the central bank's
anti-inflation credibility and that this would, in time, lead to an erosion
of the D-Mark's role as anchor currency of the EMS.
'I was surprised and shocked,' said Mr Thomas Mayer at Goldman Sachs in
Frankfurt.
'The Bundesbank has changed its course, reducing the importance of monetary
targeting. The interest rate cut shows the Bundesbank reacting in a way more
befitting a future European Central Bank, reacting to political pressures,
to tensions in the ERM and to pressure on the lira.
'It is a relief for the markets because the stranglehold of German policy
has been eased. But if we believe the Bundesbank's arguments that
inflationary developments in Germany are worrisome - and the rate cut does
nothing to change that - the move may undermine the D-Mark's status as
anchor of the ERM. The D-Mark was the anchor because the Bundesbank always
directed its monetary policy at German fundamentals, but this has now
changed.'
Mr Lothar Weniger at Salomon Brothers in Frankfurt said: 'The Bundesbank was
forced into this, reacting to pure political pressure, with very serious
consequences on how the the central bank will be perceived and how it will
be able to operate in the future. It will contribute to the image of a
seriously weakened Bundesbank.'
At Hamburgische Landesbank, Mr Konrad Kentmann, chief economist, said: 'They
could have done it earlier, and then again they needn't have done it now.'
'It raises all sorts of questions about the Bundesbank's credibility.
Autonomy has always been one of the Bundesbank's most important assets but
now doubts about this will intensify.
'In this respect it is not a good omen for European monetary union, lending
weight to the arguments of those sceptics who argue that Europe's central
bank will have no real authority.'
The cut showed that the Bundesbank move to increase interest rates earlier
this summer was misguided, Mr Kentmann said.

earlier

GERMANY offered to cut its interest rates in return for a realignment of
European currencies more than a week before the deal was finally done,
according to senior officials in Bonn and Frankfurt.
However, agreement was delayed by the refusal of other members of the
European exchange rate mechanism to go ahead with the realignment, they said
yesterday. Both Britain and France wanted the Bundesbank to cut its interest
rates unilaterally.
'It was the Germans who initiated the whole process,' according to one
well-placed official. 'We tried even before Bath (where the European
Community Finance Ministers had their informal meeting on September 6),
indicating that we were ready to do something on the interest rate front,
providing our partners would come to grips with their domestic economic
decisions.
'But in Bath the time still was not ripe.'
According to the officials, the Bundesbank was not prepared to act on
interest rates unless there was prior agreement on a realignment. 'An
interest rate cut in isolation would have indicated that the Bundesbank was
giving in, and have no effect on the markets,' according to the official,
who declined to be identified.
'Talks had been going on for some time, and at several levels,' according to
another senior official. 'In the end, the market forced the pace.'
The delay in reaching agreement may well have been because the Bundesbank
wanted a much broader realignment of currencies than simply one affecting
the lira, other sources said. They believe that such a realignment would
have involved a devaluation of sterling - but the British government refused
to give way.
Officials in the Bundesbank did believe that a sterling devaluation was
required by the market, although other officials said they recognised the
strength of British arguments against any adjustment.
In the end, the flood of speculative money from Italy into Germany last week
forced the Bundesbank to act without such a realignment.
On the German side, the deal was put together by a triangle of key
officials: Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the deputy president of the Bundesbank; Mr
Horst Kohler, the state secretary for finance; and Mr Johannes Ludewig,
economic adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
A key factor in the process was heavy political pressure from the French
government to cut interest rates in advance of next Sunday's referendum on
Maastricht, thus persuading French voters that Germany was prepared to act
in the 'European' interest.
German officials expressed surprise that the currency markets believed a
realignment would come only after the French referendum. 'There was no way
we could wait until September 21,' according to one. 'If the French got any
more pessimistic in the opinion polls, it would have caused havoc in the
market.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Schlesinger puts on a brave face -
Bundesbank cites market pressures and future German policy changes as
reasons for cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Helmut Schlesinger felt any embarrassment yesterday, he hid it well at
the press conference called to announce the Bundesbank's about-turn on
interest rates.
After months of maintaining a solidly anti-inflation stance, and asserting
its determination to bring the wayward money supply under control, the
German central bank has cut both its key rates under acute pressure from
financial markets and, clearly, politicians.
Since the cuts in the discount rate from 8.75 to 8.25 per cent and the
Lombard rate from 9.75 to 9.50 per cent come as the west German economy is
weakening and the east German economy recovering more slowly than hoped, Mr
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, was able to state that the
consequences of the move 'should certainly fit into the present situation'.
The German economy was not in a recession, but showing signs of weakness.
Also giving the rate cuts - the first since 1987 - a domestic gloss was the
hope that Chancellor Kohl's call for a solidarity pact, including low wage
deals, with industry, unions, and regional states, to sort out the problems
of unification and its financing would bear fruit.
Thus Mr Schlesinger said the rate reductions, accompanied by a move to lower
money market rates from 9.7 to 9.2 per cent by moving to a fixed rate tender
at this week's securities repurchase operation, were also 'a certain advance
concession' to possible changes in wage and fiscal policies.
But he emphasised in the same breath that it was the predicament the
Bundesbank had been pushed into by external market pressures that caused its
move. German inflation was still 'markedly high'.
Last week's inflows caused by intervention to prop up the lira in the
European Monetary System had totalled some DM24bn. Thus the Bundesbank asked
the Bonn government to press for a quick realignment. The government could
have rejected this. 'Then our foreign exchange window would have been open
today - and billions (of D-Marks) more would have poured in, and tomorrow,
and the day after', Mr Schlesinger said. As it is, funds should now flow
out, easing the extra strain on money supply.
The fact that the Bundesbank was forced to lower its rates long before even
the most optimistic observers had expected shows the extent of the
predicament it was in. Last week, Mr Otmar Issing, a prominent director of
the central bank, reasserted its commitment to firm money supply targets and
said there was no reason yet to 'sound the all clear' on policy.
Yesterday, Mr Issing did his best not to look like someone forced to eat his
words. 'This was outside our calculations'. Today, the bank was in a better
position than last week. 'You can forget M3 and so forth if a situation like
last week continues. You have to imagine the dimensions involved'.
Not that M3, the broad monetary aggregate, has been forgotten. M3's rapid
growth, well outside the 3.5-5.5 per cent target range and inflated by the
pressures of unification, has been a main reason for Germany's high interest
rates. Yesterday, Mr Schlesinger said M3 growth may have eased slightly from
the 8.5 per cent annualised rate of July, but the target would not be
achieved in 1992. It would remain a medium term objective, however.
The scale of the intervention needed had put at risk the Bundesbank's
ability to maintain its policies. 'The amount was extraordinarily high,
higher than ever before in a speculation crisis'. He added: 'We were in a
situation in which we, with the strongest EMS currency and thus having to
absorb all the funds, were really no longer in a position to continue our
monetary policy'. He compared the inflow with the DM16bn of Bundesbank
intervention during the 1973 currency crisis as the Bretton Woods system of
fixed exchange rates collapsed and the DM15bn before the last EMS
realignment in 1987.
Why was the Lombard not cut by more, Mr Schlesinger was asked? He said the
decision to push money market rates down to 9.2 per cent at the next tender
would ease foreign exchange pressures and keep these rates below the Lombard
emergency funding rate. 'It is the money market rate which defines the
problem on the foreign exchange market, not the Lombard rate'.
Asked if he had considered resigning, Mr Schlesinger replied: 'This question
does not arise for me, in view of the circumstances.' His deputy, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, said the rate cuts were not made under pressure from EC partners.
'The decision is a sovereign decision of the Bundesbank itself.'
Mr Tietmeyer said the realignment showed that the EMS rules, allowing for
parity adjustments when necessary, still applied. He denied it was a move
against Maastricht, where EC leaders last year agreed on progress towards
European monetary union. 'Until then, the EMS applies - with fixed, but
adjustable rates.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / German rate cut may stave off UK increase: Sterling up
against D-Mark but still close to ERM floor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST cut in official German interest rates for nearly five years,
staving off the immediate possibility of a damaging rise in UK borrowing
costs and heralding the possibility of lower rates for the rest of Europe,
received a mixed welcome yesterday.
The move led to sharp rises on Wall Street and in European share and bond
markets. But politicians and industrialists said more cuts would be needed
to help economic recovery in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.
Yesterday's announcement followed months of intense pressure on Germany to
ease borrowing conditions and so boost European growth.
The Bundesbank, at a special council meeting in Frankfurt, reduced the
Lombard rate by a quarter of a point to 9.5 per cent and the discount rate
by half a point to 8.25 per cent. The Lombard rate is a benchmark for other
European borrowing rates.
The German rate cut was agreed in principle over the weekend as part of an
unprecedented financial package finalised by European Community nations. It
included a 7 per cent devaluation of the Italian lira in the ERM grid. In
Britain, Downing Street put on a brave face in response to the small
reduction in German rates.
While admitting the German move might be 'a one-off', officials sought to
portray it as the start of a trend towards lower interest rates throughout
Europe and said there had been 'a significant change of mood'. Officials
said the cut in German rates had 'probably brought forward the time when
British interest rates will move'. However, there was no indication by
monetary officials of any early moves to cut UK base rates, now at 10 per
cent, to help economic activity.
Downing Street reiterated last week's uncompromising message from Mr John
Major, the prime minister, that he would not allow sterling's value in the
European exchange rate mechanism to be undermined. The probability of a
realignment of the pound's ERM parity was 'zero'.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares, which opened yesterday
morning 99 points higher on anticipation of the Bundesbank announcement,
shed some of its early gains on news of the relatively modest nature of the
central bank's cuts. It closed up 51.2 on the day, at 2,422.1.
The mood of optimism was shared on other European stock markets, with the
bourses in Frankfurt, Paris and Milan closing between 3 per cent and 5 per
cent higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Average closed up 70.52 at
3,376.22
Investors were prompted to switch funds out of D-Marks and into dollars in a
development which reduced the recent strains in the exchange rate mechanism.
However, there was some disappointment that rate cuts were not greater.
Optimism over the wider effects of the Bundesbank's policy change was also
tempered by continuing nervousness on currency markets ahead of Sunday's
French referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
A No vote next weekend could halt the moves towards European economic and
monetary union and lead to a fresh wave of selling pressures on weak
European currencies, including the pound, forcing the British government
ment into a damaging rise in interest rates. In Frankfurt, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, president of the German central bank, said it had not been
possible to cut the Lombard rate by more than a quarter of a point because
of the bank's policy of targeting monetary growth. 'With our targets for
monetary policy there is no room for more. We saw no room to manoeuvre
further.'
He said the decision to cut rates 'was not an easy one for us' and that the
central bank had been caught in 'a foreign exchange trap'.
Last week's intervention by the Bundesbank to support the Italian lira by
selling D-Marks had led to flows back into Germany of DM24bn (Pounds 8.6bn),
far more than in any previous currency crisis. This explained why it was
cutting rates as its contribution to alleviating exchange rate tensions,
although German inflation was still too high and money supply targets not
being met.
Mr Schlesinger denied that the bank had been forced into cutting interest
rates. Although the rate reductions could be seen as being in line in with
the needs of a weakening economy and as a gesture ahead of efforts in Bonn
to bring about more moderate wage and fiscal policies, he stressed it was
market pressures that had forced the Bundesbank to act.
Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland - countries which
traditionally closely follow the level of borrowing rates in Germany - all
moved yesterday to cut their interest rates. Bonds also benefited on
indications that borrowing costs across Europe may come down in the wake of
the Bundesbank move. German, Italian and French government bonds all gained
up to 2 points, while UK gilts closed 1 3/4 points higher. On currency
markets, the D-Mark lost ground substantially to the dollar, after weeks in
which it had gained on the US currency.
The dollar, after hitting DM1.5155 prior to the news of the exact size of
the Bundesbank's cuts, closed in London at DM1.4855, up nearly 4 pfennigs on
Friday's London close.
Sterling peaked at DM2.8250 in early trading yesterday, and closed in London
at DM2.8125, up more than 2 pfennigs on the Friday close. At this level it
is less than 3 pfennigs above its DM2.778 ERM floor against the D-Mark,
comfortably above its recent levels but still too near the floor for the UK
government to be contemplating early reductions in base rates. In late New
York trading the pound was at DM2.80935.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Kohl in secret visit to Bundesbank

<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, paid a secret visit to the Bundesbank
in Frankfurt on Friday to discuss a realignment of currencies in the
European exchange rate mechanism and a cut in German interest rates.
Confirmation of the visit, which also involved Mr Theo Waigel, finance
minister, and Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary for finance, emerged
yesterday.
It is likely to fuel accusations that the government put unprecedented
political pressure on the independent central bank to persuade it to relax
its high interest rate policy.
Bundesbank officials, however, are adamant that they were the ones who had
to persuade the chancellor and his finance minister to support a full ERM
realignment, hitherto blocked by other European Community governments such
as France.
Indeed, senior government officials yesterday maintained that Germany was
ready to cut its interest rates - in exchange for a realignment - more than
a week before the deal was finalised on Sunday.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said in Kiel last night: 'It is
a misunderstanding to maintain that we were forced into interest rate cuts.
We have accompanied several realignments, including that of 1987, with an
interest rate reduction.'
Responding to the charge that the Bundesbank's independence had been 'lost',
Mr Schlesinger said the central bank had never had full independence under
fixed exchange rates, either in the Bretton Woods system until 1973 or in
the European Monetary System.
A number of commentators expressed alarm at the apparent loss of
independence, including Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German Chamber
of Industry and Commerce. 'The chamber will be watching to see how the
independence of the Bundesbank is protected,' he said.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Jeers replace early cheers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEVERED enthusiasm of yesterday morning's tabloid headlines which
heralded the German move as a 'stunning coup' by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, soon gave way to grumblings that the cuts were not deep enough
to help the ailing British economy.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said the
size of the reduction was 'very disappointing'.
He said he was 'more than ever convinced' that the move had been motivated
by the need to get a Yes vote in Sunday's French referendum.
Mr John Carlisle, a prominent Tory Euro-sceptic, described it as 'derisory',
while Mr William Cash, a vociferous backbench critic of the government's
economic policy, attacked the move as 'a cynical and cosmetic exercise'.
He said: 'The fact is that it is not going to make very much difference. The
real question which still remains is what is the impact of our being tied to
the German economy when British jobs and massive unemployment and
bankruptcies are effectively being orchestrated by a policy which is being
made in Germany.'
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said his organisation had hoped for more. 'Regrettably, the cut in the
Lombard rate is unlikely to provide the chancellor with much room for
manoeuvre to reduce UK rates in the short-term,' he said.
Across Europe, the euphoria which greeted the first sign that German rates
were finally moving downwards was tinged with caution and scepticism.
The European Commission heralded the cuts as an example of the European
Community 'pulling together'. Others said these were so slim that many
central banks still lacked the necessary room for monetary easing and gains
by other European currencies were limited.
There is an element of confusion and perplexity,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head
of research at IBJ International, the securities wing of the Japanese Bank
in London. 'What has limited reaction to the German move is the feeling that
it has only scratched the surface as far as the big issues facing Europe are
concerned.'
In Germany, reaction in some quarters was profoundly sceptical, although
others, worried about a German recession, were relieved at the cut in rates.
Mr Albrecht Schmidt, chief executive of Bayerische Vereinsbank, a German
bank, said that economic and inflationary conditions had 'not changed at
all'.
Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist of the same bank, argued that if the
Bundesbank were to retain its anti-inflationary credibility it would not be
able to cut rates further until the summer of next year at the earliest.
In France, where the central bank did not cut rates, the German move was
nonetheless welcomed by leaders fighting for a Yes vote in this week's
referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime
minister, said Germany had put the interests of Europe ahead of their own in
a move that was a 'great success' for Europe.
In Italy, Mr Gianni Zandanno, chairman of the Instituto Bancario San Paolo
di Torino, Italy's biggest bank, said: 'It would have made more sense if
this realignment had been matched by important economic measures sufficient
to redress our public finances.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / Panel censures Fayeds over House of Fraser purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAYED brothers were publicly censured yesterday by the Takeover Panel
for a breach of the Takeover Code during the 1985 acquisition of the House
of Fraser stores group, which includes Harrods.
The panel said statements made by the Fayeds during the takeover about their
business interests and income-generating capacity may have created a
misleading impression contrary to general principle 12 of the Code.
This requires statements sent to shareholders during the course of a bid to
be treated with the highest standards of care and accuracy. The panel made
no ruling as to whether the statements were intentionally misleading.
The Pounds 615m takeover has been the focus of a long running legal battle
between the Fayeds and Mr Tiny Rowland's trading conglomerate Lonrho.
Mr Paul Spicer, a director of Lonrho, said last night the panel report was
all right as far as it went. 'It's useful to have another authority other
than the DTI inspectors say that they misrepresented the truth. That's the
right conclusion, but it's a bit weak and so long after the event.' House of
Fraser dismissed as 'a minor matter' the public censuring of the Fayeds 7
1/2 years to the day after completion of the takeover.
A spokesman said the Fayeds did not accept the panel's verdict as it was
based on the Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report on the
affair, the findings of which were being challenged by the Fayeds before the
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Fayeds claimed that the
statements complained of were merely descriptions of their current business
interests and that no inference could be drawn from them as to the source of
their wealth or the origin of the funds used to buy the stores group.
The panel disagreed. It concluded that references in the initial public
statement in November 1984 to the Fayeds' 'wide-spread international
interests', when juxtaposed with the view that the acquisition of 29.9 per
cent of House of Fraser was 'a logical step in the continuing evolution of
these worldwide businesses', implied that the Pounds 138m investment had
been financed from the family's worldwide businesses.
The panel cleared Kleinwort Benson, the Fayeds' financial advisers at the
time, of any breach of the code.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Health Department blocks vaccines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Health has stopped using three of SmithKline Beecham's
vaccines for children because of potentially dangerous side effects, the
company said last night.
The department's decision is a blow for SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American drugs group, which has been expanding its vaccine business.
The vaccine industry had previously been constrained by the risk of legal
action in the event of side effects. However, recent US legal decisions have
concluded that benefits outweigh the risk of vaccinations.
The immediate financial impact of the move is minimal, however. The vaccines
had annual global sales of Pounds 15m.
The vaccines, called Pluserix, Paviorix and Rimparix, are used to inoculate
babies at about 15 months against measles, mumps and rubella, but can cause
a mild form of meningitis, it has emerged.
A study in Nottingham found the strain of mumps used in the vaccines, known
as the Urabe strain, can cause meningitis in one in every 11,000 children
vaccinated. It had previously been thought the rate of meningitis
attributable to the vaccines was one in 100,000.
Institut Merieux of France and Sclavo of Italy also use the Urabe strain in
their vaccines. Doctors in the UK are being advised to use an alternative
vaccine manufactured by Merck.
SmithKline Beecham said it was in discussions with other national health
authorities about the safety of the medicines. The Irish health authorities
last week decided to stop using vaccines with the Urabe strain.
SmithKline Beecham insisted no deaths had been caused by the vaccine-induced
meningitis. More than 35m doses had been administered in 70 countries, it
added.
The Health Department said the risks of contracting vaccine-related
meningitis were extremely small, and immunisation benefits, whichever
vaccine was used, were overwhelming. Any parents whose children had recently
been vaccinated should contact their doctor if they were concerned.

</HEADLINE>

THE RECESSION is continuing to depress domestic air travel, although
international traffic is showing further signs of recovery.
The latest traffic figures released yesterday by BAA, the airports operator,
showed a disappointing increase last month of just under 2 per cent in
domestic traffic at its UK airports, compared with August 1991. A BAA
official said: 'Although we are now starting to see the end of the Gulf war
effect on our business, we are now seeing the full effect of the recession
on our domestic business.'
A recovery in international traffic turned last month into the busiest on
record for BAA, whose airports handled a total of 8.2m passengers. That was
a 9 per cent increase on August last year.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Steelworkers in recognition row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STEEL union, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, which has never
been derecognised in its 100-year-plus history, is facing its second
derecognition contest.
A bitter industrial dispute at the Spartan Redheugh steel mill in Gateshead
has led to the sacking of all the blue-collar staff and the recruitment of
non-union workers.
Even more serious for the union, the Canadian-owned Sheerness Steel, based
on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, in the spring successfully withdrew
recognition from the 700-strong workforce at the same time as introducing
personal contracts, single status between white and blue-collar staff, and
performance-related pay.
Mr Ian Scobbie, the Sheerness ISTC official, said that the workforce was
unhappy about the decision to move to personal contracts, but with very high
local unemployment it had been difficult to win support for industrial
action.
He said derecognition also applied to representing members in individual
disciplinary cases.
Mr Hugh Billot, Sheerness Steel personnel director, told the magazine
Personnel Management Plus that after moving to single status and personal
contracts, 'we realised we no longer had anything to discuss with the
unions'. He said other companies had shown an interest in what the company
had done. The ISTC said there was no evidence for a wave of derecognition
cases.
Bifu, the finance union, has won recognition rights at the North of England
Building Society after a long battle with a company staff association. Bifu
has won recognition as the result of a 'membership audit'. Discussions with
the conciliation service Acas established Bifu as the organisation with the
highest support.

FIVE cases featured in a confidential police report alleging that
high-ranking homosexuals in Scottish legal circles may have interfered with
the course of justice and are to be reviewed, the Crown Office in Edinburgh
announced yesterday.
The move follows publication of a leaked version of the report in the
Edinburgh Evening News.
The newspaper said the confidential police document concluded a
well-established circle of homosexuals in Edinburgh with influence in the
justiciary may have formed associations that laid them open to blackmail,
and homosexuality 'may well have been used as a means to seriously interfere
with the administration of justice'.

FT  15 SEP 92 / Ulster electricity sell-off postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE completion of the privatisation of Northern Ireland's electricity
industry was postponed last night
In a surprise announcement, Mr Robert Atkins, Ulster's economy minister,
said several outstanding matters needed to be resolved before the sell-off.
Mr Atkins said: 'The most important of these relates to the funding of the
proposed interconnector to Scotland and an application which the government
has made to the European Commission for assistance towards its costs.
'The government strongly supports the application and hopes for its success
but recognises the need for the commission to undertake a thorough
evaluation of it. Consequently, although one option for the flotation of
Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) was November 1992, it will not be
possible to complete the sale this autumn. Once the outstanding matters have
been resolved, the sale will take place as soon as possible, dependent on a
suitable slot in the government's overall privatisation programme.'
NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector
project earlier this year and it is thought the government is seeking about
Pounds 70m from the commission towards the cost of construction.
The first part of the sell-off took place in April when Ulster's four power
stations went into private hands.
British Gas bought the biggest station, Ballylumford near Larne, East
Antrim; Nigen, an American-Belgian consortium, acquired Kilroot station,
near Carrickfergus, East Antrim, and Belfast West station. A
management-employee buy-out team bought the Coolkeeragh plant at
Londonderry. The sales grossed about Pounds 300m for the Treasury.
It had been anticipated that the transmission, distribution and supply
business would be floated in November, raising a further Pounds 350m for the
government.
Advertisements have been running almost nightly on Ulster Television
promoting the image of NIE, and the postponement has come as a shock.

<TEXT>
THE US Senate is heading for a further confrontation with President Bush
after a vote yesterday to impose conditions next year on China's Most
Favoured Nation status.
The House has already passed legislation to renew China's MFN status - which
provides the lowest tariffs possible - only on condition it improves human
rights and trade behaviour and adheres to curbs on missile and nuclear
exports. The House is expected to muster the two-thirds vote it needs to
override a veto.
Senators yesterday passed a similar measure by a voice vote, leaving in
doubt the number of senators prepared to go against the president.
Meanwhile, US trade officials were yesterday continuing talks in Beijing on
market access. With the China merchandise trade surplus likely to exceed
Dollars 15bn (Pounds 7.6bn) this year, the Bush administration badly wants a
victory at the negotiating table to restrain the forces seeking to impose
conditions on MFN.
Alternatively, the president can impose sanctions on up to Dollars 3.9bn in
goods if no agreement on access is reached with China before October 10.

FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Other countries follow Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK'S decision to cut its lending rates yesterday was swiftly
followed by rate cuts in some other European countries.
Reductions were mainly confined to countries whose currencies form the hard
core of the European exchange rate mechanism, while others, wary that the
German move was too small to allow much room for manoeuvre, chose to wait at
least until after the French referendum on Maastricht before easing monetary
conditions.
The Bank of Belgium said it would cut its discount rate to 8.25 per cent
from 8.5 per cent. Its emergency lending rate - equivalent to Germany's
Lombard rate - was cut to 11 per cent from 11.5 per cent. In the
Netherlands, the central bank followed the German move by lowering its three
key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.
In Austria, whose Schilling is informally linked to the D-Mark although not
part of the ERM, the central bank cut its lending rates to the same level as
in Germany. The Swiss, whose currency is also informally associated with the
D-Mark, cut the discount rate to 6.5 per cent. Mr Werner Abegg, of the Swiss
National Bank, said the Swiss franc's recent stability had made the central
bank's move possible.
Denmark, which usually follows German rates closely, had not decided
yesterday how to react. The central bank said it was waiting to see how the
currency markets developed.
The Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 9.60 per cent.
In Norway, analysts reckoned the central bank was unlikely to cut interest
rates soon, partly because the German move was too small to influence Norway
and partly because of economic turbulence in Scandinavia and doubts over the
outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht.
Sweden, which last week raised its marginal rate to 75 per cent, yesterday
cut it to 20 per cent.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE officials yesterday dismissed suggestions that Japan should cut its
own interest rates but welcomed the realignment of European currencies and
the German decision to reduce rates.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said that Japanese interest rates were
already low and that there was no reason to cut them further.
'The cumulative effects from the past five discount rate cuts are emerging
steadily and (interest) rates are at useful levels,' he said.
Mr Mamoru Ozaki, vice- finance minister, said Germany was intending to stem
the recent rise in the value of the D-Mark, but added: 'This, however, will
not inspire us to alter our monetary policy.'
Japanese financial markets nonetheless rallied yesterday, partly on
expectation of a further easing of Japanese rates. The Nikkei index of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange closed up 363.71 points, at 18,471.40. Traders said the
rally was partly a response to the 800 point decline on Friday, but
sentiment was aided by the prospect of an international move towards lower
interest rates.

<TEXT>
RANSOMES, the mowing machinery manufacturer, returned to the black in the
six months to June 30 but again passed its interim dividend.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.01m, compared with losses of
Pounds 767,000. Sales rose to Pounds 79.8m (Pounds 76.8m) and operating
profit increased by 42 per cent to Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 4.53m).
Mr Bob Dodsworth, chief executive, said the Pounds 2.3m cost of the
preference dividend and the continuing worldwide recession meant that the
group still could not afford to pay an ordinary dividend.
'We have turned the corner on the first half and July and August were better
than last year. But we still have a long way to go.'
Wetter weather in Europe helped consumer grass machinery to increase
operating profits to Pounds 2.01m (Pounds 614,000). 'The last three years
were very dry' said Mr Dodsworth. 'This year people have had to cut their
grass.'
Commercial grass machinery and industrial vehicles lifted operating profits
from Pounds 3.52m to Pounds 3.98m reflecting a reduction in the workforce
and tighter cost controls.
Another 80 jobs were shed across the group bringing the total below 2,000.
Small property disposals enabled the property division to increase operating
profits from Pounds 397,000 to Pounds 423,000.
Cost cutting and currency exchange movements helped reduce borrowings by
Pounds 16m to Pounds 73m, representing gearing of 190 per cent.
Mr Dodsworth said difficulties in exporting to the US and stiff US
competition arising from the weak dollar more than offset advantages of
exporting from US businesses.
Fully diluted earnings per share of 1.4p compared with losses of 1.6p.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn reduces Gola sportswear
interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTER CHADBURN is selling Gola Footwear, which has been blamed for Porter's
poor profit performance since April 1991.
It is being bought by William Lamb (Holdings) one of the companies from
which Gola was purchased in September 1990.
Porter will retain the Gola brand name giving Lamb an initial four-year
licence.
The consideration, receivable in cash as the stock is sold with a cut-off
date of September 1993, is expected to total Pounds 2m. The licence carries
a 3 per cent royalty fee with a minimum Pounds 650,000 over the four years.
Lamb has the option to acquire the brand for Pounds 1.35m cash at any time
during the term. Porter can require Lamb to buy the brand for Pounds 800,000
if the option has not been exercised by the fourth anniversary of
completion.
Porter is withdrawing from the other Gola businesses. Directors expect that
an exceptional charge of Pounds 6.6m will be needed. However, as Pounds 3.3m
relates to goodwill written off to reserves at the time of the acquisition
the net effect would be to reduce reserves by about Pounds 2.8m.
The company said that since April last year Gola Group had incurred losses,
substantial in relation to its size and to that of Porter Chadburn.

However, Mr John Burton, chairman, warned that there may be a worsening of

a more cautious view on the full year outcome.
The interim dividend goes up to 1.9p (1.8p), payable from earnings of 7p

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net profits of Kingston Oil &amp; Gas, tumbled from Pounds 593,842 to Pounds
142,644 in the six months to end-June as turnover fell by 18 per cent to
Pounds 2.94m.
However, operating and administration costs of the oil and gas producer were
only slightly down at Pounds 2.72m (Pounds 2.86m), leaving operating profits
of just Pounds 220,662 (Pounds 724,706).
An interest turnround to payable of Pounds 11,189 (Pounds 36,629 receivable)
left pre-tax profits at Pounds 209,473 (Pounds 761,335). Earnings came out
at 1.08p (4.48p) per share but the interim dividend is maintained at 1p.
Mr Ray Chambers, chairman, said the reduction in profits was principally
accounted for by a fall in the contribution from the US operations.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Second Alliance net assets off 6%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Second Alliance Trust had a net asset value of Pounds 12.79 per stock
unit at July 31 - a decline of some 6 per cent on the Pounds 13.61 of 12
months earlier.
Available revenue amounted to Pounds 7.15m (Pounds 6.93m), equivalent to
earnings of 37.22p (36.1p) per stock unit, the relatively modest growth
reflecting a slower rate of dividend increases and lower interest accrued
from the trust's cash balances.
A proposed final dividend of 24.5p brings the total for the year to 36.5p
(35p).

There was a Pounds 112,000 fall in interest payable to Pounds 218,000.
Turnover advanced 13 per cent to Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 20.2m) helped by two
new branches of CP Supplies opened in the period and the acquisition of two

A joint venture, K-R Insulation, has been set up with Kaefer Isoliertechnik

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As forecast at the interim stage, trading at Star Computer Group showed a
marked upturn in the second half with the result that the company ended the
year in the black.
The computer services concern achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 119,000
for the year to end-June, against a loss of Pounds 886,000 last time.
The outcome was struck on turnover down by some Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 7.33m.
The pre-tax figure was boosted by receivable interest of Pounds 32,000
against a charge of Pounds 123,000 last year.
The company said that both trading companies - Star Computers and Pinnacle -
had returned to profitability, with a positive contribution from all areas
of business.
The current year had started well, the directors added, with cash funds of
Pounds 804,000, no borrowings, a strong order book and a healthy level of
recurring revenue.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.9p (12.6p losses).

ASPEN Communications, the USM-quoted specialist print, communications and
media services group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 923,000 for the six
months to June 30.
This compared with profits of Pounds 1.15m at the interim stage last year
and with Pounds 1.7m at the December 1991 year end. Turnover for the period
rose by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 28.9m.
Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said turnover in each division was increasing
again and profits for both the second and third quarters of this year were
showing healthy improvements against 1991. New business levels were higher
than a year ago, he added.
Earnings per share were 4.6p (5.6p) and an interim dividend of 2p (2.7p) is
declared. However, the directors anticipate that the total dividend for the
year would be no less than the 4.9p paid in 1991.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Further buy as Brit Polythene advances 44%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIVE British Polythene Industries, the UK's largest polythene film
products maker, lifted pre-tax profits by 44 per cent, or almost Pounds 2m,
to Pounds 6.53m in the six months to June 30.
The company also announced the purchase of BP Chemical's UK polythene film
operations at Bromborough on the Wirral for Pounds 6.4m cash. In 1991 the
business made operating profits of Pounds 780,000 on turnover of Pounds
14.1m, though it is now trading at about break-even.
BPI's turnover rose 7 per cent to Pounds 85.2m (Pounds 79.4m), though Mr
Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive, said that the rise was
better than it seemed because 'virgin' polymer prices had halved between the
first six months of 1991 and 1992. From Pounds 730 per tonne, they fell to
Pounds 365 and currently stood at Pounds 420, though he said the outlook was
downward again.
Interest payable fell to Pounds 771,000 (Pounds 1.15m) - organically, Mr
McLatchie said, not because of October's Pounds 15.6m rights issue.
Those proceeds were spent on acquiring Courtaulds Plastic Films, now renamed
Brithene Films, for Pounds 9.21m, Hobbs Packaging for Pounds 2.52m,
Monopol/JAF Vickers for Pounds 725,000 and Gooch Plastics/Clingtech
Packaging for Pounds 3.2m. BPI estimated that the acquisitions contributed
Pounds 1.51m to group profits.
Since the period-end, a further Pounds 9m has been spent including the
purchase from BP. Mr McLatchie said that the company had been acquisitive in
policy for 'a while now', but that it was 'only in the last 12 months that
prices have been sensible'.
BPI has restructured itself from two to three divisions - industrial, retail
and films.
Industrial, where supplies to the building and agricultural markets were
depressed in the period, will account for about 44 per cent of turnover
after the restructure. Retail, which mainly supplies carrier bags to grocery
multiples, and films, which makes shrinkwrap, stretchwrap and film to the
convertor and lamination industries, will both account for about 28 per
cent.
Earnings per share rose to 15.25p (11.99p) basic and 13.51p (10.91p) fully
diluted. The interim dividend is lifted to 3.5p (3p), the first rise in the
half-year payment since 1989.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit down 42% as tyre sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION has finally caught up with Kwik-Fit Holdings, the tyres and
exhausts fitter, which yesterday reported a 42 per cent decline in interim
profits blaming a fall in new tyre sales and a shift by motorists towards
remould and cheaper tyres.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to August 31 fell to Pounds 9.74m,
including a Pounds 1.72m gain on the sale and leaseback of properties, from
Pounds 16.8m a year ago when a Pounds 23,000 gain was included. Turnover
dropped 8.5 per cent to Pounds 119.2m (Pounds 130.3m) while operating
profits halved to Pounds 9.08m (Pounds 18m).
The shares shed 13p to close at 96p, as analysts again slashed their profit
forecasts. This summer, current-year forecasts were cut from more than
Pounds 36m to Pounds 24m. After yesterday's announcement, the consensus was
about Pounds 16.5m, with some as low as Pounds 14m.
Tougher UK tyre tread depth legislation, introduced at the start of January,
boosted sales in the final quarter of last year. But despite hopes that the
new legislation will eventually boost the overall size of the market, the
sales boom fizzled out early this year and tyre sales dropped in May and
June 'as the continuing recession and the decline in consumer spending took
effect.'
In addition the company said large vehicle fleet operators had imposed more
stringent cost controls and, like private motorists, were deferring tyre
replacements for as long as possible. There was no improvement in the market
in July or August.
The decrease in total tyre demand, combined with an increase in the sale of
remould and cheaper new tyres, has resulted in reduced tyre margins. Exhaust
sales, however, had been maintained at last year's levels because
'replacement cannot be deferred for too long.'
Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive, said Kwik-Fit had continued to
control operating costs as tightly as possible, and borrowings had been
restricted. Capital expenditure in the period was Pounds 9m. Seven new
centres were opened during the first half and 30 new sites were under
development.
The group ended August with net borrowings of Pounds 6m, but is in the midst
of a stock reduction programme and expects to end the year with no net
borrowings compared with net cash of Pounds 3m at the end of February.
Earnings per share dropped by 46 per cent to 3.82p (7.01p) from which an
unchanged 1.35p interim dividend will be paid.
Mr Farmer added: 'The group will benefit from any uplift in sales as
motorists reach the point where they cannot defer car maintenance
requirements any longer.'
COMMENT
Kwik-Fit appears to have been surprised by the severity of downturn in tyre
sales, and the drop in pre-tax profits was much sharper than the market was
expecting. The pressure on margins shows just how volume-sensitive the
business is - rather like a national retail chain with the associated high
fixed costs. The first-half included some non-recurring costs such as sales
sponsorship, higher advertising, expansion costs and some reorganisation. It
will also be remembered for the unfortunate way in which the market learnt
that this was certainly not a recession-proof stock. Aside from trimming
costs and inventory, Kwik-Fit is now pinning its hopes for a sales recovery
on the imposition of tougher fines for bald tyres in October - police checks
have shown that up to a quarter of cars have at least one bald tyre - and
the usual seasonal sales bounce. With earnings per share as low as 6.5p,
Kwik-Fit is trading on a prospective p/e of 14.8 and still looks expensive.

FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Whitbread close to meeting pub target after
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD, the brewing and retailing group, is close to meeting its target
for the number of public houses it can control under the government's beer
orders which come into effect on November 1.
This follows the sale, agreed yesterday, of 223 pubs to Discovery Inns, a
new company headed by Mr Paul Smith, formerly managing director of Devenish,
the west country pubs group. Some of the other managers also came from
Devenish.
The sale price was not disclosed but analysts speculated it was in the
Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m range. Whitbread is receiving cash for the pubs. A
seven-year supply arrangement between Whitbread and Discovery Inns has been
agreed.
Mr Smith, who left Devenish in July 1991 when he bought its brewery in
Redruth, Cornwall, for Pounds 700,000, said that the pubs were mainly 'third
division' outlets all with tenants. He reckoned they could be developed as
traditional community pubs known for 'good ale and the hospitality of their
landlords'. The Redruth brewery would remain separate from Discovery Inns.
After the sale Whitbread will have about 100 pubs more than the 4,300 or so
it is allowed under the beer orders, which were introduced after the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the industry in 1989 found there
was a complex monopoly.
Whitbread has cut its estate from about 6,600 in November 1989 by selling
1,300 pubs, raising Pounds 200m, and leasing 900 pubs free from the 'tie' to
the brewer. The remaining 100 pubs will either be sold or leased on short
term leases by November 1.
Discovery Inns is financed about half and half by equity and debt and has a
longer term aim of coming to the stock market. Equity backing was arranged
by Kleinwort Benson Development Capital and loan capital by NM Rothschild.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPE &amp; FISHER, the building supplies and property company, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 420,000 for the half year to end-June. Sales rose
by Pounds 728,000 to Pounds 22.1m.
The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 436,000 in last year's first
half; the company returned to the black in the second six months.
The main reason for the upturn was the turnround in the building supplies
division, which achieved profits of Pounds 319,000 against a loss of Pounds
252,000.
Property also improved with a 13.5 per cent increase to Pounds 771,000.
Earnings emerged at 1.5p per share (1.4p losses) and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 1.5p.
Mr Charles Fisher, chairman and chief executive, said he had no reason to be
opti-mistic about the prospect of economic recovery in the short term.
Interest rates were still too high to promote any improvement in sales, he
added.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EOT, the Greek state tourist organisation, is to sell a hotel chain, six
marinas and three casinos in the first large disposal of state-owned assets
to be made in the government's two-year-old privatisation programme.
Other Eot properties to be offered for sale will include two golf courses,
on the islands of Corfu and Rhodes, and a dozen campsites around Greece.
The Xenia hotel chain, with 50 properties, is to be broken up so that larger
units in leading resort areas can be sold in a package with other assets,
such as a marina, a privatisation official said.
The government has appointed Arthur Andersen, the international accountants,
to carry out a review of Eot's assets and plan a strategy for their
disposal. Most of the hotels, leased to private Greek operators, run at a
loss and are badly in need of refurbishment.
The chain's overall debts amount to Dr400m (Dollars 2.2m). Eot holds a
monopoly on marina and casino operations in Greece. Both are profitable, but
considerable investment would be required to bring them up to the standards
of similar facilities in the western Mediterranean, according to Eot
officials.
At a later stage, another eight marinas still under construction will be
offered for sale. Eot also plans to issue up to 10 new casino licences to
private operators.
Meanwhile, the state-controlled Ionian Bank is seeking bids for the Athens
Hilton, owned by its subsidiary, Ionian Hotels, and for a new Hilton nearing
completion on Rhodes at a cost of Dr13bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECTICEL, the Belgian manufacturer of polyurethane foam, is to sell most of
the rest of its 44 per cent stake in Foamex LP, its US subsidiary, for
Dollars 156m.
The Belgian company, which changed its name from Gechem in June, plans to
sell 33.6 per cent of Foamex to its US partner, 21 International Holdings,
at book value, in effect ending an ill-judged move into the US foam market.
Mr Luc Vansteenkiste, chief executive, revealed yesterday that 'due to some
new circumstances' the group was considering an increase in negative
provisions in its 1992 accounts. He hinted that the write-offs  - which
would be announced with interim results next week - might be linked to
environmental liabilities of companies which have since been sold.
The sale of the Foamex stake is conditional on 21 International raising the
money through bank finance and the issue of high-yield bonds on the US
capital markets.
The US group will also repay a Dollars 15m loan to Recticel, bringing the
Belgian group's debt down to 140 per cent from more than twice shareholders'
funds. A new capital injection of BFr3bn (Dollars 103m) promised by June
next year will reduce gearing still further, to about 60 per cent.
Mr Vansteenkiste, who inherited Foamex when he took over as Gechem chief
executive last year, said yesterday: 'The acquisition, as of last year, had
not brought any money into the company, and we had to make a decision
whether to continue or whether to stop.'

FT  15 SEP 92 / NY Senate race sets new standards in seediness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYONE knows that New York politics can be among the roughest and meanest
in the US. But even by New York standards the four-way Democratic Senate
primary race - culminating in today's vote - will go down as one of the most
vitriolic campaigns in many years.
The winner of this melee will challenge Mr Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a
right-wing politician from suburban Long Island, who has thus far tramped
about the US citing the fact that he has been rebuked rather than censured
by the Senate ethics committee as proof that he has been exonerated of past
influence-peddling charges.
Mr D'Amato is considered vulnerable this year, not least because of his
chequered record. But the Democrats have engaged in so much mud-slinging
that there is unlikely to be much high ground left to be gained by his
opponent.
Although her substantial early lead has nearly evaporated, the front-runner
among the Democrats is 56-year-old Ms Geraldine Ferraro, the former
congresswomen from the Queens who in the 1984 presidential election served
as Mr Walter Mondale's controversial running mate.
Ms Ferraro's troubles first began during the 1984 campaign when allegations
were made about the legality of her husband's business dealings. He pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanour after the campaign.
An unabashed supporter of capital punishment, Ms Ferraro styles herself as a
no-nonsense feminist with a working-class background.
It is the negative campaigning of her rivals that has raised the possibility
that she may not make it after all. Advertisments by rivals have accused Ms
Ferraro's landlord husband of ties to the Mafia and have repeatedly alleged
he rented a house to a child pornographer.
Ms Ferraro's keenest challenger, New York State attorney-general Mr Robert
Abrams, has not been hesitant to make use of the controversy. Neither has Ms
Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswomen and New York's current
comptroller.
Oddly enough the only candidate who has not attacked Ms Ferraro over ethics
is the normally demagogic Rev Al Sharpton. He arrived at a televised debate
last week with a symbolic bucket of mud for his colleagues. The debate among
the Senate Democratic primary candidates became so heated that the moderator
kept intervening to say: 'Ladies, ladies, ladies, Ms Holtzman, Ms Ferraro. .
.'
Issues have thus taken a back seat to insults, which means that even if Ms
Ferraro does win today, she is unlikely to be the unblemished sort of
challenger who can make much of the various investigations of Mr D'Amato.
The seediness of this year's New York Senate race looks set to continue.
Jurek Martin adds from Washington; Another race of interest concerns
Congressman Stephen Solarz, the Democratic foreign policy expert.
His old safe House of Representatives seat in Brooklyn has been redrawn  -
with the purpose of promoting Hispanic representation in Congress - and he
may be vulnerable to the challenge of Ms Elizabeth Colon, an advocate of
Puerto Rican interests.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Audit reform plan resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should retain the requirement for small limited liability
companies to be audited, the president of the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants said at the weekend.
In an outspoken address to the annual conference of the association, which
represents 30,000 accountants, Mr David Bishop called supporters of
abolition of the smaller-company audit 'wrong, outdated in their thinking
and nave.'
Mr Bishop, who is a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said the audit provided
protection for all those associated with a company and imposed disciplines
that helped rather than hindered businesses.
Earlier this year, the Department of Trade and Industry said it was
considering lifting the requirement for small companies, possibly those
below the Pounds 36,600 turnover VAT threshold.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants have been among the
organisations since then that have lent support to reform of the existing
system.
They say it is costly, irrelevant and contradictory in its present form.
However, the association, which has many members who perform audits on small
companies, has always stood out against abolition and has been lobbying the
government in the last few weeks for its retention.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Ashdown warned off pact with Labour: Liberal Democrats open
conference in Harrogate Call for independent Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN re-ceived a blunt warning from his party's grassroots
activists yesterday not to respond to the Conservatives' fourth general
election victory in April by seeking electoral deals with the Labour party.
As the Liberal Democrats opened their annual conference in Harrogate with a
searching analysis of their election failure, several influential activists
blamed fear of a Labour-Liberal coalition.
But Mr Ashdown, who responded to the election result with a call for the
party to act as the catalyst for a broad anti-Conservative coalition, won
some support for his argument that the party should keep open the option of
a dialogue with Mr John Smith, Labour leader.
Speaking as the conference debate opened, Mr Ashdown emphasised that his aim
was to mobilise anti-Tory support from across the opposition spectrum -
including from those who had opted out of politics - rather than to strike a
'cosy' deal with Labour. He drew an analogy with the success in the early
1980s of the Social Democratic party in attracting millions of previously
uncommitted voters.
'I have not the slightest intention of allying this party with a Labour
party that remains unelectable,' he said. However, he also insisted that
dialogue with Mr Smith on issues such as electoral reform and in areas where
the two parties' policies coincided should not be ruled out along with
electoral pacts.
Opinion among grassroots activists in yesterday afternoon's four-hour
discussion of strategy hardened around a renewed commitment to the community
politics which many see as the bedrock of third-party success.
Speakers showed little inclination to appeal to those who voted Conservative
in the election and spoke repeatedly of the need to end the sequence of Tory
governments. But fierce antagonism towards Labour was a marked
characteristic of the debate.
Ms Liz Lynne, the recently elected MP for Rochdale, said to applause: 'We
don't achieve our objectives by making pacts, doing deals or by having
massive dialogue with the Labour party.'
However, Mr Tom McNally, a former MP, said the priority had to be to get rid
of the Conservative government. 'I'm not talking about pacts or deals, I'm
talking about keeping options open and having a dialogue,' he said. 'It
would be a betrayal of the millions who have suffered under this government
if we didn't undertake that dialogue to get rid of this government.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / Major's currency strategy supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT for government refusal to devalue sterling was offered yesterday by
Mr Paddy Ashdown - but the Liberal Democrat leader called for the policy to
be buttressed by the announcement of independence for the Bank of England
and an extra Pounds 2bn of public spending.
The party believes that an independent central bank, together with a move to
the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism and a commitment to
European economic and monetary union would enable interest rates to be
reduced.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, also argues that
adoption of the targeted extra public spending on infrastructure projects
would increase confidence in sterling.
The infrastructure programme would be financed through public borrowing, as
the party does not believe that an increase of that scale in the
public-sector borrowing requirement would be unsustainable, given the high
present level of private savings.
Although that approach is likely to be endorsed with little difficulty in
this morning's debate, the party's economic team is braced for criticism
that its policy is too rightwing in some respects.
Ms Sonia Whitaker, party secretary in Beckenham, said yesterday that during
the election Liberal Democrat economic policy had appeared 'Thatcherite' in
its emphasis on low inflation, and not enough importance had been attached
to measures to create jobs.
More sustained dissent is in prospect on the party's approach to
privatisation, where its emphasis on breaking up monopolies whether public
or private-sector and on developing competition is seen by some Liberal
Democrats as being too close to that of the Tories.
The consultation paper to be discussed on Wednesday morning asserts that the
'debate between nationalisation and privatisation belongs to history', and
argues that policy for the utilities should be based on tightening
regulation and improving the services offered to the consumer.
Unease among some party members at the relatively neutral attitude towards
future privatisations is also signalled by the decision to hold separate
votes on the motion's welcome for the franchising of rail services and
stations and on its support for the gradual reduction of the price at which
the Post Office is able to operate the letter monopoly.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading players ponder party's role: Philip Stephens joins
delegates in considering where the 'third force' can go from here
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DILEMMA was encapsulated by Mr Charles Kennedy. The Liberal Democrats,
the party president declared recently, must decide whether they still hold
out as their objective, short or long-term, replacing Labour as the
principal alternative to the Conservatives. If not, they must redefine their
role in British politics.
Six months after a general election that saw Britain's third party step back
from the abyss of the late 1980s but then fall well short of its aspirations
for the 1990s, it is far from clear that the Liberal Democrats are willing
to confront their predicament.
The headline on the Conference issue of Liberal Democrats News tells the
story: No to Pacts, it declares, Yes to Progress. In other words, the issue
that swamped Mr Paddy Ashdown's general election campaign - would he do a
deal with Labour to get the Conservatives out? - is now dominating the
post-mortem.
Liberal Democrat leaders protest that talk of pacts or deals is the
obsession of the media. It offers an easy excuse to lazy journalists to
ignore the more complicated analysis of the party's policies.
But in the approach to this week's conference in Harrogate, no one has been
more obsessed than the leadership with how a party with 20 MPs can exercise
influence unless it is ready to strike a tacit understanding with Mr John
Smith.
In a breathless leap of imagination, Mr Simon Hughes, the party's
environment spokesman, has sought to concertina the whole debate by
dismissing talk of a pre-election pact - and then moving on to discuss the
party's tactics if Mr Smith heads a minority government after the election
due in 1996 or 1997. There is no concession to the possibility that the
world might have changed rather dramatically by then.
Mr Hughes is not alone. Mr Ashdown insists that talk of pacts is a
diversion. Yet at the core of the speech in Chard that began the
pre-conference debate about the party's role was a presumption that the
Liberal Democrats could no longer afford to be exclusive in their approach
to politics. A realignment of the opposition to Mr John Major was essential.
Among the party's MPs, memories of the election campaign - when the party
was drawn into a fruitless and damaging discussion of how many seats it
might demand in a cabinet presided over by Mr Neil Kinnock - appear to have
faded. So, too, apparently, has concern that it was the perception that Mr
Ashdown was ready to hand the keys of No 10 to the Labour leader that drove
many wavering voters back into the arms of the Conservatives.
The final election result was not a disaster. The party's 20 seats and 18
per cent of the vote was deeply disappointing when measured against the
aspirations of the old Liberal/SDP Alliance - but it was tribute also to Mr
Ashdown's success in rescuing the party from the wreckage of the now Lord
Owen's destructive departure. Three years ago, its support was down to 5 per
cent.
The problem for the party leader is that with Mr John Major back in Downing
Street the political reality does not distinguish between 5 and 18 per cent.
The Liberal Democrats are powerless, and Mr Ashdown sees no point in
politics for a party that is forever denied the capacity to implement
change.
Not all the party's activists agree with the analysis. A submission to the
conference from the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors -
representing the party's 3,500 local councillors and, more important, its
strong roots in community activism - calls for the party to devote its
energies to discussing 'new ideas, not dead-end deals'.
Mr Ashdown has sought to finesse the threat from some of the more vociferous
local activists of open warfare within the party. He insists that his appeal
for a less exclusive party is directed towards the creation of a broad-based
movement to win the battle of ideas against the Conservatives rather than do
a cosy deal with Mr Smith.
The party leader has been careful also to emphasise his parallel concern
that the Liberal Democrats maintain and develop a distinctive policy agenda.
The policy document that the conference will debate later today sets out the
party's commitment to market economics, to an effective environmental
strategy and to enlightened social and education policies as well as the
more familiar themes of electoral reform and decentralisation of power.
Mr Ashdown is serious about the policies, although he too frequently
obscures them in slogans about choice and opportunity and television sound
bites about the 'new politics' or the 'new agenda'. But talk of positioning
the Liberal Democrats at the centre of a new anti-Tory coalition is a
smokescreen. There is no sign of a huge untapped reservoir of support for
such a movement among the don't knows and don't cares in the British
electorate. The demise of the Greens can be attributed in part to that
party's self-destructive tendencies, but it reflects also the apathy of an
electorate still content to see politics as a non-participatory game.
The only realistic possibility is an understanding with Mr Smith - based on
the hope that Labour will be ready to embrace electoral reform before the
next election. It is that option that Mr Ashdown wants to keep open. But
neither he nor his party seems prepared this week in Harrogate to answer Mr
Kennedy's question.

FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Adjusting to reality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the size of the cut in German interest rates we are promised from
this morning's Bundesbank meeting, there are two possible conclusions to be
drawn from the weekend's currency excitements.
One is that the European Monetary system has again become the system of
fixed but adjustable rates which its founders intended. In recent years, as
realignments became increasingly rare, Europe had seemed to be on its way
towards monetary union by inertia: now, the markets have forced a reversion
to flexibility. Fixed exchange rates will have to come about by fiat -
through the Maastricht treaty or some later reprise - rather than by
default.
A second conclusion might be that German interest rates are now, inexorably,
heading down - and with them, rates in the rest of Europe. On this view,
there might be a hiccup or two on the way, if the Bundesbank's backwoodsmen
were able to rally their forces, but the growing weakness of the German
economy would ensure that any re-tightening was momentary rather than
sustained.
For most markets, these two conclusions lead in directly contrary
directions. For over a year, investors have been expecting to treat the turn
in German interest rates as a buying signal. Yet the newly demonstrated
adjustability of the ERM makes weak currencies such as sterling that much
more vulnerable.
But even for stronger currencies, last night's realignment holds a message.
It places the responsibility for convergence on the shoulders of politicians
rather than central banks. The Maastricht ratification process has shown how
little prepared they are to carry that burden.
There is one market, however, for which only half of this pair of matched
conclusions applies. The dollar stands to gain from a sustained reduction in
German interest rates, but is exempt from Europe's convergence neurosis. If
the markets really believe that the turn has come in D-Mark interest rates,
the dollar will show the impact most clearly.
One other market will be particularly sensitive in the coming days - not
least because it will be the one the Bundesbank watches most closely. The
German bond market will doubtless rally in the wake of the cut in short-term
rates.
The critical question is how far that rally will go, and whether it succumbs
to second thoughts. A weak rally, or one that is reversed in a matter of
weeks, would be a vote of no confidence in the Bundesbank's ability to
pursue anti-inflationary policies independent of political pressure. That
would not reverse the medium-term direction of European interest rates; but
it would put a floor under them well above the levels which are currently
failing to reignite the US.

Connoisseurs of political whistling in the dark may care to compare the
Finnish president's statement after last week's flotation of the markka with
two classic British examples of former times.
'My conviction is that our currency is not fundamentally overvalued and that
there is a real possibility that when more transactions are made, when
exporters and importers meet, the level of the exchange rate will be
substantially lower (meaning a stronger markka) than the level of those very
few and non-representative transactions that have got much publicity.'
President Mauno Koivisto, as reported by Reuter, September 8 1992.
'That doesn't mean, of course, that the pound here in Britain - in your
pocket or purse or in your bank - has been devalued.' Prime Minister Harold
Wilson, November 19 1967.
'We have had great losses in equipment, but our men have gained immeasurably
in experience of warfare.' War Minister Anthony Eden, commenting on the
Dunkirk evacuation, June 2 1940.

What a way to run a water board] Welsh Water, which has been frightening its

Welsh Water is expected to announce soon a co-operation deal with Manweb
whereby it shares some of Manweb's depots in north Wales. It makes sound
commercial sense and Welsh Water says in a leaked briefing note that it is
disappointed that much larger savings remain unexplored in south Wales.
Unfortunately, Welsh Water mistakenly faxed a draft of the proposed press
release to South Wales Electricity, which indignantly ripostes that it has
always been happy to co-operate on such deals. The problem is that Welsh
Water has never suggested it.

Besides producing numerous publications including the BBC book How do you

has advised such blue chip clients as Mercedes-Benz, IBM and Hitachi on
customer-service initiatives. His speciality is on changing attitudes in
organisations to make their culture more user-friendly, rather than just
'sticking spears up people's backsides'.
A former academic, Nicholson almost became a rock musician after graduating

also played the piano for the Balliol Players in a spoof of an
Aristophanes-style comedy in which Chris Patten, now our man in Hong Kong,
played Queen Victoria.
All useful early training, no doubt, for his objective of helping 'civil
servants behave in a civil way'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget Terry Smith, the sacked head of research at UBS Philips &amp; Drew and
his book Accounting for Growth. When it comes to publishing runaway
financial best-sellers, Peter Tasker can show Smith a clean pair of heels
any day.
The head of research at Kleinwort Benson's Tokyo office is already on to his
third successful book (written in Japanese, to boot), and without a cross
word from his employers - so far, anyway.
Having spent the last 10 of his 36 years in Tokyo, he has won the rare
distinction of getting both a novel and a serious non-fiction work in the
Japanese best-seller list within 12 months of one another. Sales of his End
of the Japanese Golden Era have topped 80,000 copies, and his first novel
Silent Thunder has sold 35,000 and is now being published in English.
As financial-thriller writers go, he places himself somewhere between new
life peer Jeffrey Archer and Paul Erdman. He says he's more serious than the
noble lord, but not quite so well qualified as Erdman, who penned his first
work in a Swiss jail after trying to corner the world cocoa market for a
Californian bank.
Like most money-mystery spinners, Tasker draws heavily on real life models
for his characters. For instance, Silent Thunder features a big securities
firm which gets up to much hanky-panky, a Japanese prime minister who is
deposed by right-wing radicals, and a Japan-bashing American senator with
his eye on the US presidency. There is also plenty of sex, and no lack of
MOF officials getting 'rubbed out'.
The story, however, also has its serious side - the radicalisation of trade
frictions between Japan and its trading partners. 'It is something that
could happen,' Tasker warns.
He should know. He is ranked as the number one strategist by Japanese
institutions.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Letter: Insurers work with patients to contain charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROY FORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Lawrence's letter (September 10) criticised medical insurers for
discouraging the patients of hospitals and specialists from approving or
querying their charges.
He asserted that it was 'in the interests of efficiency' that insurers
settle a patient's bills by paying the health care provider rather than the
insured person. That is not so. Direct settlement, which was initiated years
ago by PPP, was introduced as a service to the subscriber, to minimise the
worry to the a patient caused by having to pay large sums himself, be
out-of-pocket for a while, and reclaim the money from his insurer. The
direct settlement system costs the insurer, in cash flow terms, more money,
but that was judged to be worthwhile to give this valuable service to the
patient.
Despite Mr Lawrence's implication that direct settlement is done without the
patient's approval, in most cases it has in fact been done only with his
express prior consent.
Far from not wanting patients to check their accounts from health care
providers, PPP actually states in current literature: 'Please check
thoroughly any medical bills to ensure that they accurately reflect the
services provided.'
We therefore already act in agreement with Mr Lawrence's basic point that
insurers need to work with patients in seeking to constrain increasing
charges.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Letter: British companies display little determination to
export
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GAVIN CLEZY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In Britain we are rightly concerned at our negative trade balance, but
even a serious recession doesn't seem to have significantly blunted our
thirst for imports. Much is made of the relative strength of sterling, the
quality of our products, R&amp;D, delivery service, etc. but, important as all
these may be, I suggest that there is another, rather simpler, explanation
for our success in importing rather than exporting. Importing is so much
easier.
As a British but bilateral Chamber of Commerce we do our best to help
British companies export to Italy and, committed to the concept of trade, we
also help Italian companies export to Britain. When we receive a request for
information we write in reply stating exactly what we can supply and how
much we will charge for it. This information is usually quite simple and the
amounts charged are extremely modest.
So far this year only 14 per cent of British companies have taken up our
offers and this compares with a much more positive 52 per cent response from
Italian companies. And this despite the fact that, from long and negative
experience, we charge UK companies less than those in Italy. As a result our
income from Italian companies for this type of service is over five times as
much as that from British companies.
Our experience is shared by local, Italian market research organisations
which have great difficulty in persuading potential British exporters to pay
more serious sums of money for more profound research. I believe our
experience as a chamber is similar to that of other British chambers in
Europe and wonder if we have given up the belief that 'one has to spend
money to make money'.
Or is it simply another symptom of our lack of determination and tenacity in
increasingly competitive world markets? If I were chairman of a UK company
and worried about results I would have a good, hard look at the export
department.

Sir, In your editorial, 'Tired of life' (September 11), you state that in
the BTA's annual report I 'trotted out the usual complaints about a
litter-strewn, tired and tarnished city'.
This was not my complaint. My comments referred to London's image, which I
said 'regrettably, has become more than a little tired, even tarnished, in
recent years' and announced a major campaign which seeks to put this right.
It is the BTA's job to promote Britain in overseas markets and we naturally
do all we can to present a favourable picture of our most popular
destination. This is why, together with the London Tourist Board and
industry partners, we are launching a campaign in the US which will
highlight what our great capital has to offer.
But promotion has to be matched to performance and we cannot afford to be
complacent. We have to listen to what visitors tell us. London still has its
share of problems and we have called for a determined effort to tackle them.
We hope Londoners will respond, because the income from tourism, some Pounds
4.5bn a year, is vitally important to all.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Letter: ERM exerts no constraints on freedom of currency
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS COLCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, From time to time your columnists assert that the exchange rate
mechanism is a denial of the free market, because it attempts to fix the
price of sterling. Joe Rogaly did so scathingly last week ('Mr Majtricht's
logic', September 8).
In fact, the market in sterling - and any other ERM currency - is totally
free: no private buyer is constrained to buy, and no private seller is
prevented from selling, at the going price. No foreign exchange traders are
told to obey price controls. No exchange controls are constraining the free
decision of investors to get into or out of the currency.
There happens to be a powerful swing producer at work. The British
government is to sterling what Saudi Arabia is to crude oil. It is not the
sole creator of sterling - the banking system makes money too - but it is a
very powerful supplier of it. In any trade, those in such a privileged
position always have two options, both consistent with the free market.
They can decide, in some way, on an output and let the price move around. Or
they can decide on a price and alter the supply. Both strategies are an
everyday part of business life.
There is room for argument as to which of those two options the government
and the Bank of England should pursue. Those who believe - count me in -
that the main function of money is to have a stable worth will be inclined
to maintain its price against something, whether gold, the D-Mark or goods
in general, and vary its supply. Those who see sterling mainly as a
lubricant for economic activity will want to print a generous supply of it,
and let the markets value the result.
That is the essence of the argument about the pound in the ERM. In
conducting it, neither side can argue that the other is trying to throttle
market forces.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Quest for plugs to fill City's leaky sieve: A law on UK
insider dealing is soon to be introduced. Richard Waters and Robert Peston
ask whether it will catch all offenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes it seems as though the City leaks price-sensitive information like
a sieve.
Two marketmakers overhear a conversation on their banks' trading floor that
Grand Metropolitan, a leisure group, is about to make a bid. A secretary at
the Office of Fair Trading learns of several bids about to be referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A young banker hears from a colleague
that there is about to be a bid for Pleasurama, a leisure group.
These are all cases that have led to insider dealing prosecutions in the
past two years. In each, the defendants were acquitted of trying to profit
from their inside knowledge.
The British government is about to try again to plug the holes in the sieve.
An EC directive will make insider dealing a criminal act in all Community
countries for the first time. This has prompted Mr Anthony Nelson, the
treasury minister who recently took over responsibility for City regulation,
to introduce into parliament in October new insider dealing legislation as
part of the Criminal Justice Act.
The thrust of the Treasury's changes is to broaden the scope of what
constitutes insider dealing. At present, it applies only to trading a
particular company's securities on the basis of unpublished price-sensitive
information about that company. The information also has to come from
someone closely connected to the company (a 'primary insider').
The scope will be widened in several important ways. First, the law will
apply not only to company securities. Trading in the gilt market on the
basis of confidential market-moving news would also be caught. Such trading
is alleged to have happened 10 days ago, shortly before the British
government announced extensive moves to shore up sterling. However, the law
will still not cover the foreign exchange markets, or dealings that are made
outside what it calls a 'regulated market'.
Second, all information that affects a company's share price will be
covered, not just information about the company itself. So information about
a company's competitor or information about an industry could be inside
information. In addition, the need for a 'primary insider' will disappear.
That should make it easier to prosecute City advisers who learn of
price-sensitive news through others they work with, rather than directly
from a company.
Finally, the new law makes it illegal for the possessor of inside
information to encourage someone else to deal in shares, even if that person
is not told the inside information.
This proposed widening of the act has caused consternation in the City. At
the end of July the government took the unusual step for primary legislation
of circulating a draft of the new law to interested organisations, including
the British Merchant Banking Association, the Securities and Futures
Association and the Stock Exchange.
Nonetheless, regulators, market authorities and brokers are *something in
here (HP) *
worried that far-reaching changes are being rushed into law without a full
assessment of their impact. The City is concerned that the law will
interfere with its proper function of helping to get important information
out to investors and the public at large.
If, as planned, the act catches any information that may affect a company's
prospects that has not already been 'made public' (another broad phrase in
the proposed law), brokers' analysts could find themselves treading a
minefield. The BMBA has been concerned that the law might define as inside
information even those conclusions drawn from publicly available
information. However, the Treasury has taken great pains to ensure that
analysts' research based on such information will not be caught by the act.
On the other hand, almost all conversations with companies will probably put
the analyst in possession of inside information, because the definition of
inside information has been broadened so much.
In reality, the law may not have such a big effect on analysts. Their
relations with companies are already governed by the existing legislation.
If companies seek to influence their share prices through a series of nods
and winks to analysts, then in theory that is already covered by the act -
although no prosecutions have been attempted.
Analysts may actually find themselves less open to prosecution in some
cases. As required by EC legislation, the new UK law will apply only to
information that is 'precise'. So if a finance director nudges an analyst to
alter his or her conclusions about a company's trading prospects, without
actually giving out hard information, it would be more difficult to mount a
prosecution.
However, the Treasury does not believe that analysts will escape lightly. It
says that the word 'precise' refers to information with a direct provable
relationship to share price movements, such as guidance on a company's
profits, as opposed to 'general' information, such as inflation or trade
figures which have a less easily demonstrable effect on share prices.
In general, the proposed changes may bring more deals into the scope of
insider dealing. However, they may give the authorities only marginal help
in achieving a higher success rate in their prosecutions.
In 28 insider dealing trials over the past 11 years, almost half the
defendants have been acquitted. Of those who have been convicted, more than
half pleaded guilty - including Mr Geoffrey Collier, the Morgan Grenfell
director convicted in 1987 and the biggest City figure caught by
investigators.
The need to prove 'intention' in insider cases is a great problem. Cases
have often collapsed because of the difficulty of proving beyond any
reasonable doubt that someone dealt in securities precisely because he or
she was in possession of inside information. In other words, proving that
someone has been 'knowingly' dealing as an insider has been difficult.
However the new law should help prosecutions in that it puts the onus on the
defence to prove that any dealing was not prompted by inside information -
rather than on the prosecution to prove that it was, as at present.
The weakness of the prosecution record has in recent years prompted calls
both from the City, in the shape of the Securities and Futures Authority and
the London Stock Exchange, and Westminster (the trade and industry select
committee) for an overhaul of the way insider dealing is investigated and
prosecuted.
There have been suggestions that investigators should be given greater
powers, that a new body should be created to centralise the fragmented
investigatory system, and that additional civil sanctions should be
introduced for cases where a criminal prosecution seems unlikely to succeed.
By rushing through the changes this autumn, the Treasury may have pre-empted
discussion. A chance to plug more holes in the sieve may have been missed.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Free annual report service
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL TIMES has launched a new service for private investors who
would like to receive the annual reports of listed companies.
Readers wanting companies' annual or interim report can now use a single
telephone number to obtain them, free.
The key to the new service is the London Share Service pages of the FT, the
last two inside pages of the second section.
Here's how the service works:
1. Look up the company name. Companies are arranged by industry sector.
Those companies for which the service is available are marked with an
ace-of-clubs symbol after the company name. At the moment, 130 listed
companies have agreed to join the service. Companies which have already
joined include Bank of Scotland, Hanson, National Power, Smithkline Beecham
and Unilever.
2. Turn to the bottom right-hand corner of the London Share Service.
In a paragraph headed FT Annual Reports Service you'll find the telephone
number for the service and a code you must quote to make use of it.
3. Call the service, give the code, and ask for reports for the companies in
which you are interested (only one report per company, please).
The lines are open between 9am and 5.30pm on weekdays but there is an
answering service at other times.
Reports will be sent the next working day, depending on availability.
4. Remember that annual reports only become available a few weeks after the
publication of the company's preliminary results.
5. There is no charge for using the service.
The telephone call is charged at normal rates.

<TEXT>
thought to be worth Pounds 50m - for stakes in Argentina's gas transmission
and distribution companies when Gas del Estado, the state gas company, is
privatised later this year.
The company is interested in stakes in two newly-created transmission
companies and eight regional distribution companies. Final bids are due on
November 18, with stakes likely to be awarded soon afterwards. The Dollars
2.7bn (Pounds 1.37bn) sale of Gas del Estado is one of Argentina's largest
privatisations.
Gas del Estado has a 6,500-mile main transmission network - which is to be
split into two companies covering the north and south of the country - and
30,000 miles of distribution pipeline, to be split into eight regional
companies. It has 4m customers, and total sales of 600bn cubic feet a year.
British Gas already has two exploration licences and interests in four of
Argentina's producing oil and gas fields.
British Gas is keen to boost profits from its Global Gas business to offset
the effect of falling earnings from its UK supply business, where regulators
are forcing price cuts and accelerating competition. It already has
distribution projects in Turkey, Egypt and Indonesia, and a 5 per cent stake
in Verbundnetz Gas, the former east German gas transmission company, and
stakes in two German regional gas distribution companies.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Banks meet on Jubilee Line extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS meeting in Toronto today may decide the fate of the Jubilee Line
extension to London's docklands and whether a move to acquire Canary Wharf
organised by Mr Paul Reichmann, founder of the financially troubled property
development, will succeed.
The 11 commercial bank lenders to Canary Wharf have been told by the UK
government they must submit proposals for a private sector contribution to
the cost of the Jubilee Line by the end of September.
A banker who will attend the meeting said there was 'no chance' of the banks
agreeing on how any Jubilee contribution should be made by that deadline.
Another banker said he did not believe the government was 'serious' about
the deadline. However a government official said over the weekend that there
was no possibility of the Jubilee Line extension being built without a
proposal from the banks on a payment by the time next year's public spending
is decided.
Control of Canary Wharf passed to administrators, under UK insolvency
legislation, at the end of May.
To date, neither the banks, nor the administrators, who are three partners
of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, have come up with detailed plans to
complete the huge east London property development or fund the Jubilee
extension. One banker described this lack of progress as 'a shambles'.
However, an investment consortium formed by Mr Paul Reichmann - whose
company, Olympia &amp; York, created Canary Wharf - has made the only detailed
takeover proposal to be received by the banks.
Some banks are opposed to any proposal linked to Mr Reichmann, because they
blame him for the huge losses they face on loans to O&amp;Y projects. One
European bank said it was implacably opposed.
The investment consortium, whose members include Mr Larry Tisch, the media
billionaire, Mr Sandy Weill, the financier, and Mr Lewis Ranieri, the
investment banker, proposes to lend between Pounds 235m and Pounds 350m to
recapitalise Canary Wharf and contribute to the Jubilee Line.
The precise amount they lend will depend on two factors:
They will provide Pounds 50m less if the administrators sell the freeholds
of two Canary Wharf buildings to Texaco, the oil company, and Morgan
Stanley, the investment bank. The consortium believes these sales would
reduce the project's long-term value. An unfavourable deal on letting office
space to the UK government would reduce by Pounds 65m the amount to be lent.
Though Mr Reichmann will not provide any of the consortium's capital, he
would benefit if its bid were to succeed. The consortium would get 60 per
cent of the equity in phases 1 and 2a of Canary Wharf's development and 40
per cent of later phases.
However, Mr Reichmann is insisting on getting a 60 per cent equity interest
in later phases and 20 per cent of the early phases - leaving the banks with
an interest of just 20 per cent of phases 1 and 2a.
All the banks reject the consortium's proposal that it should be repaid in
full before the banks receive any principal or interest. They also want a
higher interest rate than the 5 per cent proposed by the consortium.
The consortium however believes that under its proposal banks would
eventually be repaid between 82 per cent and 100 per cent of their loans.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: Why realignment should not block EMS
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What looked like a perfectly horrible week for Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
Chancellor, has suddenly become more promising.
Having failed so far to produce economic recovery at home, he was due to
head for Washington later this week with the seemingly impossible goal of
resuscitating economic policy coordination among the leading industrial
democracies.
Before yesterday's ERM realignment - and the even more striking announcement
of an imminent cut in German interest rates - next weekend's meeting risked
achieving a hollow victory. One similar, in fact, to that attained at the
informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank
governors a week ago in Bath.
If anything, the four point statement agreed in Bath to stand by existing
parities in the European Monetary System exacerbated tensions in the system
once the perception grew that the German Bundesbank was less than
wholehearted in its support.
Without yesterday's announcement, Mr Lamont would have had to face the
problem of arriving in Washington as chairman of the EC finance ministers'
council, to represent a continent with its monetary policies in disarray.
The meeting would be one at which neither the US nor Japan, the other two
main players, would want to commit themselves to policy change.
The biggest problem bedevilling world monetary relations has been the large
6.75 per cent differential between official US and German short-term
interest rates. The US, with a presidential election less than two months
away, has shown no signs of wishing to abandon the flexibility that has
allowed it to push its discount rate to a 29-year low of 3 per cent in a bid
to stimulate its economy.
In Bath, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, offered no hope of
an immediate cut in German rates. Over the past week, it appeared that Mr
Schlesinger was extremely displeased at the way the chancellor appeared to
hype the Bundesbank's Bath promise not to increase its interest rates 'in
present circumstances' into a victory for UK monetary diplomacy.
That left Mr Lamont preparing to deliver a gloomy message at the G7: the
increasingly bleak outlook for economic activity in the western world; the
problems caused by inappropriate mixes of fiscal and monetary policy in both
the US and Germany; and the hazards lurking behind the dollar's recent sharp
fall.
Yesterday's surprise move may ease currency market tensions in the short
run, and will certainly restore his battered confidence. But he will have to
admit, if only to himself, that his main problems lie not with the G7 but -
still - with the EMS, on which the UK government has staked Britain's
economic future.
Measured against the terms of its prospectus, the EMS has performed
abysmally recently.
It was conceived in the summer of 1978 to create 'a zone of monetary
stability in Europe'. One of the main reasons for its creation was a desire
to protect Europe's economy from a weak dollar. The detailed negotiations
that preceded the launch of the EMS in March 1979 were specifically intended
to prevent it becoming a D-Mark zone. After the last big realignment of EMS
currencies in 1987, new rules - the so called Basle-Nyborg agreement - were
introduced to ensure that countries with virtuous economic policies (which
at the time meant Germany) were not penalised in periods when the system was
under strain in financial markets.
Inevitably some of these goals have been altered or fudged over time. In
particular, the worry about D-Mark dominance gave way to an acceptance that
the D-Mark, as the most stable of Europe's currencies, should be the
'anchor' of the system.
But now that the strains of German unification have been grafted on to the
EMS structure as it emerged from the Basle-Nyborg discussions, the EMS has
failed to deliver the promises in its prospectus.
The recent exchange market turbulence and pressure on interest rates shows
how it has been unable to act as a zone of monetary stability in Europe. It
has not protected Europe from dollar weakness. The dominance of the D-Mark
has been as strong as ever - a factor emphasised by last night's
developments. Yet because the D-Mark has been unable to provide the low
inflation standard that the system needs, countries with virtuous economic
performances such as France, Denmark and Ireland, have been penalised.
This latter phenomenon made the latest EMS crisis so different from previous
episodes of strain in the ERM and in its 1970s forerunner the European
currency 'snake'.
In the past countries have also been forced to devalue, push interest rates
to usurious levels and - in the case of the snake - quit the system.
Disruptive though these episodes were, it could always be argued that the
root causes of the problems lay with the countries in trouble. That was case
with Italy. Until last night, the only penalty paid by Germany, in spite of
its inflationary pressures, huge budget deficits and growing political and
social weakness, had been a substantial increase in its foreign currency
reserves through the forced purchase of Italian lire at the lower EMS
intervention point.
Admittedly, recent EMS problems are not wholly the fault of Europe's
monetary policymakers or the Bundesbank.
Financial markets have a lot to answer for. In a world where information
travels at the speed of light, understanding seems still to spread at the
speed of sail.
The D-Mark's strength takes account of past glories and the fact that it has
never been devalued, rather than Germany's problems now.
Ministers are likely to portray last night's developments as a huge
achievement.
But although the EMS now looks better placed to survive next Sunday's French
referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, it remains at risk.
Mr Lamont, as president of the EC finance ministers' council, could do worse
than order a thorough study of how it can be restored to a zone of monetary
stability.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Sweden's banks face a legacy from the 1980s: Sara Webb
analyses problems facing the centre-right government over the troubled
banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With two banks already rescued and a third in serious difficulties, the
Swedish government is now working to avoid the entire banking sector falling
under its control.
'We have reached a point where the whole banking system seems to have severe
problems. If we don't take precautions, we might end up with all the banks
being state-owned' says Mr Urban Backstrom, deputy to the Swedish minister
of taxation and financial markets.
For Sweden's centre-right government, committed to the privatisation of
state-controlled companies, the last thing it wants is to nationalise banks.
Yet two of Sweden's banks - Nordbanken (the second largest commercial bank)
and Forsta Sparbanken (one of the large savings banks)  - have had to be
rescued by the state. Now a third looks set to join the casualties.
Last week, the Swedish government was forced to pledge its support for Gota
Bank, the fourth largest commercial bank, after it emerged that credit
losses for 1992 are likely to reach SKr8bn (Pounds 782m), or double Gota's
previous forecast.
The Finance Ministry must now find a solution to Gota's problems, which will
not be made easier by last week's turbulence in the Nordic financial
markets. The Bank of Finland's decision to cut the markka's link to the Ecu
prompted a big outflow of capital from the region. Sweden's central bank
increased its marginal lending rate from 16 per cent to 24 per cent and then
to 75 per cent in an effort to reverse a currency outflow.
Swedish short-term interest rates shot up: if they remain high the effect on
the economy and the banks could be serious.
'The banks are being squeezed (by the high interest rates) and are taking a
blow' admitted Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the Riksbank, Sweden's central
bank, last week. Mr Lars Jagren, an economist at the Federation of Swedish
Industries, warned that if interest rates remain high, the consequences
would include weak demand for loans, an increase in the number of
bankruptcies, and a further fall in property prices - all of which would be
bad news for the banks.
On Friday, Moody's, the international credit rating agency, placed the
long-term debt ratings of Nordbanken, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (the
biggest Swedish bank), Svenska Handelsbanken (the third largest bank), and
Swedbank (the new savings bank group) under review for possible downgrade.
The banking sector's troubles can be traced back to the end of 1985 when
controls on bank lending were lifted. Mr Sten Westerberg, of financial
advisers Westerberg &amp; Co, points out that tax rules encouraging people to
borrow (by making interest payments tax deductible) were retained, as were
restrictions on investing abroad.
As a result, Swedes borrowed heavily and channelled the money into the
domestic stock and property markets. Property and share prices soared in the
second half of the 1980s.
Banks scrambled for new customers, and paid scant heed to analysing their
credit-worthiness.
Mr Sahlen believes there were important differences in behaviour between the
various banks. Before deregulation, Gota, Nordbanken and Forsta Sparbanken
had concentrated on the household sector. But once credit controls were
lifted, they concentrated on boosting their corporate business and chased
after new customers, particularly in the property sector.
Today, about 60 per cent of the banking sector's loans are related to
property. Mr Sahlen claims that these three banks have a proportionately
greater exposure to troubled property and have a higher proportion of
non-performing loans in relation to their total lending than the other
Swedish banks.
By contrast, Mr Sahlen says, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska
Handelsbanken both had a long tradition of lending to Swedish industry. Many
of their corporate customers belong to 'spheres' of interlinked customers,
which the banks know well. As a result neither of these banks was as
aggressive in the pursuit of new corporate business after deregulation.
The government has promised to meet all of Gota Bank's obligations to other
banks, corporate and individual customers. Over the next few weeks, Ministry
of Finance officials will discuss with Gota and its owner, the Trygg Hansa
insurance group, how best to save Gota.
The government is also drawing up a rescue plan for the banking system. 'The
banks are suffering from temporary large credit losses' says Mr Backstrom.
By the end of 1991, credit losses for the banking sector reached about
SKr45bn: Mr Backstrom warns that additional credit losses over the next few
years could amount to between SKr50bn and SKr90bn.
His department is studying ways of alleviating the burden, either by
providing insurance to the banks against credit losses or allowing the state
to take on the bad debts, provided the banks pay the state back later.
'We have to maintain the stability of the system' sighs Mr Backstrom. At the
end of the day, he admits, it is the taxpayers and customers who will foot
the bill for the banks' mistakes in the 1980s.

Big deals in restructuring industries dominated last week's international
merger and acquisition activity, writes Brian Bollen.
In banking, the news from Holland that Internationale Nederlanden Group
(ING) was prepared to launch a bid for Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) came
after months of arguments between BBL's institutional shareholders about
future alliances. ING will not, however, launch a formal bid until it has
had a close look at the books, and unless it can buy a 6.72 per cent stake
held by Italian investors and can win more than 51 per cent. The fact that
it will offer minority shareholders the same price as it plans to pay for
the Italian stake is being seen as an encouraging continuation of a fragile
trend towards the equal treatment of shareholders in continental Europe.
The restructuring of the international drinks industry continues with
Bercadi-based rum specialist Bacardi agreeing to buy a large stake in
Italy's Martini &amp; Rossi.
The foreign takeover of Spain's cement industry looks a step nearer after
Cimentos de Portugal won Spanish government approval to bid for Galicia's
Corporacion Noroeste.
Further proof that buy-outs can still be exited from successfully comes with
US toiletries group Gillette's purchase of Parker Pen. If profit-related
payments and the value of debt being assumed is included in the equation,
the deal is worth pounds340m, more than six times the value of the 1985
buyout.
Independent UK oil company LASMO completed the disposal of its US upstream
assets, while South Africa's Investec Bank gained a presence in the UK with
its purchase of Allied Trust Bank from Barclays.

<TEXT>
SABENA, Belgium's state-owned airline, is planning to cut a further 1,000
jobs on top of the 2,200 redundancies already planned as part of its
two-year restructuring programme.
Some 37.6 per cent of the airline is now owned by Air France, the French
state airline.
The European Commission announced last week that its merger control
authorities would examine the Air France deal over the next month.
If they still have 'serious doubts' about the effect of the deal on
competition in the EC after four weeks they could open an in-depth inquiry
lasting up to four months.
Sabena-Air France is only the second airline deal to be examined under the
EC's two-year-old merger regulation.
In the only other case - the sale of Pan Am's assets to Delta Air Lines -
the commission gave the go-ahead after the one-month preliminary
investigation.
Announcing a new frequent flyer programme recently, Mr Pierre Godfroid,
Sabena's chairman, said he expected the airline to break even by the end of
the year, despite the group's operating loss of BFr300m in the first half of
1992.

<TEXT>
MR DAVID Smith and Ms Elizabeth Hignell, the accounting duo who masterminded
the Isosceles bid for the Gateway grocery chain in 1989 but who were ousted
last September, have resurfaced in corporate life at Cannon Street
Investments, the struggling industrial holding company.
The two join Mr Robin Binks, Cannon Street's chief executive and former
merchant banker at SG Warburg, in trying to restore the loss-making
company's straitened balance sheet.
In doing so they return a favour to Mr Binks who played a pivotal role in
securing the finance for the Gateway acquisition while at Warburg.
Both Mr Smith and Ms Hignell can perhaps afford to chance their arm at the
troubled CSI. Isosceles, which announced its annual results last week,
revealed that it had paid the two former directors Pounds 1.9m for loss of
office.

FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Berkertex receivers sell Fifth Avenue to
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECEIVERS at Berkertex Group, the bridalwear manufacturer and retailer,
have moved quickly to secure the sale of one of its largest subsidiaries,
Fifth Avenue, a leading supplier to the fashion mail order catalogue trade.
Mr Paul Fabian and Mr Brian Worth, two of the company's managers, are
staging a buy-out preserving 31 jobs. This move is backed by 3i, the venture
capital group, and Barclays Bank.
The purchase price was not disclosed but it 'substantially exceeded the
company's break-up value', the receivers said.
Mr Christopher Morris, the receiver from Touche Ross, said Fifth Avenue was
profitable but had been dragged down by the collapse last Friday of its
heavily-indebted parent company. Last year Fifth Avenue's sales wereover
Pounds 13m and in the current year are running at more than Pounds 9m.
Receivers have been criticised recently for selling businesses to existing
managers before the assets recoverable for creditors can be fully assessed.
But Mr Morris defended a quick sale in this particular case. 'This was an
evaporating business. By Monday or Tuesday of next week there would have
been nothing left to sell.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Danish group to acquire Macfish
for about Pounds 18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOODMARK A/S, the Danish seafoods group, has agreed to pay more than Pounds
18m for Macfish, the Scottish fish processing venture jointly owned by Geest
and Associated Fisheries.
The sale follows Geest's decision in March to seek a buyer for its 50 per
cent stake in the company, based in Fraserburgh and Wearside. Associated
Fisheries announced a similar plan in April following Macfish's mounting
losses which last year exceeded Pounds 800,000 on a turnover of Pounds
46.5m.
The Danish group has agreed to pay Geest Pounds 9.2m and Associated
Fisheries Pounds 9.16m for the business, stock and fixed assets of the
frozen fish business.
Geest said funds raised by the sale would be reinvested in its core fresh
produce business, while Associated Fisheries said it planned to use the
money to reduce short-term borrowings and finance future investments.
Geest and Associated Fisheries expect the deal and a further sale of Pounds
2m of Macfish assets to cover the estimated value of their original
investments in the Scottish company.
Geest said yesterday that over-capacity in fish processing and inadequate
supplies of fish, which had pushed prices up and demand down, led to the
decision to sell.
Foodmark, like Macfish, is already a large own label supplier to groups
including Marks and Spencer.

FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Edinburgh to bid for building
society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Heart of England, the 25th largest building society with assets
of Pounds 1.1bn, may be offered a combination of cash and shares to endorse
the takeover of the society by the Bank of Edinburgh.
News of the proposed takeover, which involves Heart of England shedding
mutual status and becoming a division of Bank of Edinburgh, emerged at the
weekend after 15 months of negotiations.
The move is the first-ever takeover of a British building society from
outside the industry and will create a precedent for further takeovers. At
least three other societies are known to have been in talks with possible
purchasers.
Mr Mike Travis, Heart of England chief executive, said yesterday: 'We
believe the route we are taking will enable us to serve our members better
and give us more flexibility, particularly for raising capital and funding,
than staying mutual would do. We have considered mergers and flotations but
we are not big enough for that.'
He said that the society had received other informal approaches for
takeovers, but the board had judged that Bank of Edinburgh offered the best
opportunity.
The bank was set up two years ago with Pounds 26m in capital from investors
headed by a Scottish mutual life assurance group. Its aim is to take over
small or medium-sized building societies but to allow them to continue as
separate retail banking subsidiaries.
Heart of England fits neatly into this pattern. It has a network of 50
branches and a customer base of 250,000. Last year it made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 2.1m after bad debt provisions of Pounds 8.2m.
Mr Ken Murray, chief executive of Bank of Edinburgh, said that the takeover
would enable the society to offer its customers more services, including,
probably, a high interest cheque book current account.
He declined to comment on how Bank of Edinburgh proposes to overcome the
stiff voting requirements for a building society takeover laid down in the
1986 Building Societies Act.
Heart of England's 206,000 members will have to approve the deal at a
special general meeting at which at least half the society's members must
vote and three quarters of votes cast must be in favour.
'We are confident that we will get the approval of Heart of England
members,' said Mr Ken Murray, chief executive of Bank of Edinburgh
yesterday. He expected the vote to take place early in the new year.
News of the negotiations leaked out before Bank of Edinburgh had finalied
the terms it will offer Heart of England members, but Mr Murray said that
shares in the company could be offered as well as cash.
A cash distribution by the bank of even Pounds 150 to each member of the
society seems unlikely unless the bank's investors are willing to put up a
substantial amount of new money.

FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Japanese parent injects Pounds 65m of new
funds into Guinness Mahon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS MAHON, the merchant bank which is wholly owned by the Bank of
Yokohama, has received a new injection of Pounds 65m from its Japanese
parent as part of a restructuring of its operations.
Much of the money will support a new subsidiary called Guinness Mahon Loan
Recoveries, which will hold provisions against loan losses and a contingency
fund to cover future losses totalling nearly Pounds 50m.
Mr David Potter, chief executive of Guinness Mahon, yesterday denied that a
crisis had caused the new funding, which brings total injections by Bank of
Yokohama to nearly Pounds 200m since it first bought a stake in the company
in 1989.
He said that the money - which was approved at a quarterly board meeting
last Tuesday - was part of a financing package agreed 15 months ago and had
been conditional on the management meeting a series of targets to
restructure its operations.
'There is no crisis,' he said. 'This was part of a long and carefully
planned process and was nothing sudden.' He stressed that Guinness Mahon's
credit rating had been recently upgraded, and that new, high quality
executives had joined the company recently.
But he admitted that the provisions against bad loans - all of which were
the responsibility of Guinness Mahon &amp; Company, the merchant banking
subsidiary - had been increased in the past few months.
Guinness Mahon suffered from a series of poor loans in leasing, property and
general commercial areas made during the 1980s. Last year it lost its
listing on the Stock Exchange when Yokohama pushed up its shareholding to
100 per cent.
Its last publicly announced pre-tax losses were Pounds 35.5m in the six
months to March 31 1991, including bad debt provisions of Pounds 30m. Mr
Potter said that in the following nine months losses were about Pounds 20m.
Part of the new funding has been earmarked for future development,
particularly in the asset management and stockbroking businesses. A senior
executive also said that Guinness Mahon's contract with Mr Geoffrey Bell,
its chairman for the past four years, is unlikely to be renewed when it
expires early next year.

2 purchases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EIT, the USM-quoted information technology group formerly known as
Maxiprint, is to raise Pounds 1.9m via a rights issue and is acquiring
Second City Systems, one of the largest Apple computer dealers in the UK.
The rights issue is on a 2-for-5 basis underwritten at 17p. The proceeds
will be used to develop the company and reduce group borrowings.
Seven warrants will be issued for every 10 rights shares taken up.
Each warrant will carry the right to subscribe for one new ordinary share at
17p, exercisable between January 1 1993 and December 31 1993. Full
subscription would raise an additional Pounds 1.5m.
Second City is to be acquired for a maximum of Pounds 650,000, satisfied by
the issue of new EIT ordinary shares.
Of the total consider-ation Pounds 400,000 will be paid on completion, with
the balance - up to a maximum of Pounds 250,000 - dependent upon profits for
the year to April 30 1993.
EIT has also reached agreement in principle to acquire, for no initial cost,
the UK maintenance and support contracts of Sequence Support Systems
International, a US supplier of network and support systems.
In addition, the group proposes to sell its 70 per cent interest in
Decisionaire Systems to its management for Pounds 200,000 cash.

FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TVS shows interest in TV arm of Carlton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS Entertainment has expressed an interest in Zenith, the independent
television production company controlled by Carlton Communications.
TVS, which lost its south of England franchise in last year's competitive
tenders, is in the midst of deciding what its role should be when its
franchise runs out in December. One option is to buy a number of stakes in
production and facilities companies, another is to sell all its assets.
Ironically the 1990 Broadcasting Act which brought TVS to its knees is also
the reason why a large stake in Zenith is up for sale.
Under the Act, broadcasters can own no more than 15 per cent of an
independent production company if it is to retain its independent status.
The status is commercially important because all of Britain's broadcasters
have to commission at least 25 per cent of their output from independent
producers.

candidates win support
</HEADLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARTIES opposed to military interference in Thai politics appeared to have
won a slim parliamentary majority in yesterday's general election in
Thailand, four months after troops killed at least 50 pro-democracy
demonstrators in Bangkok.
With most of the votes counted, Mr Chuan Leekpai, leader of the Democrat
Party, was preparing an attempt to form a coalition government. His party
won about 80 seats, the largest bloc in the 360-seat House of
Representatives.
With the support of three other members of a loose pro-democracy alliance  -
the New Aspiration Party, Palang Dharma (Moral Force) and Solidarity  - Mr
Chuan is expected to form a government with at least 185 seats.
One or more of the other parties may be co-opted to strengthen the
coalition, but Mr Chuan has promised to exclude politicians accused of
corruption from his cabinet.
Businessmen and parliamentary colleagues regard 54-year-old Mr Chuan as a
responsible if uninspiring politician.
He has won his seat in the Democrat stronghold of Trang in south Thailand
nine times in a row, and has served in various governments as minister of
agriculture, education, commerce, justice and health.
Mr Chuan, who heads Thailand's oldest party, won widespread support in the
election because he opposed the military during the demonstrations in May
but attempted to resolve the conflict in parliament rather than on the
streets.
Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist known as Mr Clean who heads Palang
Dharma and led the street protests, lost support to the Democrats in his
Bangkok stronghold but made gains elsewhere.
Politicians sympathetic to the military did well in rural areas, and Chart
Thai (Thai Nation) won about 72 seats, the second highest number, followed
by about 60 for the Chart Pattana (National Development) party of the former
prime minister, Mr Chatichai Choonhavan.
In spite of the strong showing of the pro-democracy parties yesterday, the
campaign was marred by the widespread corruption and violence which have
long been a feature of Thai elections.
At least seven canvassers were shot dead by political rivals on the eve of
the poll, and wealthy politicians paid out what Pollwatch, the independent
monitoring agency, described as 'a huge sum of money' to buy votes in the
poorer rural areas.
Thai politics have been shaken up since a group of pro-military parties won
the previous election in March this year.
Thousands of demonstrators, many of them middle-class professionals, took to
the streets of Bangkok in May to protest against the military.

FT  14 SEP 92 / 'Debt crisis has not gone away'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and governments may be getting the upper hand over the third world
debt crisis but it has not gone away and poor countries will have to fight
to win more funds in coming years, the OECD said today, Reuter reports from
Paris.
'The debt problem has certainly not been resolved nor has it at all gone
away in any global sense,' the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) said in its annual aid report.
The Paris-based think-tank for the world's richest countries noted that
while the crisis had eased in Latin America, where most of the main debtors
are, problems for sub-Saharan Africa had worsened.
Since government lenders were now looking much more closely at issues such
as human rights and democracy when deciding which developing countries to
help, political reforms must continue. These countries will need to
persevere with economic liberalisation to attract private finance, since a
big increase in official aid is unlikely soon.
The OECD praised creditors for reaching landmark deals with some debtors.
'There have been clear improvements in a number of countries, which are now
implementing better economic and structural adjustment policies, assisted by
debt agreements. Nevertheless, the situation remains critical for many
others.'
The OECD applauded the debt deals reached with commercial banks by several
Latin American countries  - including Mexico, which set off the debt crisis
a decade ago  - saying these had played a part in turning round their
economies.
The Paris Club of government creditors has helped to bring a solution to the
debt problem closer, particularly with its
new policy of offering a deal on a country's total debt stock  - in effect,
a promise to write off at least half of its debt  - if economic adjustment
plans are adhered to.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Warning on Bosnia peace strategy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Nations and European Community officials will this week start
implementing a three-pronged strategy aimed at ending the war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, officials in Belgrade said at the weekend, write Judy
Dempsey in Belgrade and Lionel Barber in Hatfield.
But they warned that the process will be slow. The strategy involves linking
political talks at the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia, with a
massive humanitarian aid operation in Bosnia, and an extended monitoring
mission to stem fighting.
It follows discussions over the past few days between Mr Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, joint chairmen of the Geneva conference, and Croatian, Bosnian
and Serbian leaders. The EC yesterday expressed guarded optimism about the
peace efforts and agreed to refrain from introducing tougher diplomatic and
economic sanctions.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said at a meeting of Community
foreign ministers in Hatfield in the UK that the EC and UN would continue to
press the warring parties to place their heavy weapons under international
control and close down detention camps in Bosnia in compliance with the
London peace conference accords.
Accordingly, Mr John Major, British premier, is to write to the presidents
of Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia reminding them of their obligations.
Ministers agreed to support a US proposal to impose a a 'no fly' zone over
Bosnia-Hercegovina and said Serbia should be denied the former Yugoslavia's
seat at the UN. The proposed ban would not be imposed in the air, as in
Iraq, but by stationing observers at airports.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Pollsters fall silent as French vote nears: Referendum on
Maastricht Treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S referendum on European monetary and political union next Sunday is
expected to remain a cliffhanger, although the events yesterday involving
realignment of European currencies are thought likely to help the Yes vote,
writes William Dawkins in Paris.
Public opinion polls closed last Saturday at midnight, as they must do seven
days before an election under French law, showing that the Yes camp has a
slim majority, but that it has lost ground over the past week.
The average of the five last polls before Saturday midnight gave a narrow
52.4 per cent in favour of the treaty  - of those who have made up their
minds  - down from 54.2 per cent shown by a similar average the previous
week, according to Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers
in London.
Among the final batch, an extremely detailed BVA poll for the Liberation
newspaper, gave a 50-50 split between those who have made up their minds.
Paradoxically it indicated at the same time that 60 per cent of the
electorate supported monetary union and 62 per cent supported external
security co-operation, the main points in the treaty. Some 42 per cent said
they saw the referendum as a chance to vote against the government. All this
confirms the impression that French voting intentions are still clouded by
domestic politics.
'The Yes campaigners are failing to give people strong personal reasons for
voting for the treaty and have instead warned them of catastrophe if they
vote against. The electorate could be getting tired of this message. The No
campaign, by contrast, has focused on the specific personal worries inciting
people to vote against,' said Mr Mercier.
Better news for the Yes campaign came from a Sofres poll for TF1 on
Saturday, which gave 52 per cent in favour of Maastricht and said that 73
per cent of those interviewed thought that the pro-treaty camp would win.
According to Ifop, for Journal du Dimanche, the Yes camp had 53 per cent,
two-and-a-half points up on an Ifop poll five days previously.
Even the polling organisations agree that their results cannot be taken at
face value. President Francois Mitterrand will be more familiar with the
vagaries of polls than most; the pollsters did not foresee his 1981
presidential victory until the last minute.
The small size of pollsters' samples, usually around 1,000 people, means
that there is a margin of error of several percentage points when
extrapolating the result to a national referendum. To complicate the outlook
further, up to 29 per cent of the electorate does not know how it will vote.
For another thing, French opinion polls are notoriously volatile. The French
are so intensively quizzed on political matters  - the Journal de Dimanche
has a political poll nearly every week  - that there is a temptation for
people being polled to use the occasion to toy with opinions rather than
express real views.

THE International Monetary Fund is expected to approve standby agreements

to Dollars 120m (Pounds 60.9m) between them from the Fund.
Estonia and Latvia will be the first republics of the former Soviet Union to

a country meet its balance of payments shortfalls in return for agreement on
an economic recovery programme. Russia has negotiated a preliminary
agreement allowing it to draw on a first credit tranche of Dollars 1bn.
Senior IMF officials said the Fund was in the process of finalising a
similar standby agreement with Lithuania. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are
expected to complete arrangements soon. Belarus is also making progress in
talks.
The Baltic states' standby agreements are expected to allow them to draw up
to 90 per cent of IMF quotas.

<TEXT>
MR Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday issued a plea for
help in dealing with the refugee crisis, warning that Germany's political
stability was threatened by the flood of asylum-seekers from Yugoslavia and
eastern Europe, writes Lionel Barber.
Mr Kinkel said Germany was shouldering a disproportionate burden. Although
he avoided calling for quotas on refugees, the German foreign minister urged
greater understanding from EC countries.
Amid continuing riots in the former east Germany and attacks on refugee
hostels, Mr Kinkel said Germany had so far taken in more than 220,000 asylum
seekers from Bosnia  - more than any other country apart from neighbouring
Croatia. Millions more potential economic refugees were sitting on their
suitcases in eastern Europe, he said.
EC foreign ministers, meeting in Hatfield, expressed sympathy, but avoided a
commitment to spread the load by relaxing their own immigration controls.
Instead, they agreed to speed up Community efforts to reach a common
approach  - required because of the difference in laws.
EC justice and interior ministers are to meet in Brussels this week for
talks on immigration.
Ian Rodger adds from Vienna: The city of Vienna, fearing civil unrest
similar to that in Germany and facing a shortage of accommodation suitable
for the winter, has closed the doors of its publicly supported refugee
hostels to new Bosnian refugees. Other Austrian lander are expected to

Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's democratic socialist mayor, said that the city's
'emotional capacity' to absorb refugees had been exhausted.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Hungarian investors think again: Nicholas Denton on the
effect of economic changes on company plans - The European Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trail-blazing western companies which started to invest in Hungary at
the end of the 1980s are beginning to ponder what they should have done
differently.
Should they have committed less money? Less precipitately? In a different
location? Or not invested at all?
Investment decisions made two, three or even four years ago, when Hungary
became the first east European country to open up to western companies, are
now coming to fruition. But the economic climate has changed dramatically.
Multinationals led by such US companies as General Electric, General Motors,
Guardian Glass and Ford are finding that many earlier assumptions no longer
hold good.
No one anticipated the sharpness and duration of the fall in Hungarian
domestic demand, or realised the protected domestic market would be so
quickly liberalised.
Nor did anyone predict that east European trading links would disintegrate
so rapidly, and that exports to the west would come under pressure from
rising local costs and the relative strength of the forint, the Hungarian
currency.
Take the car manufacturers. GM, Ford and Japan's Suzuki Motor established a
presence in Hungary on the understanding that their investments would earn
the country hard currency and so win access to the protected local market.
General Motors, for instance, combined production of both cars and
components at its green-field DM400m (Pounds 143.3m) plant in Szentgotthard
which opened this year.
It hoped exports of car engines produced there would meet the foreign
exchange costs of imports of kits for local assembly of Astra models for the
Hungarian market.
But then the Hungarian government moved unexpectedly quickly to liberalise
car imports. GM Hungary has a one-shift capacity to produce a paltry 15,000
cars a year at Szentgotthard. But managers admit it would be much more
efficient to make the cars at larger western plants and import them into
Hungary.
Moreover, as a result of the Hungarian recession and import competition,
only about 7,000 Astras are likely to be sold in Hungary this year. GM is in
the awkward position of importing kits and assembling them in Hungary at
high cost, only to re-export the completed cars back to western Europe.
Depressed demand  - both in Hungary and in the rest of central and eastern
Europe  - is also posing problems for Guardian Glass, the privately-owned US
glass maker.
Guardian, one of the first large investors in eastern Europe, agreed a
Dollars 120m (Pounds 61m) joint venture in Oroshaza in the south-east of
Hungary. The decision was motivated by the promise of a large east European
market for float glass, together with the cheapness of energy imports from
the Soviet Union.
But energy prices, a large component of costs, have risen to world market
levels and east European countries cannot afford to pay hard currency for
glass.
Guardian is managing to sell only 25 per cent of its output in eastern
Europe, half what it planned, and has to export to west European countries.
Transport from Hungary costs more than for deliveries from Guardian's
Luxembourg plant, outweighing Oroshaza's advantage of lower labour costs.
'If the company knew that all this would happen, Guardian would still invest
 - I think  - in Hungary; but not necessarily in this part of Hungary,' says
Mr Gabriel Pataky, finance director of Guardian in Hungary. Mindful of the
difficulty of transporting bulky glass from the south-east of Hungary to
western Europe, he concludes: 'It would have been a green-field site
somewhere further west.'
The worldwide economic slowdown has dashed expectations. Ford's components
facility at Szekesfehervar, which exports all its output, has suffered from
the decline in the west European car market. With hindsight, the company
says it would have curbed its Dollars 83m initial investment.
The recession also adds to pressure from another direction. With global
earnings faltering, multinationals' shareholders want Hungarian operations
to contribute.
Most western companies, however, maintain confidence.
The quality of the local workforce has been better than expected, and
investors retain what Mr David Fuller, managing partner of Price Waterhouse
Budapest, a branch of the international accountants, calls an 'inner belief'
that Hungary will develop into a valuable new market place. A golden future,
however, is further down the trail than they first thought.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Shake-up alters shape of politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAST night's realignment involves a devaluation of only one currency in the
European Monetary System (EMS). But the adjustment may turn out to have a
more substantial impact than any of the 12 previous shake-ups since the EMS
started in 1979.
The realignment seems likely to bring a seismic shift in Europe's political
and economic landscape only six days away from the French referendum on
Maastricht.
The chances of a Yes vote in France next Sunday seem likely to be improved
if, as is likely, the Bank of France cuts interest rates after this
morning's expected Bundesbank reduction.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the Bundesbank's desire
to cut rates 'shows real solidarity by Germany towards its European partners
and opens the way to a relaxation of interest rates in Europe, which is
necessary to support growth and unemployment'.
Additionally, by taking action to deal with the over-valuation of the lira,
EC finance ministers have, for the moment at least, defused the most
important source of instability in the EMS.
Currency market jitters will not come to an end as long as the world economy
remains stuck in a slow growth phase, and doubts are maintained over the
eventual fate of the Maastricht treaty. But Europe's exchange rate
stabilisation scheme seems likely to have won sufficient breathing space to
enable it to live to fight another day.
The German government last night stressed that the realignment and expected
Bundesbank credit easing back up Bonn's overall 'European policies'.
In Paris, observers said they believed the move could allay public fears,
expressed in opinion polls, of a German economic domination of Europe.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who was closely involved in
realignment telephone conversations, may have some explaining to do over the
apparent U-turn in the central bank's monetary policies.
In an unprecedented fashion, the Bundesbank has bargained away a cut in its
interest rates in return for the goal  - an EMS realignment  - it has
desired to see for at least two years.
Three factors seem to explain the Bundesbank's volte face.
First, Mr Schlesinger probably believes that the inflationary risks of large
inflows of speculative currency  - which should now cease  - are at least as
large as those of an interest rate cut. Second, the Bundesbank itself has
been concerned by growing signs of domestic recession.
Third, when put under pressure from the Bonn government  - which has been
unhappy for some time over the bank's tight policies  - the Bundesbank does
have a track record of reacting with great pragmatism.
The Bundesbank's reputation for independence is well known. But its last
reduction in discount rate  - a  1/2 point cut to 2 1/2 per cent on December
3 1987  - came after a telephone plea for action by Chancellor Helmut Kohl
to Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the then president. The Bundesbank knows how to stand
firm  - but it also has an instinct for the occasional need, when faced with
overwhelming odds, to make a tactical retreat.

Extracts from the EC Monetary Committee communique:
'On the joint request of the German and Italian authorities, the ministers
and central bank governors of the member states of (the) European Community
have by mutual agreement and after consultation of the Monetary Committee
decided to fix new central rates in the EMS .....
'This decision will contribute substantially to the proper functioning of
the EMS.
'The Italian government, recognising that the fundamental condition for
stable exchange rates, low interest rates and stable prices is sound public
finance, is aware of the importance of a full and quick implementation of
the convergence programme. The Italian government, with the 1993 budget, and
with other structural measures, especially in the areas of pensions, public
health, and public sector wages, will substantially curb the public deficit
and reduce inflation.'
Statement by Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer:
'I particularly welcome the intention of the Bundesbank Council to cut its
official interest rates in order to reduce strains within the ERM. This
demonstrates the benefits of continuing close co-operation amongst Community
countries. The UK government has repeatedly made clear that there is no
question of any change in the central parity of the pound against the
deutschmark, and that we will take whatever action is necessary to secure
that. Sterling's central rate therefore remains at DM2.95.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / Kinkel issues urgent plea for help on refugee crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday issued an urgent
plea for help in dealing with the refugee crisis, warning that Germany's
political stability was at risk because of the flood of asylum-seekers from
Yugoslavia and eastern Europe, writes Lionel Barber.
Mr Kinkel said Germany was shouldering a disproportionate burden. Although
he avoided calling for quotas on refugees, the German foreign minister urged
greater understanding from EC countries. 'This is the principal problem for
Germany,' he said.
Amid continuing riots in the former east Germany and attacks on refugee
hostels, Mr Kinkel said Germany had so far taken in more than 220,000 asylum
seekers from Bosnia  - more than any other country apart from neighbouring
Croatia. Millions more potential economic refugees were sitting on their
suitcases in eastern Europe, he said.
EC foreign ministers expressed sympathy, but avoided a commitment to spread
the load by relaxing their own immigration controls. Instead, they agreed to
speed up Community efforts to reach a common approach  - required because of
the difference in laws. Germany's asylum laws are the most liberal in
western Europe.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, reminded ministers that Britain
had faced an immigration crisis in the 1960s, as a result of the influx of
Asian and other members of Commonwealth countries.
This had led to the rise of the National Front and 'very considerable
agitation and commotion'. Britain had subsequently dealt with the problem,
'and we do not wish it to return', he said at the end of the weekend meeting
in Hatfield, Hertfordshire.
The EC is taking a two-track approach to the immigration problem, starting
with an emergency humanitarian effort in the new Yugoslavia aimed at
assuring food supplies and helping the refugees to stay as close to their
homes as possible. Improving the refugee camps in Bosnia and Croatia as the
winter approaches is vital, said one EC official.
The second aim is to identify the scope of the problem which ranges from the
threat of mass immigration from economically-depressed eastern Europe to the
migration pressures from North Africa.
Another concern is the impending impact of the single European market which
will provide for free movement of EC citizens from the end of the year.
This week, EC justice and interior ministers are to meet in Brussels for
talks on immigration. With racist pressures building up in France and
Germany, due to the increase in refugees, ministers agreed that immigration
is becoming one of the most pressing issues facing the Community.
Ministers agreed to improve the humanitarian aid effort to Somalia, which Mr
Hurd described as a 'unique tragedy' caused by famine and the complete
breakdown of law and order. Some 185,000 tonnes of food are being
dispatched, as well as some Ecu50m (Pounds 36.4m) of non-food aid.
The European Commission is to send observers to Somalia to improve aid
co-ordination. Mr Hurd is to hold talks with Mr Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, to work out plans for a political solution in the North
African state.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Vienna closes its hostels to Bosnians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE city of Vienna, fearing civil unrest similar to that in Germany and
facing a shortage of accommodation suitable for the winter, has closed the
doors of its refugee hostels to new Bosnian refugees.
Other Austrian lander are expected to follow the city's lead.
Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's democratic socialist mayor, said that the city's
'emotional capacity' to absorb refugees had been exhausted. The estimated
15,000 Bosnian refugees in the city have added to a pool of roughly 300,000
first generation immigrants among a total population of 1.5m. Bosnian
refugees have been arriving at the rate of 100 to 150 a day in recent weeks.
The ban applies only to publicly supported hostels. Buses arriving from
Bosnia will still be allowed into Austria. Provided they can find shelter
through private friends or the charitable agencies, refugees can still enter
Vienna.
Mr Zilk said the ban was only temporary and there was speculation at the
weekend that it could be lifted within a few weeks, especially if the
Croatian government took up Vienna's offer to underwrite the costs of
housing up to 1,000 Bosnian refugees in empty hotels on the Istrian
peninsula. Mr Franz Loschnak, the Austrian interior minister, said it was
scandalous that the Croatian government had not yet replied to Vienna's
offer.
Mr Zilk said Austrian authorities had been shaken by the anti-immigrant
riots in Germany, and wanted to prevent similar outbreaks of xenophobia or
disturbances in the hostels. Last week, two Bosnians were arrested for
trying to recruit men in Vienna refugee camps to go back home to fight. This
infringed Austria's neutrality.
The authorities are also acutely aware of the risk of instability in other
eastern European countries, and the consequent potential for more large
flows of refugees into Vienna in coming years.
The Green party, one of the main opposition forces in the Vienna assembly,
was sharply critical. 'This is the peak of inhumanity,' a spokesman said. He
claimed there were plenty of buildings suitable for winter habitation in the
city, including military barracks. He feared that other western European
cities and countries would follow Vienna's lead.

<TEXT>
MR Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has said the
government's commitment to its new economic adjustment programme will not be
weakened, however fierce the opposition from the trade unions, writes Kerin
Hope from Athens.
Mr Mitsotakis told businessmen attending a conference in Salonica at the
weekend: 'We're not going to abandon the battle for a healthy, modern
economy. There can be no going back.'
Earlier, electricity, bank and transport workers announced they would
continue a strike protesting against reform of the state pension system, now
in its third week.
Mr Mitsotakis said that efforts to trim the public sector deficit would
start yielding results this year, with government borrowing reduced to 10
per cent of gross domestic product, and a budget surplus of Dr200bn (Pounds
573m).
He predicted that inflation, currently 15.1 per cent, would drop below 10
per cent next year, enabling the drachma to join the exchange rate mechanism
of the EMS within 1993. Greece is the only EC member still outside the ERM.
Growth this year would be around 1.5 per cent, he said.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST French voters believe neo-Nazis are gaining ground in Germany but only
a minority fear their newly-unified neighbour, according to an opinion poll
published yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
German ZDF television said it ordered the poll from the French opinion
institute, BVA, to find out how far fear of Germany might influence next
Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union.
ZDF said that when asked if they believed neo-Nazis were on the rise in
Germany in view of rightist attacks on foreign asylum-seekers, 59 per cent
of respondents said Yes and 35.5 per cent said No.
But nearly 60 per cent said they had little or no fear of Germany and 51 per
cent saw Germans as partners. Only 2.2 per cent saw Germans as enemies.
The 1,500 French voters were polled last Thursday and Friday, a week after
Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared on a French television show to reassure
France of Germany's good intentions in the run-up to the referendum.
Meanwhile in Lyons, unidentified attackers knocked over a dozen tombstones
and wrote pro-Nazi graffiti at a Jewish cemetery in the city yesterday,
eyewitnesses said.
The desecration at the cemetery followed an attack two weeks ago on a Jewish
cemetery at Herrlisheim in Alsace, where about 200 tombstones were broken.
Incidents of vandalism against Jewish and Christian cemeteries, usually by
gangs of youths, take place every year in France.
Lyon dissident Gaullist mayor Michel Noir and about 2,000 people later
gathered at the cemetery with leaders of the city's Jewish community for a
protest meeting.
Mr Noir, an outspoken opponent of extreme right-wing leader Mr Jean-Marie Le
Pen, is the son of a non-Jewish resistance fighter who was sent to a
concentration camp.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Turkish coalition challenged from left
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish government's decision to lift the ban on political parties
outlawed after the 1980 military coup has thrown up the first serious
challenge to Mr Suleyman Demirel's parliamentary majority, with the revival
of the centre-left Republican People's party (CHP).
Turkey's conservative-led coalition had long hoped the CHP would be quietly
absorbed by the former CHP prime minister Bulent Ecevit and his Democratic
Left, arguably the real inheritor of what is the country's oldest political
party. But the election last Wednesday of the maverick social democrat Mr
Deniz Baykal as CHP leader raises the prospect that up to 20 Social
Democratic Populist (SHP) deputies, now members of the coalition, may leave
to form a new party as a first step to joining the CHP.
Such a move would reduce the coalition's majority to just two seats, a fact
Mr Baykal, a skilful politician, will exploit. Mr Baykal says he will not
seek to bring down the coalition. However, his group could wield
considerable influence over a conservative-led government, which hitherto
has shared few of the CHP's old-fashioned leftist ideals.
Mr Baykal, a 54-year-old lawyer, has three times unsuccessfully challenged
the deputy prime minister, Mr Erdal Inonu, for leadership of the SHP. His
parliamentary group is known to be critical of government policy on a number
of issues, including the Kurds, where Mr Baykal favours lifting the
emergency rule in Turkey's south-east. He is also opposed on nationalist
grounds to extension of the allied air operation over north Iraq to protect
the Kurds.
Over the weekend, party officials said Mr Baykal already had support from
four deputies who represented the CHP before the coup. Mr Baykal can also
expect backing from 16 of the SHP's 70 parliamentary deputies, reducing the
coalition to 228 seats in the 450-seat parliament.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Martial music sets scene for No vote rally: Nationalist
sentiment and Gaullist values are swelling the anti-Maastricht camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A futuristic structure on the edge of a Paris science theme park,
resembling a huge indoor tennis court, giant TV screens carrying
anti-Maastricht slogans, a 6,000-strong rattle-waving audience and
stereophonic martial music set the scene for a three-hour demagogic
spectacular in France's European union referendum battle.
It was the first time since the beginning of the campaign that the three
musketeers of the rejectionist camp  - Philippe Seguin, the neo-Gaullist
intellectual, Charles Pasqua the Gaullist traditionalist and former interior
minister and Philippe de Villiers, a dynamic young centrist member of
parliament  - had shared a platform together. A roar welcomed them as the
search-lights picked them up.
To dispel the impression that all the support was coming from the regimented
faithful, bussed-in from around Paris and the provinces, if not the French
overseas territories, a cohort of ageing former political dignitaries were
massed in serried ranks behind the speaker's pulpit.
That some were still alive would have been sufficient reason for the acclaim
they received. They included Mr Maurice Couve de Murville, General de
Gaulle's veteran foreign minister and short-lived prime minister, Mr Michel
Poniatowski, former President Giscard d'Estaing's unpopular interior
minister and, of course, Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the incarnation of his
father's combat for French national independence and sovereignty.
It came as no surprise that all the speakers should extol these typically
Gaullist values as being radically opposed to centralised government from
Brussels by faceless international technocrats, who could only see their
powers enhanced by the Maastricht treaty. 'What stopped Hitler?' Mr de
Villiers asked. 'The British nation and the French nation embodied in the
Resistance. Every time an attempt is made to suppress the nation, it
provokes a popular revolution.'
In spite of the vociferous xenophobic reactions of the militants in the
hall, the speakers did their best to distinguish opposition to the
Maastricht treaty from opposition to the European Community. 'We love France
and we want to construct Europe,' Mr Pasqua said. 'But we feel strongly
that, with the Maastricht treaty, we have to choose one or the other. It is
no longer a question of pooling or associating our efforts. What we are
being asked to do is to merge and to integrate, that is to water down and
divide our national contributions.'
In spite of some sarcastic references to Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, for allegedly urging the French people to vote 'yes' to Maastricht
while himself refusing to commit Britain to economic and monetary union, the
British government's attitude to European co-operation was held up as an
example to be followed. Mr Major, Mr Pasqua maintained confidently, would be
ready to sign a new treaty. 'We have to admit that a treaty of Oxford or
Cambridge, without any technocratic elements but with a greater democratic
content and providing for an opening to eastern Europe, would be a different
matter altogether and might be something in which we could believe.'
Mr Seguin, for his part, extolled the virtues of a
common, as distinct from a single currency, co-existing with national
currencies, on the lines proposed by Mr Major and Mr Edouard Balladur, the
former French finance minister.
However, the organisers of the meeting could not hide the fact that their
objective was by no means confined to sinking the Maastricht treaty  - 'this
indigestible pudding', in the words of Mr Pasqua. Constant chants by the
militants of 'Mitterrand, fous le camp]' ('Mitterrand, get out') were a
clear indication of the difficulty that voters have in separating European
and domestic political issues in this referendum.
'Our opposition to the treaty and our opposition to the socialist government
springs from the same principles,' Mr Seguin said with frankness. 'Moreover,
we are not naive. We know only too well how much a victory of the Yes vote
would profit Mr Mitterrand. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty would
be above all his victory. In the eyes of history, it would erase all the
errors of the past. That is for us another major reason to vote No.'
For many French people, it has become increasingly clear, that will be the
principal reason for their negative vote.

FT  14 SEP 92 / A weekend of telephone calls across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MASSIVE and futile intervention by the Bank of Italy and the German
Bundesbank last Friday to support the lira triggered the surprise weekend
devaluation of the Italian currency.
After the lira had twice fallen below its D-Mark floor of L765.4 in the
exchange rate mechanism on Friday, it had become clear to the Bundesbank's
currency traders in Frankfurt that the Italian currency would not lift off
the bottom of the ERM in spite of extremely heavy buying by the German
central bank.
Their reports to the Bundesbank directorate came after weeks of mounting
tension in the ERM. There followed a weekend of intensive phone calls across
Europe that culminated in the first significant change in the ERM for more
than five years.
The intervention was a new headache for Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank's president. Only a week before, at a press conference after a
meeting of European Community finance ministers in Bath, he had indicated
that the scale of intervention to contain strains in the ERM was not yet
posing serious problems for the Bundesbank. By last Friday, German buying of
the lira had become so great as to threaten further increases in Germany's
already swollen money supply.
Mr Schlesinger's reaction on Friday was to discuss the problem with Mr Carlo
Ciampi, the Italian central bank governor, who was experiencing a
haemorrhaging of Italy's foreign currency reserves. At about the same time,
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Horst Kohler, the state
secretary in the finance ministry, became involved in consultations.
German officials said there had been a growing feeling from Thursday onwards
that a realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism would be needed
to deal with a 'very considerable' flow of funds from the Italian lira to
the D-Mark. Probably by Friday evening, and certainly by Saturday morning,
Germany was proposing a realignment of the Italian lira and German interest
rate cuts.
The Bundesbank was also motivated to act in expectation that the government
in Bonn and both sides of industry would take more effective measures to
curb inflationary pressures in Germany.
During Saturday morning Mr Schlesinger also contacted the Bundesbank's
regional central bank presidents to prepare them for a special meeting of
the Bundesbank's central council today at 9am Frankfurt time. Mr Schlesinger
wants the council to discuss cuts in Germany's discount and Lombard rates
from 8.75 and 9.75 per cent respectively.
By Saturday afternoon, the apparatus of the European Community was involved
in the plan through Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, director of the French Treasury,
who also chairs the EC's monetary committee. It was around this time that
the UK Treasury was informed of the plan. Sir Nigel Wicks, the Treasury's
second permanent secretary for international monetary affairs and a member
of the monetary committee, passed news of the planned 'double whammy' to Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Over the weekend, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton and Mr Eddie George, Bank of
England governor and deputy governor, were brought into discussions.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, met his economic ministers on
Sunday. He said he had been in touch with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the
governors of the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy as well as the German
finance minister and treasury minister to co-ordinate the operation.
Yesterday evening, the move was announced in a communique from the monetary
committee.

FT  14 SEP 92 / UK fund managers confident of Yes vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK INSTITUTIONAL fund managers overwhelmingly believe the French will vote
Yes in the referendum on the Maastricht treaty, according to a survey
carried out last week for Smith New Court, the stockbroker.
Almost two-thirds of the managers did not expect sterling to be devalued
within the European exchange rate mechanism if the French rejected the
treaty.
The survey confirmed that the Italian lira was the most vulnerable currency
in the ERM before yesterday's 7 per cent devaluation; 81 per cent of the
fund managers believed a French No vote would have led to downwards
realignment of the lira.
Most also believed Germany's internationally important Lombard rate would
start to fall soon from near-record levels of 9.75 per cent soon.
With French opinion polls indicating that the vote is more finely balanced
than institutional investors believe, the survey suggests UK equity markets
could be in for a sharp shock if the treaty is rejected.
The survey by Gallup covered 99 fund managers who together handle Pounds
531bn of investments.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Management: Bringing oil to troubled waters - Foreign
companies working in the former Soviet republics are taking on bureaucracy,
cultural differences and hyper-inflation in their search for quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When British Petroleum, the UK oil group, awarded a contract for four steel
oil platform piles in the UK North Sea to a construction yard south of the
Azerbaijani capital Baku, it met an unexpected problem. The yard had never
before tendered for a contract and had no idea how much it should charge for
the work.
'In the end we had to suggest a fair figure to them,' a BP official explains
delicately.
Not only the managers but welders at the ShelfProyektStroi (SPS) yard were
also initially bemused by western working methods.
'They joked we were even more bureaucratic than the Soviets,' says Peter
Wells, Caspian region manager for BP Exploration. 'They couldn't understand
why every piece of work they did had to be checked and given a certificate.'
A team of seven supervisors from BP, John Brown Engineering and RGC Offshore
lived in Baku for several months. Workers were given special training and
had to pass a proficiency test before they were allowed to participate in
the project. Managers, meanwhile, were taught quality control techniques and
received individual instruction on what their role should be. The experiment
paid off, with the finished piles being passed for use in any international
oil project.
'By the end they were asking us when we would be coming back with more
work,' says Wells.
BP may be back before long. Last week, together with joint venture partner
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, it signed an agreement with
Azerbaijan that could lead to the Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 760m) development of
the giant Chirag field in the Caspian Sea.
The deal, like Azerbaijan's previous deal with Amoco, and recent agreements
by Chevron and British Gas-Agip with Kazakhstan, is significant. It shows
that despite the well-publicised risks and problems, oil companies are
mastering the art of doing deals with former Soviet republics.
Moreover, the smaller republics have proved rather more fleet of foot than
the lumbering Russian bear when it comes to attracting Big Oil - with
important implications for their economic recovery.
BP-Statoil's deal was, none the less, an uphill struggle. The alliance kept
at least one person in Baku for most of the last two years, with frequent
visits by teams of negotiators who ran up against a variety of problems.
Some of those - poor communications and sometimes difficult working
conditions - do not unduly trouble managers who have worked in countries
such as Colombia, Nigeria and Vietnam.
Others were more peculiar to the former Soviet Union. One was the deep lack
of understanding of western business among everyone from government
officials downwards.
'You often have to sit down with people and spend a lot of time explaining
very patiently the most basic concepts, like risk-reward, profit and loss,
things that we take for granted,' says Wells.
Another problem was suspicion and resentment in some quarters. Workers at
the SPS yard were more open to western ways than their bosses. Government
officials, meanwhile, were more eager to deal with BP than the local
producing associations, Azerineft and Kaspmorneftegaz, whose top officials -
many of them comfortably ensconced in their posts since pre-Perestroika days
 -reportedly did not take too kindly to western companies invading their
patch.
Being forced to deal directly, but solely, with the top level of government
can be preferable to getting bogged down in the bureaucracy, however. In
Russia, for example, oil managers complain of having to negotiate
simultaneously with local producing associations, regional governments, and,
in the words of one western banker working with the Russian oil industry,
'just about every Moscow ministry and committee that could possibly have any
interest'. In the smaller republics, oil managers are often able to go
straight to the top and, provided they can get a binding deal ratified by
parliament, they are happy to do this even in the absence of established
legislation on property rights, taxation and royalties.
Both Chevron's and British Gas's negotiations in Kazakhstan were conducted
with deputy prime ministers and were closely monitored by Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, who personally signed Chevron's deal.
Similarly, in Azerbaijan, BP-Statoil's deal was negotiated directly with the
government and signed by Isa Gambarov, chairman of Azerbaijan's parliament
and effectively number two to the president, Abulfaz Elchibey, who also took
a keen interest. There are obvious risks to this approach: 'If the
government goes, so could our deal,' one BP negotiator admitted privately.
While Elchibey is a democratically-elected and popular president, his
position could become insecure, particularly if he fails to stop the
fighting in the disputed Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. However, the
man seen as most likely to replace him, Itibar Mamedov, has a programme of
accelerated democratisation and economic reform.
'There are risks everywhere, that's part of the oil business,' says John
Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration. Investment and oil are needed by
any government, he says. There is also the argument that economic growth can
itself promote political stability.
Barring political disaster, BP-Statoil's agreement may become an example of
the benefits such deals can bring both to oil companies and to the host
republic. At more than 1bn barrels, the field will be an important addition
to BP's reserves.
Moreover, while some technology will have to be imported, BP-Statoil plans
to construct as much as possible of the infrastructure at Baku's SPS yard.
It will also employ Azerbaijanis offshore and in local management, which
Browne says could provide jobs for 700 people.
While the share of profits between BP-Statoil and Azerbaijan is yet to be
agreed, Browne told local reporters last week he expected a 'very, very
hearty majority' of revenues to go to the republic. If both the Amoco and BP
deals are successful, Azerbaijan should see its oil output more than tripled
to 700,000 barrels a day by the end of the decade.
There will be inevitable setbacks. The day after BP's deal was signed, the
managers of Azphonesat, the only private satellite phone operator in Baku
which BP had been using for its communications, found their office locked
and guarded by police. They were told the local communications ministry had
decided it needed to 'supervise' communications.
BP officials were unruffled. 'It's not a problem. We've coped with much
worse than this in Colombia.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / Management: Corporate citizenship seen rising from the ashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tambrands, the US tampon company, is fanatical about the quality of its
product. So when Femtech, its Ukrainian subsidiary, found that a shipment of
sub-standard cotton had been used, it decided to burn hundreds of cases of
affected products.
Most of the 300-strong, mainly female workforce was appalled at such
deliberate waste in a country where tampons are in desperately short supply.
But the bonfire greatly impressed the local Ministry of Health which saw the
blaze as final proof that here was a foreign company that was not prepared
to fob off local consumers with inferior products.
Such recognition of good corporate citizenship is valuable in this
newly-independent country of 52m inhabitants. Ukraine has approved liberal
foreign investment and privatisation laws but is still mainly run by
old-style communist apparatchiks. Their ingrained suspicion of capitalism
and desire to protect their own vested interests is reflected in an often
obstructive approach to foreign companies which thus far have been slow to
invest in the republic.
Femtech, which started life in 1988 as a 49 per cent shareholder in a joint
venture with the Soviet Pharmaceutical Ministry was the first foreign
company to set up in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.
Since the original decision to invest up to Pounds 10m in the venture,
liberalisation of the foreign investment legislation has allowed a
progressive rise in Tambrands' stake. Femtech is now a 100 per cent owned
Tambrands subsidiary.
But much else has changed in the four years since the company took over a
half-finished engineering factory in the middle of a muddy field near Kiev's
Borispol airport. Ukraine was then part of the Soviet Union and having an
all-union ministry as a joint venture partner meant that marketing was taken
care of completely. Femtech only had to produce for a virtually limitless
market. The men from the ministry distributed it among Soviet pharmacies. At
that time, the rouble was also still an all-union currency and inflation,
though growing, was still barely into double figures.
Now Femtech operates in hyper-inflationary conditions, pays its workforce in
Ukrainian 'coupons' and has had to set up its own marketing arrangements in
the 15 independent states which have emerged from the old union. Many, like
Ukraine and the Baltic states, have either left or are leaving the rouble
zone, while the use of dollars and other hard currencies is increasingly
widespread. At the same time, unemployment is rising and incomes are
widening rapidly.
The bulk of these changes have taken place in the seven months since Tom
Collins, a 27-year-old MBA from Boston, arrived as managing director.
Another production line has been added to the original two and a fourth is
awaiting customs clearance. Once installed, output will rise to around 250m
tampons a year, still only around 2 per cent of the potential market.
Through all the changes, Tambrands has stuck to its original business plan.
This was to pay roubles for all local inputs and cover unavoidable hard
currency imports by exporting finished product to hard currency markets.
Locally-generated rouble profits were used to finance expansion. The first
acquisition was made in January when Tambrands bought a cotton bleachery in
St Petersburg with profits generated in Kiev. It is now installing two
tampon production lines and sending its general manager and other key
Russian staff to England for training.
Keeping the workforce happy in hyper-inflationary times is also a tricky
business. With official statistics in disarray, Collins relies heavily on
his chief accountant, Lilia Osipova, who every month turns out what is
probably Ukraine's best report on inflation and local wage conditions.
She sits at her phone and calls her friends in the local factories for their
wage rates. She also calls up the local stores and walks round the local
markets, preparing a basket of 100 goods from lightbulbs to men's business
suits. Armed with this high-grade intelligence, management adjusts wages to
keep abreast of inflation.
Productivity and quality at the Kiev plant are up to similar standards as
those in Tambrands plants elsewhere. But wage costs are only 2 per cent of
total costs in Kiev compared with around 14 per cent at plants in Britain.
Now Tambrands is using part of its locally-generated funds to build 104
high-quality apartments for its workforce. The land will be leased for 99
years from the local council but the flats will remain Tambrands' property
and it will be able to sell them in future, when the company hopes Ukrainian
currency is convertible and profits can be exported in hard currency.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Companies face new fraud threat from Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH police say they have uncovered fresh attempts by Nigerian confidence
tricksters to draw UK high street banks as well as businesses into
fraudulent transactions potentially worth millions of pounds.
According to police, a 'hard core of Nigerian fraudsters' has been trying to
engage UK companies in trade involving forged letters of credit and bank
drafts.
The Financial Times has been shown copies of counterfeit letters of credit
purportedly issued by a branch of Standard Chartered Bank and advised by
National Westminster Bank earlier this summer.
The documents covered a planned shipment from The Cooper Printing Equipment
Company, based in Hertfordshire. Police were contacted about the attempted
transaction after NatWest alerted the company that the financial
documentation was fraudulent.
Mr Christopher Cooper, the company's technical director, said: 'Our policy
here is that we release no goods until everything is verified by the banks.
Nigeria is a very unreliable market.'
Police say the potential for fraud of this kind has increased as the
recession continues, putting pressure on companies to secure sales. Methods
used by the Nigerian confidence tricksters have also become more
sophisticated.
Although NatWest has agreed to go public on the issue, other high street
banks are understood to have had their names used in forged documentation
emanating from Nigeria.
NatWest says that although careful handling of documentation should stop
obvious frauds from getting through the banking system, 'during a recession
you can understand how the need for business can cloud someone's better
judgment'.
The latest Nigerian fraud bears similarities to one discovered in January
when British exporters based in Leeds uncovered transactions involving a
fictitious branch of Nigeria's Wema Bank and a bogus finance company in New
York.
Separately, the FT has been passed a copy of a letter from Lagos sent to a
leading London-based car dealer last month offering a substantial commission
for help in transferring Dollars 19m of unaudited funds from Nigeria.
The sending of such letters became widespread last year, leading to a
crackdown involving British police, the Foreign Office and the Department of
Trade and Industry, with the co-operation of the Nigerian government.
Last month's letter suggests that the issue may be about to re-emerge,
together with the more sophisticated fraud identified by police after its
interception by NatWest.
Det Insp Paul Brown of The Metropolitan and City of London Police fraud
squad, said: 'We believe that Nigerian fraud is not as extensive as it was.
But the practice doesn't seem to be going away. It is an ongoing problem.'
According to Confederation of British Industry officials, suspected fraud
reported by its members has in recent months become less widespread than it
was towards the end of last year when it issued the first of several
statements alerting businesses to the danger of multi-million-pound swindles
in fraudulent trade with Nigeria.
An official warned, though, that the continuing practice was still a
potentially destabilising factor in UK links with one of its leading Third
World trading partners.
The official said: 'Nigeria is our biggest market in sub-Saharan Africa.
This sort of thing just knocks it all.'
The letter obtained by the FT explains that the funds derive from 'a
government contract to a foreign firm which is pending payment' and which
was arranged by members of the armed forces linked to the previous regime.
President Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's present military leader, seized power
in a coup in 1985.
The implication is that the account has been overlooked in the confusion
surrounding the coup that brought the government to power and that some of
the unaudited funds will be spent on cars distributed by the recipient.
The letter asks the car dealer to send the following documents by courier
service to an address in Lagos: blank-headed letter paper signed by the
dealer; blank pro forma invoices, also signed and stamped; and details of
the company's bank account.
The letter states that military 'friends' of the sender have earmarked how
the alleged funds will be shared out - 'the owners of the business 60 per
cent, the account's owner 30 per cent, for local and international expenses
10 per cent'.
The letter was posted from Nigeria early last month to a leading Mayfair car
dealer, to an address no longer occupied by the company. It was opened by
accident by the present occupant, who passed it to the FT.
The letter does not suggest that there has been any previous contact with
the company. Police have confirmed that the letter bears all the markings of
a fraud that has been widespread practice during the past 18 months with
companies receiving unsolicited letters of this nature from Nigeria.
According to diplomatic sources in Lagos, the financial-document trick is
only one of several with which Nigerian confidence tricksters of
'world-class quality' have been raking in millions of pounds from victims in
Europe, the US and elsewhere.
A Nigerian last month received a four-year jail sentence in a London court
after being found guilty of obtaining money by deception.
The individual was caught after a 'sting' operation involving British police
and a small UK company that had lost more than Pounds 100,000 in a
preliminary transaction.
In recent months the Nigerian government has tried to pursue potential
fraudsters under a special section of the criminal code that covers
obtaining money by deception.
According to British investigators, however, potential fraudsters are
managing to avoid arrest in their own country by using false addresses and
taking advantage of the inadequate resources of the local police force.
They also believe there are numerous British businessmen who have lost
substantial sums through Nigerian fraud but have not reported it for fear of
being implicated in more wide-scale corruption.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Textile trade rules are attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE AGREEMENTS on textiles and clothing cost the UK more than Pounds 1bn a
year, according to a report published today.
The Multi-Fibre Arrangement - rules that specify the amount and types of
clothing and textiles to be exported by Third World countries to
industrialised consumers - raises prices and reduces competition, says the
World Development Movement, the pressure group.
Consumers are forced to buy expensive, domestically made clothes while
manufacturing is partly shielded from inexpensive competition. In addition,
poorer consumers have less choice of cheaper clothing.
The report says that the MFA has 'also failed to protect UK jobs. Over
780,000 UK jobs in the textiles industry were lost between 1963 and 1987.'
Most were lost through recession, the introduction of new technology and
competition from elsewhere in the European Community rather than the Third
World.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Cadbury responds to CBI hostility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of
Corporate Governance, has explained why he believes the Confederation of
British Industry has objected to the committee's proposed enforcement code.
'They may think it will be like the Takeover Code, which began as a code and
has grown into a rule book,' he said. That was certainly not the intention
of his committee.
Sir Adrian conceded that a code based on voluntary compliance without the
support of CBI members would have little future. The CBI may seek approval
from its members for an endorsement of the report at its annual meeting in
November.
'I see our report as a key first step - a very important first step if we
can get the backing for it,' Sir Adrian said while explaining the hazards of
trying to overhaul corporate behaviour through voluntary means.
The committee, formed more than a year ago at the instigation of the
Financial Reporting Council, the Stock Exchange and the accountancy bodies,
has recommended a voluntary code aimed at improving the performance of
company boards. Some shareholders have criticised the report for not going
further in giving them both access to information and a voice in corporate
affairs, while some companies and directors have said it goes too far.
Two principal objections have surfaced in the 209 responses to the
committee's draft report, issued in May. They concern the suggestion that
non-executive directors have a role in monitoring the activities of
executives, and a proposal for a Stock Exchange listing requirement under
which companies would have to publicise the extent to which they comply with
a proposed code of best practice.
The full Cadbury committee will meet later this week to consider the
responses.
Sir Adrian said that he had been taken aback at the public interest in the
work of his group. 'When we were set up, we didn't expect to be the centre
of all this attention,' he said.
In explaining the public fascination with the issue of corporate governance,
Sir Adrian said the present economic climate had played a role. The enduring
recession had exposed managerial weaknesses in companies, which had been
masked during the more prosperous late 1980s.
Yet the recession was not the only cause of weakness. 'The question remains:
why aren't boards better run?' Sir Adrian said. 'I think the final straw has
been Europe. The corporate governance debate started in the US and moved to
the UK because we are the two countries which have lost out most
competitively.'
Concern for the UK's competitive position, he said, had concentrated the
minds of government, industry and shareholders and led to increasing focus
on what goes wrong at corporate board level.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Reform of tax on dividends sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Institute of Directors has called on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
to take immediate action to reform the system of advance corporation tax.
In a submission to the chancellor, it calls the existing system a 'burden'
which is distorting company investment and location decisions more seriously
in the UK than in other countries.
Surplus ACT - tax payments on dividends that cannot be offset against
mainstream corporation tax liabilities - has come under increasing attack
recently.
A study released last week showed that ACT payments among quoted companies
rose to 34 per cent of the total tax charge in 1991, compared with 24 per
cent in the year before.
Mr Lamont has admitted that ACT is a handicap for UK companies earning
profits abroad.
The IoD says it would prefer a return to the net UK rate system, which
operated until 1965, by which the tax repayment to shareholders paying less
than the basic rate of income tax was limited to the difference between the
UK and foreign tax rate at which they were liable.

FT  14 SEP 92 / BT to sell security arm to AA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom is expected to announce this week that it is selling Telecom
Security, its burglar alarms business, to the Automobile Association,
Michael Skapinker writes.
The business, acquired in the wake of BT's privatisation in 1984, is likely
to sell for less than Pounds 1m. BT announced last January that it wanted to
sell the business, in which it has a 90 per cent stake.
The sale is part of BT's strategy to divest itself of peripheral businesses.
It has already sold its catering business, its cable television interests
and a telephone factory in Wales. Telecom Security employs about 200 people.
BT is believed to have held discussions with several leading security
companies before settling on the AA.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Status of independent schools 'must be scrutinised'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN END TO the charitable status of independent schools that do not fulfil a
genuinely charitable function was approved by the Liberal Democrats
yesterday, against the proposal in a party discussion document that it
should be maintained for all of them, Alison Smith writes.
The policy paper, Excellence For All, said that independent schools should
still be able to benefit from charitable status, but that they should meet a
minimum curriculum entitlement and should play a more active part in the
local community.
After the debate, Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman,
brushed aside the adoption of the amendment from the Young Liberal Democrats
as a minor issue: he did not vote on the issue.
Instead, his speech underlined the party's opposition to schools' opting out
of local education authority control, with a call for such moves to be
vigorously resisted throughout the community, in governing bodies and on
local councils as well as in parliament.
The party's policy is to replace LEAs with democratically accountable
education departments to take strategic decisions, while giving schools
themselves greater autonomy.
The pledge to raise income tax to spend more on education was a distinctive
feature of the Liberal Democrats' general election campaign.
Mr Foster accused the government of being 'out of control' in its attitude
towards education. 'They are behaving like a demented Basil Fawlty,
furiously beating with a large branch a car that doesn't work - in a manic
attempt to get it going.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / Revival scheme failings identified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LACK of co-ordination among schemes for promoting economic regeneration has
been criticised at a Business in the Community conference on development in
the east Midlands.
Mr David Grayson, managing director of Business in the Community's strategy
group, said the UK led the world in the number of regeneration schemes it
produced, but they were often unco-ordinated.
He listed several factors that could thwart efforts to revive a rundown
area. They included unrealistic timescales and funding, and the adoption of
too many different priorities. Experience elsewhere in Europe suggested that
organisations involved in regeneration should have firm agreements on their
respective roles and should pool their resources towards a few defined
goals.
His complaints were echoed by Mr Mick Lyons, chief executive of
Nottinghamshire County Council. He said: 'There is too much worry about
setting up new agencies rather than getting existing agencies to work
together.'
He said economic development could not be done by the public sector alone or
without public-sector input.
Mr Philip Champ, a main board director at East Midlands Electricity, warned
that 'no business can continue to thrive in an area where other business is
not doing well'.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Competitor for Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPETITOR electronic share-dealing system for the London Stock Exchange
is scheduled to be launched next summer if it obtains sufficient funding.
Tradepoint Financial Networks will issue a 'pathfinder' prospectus later
this month to raise Pounds 5m from investors on the Vancouver stock
exchange.
The system - to be called Tradepoint - will target at institutional
investors and should be operational by June or July next year.
It will be 'order-driven', or operate by automatically matching volumes and
prices of share orders from buyers and sellers. That contrasts with the
quote-driven system that dominates the Stock Exchange, based on
intermediaries' quotes.
Tradepoint obtained authorisation as a 'service company regime' last week
from the Securities and Investments Board, which allows it to 'facilitate'
trading but forbids it to deal directly with private clients.
The chairman is Mr Stephen Raven, a director of Madoff Securities
International, a past director of SG Warburg Securities and County NatWest
Securities and a Stock Exchange council member for 16 years.
He said that Tradepoint would offer software and hardware to customers free
and charge solely on a percentage of the value of trades conducted on the
system.
He hopes to achieve 10 per cent of the value of total transactions on which
commissions are earned within five years, but he said he would break even
above 1.5 per cent. That is based on an estimate of Dollars 500bn (Pounds
260bn) a year of transactions on the Stock Exchange that give rise to
commissions.
He said existing commissions were normally about 0.2 per cent of the value
of Stock Exchange transactions that give rise to charges. Tradepoint's rates
would be 'significantly' below that level.
Mr Raven said he wanted to attract six institutions to subscribe to the
service before the end of the year and about 30 before the launch date.
There are existing order-driven systems including one called Nordex, as well
as the Stock Exchange's own Bulletin Board, designed for shares in which
there is little trading.
Mr Raven said that Tradepoint had the advantage of offering buyers and
sellers anonymity and of improving existing trading, which he said was
imperfect because it was dominated by just five or six market-making firms.
Previous discussions about introducing an order-driven system for more
liquid stocks on the Stock Exchange have been resisted by the market makers,
who would lose business as a result.
The Stock Exchange said yesterday that a quote-driven system was the best
way of trading in liquid stocks. It did not think Tradepoint would be a
significant competitior.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Training guidelines attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAFT government guidelines for training policy next year show that Training
and Enterprise Councils and Local Enterprise Councils, their Scottish
counterparts, are expected to lead local initiatives on training targets and
to extract more private-sector funds to support training, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes.
A scathing response from the Merseyside Tec says the government has ignored
its own leadership role and that Tecs need more public funding. They are
willing to be partners but cannot lead effectively when many of their
objectives concern areas outside their influence.
The draft of the guidelines - to be published late this year - and the
Merseyside response reveal sharp divergences on objectives, how to achieve
them, and the roles of the Tecs.
A member of another Tec board said: 'The Merseyside commentary articulates
what very many of us are feeling. I am sure many other Tecs are preparing
similar responses.'
The government wants all employees to be undergoing training or development
by 1996, when it says half the national workforce should be aiming for basic
national vocational qualifications or 'learning units' towards them. By the
following year, 80 per cent of young people should have basic NVQs.
Merseyside's response states: 'Quality foundation learning for young people
is the responsibility of us all and should be resourced by the nation
through the public purse. It should not be dependent upon the willingness
and capacity of employers to support education initiatives and youth
training.'
It adds that current funding levels, especially in youth training, will not
enable the government's aims to be met.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Jubilee Line is at crucial stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON TRANSPORT chiefs believe the planned extension of the Jubilee Line to
Docklands will never be built if it is not given the go-ahead in the next
few weeks.
They fear that further delays in reaching a decision on the Pounds 1.8bn
Tube line will cause it to lose its place in the public-spending programme
to CrossRail, the capital's next big transport project.
Construction of the Jubilee Line extension was due to have started in April,
but the project was put on hold after the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, Canary
Wharf developers.
Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf Ltd had been due to make financial contributions
of about Pounds 170m at today's prices towards the cost of building the
line. The government has said the project will not go forward until someone
else comes up with the money.
Last year's autumn statement provided for the bulk of spending on the
Jubilee Line to be spread over the next three years. However, if no deal has
been struck over Canary Wharf's future before this year's public-spending
round, the government seems likely to defer the planned expenditure.
If that happened, the Jubilee Line would clash with the Pounds 1.7bn
CrossRail scheme, an east-west underground link due to start construction in
1995.
One London Transport executive said: 'You have got to be very optimistic
indeed to believe that the government would allow both these lines to be
built at the same time. So a choice would have to be made between the two -
and if I had to put money on which one would win, I would put it on
CrossRail.'
London Transport is lobbying strongly for the Jubilee Line extension to go
ahead. It says its 500-strong project team is still assessing tenders. It
has provisionally accepted tenders for work worth Pounds 600m. By the
beginning of November the figure will have risen to Pounds 1bn.

FT  14 SEP 92 / MMC to hear of clustered private medical fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFORMATION to be submitted to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry
on private medical fees shows evidence that doctors' charges cluster very
closely around the guideline rates published by the British Medical
Association.
An analysis conducted for the Financial Times by Private Patients Plan Group
(PPP), the UK's second-largest private medical insurer, shows relatively
little variation in bills submitted to the company for the same treatment
from doctors around the country.
Last Tuesday the MMC announced that it would investigate the process by
which specialists calculated fees for private patients. It wants to
determine whether there is - voluntarily or involuntarily - a monopoly being
operated between doctors and the BMA.
The BMA first issued a set of guidelines to its members in 1989, which
showed the average rates charged for a series of medical procedures and
anaesthetics. The latest version, published this month, lists rates for more
than 1,500 treatments.
It emphasises that the rates are not 'recommended' levels but simply
advisory information that should help doctors determine their own rates in
discussion with patients.
The PPP analysis - using claims between April 1 and September 9 this year -
shows a wide range between the highest and lowest charges for any type of
treatment. However, the vast majority of bills are concentrated in a small
central range around the levels in the BMA guidelines.
Mr Roy Forman, PPP chief executive, has opposed the idea of a BMA schedule
since it was originated in the 1980s. He welcomed the MMC inquiry, and
argued that since 1989 doctors' fees had risen and increasingly clustered
around the rates published by the BMA.
A separate analysis by the company shows that the increase in claims among
all private health insurers between 1990 and last year has been more than
twice the rate of inflation.
More than 84 per cent of the increase was due to a rise in the value of
claims, with a small increase in the number of claims and a slight decline
in the number of subscribers to private health care plans.
PPP will be submitting further details of the medical bills it receives to
the MMC.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Arts: Tosca - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The years pass but the voice does not change. It is difficult to believe
that it will soon be 30 years since Luciano Pavarotti made his Covent Garden
debut: the beauty and clarity of this tenor voice remain undimmed, as does
the musicianship of its owner, however dazzling the spotlight of media
attention that is shone on his every appearance these days.
This revival of Tosca opened the Royal Opera's 1992/93 season. From time to
time the company's still handsome production is asked to recapture the
dramatic integrity it had in 1964, when it was new. More often it is merely
a showcase for a star, as here. Pavarotti sang in Tosca back in 1977, when
memory recalls the opera caught fire as drama. This time it did not,
although that should not necessarily be taken as the tenor's fault.
In the music of Cavaradossi, Pavarotti sings to the manner born. There is no
way that a ringing Italianate tenor sound can be taught. Either it is there
by nature or it is not, though Pavarotti has told of the exercises he
practised as a student to make his vowel sounds so astonishingly clear.
There was perhaps more steel to the tone than usual on Saturday. The phrases
in the Act 3 aria where a singer can caress the music remained loud and
tightly-controlled. Otherwise the role was most eloquently sung.
The vocal personality gives his Cavaradossi a touch of class, even if the
rest of the character is only sketched in. During the lovers' playful banter
in the opening scenes, Pavarotti sat at his easel, continuing to dab at his
painting with a cheeky grin, while his Tosca, with no more concern for
dramatic credibility, addressed the audience and hardly gave him a cursory
nod.
As far as she went, Elizabeth Holleque made a workable Tosca. In this
company, however, the voice lacked glamour and power. Playing a prima donna,
not least in the production created for Callas, demands a singer ready to
stamp her personality on the role to a degree this young American artist,
for all her virtues, was not. She entered the lion's den in the Farnese
Palace looking as though she would be swallowed pretty quickly.
An understandable reaction, perhaps, as Silvano Carroli was playing a
voracious Scarpia, his eyes rolling, the power clearly gone to his head.
There was coarseness in plenty here, as the voice sounded rough and he
shouts too often. But Carroli can utter Italian words in a way that sends
shivers of menace down the spine. The small roles were mostly taken by
well-known faces, including Eric Garrett's Sacristan, the original from
1964.
In the pit Zubin Mehta obtained the gorgeously lush sounds from the
orchestra that he has always found for Puccini in this theatre, although the
price was some self-indulgent wallowing at times.
On balance a lesser conductor with a good grasp of the Italian style would
probably be preferable. Despite signs that the Royal Opera had other
ambitions, this was a star's evening. What Pavarotti was achieving in vocal
terms was well ahead of anything else that was going on.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Arts: An Inspector Calls - Lyttelton Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news from the Royal National Theatre: Stephen Daldry turns out to be
quite as effective working on a large stage as he was on a small. Daldry was
until recently artistic director at the tiny Gate Theatre in London's
Notting Hill and is about to take up a similar post at the Royal Court. He
was invited to direct at the National while in transit.
Who would have guessed that he would come up with An Inspector Calls to
display his talents? J B Priestley's play is an impeccable example of really
good middle-brow drama: full of craftsmanship, the odd surprise and several
good parts. On the intellectual level, it raises questions without being in
the least bit provocative or shocking. It is the sort of stuff of which the
Reithian BBC was made. For an audience, it is almost impossible not to sit
back and enjoy it.
In other words, this is not what we expect from Daldry, although a programme
note reveals that he has directed the play before at the Theatre Royal in
York. What he shows at the National is that even a conventional piece can be
successfully subjected to his staging techniques.
An Inspector is essentially a dining room thriller with psychological and
social insights. The inspector arrives at an engagement party of north
country industrialists - the Birlings of Brumley - gradually to uncover all
sorts of skeletons in the cupboard. No member of the Birling family has
behaved criminally; social responsibility to the unseen girl who is alleged
to have committed suicide is another matter.
One way of playing this would be to give the whole stage to the dining room
and let the action revolve around the table. Indeed, by all accounts, that
is how An Inspector was played at its first London production in 1946,
starring Ralph Richardson, Alec Guinness and Margaret Leighton.
Daldry has different and better ideas. On a small scale. the entire Birling
house is centre stage, but it is the shell from which the family is drawn
out rather than where the action takes place. The rest of the stage is a
kind of no-man's land. Another house can be seen in the background, a line
of lamp-posts stretching towards it. A full-scale red telephone box, quite
important to the plot, is in the corner of front stage right.
It is the no-man's land that is dominant and where the inspector pursues his
inquiries and, one by one, members of the family admit to past actions that
do not bear too close a scrutiny. This is the outside world looking in
rather than the family protecting itself behind comfortably closed curtains.
Daldry has made one other change. Although the play was written towards the
end of the second world war, it is set towards the beginning of the first.
Daldry has switched the action to 1945. I do not think that the change makes
a ha'p'orth of significant difference. Priestley's work stands up for any
period. But it does allow the use of a crowd scene. From time to time, the
Labour voters of 1945 - not all them by any means in cloth caps - silently
occupy the stage and, at the end, the Birlings' house.
There is also a coup de theatre. At one stage, the house falls down, dining
room and all. Nothing put on by Daldry is ever dull, and as a designer he
has Ian MacNeil who worked with him at the Gate.
Kenneth Cranham is the inspector, the role once played by Alec Guinness. As
a part, it has grown with time, for nowadays we tend to give more sympathy
to the outsider than to the bourgeois family. Cranham plays it perfectly,
without undue aggression. The rest of the acting struck me as a bit flat,
though I admired Diana Kent as the daughter who sees the political light.
In repertory at the Lyttelton Theatre (071 928 2252) until October 20, then
touring.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Arts: Example - Liverpool Everyman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Television and theatre maintain an awkward relationship. Actors often have
to choose between a lucrative Soap Opera or a worthy season in Repertory,
while theatre producers need stars made bankable by television fame. At a
deeper level, the two media can be mutually informing when they treat the
same issues.
Here is a documentary play born of documentary television; Example, at the
Liverpool Everyman Theatre, is a piece of legal history still unfolding.
It was devised by the Belgrade Theatre in Education group in Coventry in
1977, and has now been reshaped by the Merseyside Young People's Theatre
Company (director Chris Channing) to tour Merseyside and visit the York Arts
Centre.
It is a folk tale of South London. The action recounts the story of Derek
Bentley. On January 28, 1953, Bentley was hanged in Wandsworth Prison for
the murder, on November 2, 1952, of PC Sidney Miles during a robbery in
Croydon. The gun which killed Miles was fired by Bentley's partner,
Christopher Craig. At the time the shot was fired, Bentley was unarmed and
under arrest.
Craig was 16 and therefore, when found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey on
December 11, 1952, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment; but
Bentley was 19, and was sentenced to hang. He was also an epileptic, had an
IQ in the 60s and a mental age of 4.
After the verdict, an appeal (13 January 1953) and representations to the
Home Secretary were turned down. On 26 January, a motion for reprieve
presented by Sydney Silverman, MP, was removed from the Order Paper on the
Speaker's instructions. No commutation came from the Home Secretary, and
Bentley hanged.
Several books have taken up the case. David Yallop's To Encourage The Others
(1972) and MJ Trow's "Let Him Have It, Chris", (what Bentley is said to have
shouted, meaning either 'Kill him' or 'Give him the gun') along with a
Thames Reports documentary (1990, director. Roger Corke) have brought fresh
evidence, augmented by Craig's new contribution and an Observer piece in
September 1991, to suggest that Bentley was wrongfully hanged. A petition,
signed by 205 MPs, for Bentley's pardon was submitted to the Home Secretary
in June this year.
A play is not a case, nor a theatre a courtroom. Example presents the
emotional argument for Bentley's relative innocence: he was involved in an
armed robbery, but he did not commit the murder. But Elvis Costello's
viciously ironic song, 'Let Him Dangle' puts a better ad hominem case.
The legal profession and the police fare badly here, the former seen as
self-serving snobs and the latter as callous liars. But if this is to be
more than - justly in this instance - an anti- authority drama, the
publicity material for schools should be clearer about the issues. A look at
changing practices in the United States should highlight the position of
convicted murderers under 18 who are, as Bentley was, mentally subnormal. In
some States, they face death by electrocution.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Arts: Islamic tradition rewarded - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS there an architectural future? With more than a third of the
architectural profession out of work and a Government keener on belt
tightening than expansion, the immediate future could well be described as
gloomy. Architecture is not like fashion. We are told that skirts get longer
when times are bad. Buildings do not get any larger - they just do not get
built.
September is a month for looking ahead after the summer break, and this year
I can see that there are not going to be so many new buildings to write
about. The in-tray is, however, far from empty. There is a lot of cultural
activity ahead and I foresee considerable debate about the need for
unfashionable things like centralised planning of the infrastructure, the
renewal of the housing stock and the development of policies for expansion
that will be environmentally safe and appropriately green. In the run-up to
the United States presidential election, the democratic candidate is already
promising to spend billions of dollars on the collapsing infrastructure of
America's cities.
In Japan, the government has decided to spend millions of yen on urban and
transport projects. In the United Kingdom, there is a sense of dismay at the
failure during the 1980s to secure an alliance between the state and the
private sector that really worked. The dreadful shadow of Canary Wharf casts
a pall over Mrs Thatcher's efforts to rejuvenate the inner cities. That
failure was undoubtedly caused by a refusal to recognise the Government's
responsibility for improving infrastructure.
Problems in the building world of the United Kingdom are put into
perspective by a glance in the direction of the politically uncertain states
of Eastern Europe and the countries of the third world. There is one
architectural agency that consistently draws attention to the achievements
and problems of architects working in the Muslim world and that is the Aga
Khan Award for Architecture. This award is not just a prize, it is a complex
and well funded process that began by alerting Islamic countries to the
dangers of ignoring their particular architectural legacy during the
oil-boom years of the 1970s. The award combines its search for the best
architectural achievements with a teaching programme in Islamic architecture
at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at
schools in Pakistan and Jordan.
It is an immaculately managed award and some of its seminars have been
highly constructive, particularly in the field of housing and in the debate
about architectural tradition. This year the prize-giving ceremony itself
achieves a particular distinction by being held in the newly created
independent Republic of Uzbekistan in the ancient Muslim city of Samarkand.
From some 259 entries, the international Master Jury has chosen nine
projects, ranging from the restoration of the seventh century city of
Kairouan in Tunisia to the careful improvement of a squatter settlement in
Yogyakarta in Indonesia.
One of the nine entries that exactly matches the aim of the award - 'to
navigate between the twin dangers of slavishly copying the architecture of
the past and of foolishly ignoring its rich legacy' - is the Pan African
Institute for Development at Ouagadougou, in Burkina Faso. The campus is
modelled on Volta village plans and is built entirely of the local material
of stabilised earth brick.
The award tries to encourage architects and builders working in Muslim
countries to avoid the anonymity and alienation of much contemporary
architecture that is built with no sympathy for its immediate surroundings
and no acknowledgement of tradition. The prize funds are generous - some
half a million US dollars - and the winners will be announced in Samarkand
on September 19.
The Aga Khan Award has not ignored the best contemporary architecture and
one of the architects it has commended is the Frenchman Jean Nouvel. He is
really famous for one building - L'Institut du Monde Arabe on the banks of
the Seine in Paris. This is an amazing marriage between Moorish traditions
and high technology. From December 16 he is to be the subject of a
exhibition in London at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. His opera house
for Lyons and his conference centre in Tours will be included in the show
and I am particularly looking forward to seeing his 'Tour Sans Fins' the
tallest tower in Europe and the slimmest in the world to be built at La
Defense in Paris. This has been described as, 'emerging from a dark crater
it appears to dematerialise as it rises, seeming to soar from the centre of
the earth to the skies.'
* * *
European architecture is to be featured strongly in the forthcoming BBC
television series, 'Building Sights Europe' which starts transmission on a
weekly basis on Sunday evenings on September 27. The composer Iannis Xenakis
and the playwright Vaclav Havel are two of the contributors who select
buildings they like. Richard Burdett, who runs the Architecture Foundation
in London, chooses the house on Capri built during the Second World War for
the Italian writer Curzio Malaparte. It was liked by both Mussolini and
Brigitte Bardot. . .
* * *
The Architecture Foundation exhibition about the City of London 'City
Changes' is to be extended until October 2 at the Royal Exchange - it is
worth seeing if only to compare the recent crop of new buildings in the City
with the quality and potential of some of the other cities of Europe.

The further we move from the days of British (and French and Belgian and
Italian) imperialism the more difficult it becomes to blame all the ills of
African countries today on colonialism. Given that local tribal, religious
and political antagonisms are blamed everywhere else in the world it seems
reasonable to expect similar causes in Africa. Out Of Darkness (7.50 BBC2)
looks at the position in Ethiopia, an example of a country less affected
than most by European imperial activity which, nevertheless, is now in a
position not so very different from that of Yugoslavia.
Unfortunately BBC2 is showing the elongated cinema version of Steven
Spielberg's Duel, a weird thriller about a car driver persecuted by a huge
articulated tanker. The original television version is shorter and better
(8.30). Panorama investigates the way that the pay of British company
directors has risen faster than ever during the recession while others have
been tightening their belts (9.30 BBC1). ITV shows The London Mozart Players
At The Fairfield performing a Rossini overture and then Mozart's Piano
Concerto No 23 with pianist Howard Shelley (10.40).

FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Angola's poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VISION of a stable and thriving post-apartheid southern Africa is being
tested in Angola, and the outcome is in the balance. Can the ruling MPLA and
its main challenger, Unita, settle their differences through the ballot box
at the end of this month, or will old enmities prevail?
The stakes are high. A successful transition to democracy will help unlock
the potential of one of Africa's most richly endowed countries, which in
association with South Africa could provide the economic boost the region
badly needs. Pretoria is Luanda's natural trading partner, notwithstanding
the irony that Angola's oil - over 500,000 barrels a day - will be paying
for the rehabilitation of an economy that South Africa helped destroy.
Failure will not only destroy this vision and dash hopes for the recovery of
a country battered by a 16-year civil war. The consequences of an unstable
Angola permeate the region, whether as refugees, traffic in arms or the
continued closure of the Benguela railway, once the main outlet to the sea
for Zaire and Zambia.
The omens are mixed as the country enters the last phase of a process which
began with a UN monitored ceasefire 16 months ago. Banditry by demobilised
soldiers, unrest in the oil enclave of Cabinda, and increasing tension
between the two armies all threaten a fragile peace.
An encouraging development was last week's news that both President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, intend to form
broad based administrations irrespective of their margin of victory.
But this assurance may not be enough to contain tensions that could derail a
process that has been flawed from the start.
It has always been apparent that the UN mission was given inadequate
resources for its task of monitoring the ceasefire and the demobilisation of
two rival armies, and deciding whether the elections are free and fair.
In contrast with the UN role during Namibia's transition to independence, it
does not have to organise the poll. But the contrast between the Namibian
operation, with 6,000 UN personnel in a country with a good infrastructure
and only 1m people, and what is expected from a 600-strong UN team in a
country shattered by war and with 10m citizens, is a sorry one.
The difficulties are compounded by Angola's weak bureaucracy and mutual
distrust between MPLA and Unita, which has left vital features of the
transition behind schedule. Demobilisation of the two armies is incomplete,
as is the creation of a new national army.
Nor is it certain that the government can arrange the efficient distribution
and collection of ballot boxes, any more than that the UN team has the
resources with which to make a definitive pronouncement on the exercise.
Angola's hazardous transition may well succeed, but it will be due as much
to good fortune as good judgment.

<TEXT>
THE CITY of London is deeply troubled by proposed new legislation on insider
dealing, and it is easy to see why. The present law is discredited. Marked
share price movements in front of important company announcements are
commonplace; successful prosecutions are rare. The idea now is that the
scope of legislation should be widened, in ways that will significantly
increase the numbers of people who qualify as insiders.
The law needs to pass two conflicting tests. It has to provide definitions
of wrongdoing that can successfully be prosecuted. And it has to do this
without damaging the interests of those who are trying to conduct legitimate
business. The present law fails the first test, since proving that someone
has knowingly been trading as an insider turns out to be extremely
difficult. The new proposals could well fail the second test, by effectively
defining as inside information almost anything that anyone could possibly
want to know.
There are real risks that this approach could check the flow of information
between companies and investors in a way that would damage the interests of
the capital markets. Company directors already have enough difficulty in
briefing investors about changing business conditions. The new law could
make this worse.
It is unrealistic to legislate for a market in which all participants have
equal access to information. Better instead to aim more modestly for an
environment in which those who abuse positions of trust are punished, and
companies are encouraged to be as open as possible about their affairs. The
government needs to go carefully.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Estonia and Latvia close to IMF deals
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is expected to approve standby agreements
this week for Latvia and Estonia, enabling the two Baltic republics to
borrow up to Dollars 120m (Pounds 60.9m) between them from the Fund.
Estonia and Latvia will be the first republics of the former Soviet Union to
conclude fully fledged IMF standby agreements  - which provide money to help
a country meet its balance of payments shortfalls in return for agreement on
an economic recovery programme. Russia has negotiated a preliminary
agreement allowing it to draw on a first credit tranche of Dollars 1bn.
Senior IMF officials said the fund was in the process of finalising a
similar standby agreement with Lithuania. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are
expected to complete arrangements soon.
Belarus is also making progress in negotiations with the IMF and officials
said they were holding discussions with Ukraine.
The Baltic states' standby agreements are expected to allow them to draw up
to 90 per cent of their IMF quotas. This would give Latvia access to around
Dollars 81m, Estonia to about Dollars 41m and Lithuania to around Dollars
91m.
IMF funding will form part of a broader package of external financial
assistance involving substantial aid from the Nordic countries and the
European Community.
In its annual report, published last week, the IMF commended Estonia for its
progress towards a market economy, but expressed some concern about the
slowing of economic reform in Latvia.
IMF officials said they particularly appreciated the 'civilised fashion' in
which the two countries had left the rouble zone, setting up their own
currencies  - the kroon in Estonia and the lat in Latvia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for the first coherent and co-ordinated system to educate the Russian
workforce in the basics of capitalism was made to the government yesterday.
A report by a commission of Russian and western experts urges short courses
across a range of disciplines  - banking, insurance, commercial law,
marketing, office skills, business management and government economic
management. It says existing courses and teaching materials are of a low
quality, haphazard and have no national standards.
The report warns that 'millions of adults will need to change their activity
and occupation', that 'Russians have no idea of the market economy' and that
'virtually the entire Russian legal profession requires retraining'.
The authors revealed yesterday the scale of the changes demanded; 800,000
civil servants require instruction in the basics of the market economy and
more than 1m accountants need retraining.
Professor Arkady Manukovsky, of the School of International Business and one
of the report's authors, said training in the new economics must be geared
to the specific conditions of the Russian economy  - including the
'illegality or semi-legality of much Russian commercial activity'.
Mr Feodor Prokopov, first deputy labour minister, said the report
represented 'the first step towards professional training in Russia'.

<TEXT>
OFFICIALS from 24 western industrialised nations are meeting in Brussels
today and tomorrow to work out a co-ordinated system of nuclear safety
assistance to the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
Senior officials and nuclear experts from OECD countries aim to co-ordinate
their bilateral aid programmes, following the failure of the G7 summit in
Munich last July to agree a Dollars 800m (Pounds 406m) multilateral
programme to pay for short-term safety work on the region's 25 most
dangerous reactors. These are in Russia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and
Czechoslovakia.
The bilateral assistance announced so far amounts to about Dollars 300m  -
with about 90 per cent of that coming from the EC. Most of the EC aid so far
has been paid for work in Bulgaria.
The meeting is not expected to provide much more money but is intended to
ensure that existing funds are spent more effectively.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Big investors in Hungary think again: Changes in the
economic climate have upset company plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trail-blazing western companies which started to invest in Hungary at
the end of the 1980s are beginning to ponder what they should have done
differently.
Should they have committed less money? Less precipitately? In a different
location? Or maybe not made the investment at all?
Investment decisions made two, three or even four years ago, when Hungary
became the first east European country to open up to western companies, are
now coming to fruition. But the economic climate has changed dramatically.
Multinationals led by such US companies as General Electric, General Motors,
Guardian Glass and Ford are finding that many earlier assumptions no longer
hold good.
No one anticipated the sharpness and duration of the fall in Hungarian
domestic demand, or realised the protected domestic market would be so
quickly liberalised.
Nor did anyone predict that east European trading links would disintegrate
so rapidly, and that exports to the west would come under pressure from
rising local costs and the relative strength of the forint, the Hungarian
currency.
Take the car manufacturers. GM, Ford and Japan's Suzuki Motor established a
presence in Hungary on the understanding that their investments would earn
the country hard currency and so win access to the protected local market.
General Motors, for instance, combined production of both cars and
components at its green-field DM400m (Pounds 143.3m) plant in Szentgotthard
which opened this year.
It hoped exports of car engines produced there would meet the foreign
exchange costs of imports of kits for local assembly of Astra models for the
Hungarian market.
But then the Hungarian government moved unexpectedly quickly to liberalise
car imports. GM Hungary has a one-shift capacity to produce a paltry 15,000
cars a year at Szentgotthard. But managers admit it would be much more
efficient to make the cars at larger western plants and import them into
Hungary.
Moreover, as a result of the Hungarian recession and import competition,
only about 7,000 Astras are likely to be sold in Hungary this year. GM is in
the awkward position of importing kits and assembling them in Hungary at
high cost, only to re-export the completed cars back to western Europe.
Depressed demand  - both in Hungary and in the rest of central and eastern
Europe  - is also posing problems for Guardian Glass, the privately-owned US
glass maker.
Guardian, one of the first large investors in eastern Europe, agreed a
Dollars 120m (Pounds 61m) joint venture in Oroshaza in the south-east of
Hungary. The decision was motivated by the promise of a large east European
market for float glass, together by the cheapness of energy imports from the
Soviet Union. Neither assumption has been borne out.
Guardian is managing to sell only 25 per cent of its output in eastern
Europe, half what it planned. Instead it has to export to Italy and other
west European countries. Transport from Hungary costs much more than for
deliveries from Guardian's Luxembourg plant, outweighing Oroshaza's
advantage of lower labour costs.
'If the company knew that all this would happen, Guardian would still invest
 - I think  - in Hungary; but not necessarily in this part of Hungary,' says
Mr Gabriel Pataky, finance director of Guardian in Hungary. Mindful of the
difficulty of transporting bulky glass from the south-east of Hungary to
western Europe, he concludes: 'It would have been a green-field site
somewhere further west.'
General Electric, by contrast, always expected most light-bulb production
from its GE-Tungsram joint venture to be exported to western Europe.
But GE has seen unpleasant surprises in other areas. Hungary's tight
monetary policy and relatively strong currency have unhinged some of GE's
assumptions. Although the forint has been devalued, it has been by less than
the inflation rate, which peaked at a rate of 38 per cent last year  -
leading to a revaluation in real terms.
'If I had known that we would have a devaluation-inflation gap of this
magnitude, we probably would have invested less,' confesses Mr George Varga,
chief executive officer of GE-Tungsram.
Another reason for dashed expectations has been the worldwide economic
slowdown. Ford's components facility at Szekesfehervar, which exports all
its output, has suffered from the decline in the west European car market.
With hindsight, the company says it would have curbed its Dollars 83m
initial investment.
The recession also adds to pressure from another direction. With global
earnings faltering, multinationals' shareholders are increasingly impatient
for Hungarian operations to make a contribution. 'There is a demand for
immediate results,' says Mr David Fuller, managing partner of Price
Waterhouse Budapest, a branch of the international accountants.
For some investors, the problems have been insurmountable. German metal
companies Korf and Metallgesellschaft pulled out of a joint venture at
Hungary's Ozd steelworks last year after heavy losses.
Most western companies, however, maintain confidence in the future.
The quality of the local workforce has been better than expected, and
investors retain what Mr Fuller calls an 'inner belief' that Hungary will
develop into a valuable new market place. A golden future, however, is
further down the trail than they first thought.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Australians win gold mines access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL Australian company said yesterday it had won the first foreign stake
in Russia's closely guarded gold mining industry by paying Dollars 200m
(Pounds 101.5m) for a deal giving it access to the country's largest proven
hardrock deposit.
Star Technology Systems said a joint stock company in which it holds 31 per
cent would have exclusive rights to develop Sukhoi Log, a prime mine with
unexploited reserves estimated at 1bn tonnes of gold ore (with a yield of
2.5 grammes per tonne). Feasibility work on development is expected to start
next year.
Lenzoloto, the state-owned enterprise which holds the licence to Sukhoi Log,
produced 10 tonnes from its existing alluvial mining operations last year.
But it has sought a foreign investor to improve its efficiency and start
work on Sukhoi Log, which could yield 20 tonnes a year by 1996.
The registration of the new joint stock company, also called Lenzoloto,
ended a battle with and among Russian authorities over whether Sukhoi Log
should be offered to other potential bidders.
The deal is an impressive coup as standing behind Star is a tiny listed
company called Central Mining Corporation, which made losses in 1989, 1990,
and 1991 and was suspended from the Australian stock exchange from November
to April this year.
It is also a victory for Lenzoloto, which encountered fierce resistance to
bringing in foreigners of its own choice from Russia's collapsing state gold
mining monopoly structure, Rossalmazzoloto.

FT  14 SEP 92 / People: Philip Chappell decides to retire from AITC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Chappell, a well known merchant banker who has tried his hand at
several different jobs, is to retire as director of the Association of
Investment Trust Companies in November, after several months of serious
illness.
Chappell, 63, joined Morgan Grenfell in 1954 and spent over 20 years as a
director. He was chairman of the National Ports Council between 1971 and
1977 and in 1980 spent a brief spell as chairman of computer makers ICL.
However, over the past few years he has switched from being a merchant
banker to being a tireless campaigner for popular capitalism.
His main interests have been wider share ownership, personal pensions and of
course investment trusts, having joined the AITC in 1986.
Chappell says he has been gradually recovering over the past few months and
is still bubbling with ideas for the savings market. The chances are that he
will continue as a regular correspondent on the FT's letters page.
Although Chappell only worked at the AITC around two days a week, the
association is set to advertise for a full-time director general to replace
him.

FT  14 SEP 92 / People: Runners in the Black Horse's final furlong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The race to find a successor to Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman is
moving into its final furlong. The two front contenders - David Pirrie
(right) and Paul Brown - are to swap jobs in a move which will be seen by
many as a final testing ground for Lloyds' next chief executive.
The top management team of Lloyds Bank, the most successful of Britain's
clearing banks, has been more stable than those of its rivals. However,
chairman Sir Jeremy Morse, who has headed the group since 1977, retires next
year and Brian Pitman, who has been chief executive since 1983, is already
past the bank's normal retirement age. It is expected that he will step down
in 1995.
Sir Robin Ibbs has already been tapped as Sir Jeremy's successor as
chairman, but there has been more uncertainty about Pitman's replacement.
Michael Hepher, the chairman of Lloyds Abbey Life, was an obvious candidate
but he was headhunted at the end of last year to be group managing director
of British Telecom.
Since John Davies, the deputy chief executive, and Alan Moore, director of
corporate banking, are both in their late 50s, analysts believe that either
Paul Brown, 50, or David Pirrie, 53, are front-runners to take over from
Pitman.
Lloyds is using the opportunity of Frank Jones' retirement as director of
international banking on November 16 to reshuffle their portfolios. David
Pirrie, who joined the Bank of London and South America as a trainee in
1959, will become director of both international banking and private banking
and financial services. Paul Brown, who is currently director of private
banking and financial services, will take over Pirrie's old job as director
of UK retail banking.
Pirrie, who joined the board in 1989, is the more senior. But some analysts
believe that Brown, who joined Lloyds Bank Europe in 1960, has the edge
since he is three years younger and is being put in charge of one of the
weak spots of the group. If he can turn round the group's retail banking
business, which employs two thirds of the staff, then he might well assure
himself of promotion to the top job.

FT  14 SEP 92 / People: Hewlett joins Lonrho board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Hewlett, chief executive of Lonrho's Mozambique agricultural, mining,
hotel and motor distribution interests, and an associate director of the
international trading group since January 1991, has been promoted to the
main board.
A graduate of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, 45-year-old
Hewlett joined Lonrho in 1979. He worked as general manager of the Kalangwa
Estates which, according to Lonrho, is its 'showpiece' farm in Zambia.
At a time when the east Germans and Romanians no longer regarded Mozambique
as a viable business proposition, Hewlett, who until then had spent his
working life in Zambia, attracted attention by moving there and establishing
four estates to grow cotton and food stuffs. Part of the job entailed
recruiting a security force some 1,500 men strong.
Hewlett has also presumably had several recent visits from Lonrho chief
executive Tiny Rowland, who has played a part in negotiating the peace
agreement in Mozambique.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Shadow ministers challenge Smith on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH faced a direct challenge to his authority as Labour leader
yesterday when three members of the shadow cabinet joined forces to attack
his strategy over Maastricht and the pound.
The challenge, on the eve of today's meeting of the national executive, came
as Mr John Major faced pressure to announce a decision on the nomination of
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former opposition leader, as Britain's second
commissioner in Brussels.
The row will overshadow the launch at the NEC of Mr Smith's first formal
statement of his priorities for Labour in a policy document entitled Agenda
for Change.
The document, setting out a series of principles to guide the party's
policymaking, calls for a determined effort to win back the support of the
'aspiring' classes whose fear of a Labour victory cost it the last election.
The aim is to rid the opposition of its image as the 'party of the producer'
and cast it instead in the role of the champion of the individual against
all vested interests.
Divisions within the shadow cabinet over Mr Smith's support for the
Maastricht treaty and his refusal to back a devaluation of the pound have
been simmering for more than a week. But yesterday they turned into outright
rebellion.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary and the most outspoken critic
of official policy, was joined by Mr Michael Meacher and Mr David Blunkett
in public calls for a referendum on the treaty.
Mr Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, and Mr Meacher, the overseas aid
spokesman, said they would table amendments on the issues to the policy
document which the NEC will discuss in advance of the party's Blackpool
conference later this month.
In a blunt challenge to Mr Smith, Mr Blunkett told BBC radio that: 'The
unity expected of us in the shadow cabinet should not be the unity of the
graveyard'.
Mr Meacher said that the constitutional issues raised by the treaty on
European union were such that they could only be decided after 'direct
consultation' with the British people.
The three rebels believe that they are reflecting growing disillusion within
the rank and file of the Labour party with Mr Smith's apparent refusal to
attack the government's economic and European strategies.
Mr Gould signalled yesterday that he was not planning to resign on the
issue. But some of his colleagues believe that the shadow heritage secretary
 -who turned down the more important health and education portfolios in July
 -is ready to force Mr Smith effectively to sack him.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Ministers face spending squeeze to meet targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury will tell cabinet ministers this week that there must be sharp
cuts in departmental spending programmes if the government is to meet its
stated targets for public expenditure in the next financial year.
Negotiations over the government's 1993-94 spending programme will start at
a meeting of the cabinet's public expenditure committee, which convenes for
the first time on Thursday.
Ministers have already said they will keep to the Pounds 244.5bn planning
total for government expenditure set out in the Budget in March. But since
then the economy has grown more slowly than the government expected, and the
rise in the numbers claiming unemployment benefit will take a larger share
of the public purse than forecast.
Thursday's meeting, to be chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will
be held against a background of rising concern about the immediate prospects
for the UK economy.
Many UK economic indicators are due out this week, all of them likely to
underline the weakness in the UK economy. Ministers are bracing themselves
for another sharp rise in unemployment when the latest statistics are
released on Thursday. July's industrial production figure, due out on the
same day, is likely to show a modest upturn at best.
As ministers prepare to divide up the public expenditure planning total for
next year, they have been told to expect a tough squeeze on public sector
pay. A final pay norm has not yet been set, but the expected fall in UK
inflation over the next year could mean average public sector pay rises are
about 2 per cent in 1993-94.
A severe squeeze on public investment in housing, roads, the inner cities
and other construction projects is also expected.
Some of the projects that have been under Treasury review - including a
three-year programme to invest Pounds 7bn in motorways and trunk roads -
appear-ed as pledges in the Conservative manifesto. But the Treasury is
arguing that nothing can be immune from scrutiny because of the threat to
the economy posed by soaring public debt.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Cadbury plan for monitoring directors may be changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO most significant proposals in a report aimed at improving the
performance of corporate boards in Britain may have to be changed, said Sir
Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the committee which drew up the recommendations.
The proposals which face alteration would oblige non-executive directors to
monitor the activities of executives, and introduce an enforcement
mechanism.
The draft report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate
Governance, published in May, suggested a voluntary code of practice for
boards of directors.
It also urged a new Stock Exchange listing requirement compelling companies
to disclose the extent to which they complied with the code, and to explain
where they did not.
Sir Adrian said more than 200 comments had been received since the draft
report was published. Almost all supported its broad principles though
several recommendations had been criticised.
'There is a great issue about the weight of the role assigned to
non-executives. The question they raise is whether we would be dividing the
board,' Sir Adrian said. 'We have used the word 'monitor'. People have
questioned that.'
He also said some respondents had objected to proposals that the
non-executive chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees should
answer shareholder questions at annual general meetings.
While he stopped short of saying the committee would have to alter its
original proposals, he said those sections of the report would have to be
reviewed closely. A final version of the report is expected to be released
in early November.
The Confederation of British Industry, in particular, has objected to the
enforcement proposals in the Cadbury report, saying they could lead to
unnecessary bureaucracy. Sir Adrian said he believed obtaining the CBI's
support for the report would be critical to its success because its members
had to carry out its proposals voluntarily. 'We need the support of the
CBI,' he said.

FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the mooted five-year deal to supply coal to the UK power generators is
eventually signed, the electricity and coal industries will be free of a
large measure of uncertainty.
The electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, will have secured
around a half of their requirements at attractive prices. And while the
direct cost savings of the deal will be passed on to consumers, the
generators will be able to buy more cheap coal from abroad. With the
additional benefits of separate rationalisation programmes, profits should
move ahead strongly over the next few years despite falling electricity
sales.
This might be taken to support the case for valuing the generators on their
earnings prospects, rather than by the traditional yield measure used for
regulated utilities. Given that annual earnings growth might be 5-10 per
cent until 1997, and that the companies have dividend cover of over three
times, an earnings multiple only 60 per cent of the market average looks
much too low. However, the regulatory risk has not disappeared: the
generators may yet be sucked into a war of attrition with the authorities
like that which has befallen British Gas.
On that basis, a yield below the market average would leave the companies
looking vulnerable were it not for a dividend cover which allows scope for a
generous increase in payouts. At the very least the generators should thus
be able to regard their recent outperformance as a move to a new trading
range.
The regional electricity companies should also benefit from the deal. Lower
electricity prices will ease the regulatory pressure, but given their recent
strong performance, the shares may have already discounted that.
Poor British Coal can hardly share the optimism. The government seems to
have decided that even a five-year deal which subsidised coal would not be
enough to persuade the market to accept the company as it currently stands.
So British Coal would be forced to face the harsh capacity realities sooner
rather than later.

FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK food retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recession came late to Britain's food retailers. In part that reflects the
power that the large supermarket groups wield. They have managed to maintain
their margins by squeezing their suppliers hard, as the pain in the food
manufacturing sector amply demonstrates. Good stock control and a tight grip
on staff costs have also helped the giants - Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway -
preserve their position at the expense of smaller firms.
But there are limits to that strategy. Excluding the effects of new stores
and Sunday opening, sales volumes are disappointing.
Tesco, which reports interim figures next week, seems to be suffering more
than Sainsbury, the market leader, or Safeway. This may partly be because it
sells more goods vulnerable to price wars, such as petrol and children's
clothing, and its customers may have suffered more in the recession. But in
trying to control costs, Tesco has withdrawn expensive facilities such as
bakeries from some stores, and that may put some high-spending customers
off.
Given the enormous capital expenditure programme, and the rights issue which
helped fund it, investors can be forgiven for wondering whether they will
see an appropriate return. This is all the more so since its expensive
developments are not depreciated and are of questionable value for
alternative uses.
Much of that concern has been reflected in the market rating of Tesco this
year. But with Sainsbury benefiting as Tesco falters, it may be right to
stick with the market leader.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Pro-democracy parties win majority in Thai election
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARTIES opposed to military interference in Thai politics appeared to have
won a slim parliamentary majority in yesterday's general election in
Thailand, four months after troops killed at least 50 pro-democracy
demonstrators in Bangkok.
With most of the votes counted, Mr Chuan Leekpai, leader of the Democrat
Party, was preparing an attempt to form a coalition government. His party
won about 80 seats, the largest bloc in the 360-seat House of
Representatives.
With the support of three other members of a loose pro-democracy alliance -
the New Aspiration Party, Palang Dharma (Moral Force) and Solidarity - Mr
Chuan is expected to form a government with at least 185 seats.
One or more of the other parties may be co-opted to strengthen the
coalition, but Mr Chuan has promised to exclude politicians accused of
corruption from his cabinet.
Businessmen and parliamentary colleagues regard 54-year-old Mr Chuan as a
responsible if uninspiring politician.
He has won his seat in the Democrat stronghold of Trang in southern Thailand
nine times in a row, and has served in various governments as minister of
agriculture, education, commerce, justice and health.
Mr Chuan, who heads Thailand's oldest party, won widespread support in the
election because he opposed the military during the demonstrations in May
but attempted to resolve the conflict in parliament rather than on the
streets.
Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist known as Mr Clean who heads Palang
Dharma and led the street protests, lost support to the Democrats in his
Bangkok stronghold but made gains elsewhere.
Politicians sympathetic to the military did well in rural areas, and Chart
Thai (Thai Nation) won about 72 seats, the second highest number, followed
by about 60 for the Chart Pattana (National Development) party of the former
prime minister, Mr Chatichai Choonhavan.
In spite of the strong showing of the pro-democracy parties yesterday, the
campaign was marred by the widespread corruption and violence which have
long been a feature of Thai elections.
At least seven canvassers were shot dead by political rivals on the eve of
the poll, and wealthy politicians paid out what Pollwatch, the independent
monitoring agency, described as 'a huge sum of money' to buy votes in the
poorer rural areas.
Thai politics have been shaken up since a group of pro-military parties won
the previous election in March this year.
Thousands of demonstrators, many of them middle-class professionals, took to
the streets of Bangkok in May to protest against the military.

<TEXT>
Markets thrive on rumour, not least in the so-called close season ahead of
results when companies are not permitted to state their case. But according
to the chief executive of one Footsie company last week some of the wilder
stories of the last few weeks - particularly in the food sector - have
become a serious drain on management time and company morale. Traders are
obviously desperate to drum up business - by any means - but it is also the
case that the UK economy appeared to take another dip earlier in the summer
just as boards were going into purdah. Investors should beware, but vicious
tongues are merely one reflection of the market's inability to find an
appropriate level.

FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Swiss Franc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is by now almost axiomatic to blame at least part of the recent turmoil
in currency markets on doubts over the ability of European currencies to
keep up with the D-Mark. One currency which has done even better in recent
months, however, is the Swiss franc. Its rise against the D-Mark of roughly
5 per cent since May is all the more remarkable in that Switzerland has also
managed to undercut German interest rates. These are normally considered a
floor for other European countries whether members of the ERM or not. But
three-month Eurofranc rates are a full 2 percentage points below their
D-Mark equivalent.
Doubtless it helps that, in contrast to Germany, Swiss money supply growth
is now within reasonable bounds while inflation rates in the two countries
are roughly level-pegging. But it would be rash to ascribe the franc's
strength purely to the skills of the Swiss National Bank. Though hard to
quantify, the Swiss currency once again seems to be playing something of a
refuge role. It would be unlikely if Italy's economic crisis, which was
moving to a head last night, had not provoked some revival of the
traditional outflow of capital to its northern neighbour.
At a more general level, the franc's performance can be seen as the mirror
image of other European currencies in the Maastricht debate over currency
union. The franc would be vulnerable were monetary union to proceed. It
would be perceived as a small currency subject to speculative flows.
Conversely it has some attractions as a safe haven if the Maastricht
exercise fails and bond markets around Europe decide to ditch the
convergence theory on interest rates. Investors cannot put all their money
in D-Marks. Japan and the US have drawbacks of their own. It is probably no
coincidence that the franc began to appreciate around the time of the Danish
referendum. Whether that continues may now depend on next Sunday's vote in
France as well as reactions to yesterday's realignment.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Deflationary effects of Japan's domestic difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus spells danger for the world economy, but not
for the reasons US politicians would have us believe. The surplus is a
product of the changed international pattern of Japanese capital flows that
has resulted from Japan's domestic financial problems. It is the
deflationary consequences of Japan's long-term capital surplus and
short-term capital deficit, rather than unfair competition from Japanese
companies, that should be worrying US and European policymakers.
Japan's current account surplus has been rising since 1990. Depressed
domestic demand for imports and a surprisingly robust export performance
have increased the surplus, in dollar terms, almost to its peak level of the
mid-1980s. The surplus, measured in Ecus, more than doubled between 1990 and
1991, as the table shows.
Yet while Japan's current account surplus looks familiar, the capital flows
which finance this surplus are very different. The balance of payments must,
by definition, balance: any surplus on the current account must be offset by
a deficit on the capital account. But today's capital flows take a different
form from five years ago, with different implications for the world economy.
Japanese capital provided the oil which smoothed world economic growth in
the second half of the 1980s. The flow of funds into Japan from its net
export earnings was offset by an outflow of long-term capital - foreign
direct investment, bonds and securities - as Japanese institutions responded
to low domestic interest rates and financial deregulation by expanding their
international portfolios. Japanese banks increased the value of their
international assets by 200 per cent between 1985 and 1990.
The outflow of long-term capital from Japanese investors and companies
exceeded the earnings on the current account, as the upper chart shows. The
balance of payments balanced because the short-term capital account was also
in surplus. Japanese banks used a portion of the short-term foreign currency
deposits they obtained from international investors to fund their lending to
domestic Japanese companies. The rapid growth of Japanese business
investment was, in part, financed by a net short-term capital inflow.
The collapse of Japan's 'bubble' economy and the ensuing difficulties of the
financial sector have reversed these capital flows. As the current account
surplus began to rise, the long-term capital account also moved into surplus
in 1991, for the first time since 1980. Japanese investors have reduced
their international portfolios while foreign investors have increased their
holdings of Japanese equities. And the flow of Japanese foreign direct
investment has been sharply curtailed. Japanese FDI was Dollars 30.7bn in
1991, against Dollars 48bn in 1990.
The combined current and long-term capital account surplus since 1991 has
been matched by a short-term capital outflow. But this time the outflow has
had a contractionary, rather than expansionary, effect on world financial
markets. Japanese banks, burdened with non-performing domestic loans and
required to meet the Bank of International Settlements capital-asset ratios
by next year, have pulled in their horns.
The short-term capital outflow results from banks' efforts to reduce their
stocks of foreign liabilities, as the lower charts show. The latest BIS
annual report showed that the decline in gross international banking
activity last year was fully accounted for by a 9 per cent contraction in
Japanese banks' balance sheets.
The global supply of new credit has effectively ground to a halt as a
result. But the problems of Japanese banks are far from over, despite the
recent stock market rally. Until their bad debts are cleared from their
balance sheets, they are likely to remain cautious about new lending. Throw
in the effects of heavy personal and commercial sector debts in the US and
UK, and high interest rates across Europe, and the outlook for the world
economy remains decidedly deflationary.

<TEXT>
AT LEAST 1,700 people are feared to have died in floods and torrential rains
which hit parts of Pakistan towards the end of last week, writes Farhan
Bokhari in Islamabad.
There are also fresh fears that the country's economy may suffer due to
widespread damaged caused to the cotton crop, regarded as the agricultural
backbone. Experts were yesterday continuing their assessment of the crop
after Mr Majid Malik, the agriculture minister, said as much as half the
cotton in Sindh had been destroyed. Output is also expected to fall in the
cotton fields of Punjab.
According to weekend estimates by the government of the semi-autonomous
Northern Kashmir state, at least 1,000 are feared dead in that area alone,
in addition to another 700 in parts of Pakistan's Punjab province.
Road networks are gradually being restored, and relief camps set up.

GOVERNOR Bill Clinton (above left) launched at the weekend a national voter
registration drive, to be led by the Rev Jesse Jackson (above right), in an
attempt to add thousands of black voters to the rolls in the hope they will
support the Democratic presidential ticket, AP reports from Washington.
But questions remain as to whether relations between the men have warmed in
the wake of Mr Jackson's complaints of a 'push-off' strategy by the Clinton
campaign. Mr Jackson sought to add the first unregistered voters to the roll
during the seventh annual Black Family Reunion in Washington, saying the
vote 'has so much power'.
The event is sponsored by the National Council of Negro Women to draw
attention to problems suffered by black families.
''Clinton campaign workers said the registration drive would include 300
events in 30 cities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian economy minister is to demand explanations from the heads of
the country's two largest state banks over allegations that they are using
government funds to persuade congressmen to vote against the impeachment of
President Fernando Collor.
The move follows publication in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper of a list
of 190 congressmen who were said to have been promised, or already given,
funds for projects such as roads, bridges, dams and hospitals in their areas
to help elect their candidates in next month's municipal elections. In
return they are expected to support Mr Collor.
The money is allegedly being released by Mr Lafaiette Coutinho, president of
Banco do Brasil, Mr Alvaro Mendonca, head of the Federal Savings Bank, and
Mr Ricardo Fiuza, the social action minister and political co-ordinator.
Known as the 'shock brigade', these three are now Mr Collor's main political
advisers.
Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, said he did not believe
the charges but would today call in the two bank presidents to discuss it.
Mr Moreira is anxious to prevent spending which could compromise his
austerity policy, particularly as inflation is increasing.
There is no doubt, however, that a flurry of projects is suddenly being
approved. In Friday's official Daily Gazette alone there were four pages of
new projects by the Social Action Ministry totalling Cr10.6bn (Pounds 1m).

FT  14 SEP 92 / Labor pins its election hopes on Kiwi-bashing: The
Australian party is prepared to go to extreme lengths to fend off the
prospect of political oblivion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION viewers in Victoria, Australia's second most populous state, have
been entertained recently by a series of Labor party advertisements showing
disgruntled New Zealanders complaining about their conservative government.
The campaign provoked an exchange of insults between Melbourne and
Wellington, including a graceless jibe by Mr Jim Bolger, the New Zealand
prime minister, about the physical appearance of Mrs Joan Kirner, Victoria's
Labor premier.
It was an unedifying incident which is probably best forgotten, except that
it illustrates the lengths to which Labor is prepared to go to fend off the
looming prospect of virtual political oblivion.
Labor has been the dominant force in Australian politics since the defeat of
Mr Malcolm Fraser's tired and ineffectual conservative coalition by Mr Bob
Hawke in 1983.
Mr Hawke, together with Mr Paul Keating, then deputy prime minister, and
state leaders such as Mr Neville Wran in New South Wales, Mr John Cain in
Victoria, Mr John Bannon in South Australia and Mr Brian Burke in Western
Australia (WA), gave Labor a modern, technocratic image at odds with its
class-based past.
For a while it looked as though Labor had emerged as Australia's natural
party of government, especially when the conservative Liberal and National
parties began to fragment in the face of personal and ideological tensions.
There were big differences between the style and policies of the various
Labor leaders. Mr Hawke's generally free-market and deregulatory approach
contrasted sharply, for example, with the interventionist policies pursued
by Mr Cain.
Nevertheless, the Labor vote was swollen almost everywhere by the economic
boom which swept the country between 1983 and 1990. By the end of the decade
the party was in power in Canberra and in every state except New South
Wales.
Two years into the 1990s, every one of Labor's big names of the 1980s has
retired in the face of public disapprobation, with the sole exception of Mr
Keating, who forced Mr Hawke aside after a messy leadership struggle in
December.
Since 1990 Labor has faced an election only in the small island state of
Tasmania, where it was defeated by the Liberals. But the electoral cycle is
gathering pace, and the party faces the prospect of further defeats in
Canberra and three other states over the next 18 months.
Much of the decline has been caused by regional issues, notably poor
economic management which has forced Victoria and South Australia to bail
out failed state-owned financial institutions, and a long-running scandal in
Western Australia over allegedly corrupt links between ministers and local
businessmen. Thanks to good electoral management, the first test will come
this Saturday in Queensland, where Labor has a good chance of retaining the
power it won in 1988.
However, while the Queensland poll will be good for Labor morale, the likely
victory will be based on local issues with little relevance elsewhere  -
mainly continued repugnance at the corruption of the previous National party
government of Sir Jo Bjelke-Petersen.
A more reliable guide to national political sentiment will come on October
3, when Mrs Kirner's Victorian Labor government goes to the polls in an
election it has almost no chance of winning.
If Labor's unpopularity was based solely on state issues, the federal
government would have little to worry about, since Australian voters
frequently switch between parties at federal and state elections.
But the opinion polls show that voters are also holding the federal
government responsible for a recession and weak recovery which has increased
unemployment to more than 11 per cent since the economy began to slow in
1989.
Mr Keating's strategy has been to pump-prime the economy through a series of
economic packages, while trying to divert attention from economic issues
through campaigns to change the flag and abolish the monarchy.
Meanwhile, the conservative coalition has been revitalised under the
leadership of Mr John Hewson, the Liberal leader, who has put forward a
comprehensive plan to shake up Australian industry through labour market
reform and free trade.
Perhaps unwisely, Mr Hewson has let it be known that he admires the economic
transformation wrought by successive New Zealand governments, which have
substantially improved competitiveness by liberalising the capital and
labour markets, squeezing out inflation and abandoning protective tariffs
and subsidies.
In the short term, however, the more obvious effects of change in New
Zealand have been a lengthy recession and social dislocation caused by
privatisation and government spending cuts.
It is this aspect of the New Zealand experience which is providing
ammunition for Labor in Victoria, and for federal leaders such as Senator
Peter Cook, the employment minister, who recently suggested that Wellington
was creating an economic under-class which would subsequently flee to
Australia.
The strategy has the dual advantage for Labor of presenting the
conservatives as free-market demagogues while also playing to the widespread
Australian prejudice against New Zealanders.
Kiwi-bashing is an old sport among Australians, some of whom find
disparaging their closest cousins a useful element in the national struggle
to define a distinctive post-colonial identity. However, in the absence of a
rapid improvement in the economy, and a consequent decline in unemployment,
it is unlikely to save Labor from the consequences of its own mismanagement.
Bashing the Kiwis may also be a more risky strategy than Labor leaders
think. The signs are that New Zealand is achieving a return to
non-inflationary growth. By the middle of next year, when the next federal
election must be held, that could be a severe embarrassment for Mr Keating.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Peruvian guerrilla chief captured: Police raids in the
capital net leaders of hardline Shining Path
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Abimael Guzman Reynoso, leader of Peru's hardline Sendero Luminoso
(Shining Path) guerrilla group, has been captured in Lima.
Police raids on two houses in prosperous suburbs netted Mr Guzman, 57, and
half a dozen key members of Sendero's powerful central committee.
Sendero has waged 12 years of political warfare, which has claimed more than
25,000 Peruvian lives and cost the impoverished nation some Dollars 20bn
(Pounds 10.1bn), roughly equivalent to its total foreign debt.
Analysts estimate Sendero's fighting strength to be in the region of 5,000,
but militants and committed supporters may total another 100,000. It is too
early to predict whether the capture of Mr Guzman will prove a crushing blow
to Sendero.
The life of Mr Guzman  - 'Presidente Gonzalo' or 'the fourth sword of the
revolution' to his followers  - had assumed almost mythical qualities. A
philosophy professor in the impoverished central Andean town of Ayacucho in
the 1960s, he built up Sendero initially among university students and
peasants. Its blend of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism overlaid with
traditional Andean culture and beliefs captured support among the
marginalised.
Since Sendero emerged into the national arena in 1980, burning ballot boxes
in the village of Chuschi in Ayacucho province, it has aimed at overthrowing
what it perceives as a corrupt and inept state.
In the past two years the violence which had previously been concentrated in
the more remote areas of Peru has come to the capital. Sendero infiltrated
many popular organisations in Lima, assassinating any local leader who
resisted. In July a wave of car bombs rocked its commercial and residential
zones.
Until now there had been only scant glimpses of Mr Guzman. He was detained
in 1979, accused of helping organise a general strike, but was released. In
1988 he gave to Sendero's newspaper a 40,000-word interview constituting the
most coherent available exposition of 'Gonzalo thought'.
Less than two years ago a videotape captured in a police raid gave Peruvians
a rare treat  - Mr Guzman was filmed drinking and dancing to the music of
Zorba the Greek with close collaborators, all dressed in Chinese-style
uniform tunics.
Mr Guzman's capture late on Saturday night was attributed to five months of
patient observation by Dincote, Peru's counter-terrorist police. His arrest,
along with high-level members of his organisation, will boost the morale of
the security forces who have, particularly in the past four months, been
targeted with a vehemence unusual even for Sendero.

LAWYERS for Mr Oung Ta-ming, a Taiwanese textile tycoon, renewed efforts to
obtain his release from jail at the weekend amid fears that his detention
could have serious repercussions on the stock market, Reuter reports from
Taipei.
Mr Oung, whose Hualon group is one of the largest in the market, was
arrested on Thursday for failing to make scheduled court appearances on
charges of involvement in a SDollars 22m (Pounds 6.9m) stock scandal, the
island's biggest.
The Taipei District Court, rejecting claims that he was too sick to stand
trial, on Friday ordered him detained without bail, citing the possibility
of him fleeing abroad. Mr Oung's lawyers petitioned the court again on
Saturday to release him on bail saying his health was deteriorating.
Newspapers reported that the court would consider the petition today when it
reopened after the Mid-Autumn Festival public holidays.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading Article: ERM adjusts to the strain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK may not be a long time in politics, but it is in the foreign exchange
markets. Just over a week ago, at their meeting in Bath, European Community
finance ministers announced their opposition to realignment. Now they have
had to concede one. In Bath they also made loud calls for lower German
interest rates. Now they have obtained them. Thus the 7 per cent devaluation
of the Italian lira, combined with the Bundesbank's commitment to reduce
German interest rates today, looks a sensible compromise. It is also the
least that could have been done. Whether it proves enough depends on
decisions still to be announced.
That the authors of the volte face were Germany and Italy is not surprising,
since these countries are probably the most relaxed about parity
adjustments. Nevertheless, the deal is potentially dangerous, especially for
Italy. Devaluation was probably unavoidable when short-term rates of
interest had been driven to 15 per cent and the country may have lost more
than half its reserves since the beginning of the summer. But devaluation
will do little for economic growth in the short term and may not permit
lower interest rates either.
Licking their wounds at the loss they have just suffered as a result of the
devaluation, creditors of the Italian state are likely to baulk at annual
increases in their outstanding loans of 10 per cent of gross domestic
product, or more. The Italian parliament must give Prime Minister Giuliano
Amato emergency powers to impose budget stringency. If it refuses, it will
have sown the wind. Italy will then reap the inflationary whirlwind.
Credibility fears
Germany too faces new dangers. For the ERM as a whole, much depends on
whether the interest rate reduction apparently promised by the Bundesbank
turns out to be notional, or substantial, and whether it looks like being
the first of a series, or an isolated event. For countries such as the UK,
or even France, significantly less pressure on parities demands the prospect
of substantial and sustained cuts in German interest rates. But such cuts
might damage the Bundesbank.
The German central bank was evidently terrified of continuing the already
costly short term intervention in support of the lira. But if the price it
pays for lira realignment is premature cuts in domestic interest rates, its
credibility could be impaired, especially after its recent reaffirmation of
domestic monetary targeting.
Such a weakening of the Bundesbank is in nobody's long run interests. Should
German interest rate reductions be large, therefore, it will be still more
imperative for the German government to make a serious - not, as now,
largely fictitious - effort to limit the growing indebtedness of the German
state.
Boost to treaty
The French government is naturally delighted at the prospect of lower German
interest rates and hopes for lower French rates too. Less than a week before
the referendum on the Maastricht treaty, such reductions might well tip the
electoral scales. Even if French interest rates cannot be reduced at once,
the government will be able to present the helpful stance of the Germans as
an indication of the value of European co-operation, while warning that such
cooperation would be threatened by a 'non'.
If the scale and presentation of the German interest rate reduction is
important for France, it is vital for the UK. First the floating of the
Finnish markka, then the pressure on the Swedish krona and now, in the heart
of the ERM, the parity of the lira is changed. The pound is likely to be
next in the firing line. Should the German interest rate cut appear to be a
token, pressure to raise UK interest rates, maybe sharply, could be severe.
Especially with the Conservative party conference coming up soon, the
government is bound to find the possibility of higher interest rates
horrifying. But now that markets have been reminded that the ERM is a system
of fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates, they are likely to draw the
obvious conclusion for other currencies.
The immediate UK problem is the level of interest rates, not the exchange
rate against the D-Mark. But a small parity adjustment like that of Italy is
most unlikely to help reduce interest rates. A government determined to stay
in the ERM will have to do what is necessary, while hoping that what the
Bundesbank does proves enough to save it from the higher interest rates it
dreads.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Personal View: Crunch for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MUELLBAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is increasingly apparent that the emperors of UK economic policy have no
clothes. The commitment to keep sterling within an ex-change rate mechanism
(ERM) band centred on DM 2.95 to the pound is unsustainable. The UK joined
the ERM at a rate which observers at the Bundesbank at the time regarded as
overvalued by between 10 and 15 per cent. They were right.
There are at least four arguments for sterling's realignment.
Various indices of competitiveness suggest the pound is overvalued;
the traded goods sector's reduced capacity;
the trade deficit;
and depleted net foreign assets.
On measures of manufacturing competitiveness, the graph shows UK relative
producer prices from 1964 to 1991; the comparison with Italy is pertinent
because the lira is widely seen as overvalued. Some observers ignore the
evidence for the period before 1980 to argue that the UK was more
competitive in 1991 than in 1981. In fact, since 1979 (apart from a brief
episode in 1986-87), UK competitiveness has been substantially worse than in
the previous 15 years.
The second argument concerns production capacity. Here the comparison with
Italy is instructive. Compared with the UK, Italy enjoyed a relatively
stable and favourable competitive position between 1977 and 1988. The effect
of improved competitiveness on output and capacity in Italy is illustrated
by the 37 per cent rise in manufacturing output in 1979-89; in Britain
manufacturing output rose by 11 per cent over the same period.
The loss of capacity and job skills which is now occurring will raise
inflation when demand eventually improves. Econometric models, including the
Treasury's, omit this effect. Thus, such models take no account of the ways
a devaluation could in current circumstances raise output permanently and
cut inflation in the long run.
The third argument is that in spite of weak domestic demand stemming from
the consumer 'debt trap', the highest real interest rates on record and
falling real income and wealth, Britain imports more than it can sell
abroad.
Fourth, half a decade of trade deficits have run down Britain's
international wealth and its ability to finance further deficits.
The competitiveness of the UK in 1991 was about 20 per cent worse than the
1964-79 average. However, this does not imply that a 20 per cent fall in the
sterling index is required.
This is because, first, the temporary undervaluation of the dollar will
begin to correct itself when European interest rates fall; and second,
because the UK now has bigger net exports of oil and gas than it had in
1964-79, though levels are now declining compared with the 1980s.
On balance, sterling needs to fall to between DM 2.4 and DM 2.5 - the
biggest realignment in ERM history. Three years on, this is likely to leave
UK prices 2 1/2 to 3 per cent higher than they would have been. This, in
turn, would add less than 2 per cent to inflation in any year which, given
the declining trend in inflation, is tolerable.
For the UK the inflationary risks are minimal. Indeed the lack of
credibility of government policy is partly due to the ferocity of the
deflationary forces which are now operating.
The credibility of the UK government demands that any sterling realignment
be large enough to make negligible the risk of a further early devaluation
of the pound. My proposal for sterling's realignment meets this requirement.
The government's credibility is likely to be enhanced by moving to the
narrow band at the new exchange rate. Other steps such as increasing the
independence of the Bank of England and not extending mortgage interest tax
relief would also help.
The Italian lira also needs to fall against the D-Mark. Italy is not far
behind the UK in breaking the inflationary round but needs more teeth in the
emergency powers its new government is seeking to make a devaluation
successful.
For both the UK and Italy, a realignment within the ERM is safer than
floating their currencies, as the recent Scandinavian experience shows.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Brussels balloon flies into danger: The French referendum is
prompting EC officials to revise long-held assumptions about the Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubt is a rare commodity among the politicians and bureaucrats who run the
European Community in Brussels. Cocooned in a world of grand designs and
logical structures, they normally project a smooth self-confidence about the
role of the EC at the centre of Europe.
With the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty just six days away, this
confidence has been punctured. Whatever the outcome on Sunday, there is a
realisation among Eurocrats that they can no longer assume that the
development of the Community is an historic inevitability.
The national debate in France on Maastricht has been sobering for the entire
Community. For the first time since the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the French,
the traditional driving force behind European integration, have held a
debate on Europe - and it has been conducted on national terms.
Both supporters and opponents of the treaty have invoked the fear of German
hegemony to buttress their campaign, while President Francois Mitterrand's
statement that France would not support majority decisions by the Twelve on
important matters of foreign policy could have come straight out of the
mouth of Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
The French have rediscovered the allure of national sovereignty. This
Gaullist tendency was detectable in the closing phase of negotiations on
Maastricht last December when France pushed to vest more power in the
Council of Ministers, and it has grown. Last week Mr Mitterrand chose to
emphasise that the independent professionals who would run the European
central bank would be subject to the control of elected politicians in the
European Council. 'Either he dared not tell the French the truth,' says one
EC observer, 'or he simply distorted the treaty.'
On the other hand, last night's announcement of a European currency
realignment gave credence to Mr Mitterrand's view that politics will indeed
play a part in decision-making by the future European central bank. As part
of the lira devaluation in the European Monetary System, the Bundesbank is
expected to ease its tight monetary policy with a cut in its leading
interest rates today - a sign of the fierce political pressures acting on
even Europe's most independent central bank.
From Brussels' viewpoint, second French thoughts about Eurofederalism are
troubling. The shift coincides with evidence in other European countries -
Britain, Denmark, and most ominously, Germany - that popular enthusiasm for
Maastricht's path to political and monetary union, never strong, is
weakening. The Danish vote in June against Maastricht no longer looks like
an aberration. 'If there was a referendum in Germany tomorrow,' says one EC
official, 'it would fail.'
How has this sudden burst of Euroscepticism come about? One explanation is
public ignorance: the dense 250-page text is about as readable as a London
bus timetable. Even supporters of closer integration worry about this. Mr
Jacques Delors, who has threatened to resign as European Commission
president if Maastricht is rejected, constantly complains about the design
of the treaty while on the campaign trail in his native France.
A senior EC official describes the shock experienced in Brussels when a
spate of public opinion polls showed a majority in France against
Maastricht. It was, he says, as if the heads of government and civil
servants responsible for Maastricht had existed in a space bubble, too
remote to gauge the true sentiments of the people.
Coming down to earth has been a bruising experience. It has forced officials
and ministers to focus on the possibility of a French rejection. The great
fear is that the dynamic development of the Community will dissipate as
governments become paralysed by uncertainty about the EC's future.
Mr Delors launched the plan for monetary union with meticulous preparation,
but Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mitterrand added on the ill-defined
political union in response to the unforeseen collapse of the Soviet empire
and the resulting unification of Germany. Five years of steady economic
growth and the success of the single market project (1992) was enough to
persuade the true believers that the gamble could be pulled off; but the
costs of German unification - coupled with the economic slowdown on the
Continent - have made the enterprise appear much more fragile.
Yesterday's realignment, by preparing the ground for a fall in European
interest rates this week, is likely to have an important impact on the
outcome of the French vote. The chances of a Yes may have increased - but
the possibility of a No will still exercises the financial markets. French
rejection, says one senior EC observer, would mean that 'the timetable for a
single European currency by the end of the century is dead'.
The combination of the Bundesbank's interest rate cut and the lira
devaluation underlines the flexibility employed by European central banks
and their governments to keep alive the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Yet
the lira devaluation adds renewed emphasis to the question marks over
Italy's commitment to participation in the final stage of economic and
monetary union (Emu).
A French No would make the horse-trading among the Twelve, which lies at the
heart of the EC process, infinitely more complex. The Delors II package,
which would funnel billions to the poorer southern member states to bring
their living standards closer to those of the richer northern countries,
would be impossible to attain. The EC's plans for enlargement would also
risk being delayed.
Second, Maastricht's plans for 'political union' linked to a common European
foreign policy would appear even more remote. So too, the tentative vision
of a common European defence.
Yet the show would go on, albeit on a different course. Member states would
still continue the process of wider European co-operation. The consequences
of the single European market - the project which provides for the free
movement of goods, services, capital and people by the end of this year -
make this inevitable. The question is whether a weak EC would have the
energy to address neglected areas such as law enforcement and immigration.
Both these areas are assuming greater urgency in view of the continuing
refugee exodus from eastern Europe, so vividly demonstrated by the Rostock
riots.
A Yes vote in France would not resolve a broader question: Will the EC be
able to absorb the lessons provided by the French referendum and the
ratification process?
Much of the opposition to Maastricht is driven by fears about the
consequences of the internal market. In France, for example, farmers may
vote against Maastricht because they are angry over Common Agricultural
Policy, which reduces their financial aid. But in the coming months and
years, as the single market starts to embrace previously protected national
businesses such as telecommunications and public procurement, the scope for
conflict rises exponentially.
Arguments about Emu are inevitable. Maastricht's basic monetary compromise -
German agreement to give up the D-Mark in return for an independent central
bank - looks precarious. Last night's Bundesbank's apparent volte face on
interest rates in response to overwhelming political pressures may add to
suspicions among German monetarists that the European central bank will
indeed enjoy only limited independence. Fears in Germany that the Twelve
will try to dilute the strict convergence criteria required for Emu are
understandable. Even if Mr Kohl's coalition secures ratification in the
Bundestag and Bundesrat this year, both chambers are now demanding the right
to hold a 'vote of approval' before the EC can move to the final stage of
Emu.
The invocation of national German interest is viewed with sympathy in
Brussels. It underlines the present trend in Europe: an increase in the
assertiveness of national parliaments as the realisation dawns about
Maastricht's impact on national sovereignty.
In Britain, where the House of Commons has long debated the pros and cons of
Europe, if not the fine detail of EC legislation, this assertiveness is
viewed as healthy. In France and Germany, where national legislatures took
EC membership for granted as part of their country's post-second world war
rapprochement, it is a new phenomenon. And it demands a response, according
to Brussels officials.
Their answer is subsidiarity - the notion that the EC should exercise
restraint in its application of Community law and devolve power to members.
Mr Delors, often caricatured a power-grabbing centralist, has been pushing
for devolved power as far back as 1988. The problem is that in the absence
of concrete proposals few bureaucrats, particularly in the European
Commission, have paid much attention.
The result is a crisis of confidence in the Commission. Eurocrats complain
they have become a convenient flogging horse for politicians in the European
Council who wish to duck responsibility for unpopular decisions. They argue,
correctly, that the European Council - not the Commission - is the big
winner at Maastricht through the increased role for intergovernmental
co-operation outside of Community law.
Mr Major, Mr Mitterrand and Mr Delors have all made this point in the past
fortnight. Yet few have drawn the consequences. However, technocratic and
undemocratic the Commission may be, it pales by comparison with the
smoke-filled rooms in the Council. For the Council is not subject to serious
scrutiny either by the European Parliament, which has failed to establish
broad legitimacy, or the national legislatures which have for the most part
ignored European affairs.
How to make the Council and the Commission more accountable is one of the
great tests of the coming decade, says a senior EC official.
For the moment all eyes are on the French, and the Danes. It is far from
clear that a French Yes can salvage a treaty which remains hobbled by the
Danish vote and which requires unanimity to have the force of law. No one is
sure how the Danish question can be finessed.
If Maastricht fails, the EC will be a far weaker, less reliable, partner for
the US and other allies - a throwback to the 1970s when member states could
not even agree on a common response to the oil crisis. With momentous events
unfolding outside the EC's frontiers in Yugoslavia, eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, this is a distinctly uncomfortable prospect.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading Article: US tax wrangle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A country that suffers from a conspicuous shortage of savings and an
endemically weak current account, the US is oddly cavalier in its treatment
of the providers of foreign capital. Once again the US subsidiaries of
foreign multinationals are being called on to make a bigger contribution to
the US fiscal pot. As in the earlier battle over unitary taxes in the
mid-1980s, the international business community is justifiably enraged at
the manner in which the US is going about the job.
The chief bone of contention is the tax treatment of transfer prices at
which goods are shunted across national boundaries within the same group of
companies. In February the US Internal Revenue Service abandoned the
internationally accepted approach whereby transfer prices  - a chargeable
cost against taxable profit - were judged in accordance with the arm's
length principle. It decided instead to measure foreign-owned companies'
profit by reference to average profits in comparable domestic businesses.
This approach could now be given a legal basis as a result of a bill
sponsored by Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, and Mr Bill Gradison. Under the proposed legislation taxpayers
who have not already negotiated an agreement with the IRS on transfer
pricing would be required to obtain their own information about the average
profits of comparable businesses and to pay tax on that basis, rather than
on the basis of their own disclosed profits. For good measure the bill seeks
to introduce capital gains tax on the disposal of shares by foreign owners
of US companies - a measure that was dumped from the 1989 Budget
Reconciliation Act after clamorous international protest. Meanwhile,
Democratic presidential nominee Mr Bill Clinton proposes to raise
substantial revenues with his own assault on transfer pricing.
Foreign profits
It is not inconceivable that there is widespread abuse in the US over
transfer pricing. Certainly studies have tended to show that the level of
profitability in foreign owned companies has been significantly lower than
in domestically owned business. Yet it would be surprising if this were not
so. For much of the 1980s foreign direct investment into the US was growing
at more than 20 per cent a year. The profitability of the total stock of
foreign investment would thus have been heavily influenced by start-up costs
and the desire to invest in building market share. At the same time the
returns on the more aged stock of domestic assets would have been
overstated, relatively, through the impact of the historic cost accounting
convention on depreciation.
Nor is there any evidence that the US is a bigger loser from transfer
pricing abuses than, say, Britain, Germany or France. But that, of course,
misses the point, since the US is not chiefly concerned to address the
question of international tax avoidance. Mr Clinton, as with Mr Bush, is
simply anxious to seize any opportunity to raise revenue by the backdoor.
National paranoia
At the same time the Rostenkowski-Gradison bill is just one more instance of
the national paranoia about Japan and the associated urge to bite the hand
that provided the lion's share of the Dollars 1,000bn of foreign capital
that the US has imported since 1980.
As with the Structural Impediments Initiative, the US is seeking to have it
both ways. But this time, as well as violating tax treaty obligations, the
proposed legislation catches Europe in the cross-fire. European governments
can be relied on to lobby fiercely to mitigate the damage.
There is a clear need for the issue of transfer pricing to be addressed at
international level. To that end the OECD has already set up a task force
which will provide the data for a properly informed debate. In the meantime
US multinationals would do well to remind their friends in Washington that
the European response to the unitary tax wrangle was to introduce
legislation to permit retaliation. With so much at stake on both sides it
would make no sense to proceed with such an arbitrary approach to the
taxation of the profits of foreign companies in the US.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Bundesbank bows to external pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's agreement to cut its official interest rates today to
support the realignment within the European Monetary System was seen in
Germany last night as sensational and unprecedented.
It would appear to be the biggest concession made in the history of the bank
 - admitting the limitations of its independence, a legal position
guaranteed by the German constitution.
No commentators or official spokesmen were prepared to admit that the
interest rate cut would be automatic, and it seems likely to be fiercely
debated within the central bank's governing council.
Yet it also seems impossible to believe that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president, could agree
to an interest rate cut without being sure they could gain a majority in the
council.
The Bundesbank last night would only confirm that an extraordinary meeting
of the council would be held at 9am today. Spokesmen refused to speculate on
how big the expected cut in discount and Lombard rates would be.
The move reveals the quite extraordinary pressure, from within and outside
Germany, which the central bank has been under to relax its harsh monetary
policy  - because of implications for German economic growth, economic
recovery in Europe, and the wider international economy.
Hitherto, the Bundesbank directors have been adamant that their policy was
dictated solely by the need to curb monetary expansion in Germany, stabilise
inflation, and ensure the stability of the D-Mark.
Only last Thursday, Mr Otmar Issing, a leading member of the executive
council, insisted the bank would not be deflected by outside criticism from
its policy of pursuing firm monetary targets. The strategy was 'without any
convincing alternative'.
And yet the bank has been unable to ignore the turmoil in the currency
markets  - leading last night to the devaluation of the lira  - as, in part,
a consequence of its own high interest rate policy. The differential, above
all, with US interest rates has been a key element driving currency
speculation, aggravated by perceived differences in strength between EMS
members.
Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank, said the central bank's
move was a 'real sensation'. There was no previous example of such a move,
although there had been both political pressure, and great currency
turbulence, in the past. 'It is a 180 degree turn, very hard to understand,'
he said. 'It is incredible that the Bundesbank is ready to call an emergency
meeting.'
The argument in recent days, however, was that the central bank could no
longer conduct its policies as if in isolation from the rest of the European
and world economy  - and the currency markets have forced the point home.
Pressure for a realignment of the currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism
of the EMS had become well-nigh irresistible.
On the other hand, the German government had been against a revaluation on
the grounds that a stronger D-Mark would make any recovery of German exports
even more difficult.
Thus the bank must have come under concerted pressure in recent weeks not
just from other banks and finance ministers in Europe, but from the
government in Bonn.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, made his relief perfectly clear
last night when he said an interest rate cut would 'improve the
preconditions for a strengthening of economic growth in both Germany and
Europe. Positive pulses will also go out to the world economy.'
'The reason for lower interest rates would be better inflation prospects and
a weakening west German economy,' said Mr James Cornish, an economist at
County NatWest of the UK, who visited the Bundesbank last week. It was not
possible to say yet whether the economy was in a temporary dip or sliding
into recession, he added.
The apparent willingness of the Bundesbank to compromise its reputation for
absolute and often bloody-minded independence will also worry those in
Germany who fear for the future political influence on a single European
central bank.
Germany has hitherto been adamant that such a successor to the Bundesbank
must, if anything, be more independent of political considerations; for
example, coming from ministers of finance in the EC Council of Ministers.
France, on the other hand, and President Francois Mitterrand in particular,
has made it clear that the final word on European monetary policy must lie
with the Council of Ministers.
Now it may be argued that the German central bank has already proved unable
to resist the pressures from the European governments.
Its defenders may reply that all it is doing is responding to the
irresistible pressures of the currency markets, which threatened to undo its
own good work in seeking to curb German monetary growth.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Luigi Abete, the chairman of Italy's Confindustria employers' federation,
last night summed up the mixed feelings of many business leaders to the
surprise devaluation of the lira.
The business community 'didn't ask for a devaluation of the lira, because
without rigorous measures to restore public finances, devalution risks being
counter-productive for the solution of so many national problems', he said.
Virtually all Italy's leading businessmen have in recent weeks strongly
supported the Bank of Italy's policy of defending existing exchange rates on
anti-inflationary grounds. Though the steady rise in interest rates required
in the past two months to defend the currency has been viewed with growing
alarm, entrepreneurs have expressed strong support in public for the central
bank's approach.
Most have remained tactfully silent on the policies of Italy's EC partners.
But Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of the Olivetti computer group, last
week launched a stinging attack on Bundesbank preoccupation with the
domestic economy, leading to high interest rates which were creating
recession elsewhere, he warned.
Few others have been so public. Last month, Mr Giorgio Falck, one of the
family owners of the Falck steel group and about the only prominent
businessman publicly to call for devaluation, was roundly criticised in the
media and by prominent counterparts for his comments.
Devaluation is likely to have a mixed reaction on the stock market. Fears
that Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy  - who has
repeatedly stressed central bank determination to defend the currency at all
costs  - might resign could severely depress sentiment.
'If Ciampi resigns, the lira will come back under pressure straightaway and
the devalution will have been a complete waste,' said one bank economist. He
doubted the Bank of Italy would cut the key discount rate at which it lends
to commercial banks  - raised by 1.75 percentage points to 15 per cent last
week  - before the French referendum on Maastricht. But removal of months of
uncertainty over Italy's currency could prove a tonic to the stock market,
which has seen share prices tumble by around 27 per cent this year. Shares
in some big companies have fallen below their nominal values as foreign
investors liquidated holdings, partly because of devaluation fears.
Some analysts have already been predicting that a cut in the value of the
lira would help big companies such as Fiat, Olivetti and the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group, which sell much production abroad and have been
increasingly penalised by relatively high domestic costs.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Brief respite for Italy's coalition government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE realignment of the lira within the European Monetary System (EMS) agreed
yesterday is likely to give Italy's four-party coalition government only a
brief respite to demonstrate its ability to tackle the country's
deteriorating public finances.
This breathing space could last until little more than the end of the month,
according to market analysts. Even that could prove optimistic if the French
referendum on Maastricht on September 20 shows a rejection of the treaty.
Ministers also recognise an internationally credible 1993 budget must be
prepared as soon as possible. This depends on parliament approving outline
plans for reforms of pensions, the health service, local government and the
civil service.
The budget has to be presented to parliament by September 30  - but it is
still not clear if and when both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate will
endorse these reforms.
The debate has been clouded by the decision on Wednesday of Prof Giuliano
Amato, the prime minister, to submit a law to enable the government to
invoke emergency economic powers in the event of an economic crisis. Since
the idea was launched, politicians have been voicing increasing
reservations, even those within the government coalition.
An editorial over the weekend in the influential daily Corriere della Sera
newspaper said the request for such emergency powers was like the pilot of a
tumbling aircraft asking for new engines. This view was widely echoed by key
officials dealing with the economy.
Prof Amato indicated he was willing to water down his proposal to ensure the
sovereignty of parliament was not infringed on. One suggestion being mooted
was that he would trade the dropping or watering down of the proposal for
parliament's quick endorsement of the outline reforms essential for the
budget's preparation.
The government will now have to confront the consequences of a currency
realignment. Prof Amato last night said keeping inflation under control
would be a priority. Italy's inflation was scheduled to fall to some 4.5 per
cent by year end.
The prime minister added that Italy's foreign trade was mainly conducted in
dollars and the lira had not been realigned against the dollar. He hoped
interest rates would come down: the discount rate is currently at 15 per
cent to defend the lira and every one-point fall reduces the government's
annual borrowing requirement by L15,000bn (Pounds 7bn).
Apart from seeking early evidence of a desire to reduce the budget deficit
now more than 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product, the markets are
likely to continue to press the government to accelerate further the
privatisation process to encourage domestic and international confidence.
Last week the government said it would sell off stakes in Credito Italiano,
one of the top six commercial banks, and Nuovo Pignone, the heavy
engineering subsidiary of ENI, the state oil concern.
Ever since the Amato government took office on June 29, it has been under
pressure to realign Italy's overvalued lira. However, devaluation has been
constantly resisted in the short term for two main reasons.
Italy's European partners were not prepared for a realignment, especially
the British, and until this weekend the French government had rejected
Italian requests to permit a lira devaluation before the Maastricht
referendum. The government regarded devaluation before the 1993 budget as of
only short-term benefit unlikely to convince the markets and risking being
inflationary.
Thus although it has seen a realignment with the first set of conditions
satisfied, the second has yet to be.
The government has taken heart from the concerted European response which
officials last night said should warn the markets that unilateral pressure
on the lira would eventually affect other members.
The Bank of Italy maintains that by calling on unlimited credit from the
Bundesbank, and to a lesser extent from the Belgian central bank, it
reminded the Germans that defending the lira risked creating liquidity
problems at home.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Initiative is example of union, says Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE realignment in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and the Bundesbank's
intention to cut interest rates will be welcomed by European Community
ministers and officials as a sign of strong co-operation between member
states, a senior Brussels official said last night.
The Bundesbank's flexibility could also strengthen the hand of supporters of
the Maastricht treaty in France. Last night's declaration was an example of
economic and monetary union working in its early stages, the official said.
For several months, EC finance ministers have been warning that Germany's
tight monetary policy was imposing strains on the economies of other
members.
The joint German-Italian initiative paving the way for yesterday's
realignment underlines the message that the Community can manage its
business, the EC official said, although the final judgment would be left to
the financial markets today.
EC officials have been alarmed by the tenor of the French referendum
campaign in which both supporters and opponents of the treaty have warned
about the threat of German economic hegemony in Europe and the EC's
inability to deal with political crises.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Sterling still faces hurdles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FULL impact on sterling of yesterday's realignment of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism will only be known after the results of today's special meeting of
the Bundesbank council.
In the weeks before the realignment, foreign exchange dealers had assumed
that a unilateral devaluation of the lira would put renewed pressure on the
British pound.
Their assumption was that devaluation of the Italian currency would
undermine investor confidence in sterling, which is widely regarded as the
second most vulnerable currency in the system.
That vulnerability has not gone away despite last night's events. 'Now that
the lira has been devalued, sterling is the most exposed currency in the
system,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in
London .
However, a cut in German interest rates would remove what has been the
biggest pressure on sterling until now. With short-term interest rates in
Germany at 9.75 per cent, the Bank of England's policy of keeping base rate
at 10 per cent has provided currency speculators with too small a return on
their investment until now.
'We could get a German cut of 50 basis points or even 100 basis points,'
said Mr Lyons.
But, he added that the size of the reduction was less important than the
move itself. Until now, investors had been anxious that the next move in
German interest rates could be up rather than down. A cut in rates today
would be the first official cut in Germany since 1988, when the Bundesbank
raised the discount rate from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent.
However, even if there is a one percentage point cut in Germany's Lombard
rate today, sterling will still face a number of hurdles.
The first problem would be new signs that the UK economy is in the grip of
recession.
The outlook for the economy remains weak, with many analysts assuming that
there will be negative growth in the UK this year followed by only a modest
recovery in 1993.
Thursday's monthly unemployment figures for August are almost certain to
show a rise in the number of people out of work, and may check any surge in
confidence that appears today.
Another problem for sterling will be France's referendum on the Maastricht
treaty on Sunday.
Until recently, currency investors had bought weaker EMS currencies such as
sterling and the lira because they assumed that both the UK and Italy would
have to rein in their annual public sector borrowing requirements in order
to meet the convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty.
If the French vote No on Sunday, the markets could assume that European
Monetary Union is dead and will unwind their earlier investments.
'If the French reject Maastricht, then this realignment will have done
little to stabilise the tensions in the EMS,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, head of
research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London.
As they tried to absorb last night's dramatic events, some analysts were
confident that the immediate outlook for the pound was promising.
'Sterling will rally on Monday morning, but it is not yet clear by much,'
said Mr John Shepperd, an economics analyst at S G Warburg in London.
'The domestic money markets were discounting a rise in UK base rates.
'If the Bundesbank cuts rates, there will be hectic trading as the money
markets shift their position radically. The equity market could rise too.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / French referendum to be a cliffhanger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S referendum on European monetary and political union will be a
cliffhanger right to the last minute, when the first results of the vote
start to emerge from the interior ministry's computers next Sunday evening.
Public opinion polls closed last Saturday at midnight, as they must do seven
days before an election under French law, showing that the Yes camp has a
slim majority, but that it has lost ground over the past week.
The average of the five last polls before Saturday midnight gave a narrow
52.4 per cent in favour of the treaty  - of those who have made up their
minds  - down from 54.2 per cent shown by a similar average the previous
week, according to Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers
in London.
Among the final batch, an extremely detailed BVA poll for the Liberation
newspaper, gave a 50-50 split between those who have made up their minds.
Paradoxically it indicated at the same time that 60 per cent of the
electorate supported monetary union and 62 per cent supported external
security co-operation, the main points in the treaty. Some 42 per cent said
they saw the referendum as a chance to vote against the government. All this
confirms the impression that French voting intentions are still clouded by
domestic politics.
'The Yes campaigners are failing to give people strong personal reasons for
voting for the treaty and have instead warned them of catastrophe if they
vote against. The electorate could be getting tired of this message. The No
campaign, by contrast, has focused on the specific personal worries inciting
people to vote against,' said Mr Mercier.
Better news for the Yes campaign came from a Sofres poll for TF1 on
Saturday, which gave 52 per cent in favour of Maastricht and said that 73
per cent of those interviewed thought that the pro-treaty camp would win.
According to Ifop, for Journal du Dimanche, the Yes camp had 53 per cent,
two-and-a-half points up on an Ifop poll five days previously.
Even the polling organisations agree that their results cannot be taken at
face value. President Francois Mitterrand is more familiar to the vagaries
of polls than most, since the polling organisations did not foresee his 1981
presidential election victory until the last minute.
The small size of pollsters' samples, usually around 1,000 people, means
that there is a margin of error of several percentage points when
extrapolating the result to a national referendum.
To complicate the outlook further, up to 29 per cent of the electorate does
not know how it will vote, according to the most recent surveys. They could
go either way or abstain on Sunday.
For another thing, French opinion polls are notoriously volatile. The French
are so intensively quizzed on political matters  - the Journal de Dimanche
has a political poll nearly every week, even in quiet times  - that there is
a temptation for people being polled to use the occasion to toy with
opinions rather than express real views.
But the polls are doubly volatile this time. When President Mitterrand
called a referendum on 3 June, the day after the Danish No vote, opinion
surveys indicated that nearly 70 per cent of the French electorate would
give the treaty its blessing.
But that majority steadily ebbed away through July and August as the
anti-Maastricht lobby took the campaign initiative, pushing hard on the
theme of sovereignty. The government's image at the same time received a
battering from the truckers' strike, a scandal over Aids-contaminated blood
and the latest twists in a long running controversy over allegedly illicit
party funding.
The sudden emergence of a small majority against the treaty by the end of
August shocked a previously sluggish pro-Maastricht campaign into action.
Since then, a flurry of meetings and interviews, culminating in Mr
Mitterrand's marathon television debate on September 3 have given the
pro-treaty vote a much-needed lift.

FT  14 SEP 92 / EC ministers warn of crisis if French reject Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HATFIELD, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday stepped up warnings about a
financial and political crisis if the Maastricht treaty on European union is
rejected in next Sunday's referendum.
The warning came at the end of two days of informal talks at Hatfield,
Hertfordshire, between the ministers but before the announcement of a
realignment in the European exchange rate mechanism late yesterday.
In France, politicians began a frenzy of campaigning to try to swing a
finely divided electorate in the run-up to the referendum.
The slim majority for Maastricht yesterday appeared fragile, according to
the last of the public opinion surveys before pre-election polling closed at
midnight on Saturday. The final five surveys before the deadline showed an
average 52.4 per cent majority for the pro-Maastricht camp. One poll, by BVA
for Liberation, showed an even split.
EC officials cautioned, however, that the warnings of a potential political
crisis in western Europe could be aimed at galvanising undecided voters in
France. They also pointed out that French approval for the treaty would not
remove the problem of the Danish vote against Maastricht last June.
At the foreign ministers' meetings, Mr Roland Dumas of France raised the
possibility of an 'earthquake' in the event of a No vote. 'You can't tell
where the buildings will fall down,' he said.
Britain, which holds the EC presidency, is prepared to call an emergency
session of EC foreign ministers in New York next Monday whatever the outcome
of the referendum. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said: 'There
will have to be very close co-ordination whether there is a French Yes or
No.'
Mr Hurd left open the possibility of EC foreign ministers  - who are due to
be in New York for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly  -
holding talks with EC finance ministers gathered in Washington under the
auspices of the Group of Seven industrialised countries.

FT  14 SEP 92 / UK fund managers confident of Yes vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK INSTITUTIONAL fund managers overwhelmingly believe the French will vote
Yes in next week's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, according to a
survey carried out last week for Smith New Court, the stockbroker.
Almost two-thirds of the managers did not expect sterling to be devalued
within the European exchange rate mechanism if the French rejected the
treaty.
The survey confirmed that the Italian lira was the most vulnerable currency
in the ERM before yesterday's 7 per cent devaluation; 81 per cent of the
fund managers believed a French No vote would have led to downwards
realignment of the lira.
Most also believed Germany's internationally important Lombard rate would
start to fall from near-record levels of 9.75 per cent within the next three
months. The investors expected a Lombard rate of 9.58 per cent in three
months and 8.41 per cent in a year. The Bundesbank said yesterday it would
cut official interest rates today.
Falling German interest rates may relieve some of the pressure on Mr John
Major, who last week committed himself to a policy of not devaluing
sterling.
But with French opinion polls indicating that the vote is more finely
balanced than institutional investors believe, the survey suggests UK equity
markets could be in for a sharp shock if the treaty is rejected.
Smith New Court's view is that a No vote would immediately hit equity
markets but that longer term rejection could be good for UK companies if it
led to a break down of the ERM.
The survey, by Gallup covered 99 institutional fund managers who together
handle Pounds 531bn of investment funds.
In the last month, the fund managers have become more confident that the
French will vote Yes; 87 per cent believed the treaty would be accepted
compared with 80 per cent who took that view in August.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Lira devalued 7% in EMS: Bundesbank interest rates to be cut
today UK to maintain sterling-DM parity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY and Germany last night moved to end the crisis in the European
Monetary System by agreeing an effective 7 per cent devaluation of the lira
to be followed by cuts in the Bundesbank's leading interest rates today.
Monetary officials said the surprise move, agreed by telephone over the
weekend, could be followed by interest rate cuts in other countries such as
France and the Netherlands. Analysts suggested it also could ease
speculative pressure against sterling.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, last night welcomed the realignment and
in particular the Bundesbank's intention to cut its interest rates.
In a statement, he made clear Britain would not alter the parity of sterling
against the D-Mark and that it would take 'whatever action was necessary' to
maintain the central rate at DM2.95.
The chancellor said last night's moves demonstrated the 'benefits of
continuing close co-operation among Community countries'.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, urged Mr Lamont to cut UK interest rates
and take measures to boost employment and investment to restore economic
growth.
Announcing the EMS changes in Brussels, the EC monetary committee said all
currencies would be revalued by 3.5 per cent, except the lira which would be
devalued by 3.5 per cent. The moves were initiated after massive
intervention by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy on Friday failed to
lift the currency off its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange
rate mechanism. The Bundesbank spent well over the DM2.5bn that it published
for intervention last week.
The intervention, obligatory under the rules of the ERM, had the effect of
increasing Germany's monetary reserves and so threatening to add to its
already rapid money supply growth.
The German interest rate cuts will be decided at an unprecedented meeting of
the Bundesbank's ruling council at 9am Central European Time today. A
Bundesbank official said last night both the discount and Lombard rates,
currently 8.75 and 9.75 per cent respectively, would be cut.
EC officials said the Bundesbank appeared to have agreed to cut its interest
rates in expectation that the Bonn government and both sides of industry
would take more effective measures to curb inflationary pressures in
Germany. It also seems to have become more worried about the slowdown in the
German economy than was the case only a week ago at the EC finance
ministers' meeting in Bath.
Prof Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, last night put a brave face
on events, saying he believed the decision effectively to devalue by 7 per
cent would not be inflationary.
The main component in Italy's inflation was internal costs, he said, and the
government was seeking to tackle these. Italy's inflation has been falling
and in August was running at 5.3 per cent on an annual basis.
Prof Amato said he welcomed the co-operation of the Germans and the
agreement worked out in consultation with other EC members. 'If we had
devalued earlier, it would have been merely an own goal,' he said.
The impact of the realignment was immediately felt this morning in the
Pacific markets where trading was described as frantic. In Tokyo the dollar
opened sharply higher against the D-Mark. It was trading close to DM1.50
after closing at DM1.4508 in New York on Friday. Sterling was trading above
DM2.82, against its previous London close of DM2.79. Against the dollar it
had fallen to below Dollars 1.89 after Friday's New York close of Dollars
1.921.
The Bundesbank's agreement to cut its official rates will amount to a
substantial concession by the central bank, in effect giving in to pressure
from the other member states in the EMS.
Until now, the Bundesbank has been adamant that its high interest rate
policy is essential to curb monetary expansion and hold down inflation
within Germany. By agreeing to make cuts, it is admitting the important role
the high rates have played in the recent European currency market turmoil.
Only last week Mr Otmar Issing, a leading Bundesbank board member, insisted
that the bank's interest rate policy would not be swayed by broader economic
considerations, but only by its paramount task to curb inflation and
maintain the D-Mark's stability.
Nonetheless, pressure on the Bundesbank has been growing rapidly both within
Germany, and outside it, to recognise the international reality causing the
stresses in the currency markets.
The German decision may fuel hopes of rate cuts in the US and Japan.
The EMS changes were welcomed by the US where Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury
secretary, said they were a 'positive development for world markets'.
In London, several City economists said the Bundesbank's pledge could lead
to a rise of sterling and other European currencies today, and that, in the
short term, the pressure had been taken off the UK to raise rates.
Mr John Shepperd, senior economist at Warburgs, said the chief part of the
equation was still missing - namely the size of the German rates cut.
But he added: 'The most important thing is that the Bundesbank has cracked.
It has bowed to international pressure, abandoning domestic issues. Its
approach to policy has changed. In the future it is likely to have a much
more accommodating stance. There will be much more confidence that the
current parities will be much more durable and sustainable. What was going
to blow the ERM apart was the Bundesbank's intransigence.'
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said the Bundesbank move was 'very welcome'. He hoped the cuts in German
borrowing rates would be followed by UK interest rate cuts 'at an early
stage'.
The lira has been under pressure since the Danish referendum on Maastricht,
but this intensified over the past two weeks as a result of two factors:
uncertainties about the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht and
market fears that the Italian government would not take sufficiently tough
measures to tackle the country's budget deficit rising beyond 10.5 per cent
of gross domestic product.
On August 8 the lira for the first time breached its L765.40 floor in the
EMS against the D-Mark. Since then it has been close to or near the floor.
According to Prof Amato, the German government last week initiated secret
contacts with the treasury and the Bank of Italy on a realignment of
currencies in the EMS. The Italian government lobbied hard for the
Bundesbank to realign in conjunction with a lowering of its own interest
rates.
Italian officials indicated that a significant element influencing German
attitudes was the increasing number of calls likely to be made on the
Bundesbank to buy lire under its EMS obligations to support weaker
currencies.
Already this month the Bundesbank had been obliged to drain liquidity from
the domestic market to back its lira support operations. Last Friday and the
previous Friday the Bundesbank bought lire worth a total of more than
DM1.7bn.
On the Italian side, the authorities had few weapons left to confront
another week of speculation against the lira in the run-up to the French
referendum. Unofficial estimates of convertible foreign currency reserves
are believed to be little more than L10,000bn against L26,000bn at the end
of July.
The discount rate was raised by 1.75 points to 15 per cent on September 3
and overnight money rates on Friday rose to 28 per cent.
Last night there was no indication the Italian authorities would be able to
lower the discount rate. This suggested they would watch market reactions
which are still thought likely to be nervous about the lira.

FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Write-off pushes Sansui into
Y19bn loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SANSUI Electric, the Japanese consumer electronics company and former Polly
Peck subsidiary, has announced losses after extraordinary items of Y19.2bn
(Dollars 154.6m) in the six months to June. This follows a Y73.2bn loss in
1991.
The latest results were hit by what is expected to be the final big
write-off in the company's post-Polly Peck corporate restructuring.
Sansui is still in the red at the operating level, but the interim figures
included an extraordinary loss of Y17.2bn, related to the sale of
Capetronics, a loss-making manufacturing company sold to Sansui by Polly
Peck in 1990.
Hong Kong-listed Semi-Tech (Global) recently purchased 51 per cent of Sansui
in a Dollars 31m deal, whereby the bulk of the shares were purchased from
the administrators of Polly Peck, for a nominal sum.
Polly Peck retains a 20 per cent stake, while the Bank of Tokyo, Sansui's
main creditor, has converted some debt for equity to take a stake of close
to 5 per cent.
Capetronics was purchased at the height of Japan's 'bubble economy' and on a
Japanese price-earnings ratio, according to Sansui's new chairman Mr James
Ting. The Taiwan-based manufacturing business was sold so that Sansui could
focus on low-cost manufacturing in China, he said.
Despite the dour picture painted by its latest results, Sansui's recent
misery could finally be drawing to a close. It has forecast a profit in the
second half of the year, due to property disposals; and it should be able to
break even at the operating level in 1993, according to Mr Ting.
Its new parent is the former Hong Kong computer manufacturer which launched
the takeover and then turnround of Singer, the US sewing machine group. It
intends to use Singer to help produce a similar performance for Sansui.
Mr Ting has a simple business plan he is confident will bring it back to
profit by 1994. He is proposing to bring the company's quality audio
products down to mass market levels, focusing on high-turnover items, such
as mini hi-fi units.
Singer's 30,000 distribution outlets will then be used to develop sales.
These have already been changed from a narrow focus on sewing machines to a
wider range of consumer electronic products.
The second part of the strategy is to pursue Sansui sales in China. 'China
is in a time warp, as far as this industry is concerned,' said Mr Ting. Only
recently have the Chinese demonstrated their enormous appetite for
televisions and washing machines.
Semi-Tech has enlisted the aid of Hong Kong's largest audio products
manufacturer Tomei Holdings, through an equity swap. Tomei is to produce
cheap audio products in China and it will also utilise its domestic sales
quota for Sansui products.
A Sansui retail network is also planned.

ITALY'S fast-diversifying Benetton family has shifted into a new area of
activity with the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in the TWR Group, the UK
motor racing, research and consulting company run by Mr Tom Walkinshaw.
No price for the deal has been disclosed. However, a spokesman for Edizione
Holding, the Benetton's family holding company which is making the
investment, said its involvement would 'alter TWR's debt-equity ratio,'
thereby ensuring a Pounds 60m (Dollars 114.6m) bank loan destined for new
projects.
TWR, based in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, has around 700 employees and
expects sales this year of around Pounds 170m. The company designs and
develops prototype cars and is also active in motor sport and Formula One
racing.
Among the best known of its current projects is the new Jaguar XJ220
super-car, which is being produced in a limited edition of 350 vehicles
costing Pounds 415,000 each.
The group has grown dramatically, with turnover surging by 819 per cent in
the past six years. Among new projects on its drawing board are contracts
for Ford, Mazda, Rover and Holden, General Motors' Australian subsidiary, as
well as a joint venture with Aston Martin, which has entrusted TWR to
develop a new model for 1994. The company is also working on an advanced
electric car.
The Benetton family's stake is to be held by 21 Investimenti, a new
subsidiary of Edizione Holding set up last year to spearhead investments in
new activities. Apart from controlling the family's stake of around 80 per
cent in the Benetton clothing concern, Edizione Holding has expanded into
sports goods equipment, with a string of takeovers of famous brands and
property.
Mr Alessandro Benetton, the 28-year-old second son of Benetton's guiding
light, Mr Luciano Benetton, will join TWR's board. The two men have already
established contacts through Benetton's activities in Formula One motor
racing, which are under Mr Alessandro Benetton's control. Earlier this
month, he also joined the board of Edizione Holding,

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BSN, France's largest food group, has scaled down plans to protect itself
from hostile takeovers, in response to objections from institutional
shareholders that their voting rights were being curbed.
Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, said he would ask shareholders at an
extraordinary meeting on September 30 to agree that planned new limits on
voting rights should cease to apply once a bidder had bought more than 67
per cent of the group's capital.
Previously, he was planning to ask the meeting to make the new voting limits
apply up to a ceiling of 90 per cent of BSN's equity, after which level they
would be lifted. The planned restrictions would limit holders of shares with
single voting rights to vote for 6 per cent of BSN's equity capital, rising
to 12 per cent for holders of shares with double voting rights.
Shares in French companies held for two years automatically get double
voting rights. BSN is proposing the new curbs to avoid being caught by
surprise by this process.
Some of BSN's largest shareholders were irritated by the 90 per cent plan
and the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock exchange
watchdog, has in the past disapproved of excessively restrictive voting
curbs. In common with many French companies, BSN also has a 'poison pill'
under which loyal shareholders would acquire 20 per cent of the equity in
the event of a hostile bid. This provision would remain.

<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and financial services group which has been
attacked by shareholders over a variety of corporate governance issues, has
appointed two new board directors.
They are Mr Michael Miles, chairman of Philip Morris, the large cigarette,
beer and food manufacturer, and Mr William LaMothe, chairman emeritus of
Kellogg, the cereal company. Mr LaMothe retired as chief executive of
Kellogg at the end of last year.
The two appointments expand the size of the Sears board from nine members to
11, and is the latest in a series of moves by the company which appear
designed to answer some of the complaints levelled against it by investors.
Sears has been under fire from dissident shareholders for several years. In
large part, the unhappiness results from the lacklustre performance of the
company's large retail operations, and the poor performance of Sears shares.
However, at the last couple of annual meetings, this disquiet has focused on
several corporate governance issues - with the dissidents requesting that
the roles of chairman and chief executive be spilt, and directors be elected
annually.
At last May's AGM, the dissident motions gained larger-than-expected
support, although none was successful. Sears has since made several moves to
appease investors.
In June, for example, it approved some additional powers for shareholders.

SKODA Automobila, the joint venture between Volkswagen of Germany and Skoda,
the Czechoslovak car manufacturer, is planning to raise a DM1.2bn (Dollars
857m) syndicated bank loan under the umbrella of the International Finance
Corporation.
The deal will be co-arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, JP Morgan,
Deutschebank and Dresdnerbank.
It will mark the first time an eastern European corporate borrower attempts
to raise a significant sum on western markets and should set a benchmark for
similar blue chip foreign-controlled companies in the region.
Mr Hans Meisner of the CSFB banking department in London said the terms of
the loan were being negotiated and should shortly be placed privately among
banks.
Under a joint-venture agreement Volkswagen bought 31 per cent of Skoda for
DM620m and is committed to lift its participation to 70 per cent by 1995.

<TEXT>
RHONE-Poulenc, France's largest chemical group, plans to sell Societe
Francaise d'Organao Sythese, its specialty chemicals subsidiary, to Great
Lakes Chemicals group, the Indiana-based company.
Terms were not announced. The subsidiary, which manufactures additives for
lubricants and polymers, has a turnover of FFr525m (Dollars 107.1m). It
employs about 340 at its Paris head office and two production sites at
Persan (Val d'Oise) and Catenoy (Oise).
Rhone-Poulenc, which warned last week it would not reach its target of more
than 20 per cent earnings growth, said the business was no longer in line
with its main strategic orientations.
The sale is part of a Rhone-Poulenc's substantial disposal programme. In
February, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, group chairman, said he hoped to raise as
much as FFr3bn from disposals this year and between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn in
1993. The aim is to cut the group's debt to equity ratio from 0.78 at the
end of last year to about 0.5 in 1993.
Great Lakes, which specialises in bromochemicals and fuel additives, is
expanding rapidly in Europe. Last month it paid Dollars 21m for the
remaining 50 per cent it did not own of Octel Kuhlmann, a French gasoline
additive business, which was a joint-venture with Rhone-Poulenc and Elf
Atochem of France.

FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: France urges closer ties for
Renault, Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government has given a political push to the growing co-operation
between Renault, the state-owned car maker, and Volvo, its Swedish partner.
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the industry minister, has called on the pair to
go further in their partnership, which began two years ago with an exchange
of minority equity stakes. Since then, the pair has pooled the purchasing of
some components, share research and development and co-operate in quality
control.
Mr Strauss-Kahn said more synergies could be explored and asked Renault and
Volvo to 'clarify' their relationship by the end of the year. His remarks
will be welcomed by the partners, who have been exploring a merger as one of
several options for further co-operation, though they have yet to present
precise plans to the French government.
Paris has until recently been cautious over considering a Renault-Volvo
merger because it would have to table a bill in parliament if Volvo wanted
to buy more than 25 per cent of the French car maker. The Swedish group
currently owns 20 per cent of Renault and has an option to buy another 5 per
cent, while Renault holds an 8.2 per cent stake in Volvo's parent group.
The government has been unwilling to present what could be a controversial
merger plan, given Renault's importance as a historic symbol of French
industrial policy, in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum. However, a
politically opportune moment could arise if there is a calm period after the
Maastricht vote and before the start of campaigning for next March's French
legislative elections.
Renault is in a strong financial position as it reaps the benefits of
several years of cost-cutting measures and a good performance in export
markets. However, loss-making Volvo could find it hard, for the moment, to
afford the cost of buying more shares in Renault.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (3): Miracles need a long haul - Tony
Hawkins takes an overview of the economic prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a handful of third world countries in East Asia have made the difficult
leap from factor-driven growth, exploiting abundant low-cost labour or rich
natural resources, to a modern, investment-driven economy.
Mauritius, having already exploited to the full its narrow resource base,
will try during the 1990s to make this transition to a skills-intensive,
service-led economy. It has little choice, because employment of both labour
and land is forcing it upmarket into territory where, today at least, it has
no obvious comparative advantage.
International trends are forcing it along a new, more difficult, growth path
too. Liberalisation of the world trading system - especially the phasing out
of the multi-fibre agreement (MFA) - will remove an important source of past
competitive advantage in the form of preferences in the European Community,
while reform of the EC's common agricultural policy will hurt the sugar
sector.
With two of the island's three economic pillars, clothing and sugar, under
threat from global forces, as well as domestic constraints, the third
pillar, tourism, will have to be supplemented by new sources of growth.
The trick in the 1990s will be to 'grow' new competitive advantage,
especially in services: offshore banking and other business services, a free
port, increased tourism, diversified agriculture and manufacturing; in the
same way as it successfully developed into a world-class exporter of
knitwear over the last decade.
But it is going be more difficult this time round, partly because there is
no longer a pool of skilled and semi-skilled workers to exploit, but also
because the world of the 1990s threatens to be far more competitive.
Mauritius expects to lose some of its preferential advantage in the single
European market to low-cost manufacturers like Greece and Portugal, while
facing tougher competition from other third world exporters if and when the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation measures is implemented.
Following the important structural reforms of the early 1980s, the Mauritian
economy has grown at almost 6 per cent a year, with the main thrust coming
from the export processing zone( EPZ), dominated by clothing manufacturers,
whose share of GDP more than doubled from 6 per cent in 1984 to 14 per cent
last year.
Sugar, the traditional locomotive of growth, whose reinvested profits
fuelled both industrial and tourism expansion, still accounts for 10 per
cent of GDP, while tourism's direct share, at 3 per cent, much understates
its real importance as a foreign currency earner (16 per cent of the total)
and as a source of employment.
Growth prospects have deteriorated with the onset of full employment. EPZ
growth slowed dramatically from more than 30 per cent annually in the
mid-1980s, to an average 7 per cent a year since 1987. This reflected
intensified competition in global markets, some loss of competitiveness as
wage inflation took hold, and the tightening labour constraint as
unemployment fell below 3 per cent last year from 19 per cent in 1983.
Despite this, EPZ expansion still accounts for more than a fifth of
post-1987 economic growth. By contrast, the sugar sector has gone backwards,
with value-added declining 6 per cent over the past five years The bulk of
growth (60 per cent) has come from services, with the finance sector, on
which great hopes are pinned, expanding at more than 6.5 per cent a year.
The balance of payments is healthy: a current account deficit of MR274m
(Dollars 20m), 0.7 per cent of GDP. Mauritius has a large trade deficit of
MR3.3bn (Dollars 235m), but this will be more than offset by tourist
earnings of over MR4bn in 1992, while capital inflows, in recent years, have
averaged MR1.5bn. External debt is modest at Dollars 938m (1990), with a
debt-service ratio of 6 per cent.
Hopes of maintaining growth at 6 per cent look optimistic. The signs are
that Mauritius will have to settle for a more sedate 4 per cent growth rate
in the 1990s, although this year GDP is forecast to rise 6.5 per cent,
chiefly on the strength of a recovery in the sugar sector following last
year's drought.
Export processing zone (EPZ) diversification - with reduced dependence on
clothing in favour of electronics, watch assembly, jewellery manufacture -
has not yet materialised. There is a strong feeling that the Free Zone firms
would do better to stick (literally) to their knitting. At present almost 85
per cent of EPZ workers are employed in the garment industry, with another 6
per cent in textiles, and this sectoral concentration has been increasing.
The Mauritian education system is well equipped to provide the type of
worker required for relatively low-skill clothing manufacture, but its
capacity to turn out workers capable of operating high-tech state-of-the-art
equipment, and people trained to staff and manage entrepreneurial service
activities, is very much in doubt.
Even if indigenous skills can be developed, there are just not enough pairs
of hands to go round. This means not only that labour participation rates
must rise, with more women being enticed to take jobs - participation rates
are twice as high among men - but also that productivity growth must be
secured from substantial new investment in both the software and hardware of
modern business.
Traditionally, growth and diversification has depended heavily on the
reinvested surpluses of the sugar sector. But with sugar profitability on
the wane, new sources of savings will have to be found. The 1992 budget
tackles this problem, with a raft of new savings incentives targeted
specifically at stock market investment.
Unlike the Asian tigers, Mauritius is not a significant player in the inward
investment game, attracting less than Dollars 150m in new foreign capital
inflows during the 1980s. Investment has therefore been dependent on
domestic savings levels which, fortunately, have averaged 27 per cent of GDP
in recent years, sufficient for GDP growth of at least 5 per cent a year,
given existing rates of investment efficiency. As sugar surpluses fall,
however, so Mauritius will need to attract more foreign interest - not just
financial inflows, but the even more important inputs of technology,
expertise and access to markets, to brandnames and subcontracting
arrangements.
Attracting these inflows is not going to be easy; with a GDP of less than
Dollars 3.5bn, the domestic market has little to offer. Government ministers
believe that the improved economic prospects in the island's natural
hinterland - east and southern Africa - will turn Mauritius into an
attractive location for entrepot business, interfacing between Africa and
south-east Asia; for regional headquarters for multinational companies as
well for the offshore banking and financial services. Mr Ramakrishna
Sithanen, the finance minister, sees post-apartheid South Africa as the
locomotive most likely to start up the regional economy.
But there is an element of wishful thinking in this regional service centre
picture, given the continuing - indeed, accelerating - marginalisation of
Africa and the probability of only a sluggish South African economy for the
next few years at least. Even if the plan were to come good, it is very much
a long-haul one.
The upbeat side of it is the Mauritian track record. Given the
transformation in little more than a decade from sugar mono-economy to a
finely-balanced three-legged stool - sugar, clothing and tourism - the
islanders' resilience and resourcefulness should not be underestimated. Mr
Sithanen has started well by rationalising domestic monetary and tax
policies to increase savings and investment, while also abolishing what
remained of exchange controls.
There is more to be done. For all its reputation as a liberal,
outward-oriented economy, Mauritius today has more price controls than five
5 years ago; its system of centralised wage-bargaining is a drag on
industrial and commercial efficiency.
Mr Sithanen acknowledges that the public sector is overmanned, agreeing that
labour must be retrained and redeployed; the sugar milling sector needs to
be rationalised to reduce the number of mills and thereby improving
efficiency, and the one-stop investment shop at the ministry of industry
needs to be streamlined.
Above all, the Mauritian miracle is going to run out of steam unless it can
revitalise its human sector. Two elements are crucial. The first is the will
to win, and many doubt whether the cheerful, easy-going Mauritian people,
increasingly accustomed to rapidly-improving living standards (per capita
income have risen 70 per cent since 1980 - have that killer instinct.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, they may not have the core
competencies necessary to succeed in a world where low-cost labour is no
longer a passport to economic growth. Developing new attitudes and new
competencies will - like financial sector growth  - be a long haul.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (4): A new dynamo is required - Mr
Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance minister, takes stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's going to be difficult but manageable,' says Mr Ramakrishna Sithanen,
the finance minister, as he takes stock of the economic options facing
Mauritius in the 1990s.
Two serious short-term problems loom: inflation, which he has successfully
cut from 13 per cent a year ago to below 3 per cent at present; and a
deteriorating balance of payments situation.
The balance of payments - a forecast deficit this year of 0.7 per cent of
GDP - looks likely to get worse if, as planned, import-intensive investment
in machinery and technology takes off as the manufacturing and services
sector gear up to compete in the world economy.
Similarly, businessmen worry that inflation will accelerate over the next
year, especially if, as seems probable, public sector labour unions win
their battle for a double-digit pay award.
Topping the list of the minister's longer-term worries is the likelihood
that global market conditions for Mauritian exports will become increasingly
competitive. Uruguay Round trade proposals and reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy in the European Community could damage the country's
garment and sugar industries.
As one industrialist luridly puts it: 'The phased abolition of the
multi-fibre agreement (MFA) would spell the death knell of at least a third
of export processing zone (EPZ) clothing firms.'
With growth already having slowed in the EPZ, sugar, and tourist sectors,
the island is looking for a new dynamo. The current emphasis is on turning
Mauritius into an offshore business centre and free port - underpinned by
consolidation, modernisation and diversification of agriculture,
manufacturing and tourism.
'There is no reason to change a winning formula,' says Mr Sithanen.
Mauritius must consolidate 'what we are good at,' simultaneously
diversifying its economy to ensure a flexible response to the fast-changing
global economy. 'We must improve performance in traditional sectors to stay
competitive.'
Two elements are crucial to Mauritian economic strategy in the next few
years, he says: deeper integration with the world economy, and regional
co-operation to exploit the island's geographical position. No other country
in the region has the potential to develop into an offshore business centre
interfacing between Africa and the Far East. The freeport could become a
springboard for such trade.
He sees Mauritius as the gateway to a growing African economy in the 1990s,
exploiting its export platform serving Africa as a member of the 18-nation
preferential trading area (PTA). But for regional growth to take off,
southern and east Africa needs a locomotive. The only country capable of
this is South Africa.
In a full employment economy, growth will have to come from improved
productivity, moving upmarket into higher value-added products and
developing competitive advantage in skills and capital intensive activities.
Having recently lost comparative advantage in labour-intensive, low
value-added production, Mauritian manufacturers must find new markets and
new niches. 'There is always room for niche marketing,' he says, 'provided
you market yourself properly.'
The range of options has narrowed. This is partly because Mauritius has
exhausted its most obvious source of comparative advantage - low-cost
labour; but also because it confronts by a new set of conditions in the
world economy: conditions favouring skills and capital-intensive techniques.
Mr Sithanen sees no quick-fix solution. Financial services, the freeport,
and offshore business development will be a long haul, he says. But he sees
no viable alternative to the growth strategy adopted in the late 1980s.
'We must continue with what we are doing,' he says, 'only we must do it much
better.'
But that will happen only if there is a change in attitudes: 'a change in
the work ethos. People will have to work harder and better if productivity
is to increase - the name of the game is to increase competitiveness.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (11): Sugar revenues lose their
sweetness - An important export needs a rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAURITIAN sugar industry is facing up to the need for a far reaching
adjustment in the face of increasingly uncertain revenues for its annual
production, which averages 650,000 tonnes.
The prospect of a reduction in the guaranteed support price - after a seven
year freeze, paid by the European Community to African Carribbean Pacific
(ACP) sugar producers under the Lome Convention - has concentrated minds in
the industry. Declining revenues combined with rising domestic costs of
production have forced the sector into an important rethink of its external
and internal policies.
But hard policy decisions are politically sensitive, given sugar's pivotal
role in the Mauritian economy. It contributes 30 per cent of export
earnings, 15 per cent of employment and 11 per cent of GDP.
Lingering distrust between government and the powerful sugar lobby makes it
much more difficult to address the main issues of productivity,
mechanisation, increased yields, modernisation and the role of state
intervention.
Yet the need for a serious overhaul of the sector is vital. A Mauritius
Chamber of Agriculture report says: 'The industry has now reached a
crossroads and important decisions have to be taken to ensure that the way
ahead is the one which leads to greater competitiveness and productivity.'
Mr Jean-Claude Tyack, the general secretary of the chamber, says the
critical impetus for reform is the likelihood of stagnating or decreasing
revenue from reduced prices as a result of reforming the EC common
agricultural policy (CAP), and the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Under the CAP, the slash in the lower prices paid to farmers of cereals,
milk and beef, and the pressure from the Gatt negotiations, are likely to
have a downward impact on sugar prices in the EC. Sugar accounts for 80 per
cent of Mauritian sugar exports.
'We are barely making ends meet at present and we expect there will be a new
sugar regime by mid-1993,' says Mr Tyack. 'The EC can't ignore sugar for
ever.'
Compounding the declining profitability of the Mauritian sugar industry has
been the erosion of foreign exchange gains as a result of the entry of
sterling into the European monetary system, and the slowing of the
depreciation of the Mauritian rupee.
Mauritius and other ACP producers are pushing for EC compensation in line
with what EC farmers are being paid to maintain revenues after the cut in
support prices for other commodities. Hopes are also high that the end of
Portugal's transition period of entry into the EC will result in a new
agreement, favourable to ACP producers, for Portugal's annual requirement of
300,000 tonnes of sugar.
Mr Michel Hardy, general secretary of the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, says
the island must also continue to raise the volume of high value specialty or
'natural' unrefined sugars it sells (75,000 tonnes last year), both in EC
and non-EC markets, and hunt out new markets for value-added products.
But the deteriorating external conditions present new challenges to the
Mauritian sugar sector. Producers complain that it is overly regulated by
government, is short of labour, and that the sector needs important advances
in productivity and mechanisation.
Producers say, too, that the first challenge is to define a new domestic
environment for the private sector in order to restore profitability and
competitiveness. They say that while Mauritius is moving fast towards
liberalisation, the sugar industry is 'kept in a fiscal and economic strait
jacket.'
A government/private sector working committee is currently considering
prescriptions proposed by the sugar lobby. These include liberalisation of
domestic price controls; reduction in the rate of export duty on sugar;
rationalisation of the tax regime to eliminate double taxation on profits;
better incentives for investment in capital to modernise and mechanise the
sector; easing restrictions on closure of sugar factories to allow better
rationalisation and economic efficiency, and reductions in and reform of
'cesses' - the local agriculture tax.
With the correct enabling environment, sugar producers say they will feel
more comfortable undertaking the necessary investments required needed to
raise production and cut costs.
The government, however, says that the 'sugar class' protests too much. Mr
Madan Dulloo, the agriculture minister, points out that government has
consistently given performance-linked incentives and support to the
industry; and that already this year it has provided for the issue of tax
free debentures and has substantially increased domestic consumer prices.
Further measures will be considered for legislation, he says, but 'because
of the importance to the economy of sugar there has to be give and take and
government has to balance the political, economic and social dimensions of
any policy change.'
Apart from the critical issue of the role of government, there is broad
agreement that several other measures need to be taken. The first is to
increase yields to compensate losses from the decline in area planted - each
year the sugar sector loses an estimated 500-1,000 acres of land to
development of housing, infrastructure and industrialisation. Producers say
the present sugar yield of 8.5 tonnes per hectare on estates could be
increased to 10-11 tonnes within a decade. Irrigation (especially drip and
improved furrow techniques), a comprehensive water management plan for the
island, increased research on new varieties, and mechanised harvesting,
loading and land preparation are also extremely important.
Many of these advances cannot now be applied to Mauritius's 33,000 small
planters - 90 per cent of whom work plots of under two hectares - who
produce about 38 per cent of the cane. Sugar yields from the smallholder
sector are at least two tonnes per hectare lower than for the estate sector.
Intensifying the effort to group small planters together into larger areas
of at least 20 hectares (land area management units) will be vital if they
are going to be able to exploit capital-intensive yield improving
techniques.
Modernisation of the long-neglected milling sector, increased productivity
of labour, better training, and further expansion of agricultural
diversification are all badly needed, too, to revive sugar's flagging
fortunes.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (10): Dreams still unrealised - Julian
Ozanne reports on the agricultural diversification effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE YEARS after an investment of MR8m in a fully mechanised fruit line, Mr
Berty Malabar has been unable to realise his dream of a sophisticated and
high quality export business of fresh fruits to Europe.
The Mauritian Government's incentive package to exporters, including a 50
per cent freight rebate scheme, has stimulated competition and dramatically
increased producer prices of pineapples, bananas and lychees. Mr Malabar has
been unable to secure a sufficient supply of fruit to keep his machines,
which wash, wax and pack, working more than a few days a year.
He complains of the entry into the unregulated market of a number of cowboys
who do not observe the minimum standards necessary to protect Mauritius'
brand name in an increasingly competitive European consumer market.
Mr Malabar's problems are typical of the lack of clear government direction
in agricultural diversification which - with the prospect of a much less
favourable environment for sugar (as discussed in the article above) - has
become even more pressing than before.
Furthermore, experts say Mauritius is wasting a vital competitive advantage
over other African horticultural exporters such as Kenya and Zimbabwe: the
huge excess capacity in air cargo for perishables, which has been created
alongside the tourist boom of the past seven years.
Last year, about 80 per cent of the air capacity to Europe was unused - a
total of almost 4,800 tonnes, against exports of 880 tonnes airlifted.
Opportunities for greater use of sea containerisation in Mauritius'
expanding port have also yet to be developed.
Critical policy options now have to be confronted. These include,
particularly, the balance between import substitution and export
orientation, efficient use of scarce land resources, the type of products
which to receive attention, and shifting away from what Mauritians describe
as the 'sugar mentality' to more active and skilled husbandry techniques.
The picture is far from bleak, however. Significant successes have been
achieved in import-substituting vegetable production for the local market,
particularly potatoes and ginger, and in the export of anthurium flowers.
Further opportunities exist in fruits and vegetables, sugar by-product
utilisation and deer farming.
Experts in the sector say the need now is for a carefully considered
government approach to the entire agricultural diversification industry, to
map out a coherent strategy of research and support for a sector which, with
the right policy environment, could expand dramatically in the coming years.
Recognition of the increasing problems facing the sugar industry is adding
impetus to the diversification drive.
The Mauritian Government has given considerable incentives to non-sugar
agriculture, and significant results have been achieved through crop
rotation, interline cultivation, and more effective use of by-products by
sugar farmers. An important project is under way to increase exploitation of
bagasse, the fibrous material separated during cane crushing, for the
production of energy.
Two new power stations are scheduled to start up in 1994 and 1995, which
will burn bagasse during the crop and coal in the intercrop period. Two
other existing power stations will be rehabilitated. The project is intended
to save foreign exchange by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels,
increase the sector's value-added, and have a favourable impact on the
environment by using a local renewablesource of energy.
Experts say further work needs to be done to investigate how to upgrade the
value of other byproducts, such as cane straw, scums and molasses. A whole
range of products - rum, power alcohol, vinegar and perfumes - are being
manufactured, but most of them on a small scale.
However, the general declining profitability of sugar land, together with
increased mechanisation, is likely to release land for alternative uses,
with prospects for higher returns. Fruit, vegetable and anthurium production
has already more than doubled since 1985.
Further increases in horticultural production will depend on:
eliminating the 'sugar mentality' for a sub sector which needs much more
careful husbandry, irrigation and more appropriate use of fertiliser and
pesticides;
research into the potential profitability and market opportunities of
different crops;
better land use - particularly of sugar lands, which will become impossible
to bring under mechanisation because they are too rocky or hilly;
development of strategies to protect horticulture from cyclones, such as
establishing windbreaks;
radication of fruit fly;
development of cheaper sea transportation to Europe.
According to Mr Malabar, the creation of high standards in post-harvest
handling procedures, such as selection, packing and temperature control,
will be vital to winning markets and may therefore require some licensing of
the industry.
Another interesting area of agricultural diversification is deer farming and
ranching. Already, nine farms with about 10,000 head are producing about 450
tonnes a year. Export markets have already been found for live animals in
Malaysia, and whole carcasses to the island of Reunion, and choice cuts and
delicatessen are being sold locally. Deer farmers say an important overhaul
of the national abbatoir, to bring it up to EC standards, is the constraint
on growth at present.
Mauritius has already demonstrated considerable progress in agricultural
diversification. But serious consideration by both the government and the
private sector of the many constraints is urgently requiredif substantial
growth is going to take place over the next five years.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (14): Toughness needed - Environmental
degradation must be reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STUNG BY international donor criticism, Mauritius has started work on a
comprehensive environmental policy aimed at preventing further serious
degradation of its fragile resource base.
Reversing the serious damage done to the environment from the past eight
years of rapid but unregulated growth in manufacturing and the tourism
sector will be a big challenge, requiring some tough - and politically and
economically courageous - decisions.
However, for some of the environmental damage already done - such as the
destruction of part of the marine and coral life around Grand Baie, caused
by from the discharge of untreated sewage into the sea by the mushrooming
hotel industry - government awareness has come too late.
The critical challenge for government lies in balancing the often
conflicting demands of enhancing 'the second phase' of economic growth,
while spending money and instituting controls and regulations on businesses
to preserve the environment. A comprehensive 400 page report, prepared by
the Mauritian government for the presentation at the Rio Earth Summit last
June, recognises this.
'The rapid pace of industrialisation has admittedly given rise to a
degradation of the environment which to a large extent stems from haphazard
development and poor planning,' the report says. But it also stresses the
need for a pragmatic policy towards the industrial sector and the need to
'frame intervention to protect the environment at least cost to industry."
Whether the government will be able to tread this tightrope, successfully
trading off environmental concerns with demands for even faster growth,
remains questionable - given the political strength of business interest
groups. But there seems to be widespread recognition of the problems and the
need for action.
The creation of a Ministry of the Environment in 1990 was a turning point in
the Mauritian government's environmental awareness and in its efforts to
construct a comprehensive policy structure. Among the pressing environmental
problems identified by the new ministry are:
The need to arrest coral depletion by coral sand mining companies, by
introducing incentives for switching to basaltic sand. 600,000 tonnes of
coral sand are used every year in the building industry. The ministry has
stopped allocating new licences to coral sand dealers, and will carry out a
review by next June, with a view to phasing out the trade completely.
Tackling the heavy use of agrochemicals and fertiliser.
A National Physical Development Plan to relocate economic activities and
allocate scarce land resources in an environmentally friendly way.
An important upgrading of solid waste management and the development of a
sewerage master plan. Rubbish dumps are to be phased out; in future all
waste will be transported to transfer sites, where it will be compacted into
bales and then taken to land-fill sites. Five of these have already been
identified and are being prepared.
The promotion of environmental protection and low waste technologies through
incentives, loans and subsidies to Mauritian manufacturers, particularly the
worse environmental offenders such as the textile dyeing houses, sugar
factories, stone crushing plants and boilers.
Introduction of the 'polluter pays principle' through charges, penalties and
taxes.
Creation of a special industrial estate for high pollution industries where
skilled technicians can work to reduce environmental damage.
Zoning of marine parks to protect marine life and coral reefs.
Mr Bashir Khodabux, environment and quality of life minister, says that
identification of these problems by the ministry's 400 page report has been
a significant plank in the government's policy. Passage of the Environmental
Protection Act (EPA) in July last year has also laid the legislative
framework for the next phase of quantitative action.
Under the Act, all new projects must be subject to an environmental impact
assessment, which will allow the ministry to impose environmental conditions
into the project plan.
For existing businesses the government is developing a series of
quantifiable 'norms and standards' under the EPA to control the emission of
effluents, smoke, noise, odour and water purity.
The standards are now at the solicitor general's office, and will then go
through a process of public comment. 'As soon as these standards are
prescribed by law we shall start inspecting premises,' said Mr Khodabux. 'We
are not going to be dictatorial. We want a consensual approach and we want
to be pragmatic and practical but we do also want to start seriously on
environmental action.'
The minister believes the process will be completed by January 1993. 'As
from that date Mauritius will have a pragmatic but effective environmental
policy.' A number of other studies and projects are also under way - funded
by donors who pledged Dollars 93m in 1989 for an environmental programme.
The list of ongoing projects includes funding technical specialists and
scientists; establishing four environmental laboratories; providing
infrastructure for the special industrial park; an emergency sewage project
for Baie de Tombeau; preparation and implementation of a National Sewage
Master Plan; establishment of a hazardous substance control board and plans
to improve pesticide use and regulation.
Observers say that the Mauritian government has moved swiftly, albeit after
a long period of damaging inaction, to prepare a sweeping environmental
policy.
The critical question which remains, however, is whether the g o v e r n m e
n t has the political will to implement its policies effectively -
especially in the face of business opposition and claims that environmental
protection is costly, and acts as a brake on development.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (13): 'No one owes us a living' - Sir
Anerood Jugnauth, the prime minister, is interviewed by Michael Holman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Question: Where will the impetus for growth in the 1990s come from?
Answer: The economy is now in a new phase of its industrialisation process,
characterised mainly by diversification into capital and technology
intensive manufacturing. Diversification will broaden our production base
and reduce our dependence on sugar, textiles and tourism. Capital and
technology, along with the production of up-market goods and services will
raise our productivity.
More impetus for growth will come from the financial services sector. In
fact, this sector is poised to become the fourth pillar of our economy. The
offshore business centre and the freeport will help growth and lead us on
the path to become a newly indus-trialised country.
Q: Are you disappointed at the pace of diversification in the export
processing zone (EPZ)?
A: I would certainly prefer things to move faster. The world recession has
slowed down investment, but I am confident that as the international
economic situation improves, there will be growing demand for products such
as electronics and jewellery, in which we are diversifying.
Q: How serious a constraint is the skills shortage?
A: In the short term it is not a serious problem, since we allow firms to
contract expatriate workers. For the long term, we are investing massively
in training.
Q: How will you cope with the changing international trade environment?
A: Insofar as sugar is concerned, the European Community sugar protocol for
ACP members will hold for an indefinite period. However, as regards the
Multifibre Agreement, Mauritius presently enjoys preferential access to EC
markets, which may not be the case if the MFA is not upheld. But we are
already preparing ourselves for tougher competition. No one owes us a
living. Diversification, modernisation, quality improvement, productivity -
focus on these areas will help us maintain our competitive edge.
Q: Is enough being done to protect the environment?
A: We are doing the maximum we can. Our approach is very much related to
sensitising our population through school and public campaigns, and since
the publication in 1988 of a national action plan, government is proceeding
with 32 projects covering all aspects of the environment.
Q: Can Mauritius afford its 'welfare state' facilities - free education,
free health services, social security benefits, subsidised basic foods?
A: To tell you the truth, I am worried. I have warned that we cannot go
subsidising food for everybody. I even say for certain types of medical
care, people who can afford to pay should be made to pay. I and my
colleagues are going to study these things very carefully, and a committee
is being set up . . . it just cannot go on like this.
Q: Are you closer to a solution for Diego Garcia (the coral atoll forming
part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, serving as a US military base,
claimed by Mauritius)?
A: I sincerely hope so. I have received a letter dated July 1 from the
British government which opens the way for further discussions. I am
satisfied the grounds have been cleared for a mutually satisfactory
solution.
Q: Does Mauritius provide any lessons for Africa?
A: Two factors in particular have contributed to our success, and which I
believe are prerequisites for successful development anywhere: political
stability in a democratic context, and heavy investment in human resources.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (15): Just pick up that cellphone

FEW business destinations can be as beguiling as Mauritius. Accessible
government officials, a flourishing private sector, up-to-date statistics,
good restaurants and delightful beachside hotels make even hardened
workaholics relax.
Life has been made even easier by the arrival on the island of the cellular
telephone. Local and worldwide connections are so good that your caller will
not know whether you are under a palm tree, putting the 25 minute journey
from your Grand Baie hotel to Port Louis to good use, or telephoning from
the capital itself. Local and international calls are at the standard phone
call rate, so the saving on hotel surcharges can cover the MR400 daily
rental.
There are no first class hotels in Port Louis, but with some of the world's
finest beaches a 30 minute taxi ride away, who would choose to stay in the
capital? Most offices are within walking distance, so it's hardly necessary
to hire a car. The taxi journey from Grand Baie area costs about MR200 (or
you could help pay for the cellular telephone by using the efficient bus
service - MR10 for the same journey).
An alternative to hotel accommodation is a short term let of a serviced
beachside bungalow; this can be arranged by Leisure Promotion (Tel/fax
2638812).
A pleasant city rendezvous is La Bonne Marmite (2122403/4406 - wonderful
palm heart salad); but one of the best restaurants on the island is Le
Piscatore (2616337), near the Trou aux Biche Hotel: excellent sea-food, and
special dishes for vegetarians.
Galerie Helene de Senneville (2637426, Grand Baie) offers fine paintings and
prints of Mauritius by local artists including Daniele Hitie, and look out
for work by Michael Adams, who lives on the Seychelles but visits Mauritius
frequently.
For a weekend break, explore the island of Rodrigues - 'Mauritius before the
tourists arrived'. Air Mauritius has a daily service to the island, and
every room at the recently opened Cotton Bay Hotel (095-831 3000/1/2) opens
up on to an unspoilt beach.
But find time for a sundowner on the wood-slatted verandah of the Pointe
Venus hotel, an elegant but fading reminder of the colonial era which
overlooks the capital, Port Mathurin. Credit cards are widely accepted in
Mauritius; business cards are regularly exchanged.
No visas are required for Commonwealth passport holders, or from the EC,
Scandinavia, Japan, US, South Africa, Oman, Quatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE.
Yellow fever and cholera vaccination certificates may be needed if you
arrive from infected areas. There is no malaria on Mauritius.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (12): Expanding tourism presents
dilemmas - Paradise has problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDEN sunlight dances off the clear turquoise water of the Indian ocean. A
gentle breeze, blowing across the lagoon, rustles the deep green leaves of
palm trees fringing white sandy beaches. Half a mile out to sea, the surf
breaks gently over the coral reef.
There are few 'sea, sun and sand' tourist destinations in the world which
come as close to paradise as Mauritius, with its excellent facilities for
deep sea diving, big game fishing, water skiing, wind surfing, riding and
sailing.
But the tourism sector is struggling to come to terms with a rocketing
expansion of the industry. This has created serious environmental and
economic problems and left government confused about the policy direction it
should follow for the next five years.
Industry experts say a comprehensive government five-year tourism
development policy is eagerly awaited. They look to this to give clear
directions about critical policy issues such as tourist arrivals, hotel
development, international marketing strategies, environmental impact
assessments, and plans to develop a more diversified and high quality
product.
The tourism boom in Mauritius has been impressive. Tourist arrivals have
doubled in six years: 148,900 in 1985 to 298,500 last year. Earnings have
risen from MR845m to M3.9bn over the same period, making tourism the third
biggest foreign exchange winner. Particularly good results have been
achieved in boosting the average spending per tourist, which increased from
MR5,676 in 1985 to M13,000 in 1991.
After a disappointing year in 1991, during which tourist arrivals increased
only by 2.4 per cent over the previous year ( mainly because of world
recession and the Gulf War), Mr Noel Lee Cheong Lem, minister of tourism,
says arrivals look likely to return to a growth rate of about 10 per cent
this year.
This pattern of growth has had its costs. The number of hotels in the past
six years has increased from 55 to 80, with an increase in the number of
beds from 5,387 to 10,482. Bed occupancy rates fell to a record low of only
47 per cent last year, as the increase in tourists has not kept pace with
the increase in beds.
Between 1985-1988, according to Mr Lem, a number of hotel development
certificates were distributed as 'political favours' - without either
adequate planning about how the new hotels were going to be filled, or
consideration of the environmental impact of this expansion. With low
occupancy rates the new hotels are struggling to make profits, despite
attempts to buy market share by cutting rates.
Furthermore, the unregulated growth in the number of hotels has had a
detrimental impact on the environment. Dumping of untreated sewage into the
seas and lagoons, particularly severe in the Grand Baie area, has had a
damaging impact on the marine ecosystem.
A moratorium on 20 new hotel projects expired last year, but Mr Lem says 16
of these projects have subsequently been shelved, and the government is
trying to persuade the other four not to go ahead. 'We are applying the
brakes on the further expansion of the tourist sector and at the same time
trying to widen the market to allow hotels to achieve the rate of occupancy
which is viable and profitable.'
All new hotel developments will now also be subject to an environmental
impact assessment under the new Ministry of the Environment.
If hotel development is slowed, and the growth in arrivals continues to
boom, Mauritius's capacity problem and the economic viability of hotels is
likely to ease considerably within the next three to four years. The
government has now abandoned an arbitrary limit of 400,000 arrivals by the
year 2000, and Mr Lem says Mauritius is a long way from the threshold of
tolerance of tourist arrivals, and that the ratio of tourist arrivals to
population is still so low that at least 500,000 arrivals by the end of the
century is acceptable and possible.
Two important challenges face the government in seeking to increase
arrivals: developing new markets, and developing the infrastructure for the
'second phase' of development.
Government is pinning its hopes on development of the Japanese and Indian
markets, and consolidation of the French, British, German and South African
markets. A once-a-week flight from Osaka to Mauritius is expected to start
by 1994. But hoteliers and tour operators say the Government Tourist Office
is weak and ineffective, and must develop a much more aggressive marketing
campaign. They say the MR65m allocated to promotion in this year's budget is
not enough.
The government will continue to ban charter flights, camping and caravan
sites, to discourage 'low budget' tourists and maintain Mauritius's image as
an upmarket destination for 'low volume high income'. The question remains
whether the sufficient growth in numbers can come from the high income
market alone.
Moreover, many 'low budget' tourists, especially from France, continue to
find their way to Mauritius by taking charters to Reunion and then making
the short (50 minutes) flight to Mauritius. Some hoteliers and tour
operators believe it would be better to accept that low budget tourists are
going to come, cater properly for them, and get the maximum revenue out of
them.
They also say that Mauritius remains an extremely expensive destination,
even for the high-income bracket tourist, and that only by considerably
improving the quality of the product and service will the industry be able
to continue to attract increased volume in the face of competition from
Kenya, Seychelles, Indonesia, Maldives and Thailand.
Development of infrastructure and added facilities will be critical to
further growth - as will maximising revenue by attracting tourists off the
beaches to spend more money on other activities. The development of the
National Handicraft Centre, and of inland facilities such as the 'Domain du
Chasseur,' a deer hunting and nature park, is being welcomed by the private
sector.
After a period of rapid growth the government is now facing crucial
decisions on how to consolidate and expand its thriving tourist sector to
ensure that continued growth will be sustainable.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (9): Important to go upmarket - Tony
Hawkins notes that EPZ growth has slowed to a crawl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER five years, during which growth in the Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
averaged a remarkable 26 per cent, manufacturing in Mauritius can no longer
claim to be the leading sector of the economy.
Indeed, in the last three years, EPZ growth has slowed to a crawl - at least
by Mauritian standards - with its output rising by a very respectable 6 per
cent a year. The slowdown reflects a combination of demand and supplyside
factors.
On the supply side, full employment, higher inflation and reduced investment
has undermined growth. At the same time, demand in the island's crucial
European markets has been hit both by the recession and by intensified
competition.
Export growth, which averaged 35 per cent in the mid-1980s, is down to
single-digit levels, though the EPZ's export role continues to grow in
importance and it now accounts for 63 per cent of total export earnings.
Investment in manufacturing in the last two years fell below the levels of
the late 1980s, but this has been partly offset by the marked improvement in
labour productivity.
Productivity in the EPZ, fell more than 20 per cent in the early 1980s as
employment grew far faster than output. It has since recovered strongly,
increasing 20 per cent since 1988.
This is an encouraging development - and one which suggests that Mauritius
employers are responding to their eroding margins by squeezing extra output
from the island's workforce. Indeed, between 1987 and 1991 value-added per
worker in the free zone increased 27 per cent.
Opinion is divided on the future of what has become the model for export-led
growth in Africa.
Since 1987, Mauritian ministers and business leaders have been pushing for
diversification out of clothing and textiles; two industries which, between
them, account for 85 per cent of EPZ production. Their efforts are directed
towards diversifying into jewellery (whose current output share is 3.5 per
cent), watches, optical goods (5 per cent), leather goods and electronics.
But there is a growing feeling that Mauritian exporters should focus on
moving upmarket in the clothing industry rather than seeking to develop new
sources of competitive advantage.
Mr Jean Claud de l'Estrac, the industry minister, says that while he favours
diversification, 'the choice is not ours to make.'
He has a foot in either camp, arguing for the modernisation of the clothing
sector so that it can exploit its experience to advantage, and its present
foothold in world markets. 'By global standards, we are still a low-cost
producer of textiles,' he says, adding that the textile sector has a future
so long as it adapts to changing conditions at home and abroad.
There is general agreement that urgent action is essential; a successful
outcome to the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks would, within a decade,
torpedo the EPZ's largest single export, the T-shirt industry, which would
lose its preferential edge relative to other third world manufacturers in
the European market.
EPZ exports totalled MR12.1bn last year. Of these, France took almost 29 per
cent of the total, Britain 16.5 per cent, and Germany 16.3 per cent. The
island's only significant non-European Community market is the US, which
buys 16.6 per cent of EPZ exports.
But there is no consensus in Mauritius on precisely where the EPZ should now
be heading for.
Some, such as Mr Arif Currimjee of the Bonair clothing group, one of the
zone's top quality players, argues that there is scope to expand value-added
very considerably by focusing more on design and marketing skills, seeking
competitive advantage through differentiation rather than cost leadership.
His company has achieved a 70 per cent value-added factor compared with an
EPZ average of only 32 per cent.
Furthermore, he highlights the need for closeness to the market. Bonair has
a Paris office from which it monitors Euro-market trends in fashion design
and retailing - pointing to the shortening of product life cycles and lead
times, and the need for greater production flexibility.
Others are approaching the problem by a different route. The Floreal group,
which alone accounts for a tenth of EPZ exports, and is the world's second
largest manufacturer of Woolmark garments after Benetton of Italy, went
offshore in 1989, opening a factory in nearby Madagascar which currently
produces 30 per cent of its woolmark items. Floreal, a middle-market player
which will be hard hit by the abolition of the MFA, is investing heavily in
new technologies.
Like Bonair, it emphasises the need for greater flexibility, shorter
production runs and, above all, improved quality. But quality gains are
difficult against a background of full employment.
Similarly, the days of a single-shift textile production, with expensive
capital equipment lying idle for 12 hours and more, are gone. Mr Daniel
Giraud, chief executive of Floreal, echoing a pervasive theme evident in
almost all sectors of the economy, stresses the need for a new and different
culture, both on the part of workers and management.
Some Mauritian policymakers believe the EPZ's longer-term future lies in a
consolidated, though smaller clothing and textiles sector, alongside
electronics, watches, leather and optical goods manufacturers.
The establishment of an informatics park, which is scheduled to open by the
end of 1993, and the rejuvenation of the EPZ development authority,
spearheaded by entrepreneurs from the private sector, underline official
determination to regain the EPZ momentum of the mid-1980s.
But whatever the disagreement on the extent of diversification versus
consolidation, there is unanimity on one aspect. That is the need to move
upmarket, reducing dependence on cost-leadership 'commodity' products, such
as pullovers and T-shirts, and developing new expertise in high-tech
capital-intensive operations.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (8): Incentives are in place - Michael
Holman examines the freeport plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF VISION becomes reality, Port Louis harbour will play an increasingly
important role in the economic development of Mauritius.
Hand in hand with the expansion and improvement of the harbour and its
facilities is the plan for a freeport, closely linked to the island's
emerging role as an offshore banking centre.
The port would serve as an international trade depot, providing warehousing
for transhipment and facilities for processing or assembling of goods and
materials for re-export to destinations around the world.
Sir Edouard Lim Fat, chairman of the Mauritius Freeport Authority
established earlier this year, and prime mover behind the establishment of
the island's Export Processing Zone, acknowledges that it is an ambitious
project.
The publicity material for the project refers to the island's 'strategic
location in the Indian Ocean.' But the natural economic hinterland is
sub-Saharan Africa - which is responsible for only 3 per cent of world
trade.
'It is nevertheless a significant market which we can help service,'
counters Sir Edouard, who is just back from a promotional visit to the Far
East. 'Membership of the Preferential Trade Agreement (an African trading
bloc) is one of the biggest assets we have. We are a gateway to Africa,
particularly for exports from Asia.'
The success of the Export Processing Zone - selling knitwear to Europe and
the US - shows that distance need not be an obstacle. Sir Edouard goes on to
list a wide range of incentives.
Machinery and materials imported by freeport operators will be exempted from
duties and taxes, and goods destined for re-export will qualify for reduced
port charges.
Companies engaged exclusively in re-export qualify for concessionary tax
rates; free repatriation of profits; freedom from exchange controls;
exemption from duties; tax on imported office equipment and, in addition,
tax breaks for expatriate staff.
Double taxation agreements with Britain, South Africa, France, Germany and
India already exist, while treaties with Italy, Zimbabwe, Sweden and
Malaysia are scheduled to come into effect soon.
These incentives, coupled with the harbour's improved facilities, political
stability, good telecommunications, a well educated bilingual (English and
French) labour force and pleasant living conditions, make up an attractive
package, argues Sir Edouard.
The port, which handled over 3m tons of cargo during the year ending June
1992, has ample room for expansion, with about 290 acres of land created by
a dredging and reclamation programme. In addition to five deep water quays,
an eight hectare container park with an annual throughput of 85,000 TEUs,
has provision for refrigerated containers.
A 7,500 sq. m. shed is available for freeport activities, while 37 acres of
land have been earmarked for development, should demand warrant it.
'We have the facilities, we are providing the incentives - my job now is to
put the freeport of Mauritius on the map,' says Sir Edouard.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Monday Interview: Builder of a social pillar - Michel
Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, talks to Michael Prowse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a former governor of the Bank of France and director of the French
Treasury, Mr Michel Camdessus has the perfect credentials for his present
post as managing director of the IMF. Yet he is far from a typical product
of central banks and finance ministries.
He is more affable, more extroverted and markedly less conservative than
most of his peers. At least, that is how he struck me in an interview at his
Washington office on the eve of the IMF/World Bank annual meeting.
I was also impressed by his unfailing optimism and good humour. Mr Camdessus
faces an array of formidable problems yet betrays no trace of strain. As he
smiles and gesticulates, he spins the illusion that the world's most vexing
problems will readily dissolve if only the protagonists show a modicum of
goodwill and common sense.
Leaving for later the sensitive issues - Maastricht, Europe's exchange
rates, Russia's stalled reforms - I delved first into Mr Camdessus's
personal economic philosophy, a fascinating realm in its own right.
Speaking recently in New York, Mr Camdessus said policymakers had exhausted
themselves in the past decade talking about macroeconomic reforms,
development strategies and trade liberalisation. It was high time they
focused on 'social policy', which he depicted as the essential 'fourth
pillar' of a system of international co-operation.
Warming to his theme, he said the international agencies (including the IMF)
had failed to pay 'sufficient regard to the short-term human costs involved
during adjustment or transition to a market economy'. The social component
of interventions was sporadic, financially inadequate, late and
disorganised, he said.
Few of Mr Camdessus's peers can bring themselves to utter the words 'social
policy', let alone demand more of it. Were his words intended only for
rhetorical effect?
Mr Camdessus seemed horrified. It would be 'just indecent', he said in his
lilting English, to say things one didn't mean. All his experience at the
IMF was that if you ignore social problems, 'you can forget about the
efficiency of your programmes'.
In pushing his social agenda, Mr Camdessus has repeatedly urged industrial
countries to meet the United Nations target for development assistance of
0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. Did he realise he was demanding a
doubling of Britain's foreign aid budget?
He chuckled, but did not retreat. 'I would give you to the end of the
century.' The increase, he said, was necessary and could easily be afforded
given the scope for military spending cuts - another favourite theme.
Since his arrival at the IMF in 1987, Mr Camdessus has struggled to lengthen
time horizons - to coax his staff to think less about short-term ways of
'stabilising' economies and more about promoting long-term growth. Recently,
his campaign has seemed to intensify. At the Rio earth summit in June, he
announced that the IMF's goal was no longer growth per se, but 'high
quality' growth. What did he mean?
'Monetary discipline does not make sense if it is not to lay the ground for
sustainable growth,' he explained. But different forms of growth were not
equally desirable.
By 'high quality' growth he meant growth that has 'a rich content in poverty
alleviation', brings 'improvements in income distribution' and is
environmentally friendly. The IMF was having to adapt, he added, because
'public opinion has told us that growth without poverty alleviation is
nonsense'.
Was there anything in his background that explained his unusual sensitivity
on such issues? Mr Camdessus roared with laughter. 'I will see a
psychologist,' he promised. Growing more serious, he said travelling in
Africa as a senior French civil servant had opened his eyes. 'I believe we
don't do enough. This is an anxiety of mine.'
But how did he square the IMF's meagre Dollars 1bn loan to Russia with his
strictures about needing to do more to ease human suffering in the
transition to capitalism? He responded in two ways. The IMF loan was only
part of a total relief effort for Russia that already amounted to Dollars
12bn-Dollars 13bn. More important, it represented 'just the beginning of our
work'.
True to his nature, he was resolutely optimistic about Russia's prospects.
Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's reforms were on track, he declared. The IMF
had just dispatched a team to negotiate a full standby agreement for 1993.
'We have a strong determination to do the maximum and to encourage others to
do the maximum.' In theory the maximum means an IMF loan of about Dollars
3bn, he indicated.
Turning to Europe, I asked whether the French vote on Maastricht was really
crucial to Europe's future. He smiled and conceded that his countrymen had a
tendency to exaggerate their own importance. He then plunged into a
passionate defence of the treaty.
A European single currency was the 'single most important step toward the
reconstruction of an orderly monetary system since the breakdown of Bretton
Woods in the early 1970s,' he said. Maastricht was 'good for Europe, good
for the world, and very good for France.' He felt certain that common sense
would prevail on the day of the vote.
But what was the logic for a single currency? Why make Europe homogenous?
Were not small countries - Switzerland, for example - often prosperous? Mr
Camdessus was firm. 'The logic is to make transactions easier and
disciplines common.' Because Europe is a community, it is essential that
fiscal and monetary policy be 'conceived, managed and implemented in
common'.
Taking a wider view, while Maastricht would not allow 'Europe to dominate
the world with a currency stronger than the dollar,' it would create 'a
position of equal partnership with other key currencies'. It would enable
Europe to do more to promote global monetary stability.
The treaty, moreover, would reduce inflation and budget deficits and
stimulate saving and investment. It would turn Europe's 'totally
unacceptable' current account deficit into a surplus, thus providing the
savings needed to fuel the economic transformation of eastern Europe.
How did he react to the turmoil on European foreign exchanges? Didn't the
shock of German unification provide a textbook justification for a
realignment of currencies in the exchange rate mechanism?
Mr Camdessus conceded that a realignment had been an option 'at the moment
of unification'. But that course had rightly been rejected because it would
have undone much good work. 'Credibility in monetary affairs takes a long
time to build but is very rapidly destroyed.' The future lay not in a
realignment but in putting in place macroeconomic policies that 'truly
supported' current parities.
In Germany this required 'convincing budgetary action'. Italy faced 'the
moment of truth'; it had a last chance to take 'extremely strong fiscal
action' and demonstrate its commitment to the Maastricht convergence
criteria.
Talk of Maastricht reminded me of the bewildering variety of claims on the
time of IMF managing directors. Yet it is often possible to identify a
single 'defining task'. In the case of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, his
predecessor, it was the third-world debt crisis.
Did Mr Camdessus agree that his defining task was overseeing the historic
shift to capitalism in former Soviet republics and eastern Europe?
He was far too canny to be comfortable with that risk-laden gauge of job
performance. 'The republics are quite important. But I still spend a great
deal of time on debt.' And working toward 'a better co-ordination of
policies among major countries' was also a top priority. With any luck, the
affable Mr Camdessus will hit at least one of these targets. In the
meantime, expect more extracurricular ruminations on social policy.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Why Bill and Al need Paul: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<TEXT>
Kennedy was obviously looking for a reassuring symbol of financial
rectitude, and he made a calming, bipartisan choice.'
I quote from Changing Fortunes (Times Books), where Mr Paul Volcker, the
former Federal Reserve chairman, recalls President John Kennedy's inspired
choice of Douglas Dillon as Treasury secretary in 1960. Dillon, writes Mr
Volcker, was a Republican and a conservative: an investment banker with
'impeccable credentials in the financial and diplomatic communities'.
It would be a strange, but far from impossible, twist of fortune if Mr
Volcker were to find himself playing Dillon's role in a Clinton
administration. With election day less than two months away, Mr Bill Clinton
is playing his economic cards close to his chest. He and his choice for
vice-president, Al Gore, rely on an eclectic mix of economic and financial
advisers, none of whom is a certain bet for either of the two top economic
posts - Treasury secretary and White House chief economist.
The most frequently mentioned contenders for Treasury secretary in a Clinton
administration include investment bankers Bob Rubin of Goldman Sachs, Roger
Altman of the Blackstone Group and Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres. All are
well regarded in financial circles, but none (with the possible exception of
Mr Rohatyn) would add much ballast to a Clinton presidency.
Mr Volcker is in a different class. He would be an instantly reassuring
figure, not just on Wall Street but in central banks, finance ministries and
bourses around the world. Imagine Mr Clinton arriving at his first economic
summit with the large, cigar-smoking figure of Mr Volcker in tow: would
anybody pine for the hamfisted economic diplomacy of George Bush and
Nicholas Brady?
At present Mr Clinton appears weak on macro and international economics. He
is comfortable debating many of America's microeconomic problems, such as
uncontrolled healthcare costs and poor job training. His economic plan,
Putting People First, makes valuable suggestions for improving US
productivity, mainly through higher investment in education, training and
infrastructure.
But its priorities are those of an intelligent state governor, rather than
an international economic statesman, and they reflect the expertise of close
advisers such as Mr Ira Magaziner, a business consultant and educational
expert, and Mr Robert Reich, the Harvard political economist, neither of
whom would claim macroeconomic credentials. Mr Robert Shapiro, another
capable adviser, does have a macro background but lacks international
stature.
Mr Volcker would fill the macroeconomic hole in the Clinton team far more
convincingly than financial experts such as Mr Rubin or Mr Altman. But could
a former under-secretary at the Treasury during the Nixon years fit into a
progressive Clinton administration? Disapproving references in Changing
Fortunes to escalating healthcare costs, eroding infrastructure and
educational shortcomings suggest Mr Volcker would have few philosophical
differences with the Arkansas governor who, after all, is a decidedly
conservative Democrat.
Sources close to Mr Volcker say he feels underemployed as chairman of J D
Wolfensohn, the investment bank, and would be delighted to get the phone
call from a president-elect Clinton. The top job at the Treasury, at a
testing moment in US economic history, would be a fitting finale for a life
of public service.
The drawback for Mr Clinton is that Mr Volcker would be too powerful. He
might overshadow his president. Clinton advisers also fear that he might
prove 'uncontrollable' - which is one reason why speculation about a role
for Mr Volcker mainly occurs outside, rather than inside, the Clinton
campaign. In all probability, Mr Volcker would prove implacable on certain
issues. He would apply relentless pressure for a lasting reduction in the
budget deficit. But this ought not to matter; Mr Clinton is reportedly much
keener on deficit reduction than many of his advisers. And macroeconomic
stability - Mr Volcker's strong suit - is precisely the environment required
if Mr Clinton's long-term structural reforms are to bear fruit.
If Mr Volcker were to go to Treasury, Mr Clinton would be wise to pick a
complementary figure as chief economic adviser. A dynamic young academic
would provide the perfect foil for elder statesman Volcker. Mr Clinton might
opt for an economist he knows well, such as Mr Shapiro. But he would
probably be tempted by one of the profession's young intellectual
heavyweights.
Mr Paul Krugman, a rising star at MIT, is a good bet. His academic expertise
lies in the Clinton team's area of greatest ignorance: international
macroeconomics and trade theory. Yet he has also helped mould the domestic
debate, with a book that drew attention to people's diminished economic
expectations and with controversial estimates of the growth of income
inequality during the Reagan/Bush years.
If Mr Clinton wants to shine economically, he could do worse than draft the
two Pauls - Volcker and Krugman. But first he must win the election.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Justinian: An escape from justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shorter, simpler and cheaper system for trying complex fraud cases would
reduce the risk of trials having to be abandoned or breaking down for
reasons of defective procedures in the criminal justice system. This is the
recipe recently prescribed by the new director of the Serious Fraud Office,
Mr George Staple.
His approach reflects the anxious consideration now being given in the wake
of a crop of misfired fraud trials - Guinness, Barlow Clowes and Blue Arrow
 -which have unsettled the administrators of criminal justice. It was Mr
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the US Supreme Court who once remarked that
there was more danger that criminals would escape justice than that they
would be subjected to tyranny.
Mr Staple, not unnaturally, focuses primarily on what prosecuting
authorities might undertake to achieve the objective of a more effective
method of subjecting fraudsters to a judicial process. He has three main
proposals to make for reforming the existing system or seeking an
alternative route to a solution which is just for both offenders and the
public.
First, he wants to produce greater selectivity in both the range of criminal
charges facing accused persons, and the numbers of defendants put on trial.
The former is always available to prosecutors, aided and abetted by a
vigilant judiciary. The latter is also exclusively within the discretion of
the prosecutor.
Any of those at the very heart of the fraudulent enterprise present an
appropriate target for prosecution. And there has always been a sound
stratagem among prosecutors to include the minor miscreants in a fraud
trial. A jury finds special comfort in acquiting the peripheral offender,
while convicting the main villains. If only the central figures are in the
dock, the opportunity for selection is severely reduced and may lead to the
unforeseen consequence of acquittal for one or more of the palpably guilty
ringleaders.
Mr Staple's special suggestion is to formulate an explicit system of plea
bargaining. Informal agreements to accept pleas of guilty in return for
monetary or other non-custodial penalties do pertain at present. They could
be encouraged. But there is an instant dislike within the legal profession
for any formal bargaining which needs to be carried out before the criminal
justice system is majestically wheeled into place. A leaf might be taken out
of the Inland Revenue's book. It uses its power to administer monetary
penalties, up to three times the amount of the tax evaded by the defendant.
If that were to be an acceptable policy in non-fiscal frauds, it would need
to be legislatively sanctioned.
The third proposal is allied to the second. It is to confer powers on the
financial regulatory bodies to discipline fraudsters by way of penalties
such as disqualification from offices and posts, in addition to
administering fines. Again, legislation would be required.
As long as criminal justice is to be applied effectively and efficiently to
serious fraud cases, the focus of reform must be on the defence. Mr Staple
does not want to tamper with the right to trial by jury. Instead he wants
tough measures to ensure that the defence puts its cards face upwards on the
forensic table at the earliest stage, and that judges should strictly
enforce their orders for disclosing the nature of the defence.
Mr Staple thinks that much can be achieved to produce a cultural change in
criminal justice, abandoning the tradition whereby defendants keep their
defences up their sleeves until the last moment, even declining to indicate
whether they will go into the witness box until the last prosecution witness
has given evidence. Early disclosure of a defence would no doubt help define
the issues to be tried. The introduction in 1967 of a provision that took
away the absolute right of a defendant to call evidence in support of an
alibi, and required prior notice to be given of an alibi defence, provides a
useful precedent for demanding prior disclosure of a defence.
Certainly prosecuting counsel can do much - but only so much - by presenting
the Crown's case in a readily intelligible form for ordinary jurors. But
will such reforms of the procedure within the jury system suffice to remedy
the mischief of complex, prolix and costly trials?
Six years ago, the Roskill Committee on Fraud Trial (to whom Mr Staple gave
written evidence) thought not, and recommended trial by a 'fraud trials
tribunal', consisting of a judge and two lay members selected from a panel
of persons with expert qualifications. The government rejected the
recommendation, and still inclines towards preserving trial by jury. Will it
resist the pressures for at least modifying the unqualified rule of jury
trial for all serious crime?
The ultimate problem of trial by jury is less about refining the process of
prosecution or imposing disclosure by the defence of its case than about the
conduct of the case as it is being unfolded in the courtroom. It is an
inevitable feature of jury trial that defence counsel, at the insistence of
the client, will wish to put up a smoke screen in front of the jury, and
confuse the issue so that doubt is created in the jurors' minds.
Without the risk of impairing the fairness of the trial process, it is
impossible for the judge to stop the spoiling tactics of defence counsel.
This is an aspect of jury trial that was not fully considered by the Roskill
Committee. It should now form part of a comprehensive review, and not one
confined to a narrow band of cases of an indefinable class. Perhaps this is
a topic for the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (1): Tiger-like aspirations - A third
world success story in the 1980s, the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius seeks
now to integrate closely with the world economy. But the islanders'
easy-going style may be at odds with long term ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN

<TEXT>
WHEN a finance minister describes a 4.9 per cent real growth in GDP over the
past year as 'a fairly good performance', he is surely indulging in
understatement. Or he manages the economy of Mauritius.
The year ahead will be better, Mr Ramakrishnan Sithanen reassured listeners
to his budget address in June: he forecast growth of over 6 per cent. This
was more in line with what Mauritians have come to expect.
Over the past decade, the Indian Ocean island has maintained a record of
sustained development remarkable by international standards, and positively
phenomenal in comparison to Africa, some 1,500km to the west. But an era is
ending: a changing world trade environment and the erosion of Mauritius's
advantages, such as cheap labour, means that the going will be tougher, the
competition sharper.
It was 10 years ago that the government of Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the prime
minister, bit the bullet of structural adjustment, observing the conditions
of successive IMF stand-by programmes, and winning World Bank backing.
Mauritius was in a parlous state, with inflation exceeding 30 per cent, an
overvalued currency, and unemployment topping 20 per cent, until the
transformation began.
The mono-crop (sugar) economy was able to broaden its base. The export
processing zone (EPZ) was encouraged by realistic exchange rates and
government incentives. Drawing on a cheap, literate and multi-lingual
(English and French) work force, and concessional access to western markets
under the Lome convention, the EPZ catapulted the island into the ranks of
the world's leading clothing exporters.
The island's idyllic beaches were already attracting tourists. But a hotel
building boom, in response to the attractive investment climate and vigorous
marketing, has seen the number of visitors treble to the 300,000 expected in
1992.
At the same time, the budget deficit has been falling from 14 of GDP in 1980
to a forecast 0.7 per cent for 1992-3. External debt servicing which
consumed 26 per cent of export earnings has dropped to single figures, and
there is near full employment.
The overall result is a third world success story, where over the past
decade growth has averaged around 6 per cent a year. With a population
increase of only 1 per cent, it means that real living standards have risen
by some 5 per cent annually, propelling per capita GDP from well under a
thousand dollars to over Dollars 3,000.
But Mauritius owes its success to more than the right doses of IMF medicine.
One of the main planks in the platform on which the island's take-off has
been based is singled out by Sir Anerood: 'Political stability in a
democratic context' - to which he might have added ethnic and religious
tolerance.
The 1m islanders are a harmonious mix of Hindu, Moslem, Creole and small
minorities of French and Chinese origin, culturally diverse but seeking
political consensus. 'Parties hiding behind words like 'militant',
'socialist', and 'workers' have come to occupy the middle ground in
politics,' says one commentator, 'and any coalition is possible.'
Nothing illustrates this better than the governing alliance of Sir Anerood's
Mouvement Socialiste Militant (MSM) and the Mouvement Militant Mauricien
(MMM) led by Dr Prem Nababsing, deputy prime minister, and including Mr Paul
Berenger, the able foreign minister. Even before they joined forces in 1990,
it was clear that personalities rather than policies divided them.
The alliance won last September's general election by a comfortable majority
over Dr Navin Ramgoolam's Labour Party, the main opposition. But the
government cannot afford to be complacent. The remarkable statistics conceal
weaknesses in the government's economic management, likely to be exposed in
the 1990s.
One prickly problem is the increasing cost of the Mauritian 'welfare state'
 -free education, health facilities and other social services. Pay awards
due next year will be inflationary, and a skills shortage is impeding
growth.
The poorly regulated building boom in the tourist sector has led to
substantial overcapacity, as well as exacerbating environmental problems
belatedly addressed. Comparatively little progress has been made in
implementing the long overdue reform of the sugar industry, while the
considerable potential of the horticultural sector has yet to be exploited.
For all the talk of diversification of the EPZ, from its textile base into
areas such as high technology, there has been only modest progress.
Meanwhile both sectors face further challenges. Uncertainty about the
relationship with China helped prompt Hong Kong industrialists to invest in
the EPZ in the 1980s. 'Now my uncle in Hong Kong is more interested in
China's economic zones' says a Mauritian of Chinese origin, explaining the
fall in investment in the zone.
Sugar will be hit by reform of the EC's common agricultural policy and the
cut in subsidies to Lome members. And if the Multi-Fibre Arrangement is
phased out, the market advantages enjoyed by the island's textile sector
will be eroded.
Challenges do not end here. The post-communist era has produced new
competitors for investment, such as Vietnam, or China, where labour costs
are below Mauritian levels.
Much is expected from the fledgling financial services sector - the
combination of an emerging stockmarket, offshore banking and the freeport of
Port Louis: 'The financial services sector is poised to become the fourth
pillar of our economy', says Sir Anerood, 'and help maintain its growth
momentum and lead us on the path to become a Newly Industrialised Country.'
This strategy - an aspiring Indian Ocean tiger drawing inspiration from
Singapore or Taiwan - seems overly ambitious. Government officials and
business leaders frequently refer to 'the African market', whether as a
source of funds for the offshore banks, or as a destination for which
international traders will use the freeport as a stepping stone.
But the level of interest in the island's offshore facilities suggest that
Africans prefer to bank either with the former big centres (notably London
and Paris) or in traditional locations such as Switzerland. And as an
economic hinterland, Africa provides Mauritius with little encouragement.
Sub-Saharan Africa's share of world trade is not only small - about 3 per
cent - but either stagnant or declining.
Nor do Mauritians seem prepared to respond to a more demanding world by
working harder and longer. Civil servants in an over-staffed administration
(the private sector is only a little better) still clock in at nine, rushing
for the exits at four in the afternoon. The island's tendency to sit on its
collective laurels makes for a comfortable life. But the would-be tiger of
the Indian Ocean has a long way to go.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (5): Top of the priority list - All
hands to developing offshore business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENT of the finance sector has top priority. Mr Ramakrishna Sithanen,
the finance minister, is confident that Mauritius can become a regional
financial centre. 'We want the financial and services sectors to become the
fourth pillar of our economy.'
Possibly the most important single policy thrust for the 1990s is the
attempt to turn Mauritius into an offshore business centre. The initial
drive for offshore banks has broadened to cover all footloose business
activities. Seven banks - six of them with onshore operations - have been
granted offshore licences.
There are three new players: Credit Lyonnais (joint venture with the market
leader, the Mauritius Commercial Bank); the State Bank of India with the
number two player, the State Commercial Bank, and Banque Privee Edmond de
Rothschild (Ocean Indien) Ltd. Officials concede that the response has been
disappointing, especially the absence of a Japanese or German bank.
While bankers say they hope to attract deposits and lending opportunities
from Asia, especially India, they see opportunities too in the broader
sphere of fund management, (two international firms have already been
launched), insurance, shipping and aircraft management and leasing, and a
whole raft of international business services.
While Mr Sithanen is confident that Mauritius is well-placed to exploit
economic recovery in sub-Saharan Africa, it is difficult to see why African
depositors and investors should prefer Mauritius to a European or Far East
offshore centre.
It is hard to escape the feeling that Mauritius is a touch remote for some
of these activities. But the minister points to the financial sector's
strong growth in recent years - an average of 12 per cent a year - and to
the benefits he expects to flow from the liberalisation and deregulation
that figured extensively in his June budget.
There is a strong case for greater competition. Two of 13 banks dominate -
the Mauritius Commercial Bank with 34 per cent of deposits and 38 per cent
of advances, and the government-owned State Commercial Bank, which has a 26
per cent market share of both deposits and lending. Barclays, and Hong Kong
and Shanghai, each have a 6 per cent to 7 per cent market share. Banque
Nationale de Paris Internationale has 4 per cent.
In the budget, bank rate was lowered to 8 per cent from 11 per cent
previously; the reduction in interest rates followed the sharp fall in
inflation (from 12.8 per cent in 1990-1991 to 2.8 per cent in the year to
June 1992. For 1992, inflation is forecast at 5 per cent (compared with 7.1
per cent in 1991).
Lending rates were differentiated by sector so that, while EPZ and other
priority firms could borrow at a minimum of 13 per cent (now 10.5 per cent),
traders had to pay 17.5 per cent. Government officials say now that rates
have been deregulated; it is the banks that are responsible for rate
discrimination, and not the authorities.
Like all directed credit systems, this one ran into problems; banks were
reluctant to lend to under-capitalised, highly-geared, poorly managed EPZ
firms - especially given the high turnover of firms there. There have been
53 closures in the EPZ in the last year alone - nearly a tenth of the total
number.
Clearly this was no way to encourage diversification, nor the integration of
the 'domestic' and EPZ sectors. But with priority sector ceilings now
removed, 60 per cent of bank lending has been deregulated. This has paved
the way for more efficient bank lending, though the liquidity overhang in
the market - estimated by the minister at MR3bn - will remain a threat to
price stability.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (6): Buy-and-hold persists - Stock
market needs bigger players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE three years since its launch in mid-1989 the Mauritius stock market
has come a long way. It has 20 quoted companies, compared with six only
three years ago, and another seven applications are being processed. Market
capitalisation has increased from MR3bn (8 per cent of GDP) two years ago to
MR5.1bn (10.7 per cent of GDP) today. Average turnover is running at MR2m a
week - four times the figure for 1989. Semdex (the Stock Exchange of
Mauritius share price index), having peaked at 179 (July 1989 = 100) in
August 1990 now stands at 162.
Impressive though these growth indicators are, market development is
constrained by structural and cultural considerations; government incentives
are unlikely to change these in the short run. In three years, only MR162m
(Dollars 11.5m) has been raised in the new issue market - less than 0.5 per
cent of total investment in the economy.
One explanation is the concentrated structure of business ownership in
Mauritius, where family-controlled firms dominate. Owners are reluctant to
go to the market to raise new funds - this would bring 'outside'
participation.
Traditionally, Mauritian business has relied on retained earnings and bank
borrowings to finance its development. The recent reduction in interest
rates and excess liquidity in the local capital market seems likely to
facilitate dependence on the banks rather than pushing firms to seek
long-term funds via the stock market.
The government uses tax breaks to encourage firms to go public. Until
recently, stock market-listed firms paid corporate tax of 25 per cent as
against a basic rate of 35 per cent. But this was not attractive for EPZ
companies or hotels, which pay a 15 per cent rate of company tax. In this
year's budget, Mr Sithanen cast his net more widely, seeking to attract EPZ
companies by announcing a 30 per cent tax credit, so that EPZ firms which go
public - none, to date - will now pay 10.5 per cent. Some EPZ firms are
considering a listing, while indirect investment in the largest EPZ company,
the Floreal Group, will be possible later this year when the Ciel Investment
Trust, which has a 67 per cent stake in Floreal, is quoted on the Mauritius
market.
The danger with fiscal incentives is that they encourage firms to make the
minimum number of shares available to satisfy listing requirements - 25 per
cent of their equity - purely to benefit from the reduced rate of profit
tax. This has happened, with the result that several quoted stocks are
seldom traded and overall turnover at 2 per cent of market capitalisation is
low. In part, this also reflects the buy-and-hold culture of individual and
institutional holders.
On the investment side, the government is trying to foster a stock market
investment and trading culture among small savers, by exempting from income
tax dividends received from listed companies a 10 per cent tax credit on
investment in Unit Trusts and a tax credit on investment in new shares
issued by a listed company.
In the 1992 budget, in a move designed to foster the bond market, tax
exemption was broadened to cover loan interest on traded bonds, while the
minister announced plans to create a National Investment Trust company that
will mobilise savings by selling its shares to the public and recycling the
proceeds into investments in parastatals.
The exchange wants greater institutional and foreign participation. But in
so tiny a market - 60 per cent or more of the quoted securities tightly held
 -there is little room for big players. An estimated 40 per cent of turnover
is in one counter: the Mauritius Commercial Bank, the most liquid stock by
far.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (7): Names are not much to go by -
Michael Holman reviews the political scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NAMES were anything to go by, Mauritius is governed by an alarming
alliance of two radical parties clinging to discredited ideologies. But the
Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien (MSM) is not socialist, no more than the
Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM) is militant. The labels hark back to past
enthusiasms, for the MSM/MMM coalition led by Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the
prime minister, advocates a market economy and straddles the political
centre. Nor does the opposition Labour Party, headed by Dr Navin Ramgoolam
and in alliance with the Parti Mauricien Social Democrat (PMSD), offer a
radical alternative. Although he is not short of ammunition with which to
attack the government, Dr Rangoolam makes clear his support for the economic
formula that has proved so successful in Mauritius. 'However, the economy is
running into serious difficulties but government has run out of steam,' says
the son of the late Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the first prime minister of
Mauritius who led the island to independence from Britain in 1968. 'The
export processing zone needs more investment in higher technology, skills
training has been inadequate. And on the environment government has been all
talk and little action.' Dr Ramgoolam, 45, who qualified as a doctor at
Dublin and is on his way to becoming a barrister, saves his most passionate
criticism for three issues: the government's decision to opt for republican
status, alleged failure to crack down on drugs, and the conduct of last
September's general election. The result was a resounding victory for the
MSM/MMM alliance: 57 assembly seats to Labour's three - a lopsided
reflection of the 56 to 40 per cent shares of the votes cast.
'It was blatantly rigged,' claims Dr Ramgoolam, amid counter charges by
government. The Labour Party has taken its case to court.
Dr Ramgoolam is especially critical of the government's decision to make
Mauritius a republic, formally enacted on the independence anniversary,
March 12.
'I support the move in principle, but there should have been a referendum,'
he argues, and expresses especial concern that that government may end the
recourse to the Privy Council as a final court of appeal. 'We need this
constitutional safeguard,' says Dr Ramgoolam.
He takes heart from the recent village council elections which, he argues,
showed a swing against the government. The results are difficult to
interpret, for candidates do not stand under the political partys' banner.
But coupled with recent rumblings from the unions, pushing for wage
increases, they may serve as a warning against complacency to Sir Anerood,
enjoying his 10th year in office.
His lengthy tenure owes much to skilful political footwork, ending one
alliance and embarking on another - the latest being with the MMM, based on
a bargain struck in July 1990.
Sir Anerood turned to Mr Paul Berenger, the key figure in the MMM, which the
two men helped found in 1970. The Mouvement swept to power in the 1982
election, winning all 60 mainland seats (the island of Rodrigues has two
assembly members).
But nine months later Sir Anerood and Mr Berenger parted company. The
differences between the two men involved personality rather than policy. In
his short tenure as finance minister Mr Berenger began the implementation of
the economic reform programme, followed through by Sir Anerood after he left
the MMM to create the Mouvement Socialiste Militant, the party he leads to
this day.
Although Dr Prem Nababsing, the deputy prime minister, heads the MMM, the
enigmatic Mr Berenger remains the key figure in the party. Unlikely ever to
become prime minister by virtue of his Franco-Mauritian origins  - an
electoral liability on an island where 52 per cent of the 1.1m population
are Hindu, and 17 per cent Moslem - he can play the role of kingmaker.
Whether the alliance can hold remains to be seen: 'Breaking and forging
coalitions is a political way of life in Mauritius', says one veteran
observer.
The main reason is not hard to find. As Dr Ram Mannick, a UK-based Mauritian
academic comments in his book, Mauritius: The Politics of Change*, there is
very little to choose between the various parties: 'Consensus politics rules
the day,' he notes.
This principle accounts for one of the island's strengths - stability. But
as Dr Mannick pointed out: 'The danger is that politics becomes
opportunistic - a game to get into government rather than a debate over
policy issues.'
'Real problems might be forgotten,' he warns, 'while politicians struggle
for positions.'

FRANK GRAHAM has been awarded a civil engineering design contract by
CrossRail for the covered way and ramp at the Allen Garden section of this
project. The value of the construction work is estimated at Pounds 7.5m.
Commencing at the eastern portals of the bored tunnel drive 15 metres below
Shoreditch, the work comprises a 250 metre section of cut and cover, which
may be carried out using continuous bored pile walls and "top down'methods
of construction. This is followed by a 300 metre long ramp and viaduct
which, initially, is in open cut before climbing to link with the existing
viaduct at Vallance Road.
The CrossRail scheme, a joint development between London Underground and
British Rail Network SouthEast, involves building a twin-bore tunnel, 9.6kms
long, across central London between Paddington and Bethnal Green. This will
1ink rail lines to Reading and Aylesbury in the west to those serving
Shenfield in the east.
The Pounds 1.7bn scheme will reduce journey times across the region and
relieve congestion on the London Underground.

BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded the Pounds 1m contract to
replace the pedestrian subway roof at Bank Station by London Underground.
This is not the first time Balfour Beatty has been commissioned to work on
this site. At the height of the Blitz during World War II, a bomb fell on
the main ticket hall of Bank Station, demolishing the roofing and, by the
use of steel troughing infilled with concrete, the station was quickly
repaired and made operational.
Now some 50 years on, above the roof lies one of the busiest road junctions
in the City of London and because of the increased traffic, it has become
necessary to bring it up to current loading standards. To facilitate this,
the roof needs to be demolished and replaced.
Also included in the works are repairs to the existing brickwork and
waterproofing. To ensure the station is operational at all times, the
year-long programme involves careful phasing of the works.

FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Gilts: Traders on tenterhooks after devaluation of lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gilt market will be on tenterhooks today as all eyes focus on the
Bundesbank and the size of the cut in interest rates it has indicated it
will make after last night's devaluation of the Italian lira.
From the point of view of sterling, the developments are both good and bad
news. A cut in German borrowing rates - the size and nature of which are due
to be announced today - should take the pressure off the pound in the
European exchange rate mechanism grid.
On the other hand, a lira devaluation - the first significant adjustment of
the ERM since 1987 - might appear in the eyes of some market participants to
presage other changes in parities in the grid affecting other weak
currencies, the pound included.
The markets also have to digest the outcome of next Sunday's referendum on
Maastricht. If France votes No to European economic and monetary union, that
could lead to further selling pressure on weak ERM currencies, exacerbating
the recent strains on currency markets and possibly leading ultimately to a
sterling devaluation.
The general nervousness about the pound was a feature of gilt trading last
week. It forced a large rise in yields for short-dated bonds, amid fears
that the British government might be forced, in the near future, to increase
interest rates to defend the pound's ERM parity.
With the UK government stressing strongly last week it would not devalue the
pound, a rise in base rates, now 10 per cent, might be required to prevent
sterling falling through its ERM floor.
That explained why the yield on the short-dated 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond
due in 1997 rose  1/3 of a percentage point last week, closing on Friday
night at 9.71 per cent. Its price fell by 1 point to 96 7/32 .
While short yields were pushed up, few large sellers of the securities were
reported. An exception, however, was the Bank of Sweden, which was said to
be selling gilts for cash to put its foreign-currency reserves in a more
liquid state in case large-scale intervention is required to defend the
beleaguered krona.
At the long end of the yield curve, investors such as pension funds and
insurance companies were moderate buyers of gilts on optimistic perceptions
about the longer term inflation profile. As a result, long-gilt yields were
depressed marginally.
The degree to which pressure on rising prices is becoming subdued as a
result of the long recession was underlined by last week's figures for the
retail prices index. The RPI rose by 3.6 per cent in the year to August,
after 3.7 per cent in the 12 months to July.
However, it was the shorter term outlook for the pound that worried most
gilt investors last week. Sterling closed on Friday against the D-Mark at
DM2.79, slightly more than 1 pfennig above its DM2.778 ERM floor. This was
even though a stronger dollar somewhat eased the overall ERM strains by
putting less upward pressure on the German currency. A weak pound depresses
sentiment about gilts.
A special problem for the pound is the stalled domestic economy. With some
commentators suggesting a recovery is unlikely until 1993 or 1994, investors
are unlikely to want to push funds into sterling on the basis of hopes about
a growing economy.
At the same time, the UK's economic weakness greatly magnifies the potential
effects of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, being forced to raise base
rates to defend sterling's ERM parity.
'In normal times, the bad news about the economy, and the sense that
inflation is coming down, would be expected to be good news for gilts,' said
Mr James Barty, an economist at Morgan Grenfell. 'The trouble for gilts is
that these are not normal times.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / European Bonds: German interest rate cut to spark volatile
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S promised cut in German interest rates will kick off a week of
volatile trading in European government bond markets in the run up the
French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. German yields, which were
already falling last week as investors switched out of higher yielding
paper, could now be set to fall sharply.
The bond markets will be looking closely to the foreign exchange markets for
their lead this morning. The central question for both markets is likely to
be the scale of the promised German cut in interest rates. If speculators
judge the cut too small, they will have a perfect excuse to launch further
attacks on weaker currencies, principally sterling. They have been proved
right once, so why shouldn't the same trick work a second time?
But if the Bundesbank's cut is a substantial one, the ERM could yet end the
week stronger than it started. Most analysts had given up hope of any
significant German interest rate cut before the end of this year, so an
earlier move could take the pressure off Germany's neighbours, possibly
allowing them scope for interest rate cuts.
Yesterday's monetary developments will influence the French referendum on
Maastricht: if French interest rates fall this week, as the Italian
government, at least, was suggesting last night, French voters may be more
willing to give European monetary union the benefit of the doubt.
If, despite this, France votes No, today's piece of damage limitation from
the German authorities could be quickly forgotten. Before the weekend's
excitements, some analysts were suggesting that bond markets in the D-Mark
bloc should benefit from either result. Their arguments hold good, in
modified form, even after Sunday's realignment.
A No vote would raise the question of whether the lira had been sufficiently
devalued, and perhaps call the pound's ERM rates into question. Both of
these concerns would probably lead to outperformance by the German bond
market - or at least, a predisposition by investors already in the D-Mark
bloc to stay put.
A Yes vote, on the other hand, would trigger a rally in the higher-yielding
French, Spanish and Ecu bond markets, while the D-Mark bloc would initially
be left behind. But since a Yes vote in France would still leave many
questions unanswered about the future of the Maastricht treaty, some
economists recommend taking early profits in higher-yielding markets and
going overweight in bunds.
German bond yields fell last week on the growing belief that the Bundesbank
would eventually respond to the slowing domestic economy by cutting interest
rates. The yield on the benchmark 8 per cent 2002 bond dropping to 7.82 per
cent from 7.74 per cent. This compares with 8.13 per cent at the end of
July. Yields on shorter maturities showed a bigger drop last week, of around
12 basis points.
Last night's confirmation of what on Friday was no more than wishful
thinking should fuel the rally in bunds. Its extent, however, depends on the
size of the cut.

FT  14 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Weak data fails to indicate recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICS and economics are never far apart. But the approaching US
presidential election, and the increasingly heated campaigning, now give an
added twist to each set of dismal statistics which fails to indicate any
meaningful recovery.
Ten days ago, for example, yet another set of poor unemployment figures hit
the news wire.
So the bond market was all ears when President George Bush rose to address
the Detroit Economic Club last Thursday. Traders fretted that the president,
eager to boost his re-election chances, might suddenly become overly
open-handed.
After a few jittery minutes, they were able to pack their fears away. The
president offered no new measures likely to pump inflationary pressures into
the economy, and his one percentage point tax cut proposal was deemed to go
little further than his statements to the Republican Convention last month.
The bond markets breathed a collective sigh of relief, and the yield on the
benchmark 30-year long bond fell below 7.25 per cent.
It did not, however, return to the depressed 7.21 per cent seen on Tuesday
evening, the lowest closing yield registered for more than seven years. This
was, at least in part, due to the large number of corporate bond issues
which hit the market last week - with some estimates suggesting that between
Dollars 7.5bn and Dollars 8bn-worth of corporate debt was priced during the
abbreviated four-day trading period.
Corporate issues tend to depress bond prices, partly because underwriting
firms on Wall Street sell off holdings of treasuries in order to give
themselves the leeway to hold unsold corporate debt, and partly because
investor demand becomes squeezed.
In this particular case, traders said a large number of issues were priced
aggressively - that is, offering only a minimal yield advantage over
lower-risk treasuries. As a result, dealers were left holding large tranches
of unsold stock.
By the end of the week's trading, these technical considerations were still
overshadowing the market, and even some extremely low inflation data for
August - showing that the producer price index rose just one-tenth of 1 per
cent during the month - failed to revive bond prices. The long bond fell by
 9/16 , and its yield at the end of the week stood at 7.29 per cent.
Such technical blips notwithstanding, most bond market participants are
convinced that yet another easing of interest rates is on the cards and that
yields have further to fall in the medium term.
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example, is suggesting that the 30-year
treasury bond yield could be down to 6.5 per cent by mid-1993.
The reasoning is simple: the lack of consumer confidence, generated in part
by employment worries, the extremely low rates of inflation at present, and
 -against this backdrop - the extraordinarily cautious Federal Reserve
policy.
As Mr Robert Brusca, at Nikko Securities, argued to clients last week:
'Friday's PPI report for August shows how good inflation's performance has
been.
Year-over-year inflation dropped from a 1.7 per cent to 1.5 per cent rate of
increase, a decline in inflation's pace of 0.2 percentage points.
'Meanwhile, the Fed has eased by 0.25 percentage points. Thus what the Fed
has really done - net - is to ease in real terms by 0.05 percentage points,
or 5 basis points'.
This argument will probably be reinforced in the coming week, when the
consumer price numbers, also for August, are released on Tuesday.
After the very low PPI figure, most analysts are expecting an increase in
'core' inflation (excluding food and energy costs) of perhaps 0.2 to 0.3 per
cent - a slight uptick from the July levels.
Also on Tuesday's calendar are the August retail sales figures. Leading
retailers have already unveiled lacklustre sales figures for the month,
although they were quick to blame the relatively late date for the Labor Day
holiday, saying that this had pushed some 'back-to-school' spending into
September.
Still, analysts now expect the overall retail sales numbers to either show a
minimal advance, or even a small decline.

FT  14 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Italy's withholding tax reform will
shift investment patterns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE changes to Italy's investment taxation regime, announced last week as
part of the government's economic package, will not only shift patterns of
investment in Italy, but will have a knock-on effect in several areas of the
international capital markets.
Eurobonds issued by some supranational agencies (the World Bank, the
European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Coal and Steel Community and
the European Atomic Agency) and government and state agencies (the Republic
of Italy, Enel, the electricity utility, Crediop, the financial institution,
and Ferrovie, the national railway) have lost their tax exemption for
Italian residents, and future deals will have withholding tax levied at 12
1/2 per cent. But existing issues remain exempt from withholding tax, even
if they continue to be traded.
Prices in existing tax-exempt issues rallied on the news on Friday. The
World Bank's global bond issues benefitted most, with the yield spread on
its Dollars 1.5bn five-year global narrowing from 3 basis points above the
five-year treasury to 10 basis points below. The bank's 10-year yen global
bonds tightened from 20 basis points to 12 basis points over the 10-year
Japanese government bond yield. However, there was concern that the effect
of aggressive buying of these issues would 'strip all our liquid benchmarks
out of the market,' one trader said.
Other Eurobonds did not appear to be following these deals to tighter
spreads.
The tightening of existing paper should help the World Bank achieve
aggressive funding when it launches its next global bond, despite its loss
of tax-exempt status. The bank said it may advance its funding programme to
take advantage of the shortage of paper. The bank's next offering, a yen
global offering totalling at least Y200bn is scheduled for mid-October. But
the next dollar global offering, expected in 1993, may be brought forward.
Although the effect will vary from one sector to another, bankers expect
costs for the World Bank to rise, in the medium to long term, by around 20
basis points, to about 20 basis points under Libor.
The EIB is likely to suffer a greater increase in funding costs, since it
has targetted Italian investors with issues in smaller markets such as the
matador bond market. It has frequently achieved funding costs of 75 to 80
basis points under Libor, now also set to rise to around 20 basis points
under Libor.
The EIB decided on Friday to pull its Pta10bn issue of floating-rate notes,
launched on Wednesday, just hours ahead of the tax change announcement.
Although the change did not take effect until Thursday, there was some
uncertainty over whether it applied to the launch or the signing of the
deal. Trades in the issue, which had been largely placed ahead of the
announcement, were cancelled, according to lead manager Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya. The EIB is still considering whether to go ahead with a Y50bn deal
scheduled for last Thursday. However, dealers said the planned terms of the
issue would have to be changed to take account of the new tax regime.
Meanwhile, spreads of Italy's Eurobonds barely tightened on the news.
Dealers said concern about Italian credit and the excess supply of Italian
paper stifled any rally in Italian paper.
The sizeable repurchase agreement (repo) market is likely to suffer on
several fronts. As well as the loss of tax-exempt status for supranational
names, the new rules limit companies' ability to deduct the repo costs as a
business expense.
Also included in the package is a cut in withholding tax for Italian
investors on foreign bonds from 30 per cent to 12.5 per cent, the same as
for Italian government bonds. This is expected to encourage Italian
institutions to diversify their investments in overseas markets.
However, the new regulations also close a loophole used by some Italian
institutions. They will no longer be able to avoid paying withholding tax by
'coupon-washing' - farming out bonds when the coupon is due to be paid. In
future, taxation will be applied to accrued interest.
Volume on Italy's new bond futures market, the Mercato Italiano Futures
(MIF) reached 10,000 contracts on its first day of trading on Friday.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Syndicated Loans: Sweden faces a testing time over credit
standing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S credit standing in the international financial community will be
tested this week as foreign banks ponder whether to support its Ecu8bn
syndicated loan, announced on Friday.
Like the UK the week before, Sweden is borrowing heavily to support its
currency in the face of the turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism
(ERM). The success of its deal will be a pointer to other countries which
are said also to have considered foreign borrowing to defend their
currencies. 'If it doesn't go well, other countries will start to get
worried about what it will cost them to do the same thing,' said one large
US bank considering whether to participate in the Swedish deal.
In many ways, the transaction has powerful attractions. Sweden has not come
to the international markets since 1989, so its loan will be snatched up by
banks wanting to develop their relationship with the country.
It was also generally considered on Friday to be well priced. The yield to
participating banks was put by one bank at nearly 20 basis points (0.2
percentage points) over London interbank offered rate (Libor), compared with
10 basis points on the UK deal. Given that the loan is zero-weighted for
capital purposes, this was widely seen as a good price for a three-year
facility.
However, concerns about Sweden's credit standing overshadowed the loan at
the end of last week. The country has a AAA credit rating from Standard &amp;
Poor's and a Aa1 rating from Moody's. But after the recent events banks are
likely to think hard about increasing their exposure to the country before
its economic prospects become clearer.
'There will be credit officers in many banks who have sat up in the past
week and said, 'what is happening in Sweden?'' said another big
international bank. That could lead banks to freeze their limits to Sweden
in the short term, he said. Sweden also drew heavily at the end of last week
on two standby banking facilities, totalling Dollars 3.4bn, to support its
currency.
JP Morgan said it would be approaching the National Debt Office's close
relationship banks over the next few days with the aim of putting together a
group of lead managers, and it hoped to syndicate the deal among about 30
